5|$|On August 8, 1993, Wallace's {{longtime}} girlfriend {{gave birth}} to his first child, T'yanna. Wallace had split with the girlfriend for some time before T'yanna's birth. Wallace wanted his daughter to complete her education, despite being {{a high school dropout}} himself. Wallace said that if his mother had promised him what he promised his daughter, everything she wanted, Wallace would have been not only a graduate but also {{at the top of his}} class. He continued <b>selling</b> <b>drugs</b> after the birth to support his daughter financially. Once Combs discovered this, he forced Wallace to quit.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drug smuggling, Noriega's associates such as Floyd Carlton and Cesar Rodríguez also eventually {{became involved with}} money laundering: large sums from drug revenues were brought in from Miami and elsewhere to Panama for laundering, and Noriega received protection payments in these instances as well. American Steven Kalish also began a large scale business <b>selling</b> <b>drugs,</b> laundering money and selling hardware to the Panamanian military for large profits with Noriega's assistance. Dinges writes that in {{at the time of}} the 1984 election, Kalish was preparing to ship a load of marijuana worth U.S. $1.4 million through Panama, for which Noriega had agreed to provide false Panamanian customs stamps to help it avoid scrutiny in the U.S.; Noriega was to be payed $1 million for this exercise. However, beginning in 1984 Noriega appeared to reduce the scale of his operations, and even ordered a raid against a cocaine factory in the interior of Panama, a raid which he then emphasized as evidence of his cooperation with the U.S. in their fight against drugs. He also ordered a crackdown on money laundering by the Colombian cartel. Noriega's new image was symbolized by his being invited as a speaker in 1985 to Harvard University, for a conference on the role of the military in Central America's wars, a speech which received a lot of attention in Panama's pro-government press.|$|E
40|$|Purpose This study {{explores the}} drug dealing {{behaviors}} of youthful offenders who <b>sell</b> <b>drugs</b> and examines {{differences between these}} offenders {{and those who do}} not <b>sell</b> <b>drugs</b> across a variety of measures including types of drugs sold, substance use and behaviors. Methods The sample consists of 227 youthful offenders in two juvenile residential facilities. Chi-square and t-tests are used to assess differences between youth who <b>sell</b> marijuana, hard <b>drugs,</b> and prescription drugs and those youthful offenders who do not <b>sell</b> <b>drugs</b> across a variety of measures. Results The majority of youthful offenders in our sample are involved in drug dealing and many are extensively involved. Drug dealing, however, is not tied solely to economic motivations but is connected to patterns of substance use. Youthful offenders who <b>sell</b> <b>drugs</b> are also engaged in patterns of delinquent and other risky behavior at higher levels but the magnitude of differences in substance use and delinquent or risky behaviors varies by type of drugs sold. Conclusions Youthful offenders who <b>sell</b> <b>drugs</b> are embedded in patterns of substance use and delinquent behavior that differ from those who do not <b>sell</b> <b>drugs</b> and interventions for these youth need to be targeted at multiple levels. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{rational}} {{drug policy}} is {{one based on}} drug use in which patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and their community. Pharmaceutical companies make considerable money by <b>selling</b> <b>drugs</b> under their trade names, promoting the branded drugs as against those named generically. Doctors often prescribe branded drugs which are more expensive than generic drugs which have the same efficacy.|$|E

25|$|The {{police were}} {{convinced}} that Chang was running a large operation and several staff from his restaurant were found <b>selling</b> <b>drugs</b> and convicted. He sold {{his interest in the}} Regent Street restaurant and opened the Palm Court Club in nearby Gerrard Street, in what is now London's Chinatown, but which then was just another London street. Police interest continued, however, and after a number of raids Chang was forced to move to Limehouse in October 1923, a poor area near the London docks that contained the original small Chinese community of London and which had been connected in the public mind with opium smoking since Victorian times.|$|E
25|$|The Latino {{demographics}} caused {{controversy in}} the 1970s, when many drug cartels were <b>selling</b> <b>drugs,</b> even though most people were not actually affected by it. While some media sources placed culpability on the wire transfer stores along Roosevelt Avenue as vestiges of the drug-selling, these stores were actually useful to the community. Latino clubs and bars on the avenue were also pointed to as another trace of evidence, even though most were actually just places for typical Latino immigrants to hang out. Little India was also controversial. Although Indians are a minority in Jackson Heights, a vibrant commercial area developed on 74th Street in the 1990s, and by 1993, {{it was the largest}} Asian Indian shopping area in the country.|$|E
25|$|Dragon {{formed in}} Auckland, New Zealand, in January 1972 with a line-up that {{featured}} Todd Hunter on bass guitar, guitarist Ray Goodwin, drummer Neil Reynolds and singer/pianist Graeme Collins. All {{had been in}} various short-lived bands in Auckland, Collins is credited with using I Ching to provide the name Dragon. Their first major gig was an appearance at The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival in early January 1973. By 1974 several personnel changes had occurred, with Todd Hunter's younger brother Marc Hunter joining on vocals and Neil Storey on drums. The band recorded two progressive rock albums in their native New Zealand, Universal Radio in 1974 and Scented Gardens for the Blind in 1975 both on Vertigo Records. Despite being New Zealand's top live attraction by late 1974, neither albums nor related singles had any local chart success, and they recruited Robert Taylor (ex-Mammal) on guitar as they searched for a raunchier pop sound. By early 1975, manager Graeme Nesbitt (ex-Mammal), who had obtained regular gigs and organised their first New Zealand tours, felt they should tackle the larger Australian market. Nesbitt was unable to travel with them to Australia – he {{had been arrested for}} <b>selling</b> <b>drugs.</b>|$|E

25|$|After Campbell's sections, {{the game}} then cuts to Michael Tapp at his father's {{apartment}} after his suicide. He sees Chief of Police Henry Jacobs, a detective named Joseph, and David Tapp's reclusive neighbor Sarah. Michael also sees Jennings Foster, a forensics specialist {{who was a}} survivor of the first Saw game. Michael is then kidnapped by Pighead and forced to play Jigsaw's game in order to investigate his father's death. After being abandoned by another victim, Solomon Bates, Michael is given another chance. The first victim Michael must save is a college student named Griff whom his father arrested for raping his professor. Michael continues through the hotel, traversing traps, and rescuing a pedophile named Zeke. Immediately afterwards, Michael finds Chief of Police Henry Jacobs in a trap because of being corrupt and <b>selling</b> <b>drugs</b> on the streets. Upon being saved, Henry pretends to be grateful but later meets up with another corrupt policeman, Joseph Poltzer, who together decide to kill Michael because he learned about their drug smuggling operation. Michael then saves Sarah Blalock (who he met earlier but {{turns out to be}} a drug addict) from being drowned in a glass case. Upon being freed, Sarah flees and Michael continues through the hotel to save his next victim.|$|E
25|$|A large {{percentage}} of pimps in the United States are also documented gang members, which causes concerns for police agencies in jurisdictions where prostitution is a significant problem. Pimping rivals narcotic sales as {{a major source of}} funding for many gangs; this is particularly true with African-American gangs. Gangs need money to survive, and money equates to power and respect. While <b>selling</b> <b>drugs</b> may be lucrative for a gang, this activity often carries significant risk as stiff legal penalties and harsh mandatory minimum sentencing laws exist. However, with pimping, gang members still make money while the prostitutes themselves bear the majority of the risk. Pimping has several benefits to the gang that the pimp belongs to. These benefits include helping the gang recruit new members because the gang has women available for sex and the money brought in by prostitution allows gang members to buy cars, clothes and weapons, all of which help to recruit younger members into the gang by increasing the reputation of the gang in the local gang subculture. The presence of gangs (and weapons and drugs) is a virtual guarantee when prostitutes are present, which is why many law-enforcement agencies advocate taking an aggressive stance against prostitutes. Many vice units work to ascertain if the prostitute they have arrested has a pimp, and if so, they pressure them to provide information about their pimp and the gang involved. This information can then be used to go after the more serious and violent offenders.|$|E
