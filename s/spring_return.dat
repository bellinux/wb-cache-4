40|$|This master’s thesis {{describes}} {{an evaluation of}} truck drivers’ attitudes towards electrical and <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> steering wheel stalks, and the following development of design concepts for electrical and <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> steering wheel stalks in future Volvo Trucks. Electrical and <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> steering wheel stalks are today used in cars for the interaction with steering wheel stalk functions such as direction indicator, windscreen wiper and cruise control. An introduction of electrical and <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> stalks in Volvo Trucks would bring advantages of adaptability and facilitate the stalk placement, {{but it would also}} mean a loss of feedback and require a change in the truck driver’s interaction with the steering wheel stalks. An evaluation was performed with truck drivers driving cars equipped with electrical and <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> steering wheel stalks. The evaluation focused on the direction indicator, windscreen wiper and auxiliary brake and included driving a test route while performing user tasks and answering a verbal questionnaire. The purpose of the evaluation was to explore the truck drivers’ acceptance of using <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> stalks, how the stalks are experienced in ordinary driving situations and investigate possible interaction difficulties and importance of different feedback. The results of the evaluation indicate that the truck drivers are positive of having <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> in their truck. The auxiliary brake stalk should be further evaluated since the cars were not equipped with <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> stalks for this function and could only be evaluated in a theoretical way. Furthermore, the evaluation results show that the feeling of resistance in the stalks is very important for an efficient stalk interaction and that quick activation and cancellation of modes should be possible. Based on the results from the evaluation, a requirement specification was compiled and a number of sub problems were identified for the following concept development. Concepts for <b>spring</b> <b>returning</b> stalks for the direction indicator, windscreen wiper and auxiliary brake were generated, evaluated and further developed. The final concepts for instance include directions of moving the stalks, sequences of modes, control of rain sensor and interval functionality, and light control functionality exclusive for the North American market. The design of the stalks is of principles and is visualized in rendered pictures of 3 D surface models and a simulation was developed to demonstrate the interaction with the stalks.

50|$|Ballonet air valves were {{originally}} a butterfly type, actuated by springs. If pressure {{rose in the}} ballonet, a spring would pressure the spindle of the butterfly valve to turn, relieving the pressure.

40|$|A non-collinear valve {{actuator}} includes a primary actuating {{system and a}} <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system with each applying forces to a linkage system in order to regulate the flow of a quarter-turn valve.

By positioning the primary actuating system and <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system in this manner, the primary actuating system can undergo a larger stroke while the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system experiences significantly less displacement. This allows {{the length of the}} <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> to be reduced due to the minimization of displacement thereby reducing the weight of the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system.

50|$|The older {{mechanically}} designed accelerator pedals {{not only}} provided a <b>spring</b> <b>return,</b> but the mechanism inherently provided some friction. This friction introduced mechanical hysteresis into the pedal force versus pedal position transfer function. Put more simply, once the pedal {{was set at}} a specific position, the friction would help keep the pedal at this setting. This {{made it easier for}} the driver to maintain a pedal position. For example, if the driver's foot is slightly jostledby a bump in road, the accelerator pedal would tend to stay at its setting. While these old purely mechanical designs did have somefriction, the return spring force was always designed to overcome this friction with a considerable safety margin. The return spring force ensured that throttle returned to zero if the pedal force applied by the driver was reduced or removed.|$|E
