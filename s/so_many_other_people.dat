[...] In the same interview, Hammer asked television host Wendy Walsh of The Doctors about the storyline, to which she responded, [...] "The main theme of the show was about this poor 'stupid' woman who was too dumb to leave her relationship. And domestic violence is far more complicated than that. We're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship {{and this is the}} kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life. It’s not satire anymore." ...|$|E

6000|$|How it {{came about}} that she had settled down in a {{southern}} French town, {{in the summer of}} 1914, only her roving spirit knew. She had been a widow ten years, which she had passed in the quest of perfection; all her life she had been haunted by that instinct, half-smothered in ministering to her husband, children, and establishments in London and the country. Now, in loneliness, the intrinsic independence of her soul was able to assert itself, and from hotel to hotel she had wandered in England, Wales, Switzerland, France, till now she had found what seemingly arrested her. Was it the age of that oldest of Western cities, that little mother of Western civilisation, which captured her fancy? Or did a curious perversity turn her from more obvious abodes, or was she kept there by the charm of a certain church which she would enter every day to steep herself in mellow darkness, the scent of incense, the drone of incantations, and quiet communion with a God higher indeed than she had been brought up to, high-church though she had always been? She had a pretty little apartment, where for very little--the bulk of her small wealth was habitually at the service of others--she could manage with one maid and no [...] "fuss." [...] She had some [...] "nice" [...] French friends there, too. But more probably it was simply the war which kept her there, waiting, like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> for it to be over before it seemed worth while to move and re-establish herself. The immensity and wickedness of this strange event held her, as it were, suspended, body and spirit, high up on the hill which had seen the ancient peoples, the Romans, Gauls, Saracens, and all, and still looked out towards the flat Camargue. Here in her three rooms, with a little kitchen, the maid Augustine, a parrot, and the Paris Daily Mail, she dwelt as it were marooned by a world event which seemed to stun her. Not that she worried, exactly. The notion of defeat or of real danger to her country and to France never entered her head. She only grieved quietly over the dreadful things that were being done, {{and every now and then}} would glow with admiration at the beautiful way the King and Queen were behaving. It was no good to [...] "fuss," [...] and one must make the best of things, just as the [...] "dear little Queen" [...] was doing; for each Queen in turn, and she had seen three reign in her time, was always that to her. Her ancestors had been uprooted from their lands, their house burned, and her pedigree diverted, in the Stuart wars--a reverence for royalty was fastened in her blood.|$|E

60|$|Since visiting Switzerland, that {{excellent}} lady's spirit {{had undergone}} a considerable change. Without going minutely into particulars, we may say that the startling events which had occurred had been made the means of opening her spiritual eyes. It had occurred to her--she scarce knew how or why--that her Creator had a claim on her for more consideration than {{she had been in}} the habit, heretofore, of testifying by a few formalities on Sundays; that there must be some higher end and aim in life than the mere obtaining and maintaining of health, and the pursuit of pleasure; and that as there was a Saviour, whom she professed on Sundays to follow, there must be something real from which she had to be saved, as well as something real that had to be done. Sin, she knew, of course, was the evil from which everybody had to be saved; but, being a good-natured and easy-going woman, she really did not feel much troubled by sin. Little weaknesses she had, no doubt, but not half <b>so</b> <b>many</b> as <b>other</b> <b>people</b> she knew of. As to anything seriously worthy the name of sin, she did not believe she had any at all. It had never, until now, occurred to her that the treating of her best Friend, during a lifetime, with cool and systematic indifference, or with mere protestations, on Sundays, of adoration, was probably as great a sin as she could commit.|$|R

The boughs were so tangled that he was obliged to screen his face with his hands, to escape the risk of having his eyes filliped out by the twigs that impeded his progress. Thus slowly advancing, his ear caught, between the rustles, the tones of a voice in earnest declamation; and, pushing round in that direction, he beheld through some beech boughs an open space about ten yards in diameter, floored at the bottom with deep beds of curled old leaves, and cushions of furry moss. In the middle of this natural theatre was the stump of a tree that had been felled by a saw, and upon the flat stool thus formed stood Ethelberta, whom Christopher had not beheld since the ball at Wyndway House.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the stories}} of young people, both male and female, from rural and economically weak backgrounds. Participants {{in the present study}} come from the province of Sindh, Pakistan, and Sindhi is their first language. The data consist of the narratives of their lives. They deal with their attitudes and behaviours, actions and struggles, hurdles and hardships, expectations and desires. The participants talked about their family, home, village, surroundings, socio-economic problems, etc. My participants struggled to make ends meet economically and worked hard to improve their social position and that of their families. This study tries to interpret the observations of the interviews in terms of the theories and categories of Pierre Bourdieu (cultural, social, and symbolic capital; habitus, field, symbolic violence, practice, etc) and treats them as evidence of these theories. Symbolic Interactionism was used to interpret small-world lives of one-to-one interaction of individuals with individuals and artefacts and their roles. Narrative Analysis was applied to stories taken from two interviews. I investigated how young people from poor rural backgrounds progressed towards a better standard of living. The socio-economic position of my participants in the social structures of their native villages hindered or facilitated their progress towards their goals. By interacting with people and artefacts in their environment, my participants managed to improve their standing in wider society. By getting an education, they found a way to cope with their day-to-day problems. But they were hindered in these attempts by the restrictions inherent in the existing social structures. This study found that my participants had to overcome obstacles which were <b>so</b> great that <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> from the same background never succeeded in doing so.

40|$|The health {{consequences}} of migration and rapid modernization are {{examined in the}} Manus people living in Pere village in Manus Province and in migrants living in both the local provincial towns and larger cities of Papua New Guinea. For the Manus, like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> Pacific Island <b>peoples</b> and <b>other</b> modernizing populations around the world, lifestyle change has resulted in increased blood pressure and rates of hypertension in both adults and youth, placing them {{at greater risk for}} cardiovascular pathology. ^ Higher blood pressure is accompanied by greater body weight, mass and fatness and also by differences in body fat distribution among the predominantly young adult migrants compared to their village relatives. Higher blood pressure among town youth is attributed to their greater body size and growth status. Changes in diet, educational and occupational status, marriage patterns, physical activity levels, health care, and fertility and mortality patterns have also occurred with modernization and directly or indirectly affect blood pressure variation among migrants. ^ In addition to greater fat levels, migrants also show differences from villagers in the relative distribution of subcutaneous fat on the body. A greater centripetal distribution of fat, particularly greater subscapular or upper back fat, is significantly associated with both blood pressure level and the response of blood pressure to postural change among both village and town adults. ^ Manus migrant men have a high incidence of borderline hypertension compared to young adult men living in the United States. Adiposity and occupational status significantly and independently predict blood pressure levels among these men suggesting that, in addition to physical factors, psychosocial stress plays a role in the etiology of blood pressure elevation in this population. Because the Manus of Pere village have been studied extensively over the past six decades by both cultural and biological anthropologists, it has been possible to carefully assess the impact of social and cultural change upon human biology and health in this population. ...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16th century, a number of disputes arose between Hausweiler and several neighbouring villages. A grazing cooperative came into being in which, besides Hausweiler, also Buborn, Deimberg and the Schönborner Hof participated. Buborn and Hausweiler, though, felt that they had been hard done by in this deal, {{and the two of them}} withdrew from the cooperative, leaving Deimberg and the Schönborner Hof to themselves, thus creating two parties. Time and again, one party would let its livestock graze on the others’ land, or one party’s or the other’s would wander off and get lost. The common practice at the time allowed one to claim livestock from outside as one’s own if it was found on one’s own land. Since this happened between the two parties repeatedly, it was not long before a serious disagreement arose between the two parties. It was, however, a long time before the disagreement was settled; the legal proceedings lasted years. In 1575, the Rhinegraves established themselves in the neighbouring village of Grumbach, and Hausweiler’s inhabitants were henceforth their subjects. Until the time of the French Revolution, Hausweiler belonged to the lordship of the Rhinegraves of Grumbach. During the Thirty Years' War, the village was repeatedly plundered. Only a few inhabitants survived the war. In 1632, the Spaniards, who were on the Emperor’s side, came murdering and pillaging. That same year, the Plague claimed many inhabitants’ lives. In 1635, Croatian troops were making their wrath felt in the region. As Imperial troops, they had had to accept a defeat near Odernheim am Glan and had now advanced up the Glan. Like the inhabitants of <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> villages, the <b>people</b> of Hausweiler left their village and hid themselves in the Winterhauch woodland. Only a few returned to the village. Even after the war ended in 1648, there were still troops marauding over the land. Hausweiler could only recover from this gradually, especially as it also had to suffer in French King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest. During these wars, the inhabitants again ﬂed the village in 1697.|$|R
