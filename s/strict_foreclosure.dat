50|$|<b>Strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> {{in the law}} of {{security}} interests in the United States, is the foreclosure of personal property that is subject to such an interest. This is permitted under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The secured party in a <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> takes physical possession of collateral, and the debt for which the property served as collateral is discharged as fulfilled. <b>Strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> is an effective remedy where the creditor has a need or use for the physical property itself. For example, a seller of goods that forecloses on goods in which it had a purchase money security interest (PMSI) may then return the foreclosed goods to its inventory and resell them at its leisure. Similarly, a company that operates equipment and sells some surplus equipment (such as a taxicab company that sells some of its vehicles, or a landscaper that sells excess gardening equipment) can put the foreclosed equipment back into {{the service of the}} company. <b>Strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> is also an effective remedy where the value of the goods foreclosed is the equivalent of the debt due and owing, and the creditor can easily sell the goods for that value.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} {{foreclosure}} are considered minor {{because of their}} limited availability. Under <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> which is available in a few states including Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont, suit is brought by the mortgagee and, if successful, a court orders the defaulted mortgagor to pay the mortgage within a specified period of time. Should the mortgagor fail to do so, the mortgage holder gains the title to the property with no obligation to sell it. This type of foreclosure is generally available only when {{the value of the}} property is less than the debt ("under water"). Historically, <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> was the original method of foreclosure.|$|E
5000|$|... "Strict foreclosure" [...] is an {{equitable}} right available in some states. The <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> period arises after the foreclosure sale {{has taken place}} and is available to the foreclosure sale purchaser. The foreclosure sale purchaser must petition a court for a decree that cuts off any junior lien holder's rights to redeem the senior debt. If the junior lien holder fails to object within the judicially established time frame, his lien is canceled and the purchaser's title is cleared. This effect {{is the same as}} the <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> that occurred at common law in England's courts of equity as a response to the development of the equity of redemption.|$|E
50|$|Foreclosure in the People's Republic of China {{takes place}} {{as a form of}} debt {{enforcement}} proceedings under <b>strict</b> judicial <b>foreclosure,</b> which is only allowed by law of guarantee and law of property right.|$|R
50|$|In {{virtually}} all jurisdictions, specific procedures for foreclosure {{and sale of}} the mortgaged property apply, and may be tightly regulated by the relevant government. There are <b>strict</b> or judicial <b>foreclosures</b> and non-judicial foreclosures, also known as power of sale foreclosures. In some jurisdictions, foreclosure and sale can occur quite rapidly, while in others, foreclosure may take many months or even years. In many countries, the ability of lenders to foreclose is extremely limited, and mortgage market development has been notably slower.|$|R

("WIRFS") [...] "via <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> under revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code" [...] in October 2012. In January 2013 Buttolph assigned the trademarks and intellectual property to Mrs. Winner's Brand Management, a Georgia LLC.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} effect a <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> the {{creditor}} must transmit a proposal indicating their desire to foreclose, which must {{be sent to the}} debtor and to secondary obligors (guarantors of the debt). If the collateral is not consumer goods, the notice must also be sent to other secured parties known to the foreclosing creditor, either because they have notified the foreclosing creditor of their interest, or because they have perfected their interest by filing the appropriate documents with the state secretary of state. If any notified party objects within 20 days, irrespective of reason, then <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> will not be permitted. Instead, the creditor will have to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner, and will recoup its debt from the proceeds of that sale. This prevents subordinated creditors from having their interest {{in the value of the}} property cut off, since any amount recovered in the sale over and above the amount of the foreclosing creditor's debt will go to the remaining creditors.|$|E
50|$|A recent {{modification}} to {{the rule}} provides that <b>strict</b> <b>foreclosure</b> will also not be permitted if the debtor has repaid at least 60% of the loan for which consumer goods have been put up as collateral, or has paid 60% or cash price of consumer goods bought under a PMSI. This rule prevents the creditor from realizing a windfall gain by foreclosing on property that is substantially more valuable than the remaining debt. If the 60% threshold has been met, then the creditor will have to sell the collateral within 90 days, and must recoup its debt from the proceeds of that sale, returning all excess to the debtor.|$|E
