These 12 clubs would later become the Football League's 12 founder members. The meetings were held in London, the main concern was that an early exit in the knockout format of the FA Cup could leave clubs with no matches for almost a year, and if that happened, not only could they suffer heavy financial losses, but fans often didn't <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> that long without a game, and instead went to other teams.

50|$|Despite being {{compared}} to popular alternative bands such as Built to Spill, Caustic Resin were less connected to Seattle than many thought. In {{contrast to the}} more popular sounds of the Northwest, Caustic Resin's music was a dark, druggy blend of heavy metal, psychedelia, and space rock. Headed by guitarist/vocalist Brett Netson, the band favored thick, slow-moving jams filled with torturous vocals and warped noise freak-outs, softened by the occasional quiet meditation or hint of blues. Most media attention focused on Caustic Resin's relationship with Built to Spill — Netson was a frequent guest musician, and the two bands once combined for an EP release — but they {{proved to be a}} venerable presence in their own right, <b>sticking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> well over a decade.|$|R

5000|$|In his {{analysis}} of the Spaghetti Western genre, Alex Cox was highly critical of the Stranger films, which he felt were [...] "brain-dead" [...] and had [...] "nothing at all to recommend them", and of Anthony, who he described as an [...] "unappealing" [...] actor who was [...] "talented at nothing beyond <b>sticking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> sequels". Writing specifically about A Stranger in Town, Cox described the film as [...] "entirely routine and derivative" [...] of Sergio Leone's films, and bemoaned the film's [...] "tedious" [...] pacing and [...] "dull" [...] violence. He felt that Frank Wolff, [...] "a good actor of good guys", was miscast as Aguilar, finding Aldo Berti to be more convincingly villainous as Marinero. Cox also criticised the [...] "inglorious" [...] revelation of the Stranger as a army spy, the [...] "endlessly repeated" [...] score and the mostly [...] "unimpressive" [...] camerawork.

Rob Markman of MTV gave the project a positive review saying, [...] "By the time the 14-track project winds down, Isaiah Rashad slowly doles out his own coming-of-age story using introspective raps, melodies and, at times, good old southern bounce." [...] Marcus Dowling of HipHopDX said, [...] "Every story and hook on Isaiah Rashad's Cilvia Demo connects on a human level. What it lacks in depth is covered by excellent production and raw talent."
