To minimize the effect of this on throughput, circuit designers often deeply pipeline designs whenever possible. Several research groups have attempted to support this type of heavily pipelined circuit by developing new architectures that include registered <b>switchpoints</b> within the interconnect. Unfortunately, this pipelined communication network presents a new and difficult problem for detailed routing tools. In this paper we discuss the details of this problem and present a new timing-driven pipeline-aware router that produces 40 % better critical path delay than previous efforts.

Several research groups have attempted to address this by developing new architectures that include registered <b>switchpoints</b> within their interconnect. Unfortunately, this pipelined communication network presents a new and difficult problem for detailed routing tools. Known as the N-Delay Routing Problem, it has been proven to be NP-Complete. Although there have been two heuristics recently developed to address this issue, both have certain limitations and neither approach considers timing during the routing process. While timing-driven conventional routing is largely considered to be a solved problem, there are several issues inherent to the N-Delay Routing problem make addressing timing particularly difficult.

40|$|In arthropods, {{most cases}} of {{morphological}} dimorphism within males {{are the result}} of a conditional evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) with status-dependent tactics. In conditionally male-dimorphic species, the status` distributions of male morphs often overlap, and the environmentally cued threshold model (ET) states that the degree of overlap depends on the genetic variation in the distribution of the switchpoints that determine which morph is expressed in each value of status. Here we describe male dimorphism and alternative mating behaviors in the harvestman Serracutisoma proximum. Majors express elongated second legs and use them in territorial fights; minors possess short second legs and do not fight, but rather sneak into majors` territories and copulate with egg-guarding females. The static allometry of second legs reveals that major phenotype expression depends on body size (status), and that the <b>switchpoint</b> underlying the dimorphism presents a large amount of genetic variation in the population, which probably results from weak selective pressure on this trait. With a mark-recapture study, we show that major phenotype expression does not result in survival costs, which is consistent with our hypothesis that there is weak selection on the <b>switchpoint.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that <b>switchpoint</b> is independent of status distribution. In conclusion, our data support the ET model prediction that the genetic correlation between status and <b>switchpoint</b> is low, allowing the status distribution to evolve or to fluctuate seasonally, without any effect on the position of the mean <b>switchpoint...</b>|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} is {{one major}} source of variation in natural populations. Inducible defences, which can be considered threshold traits, are a form of plasticity that generates ecological and evolutionary consequences. A simple cost–benefit model underpins the maintenance and evolution of these threshold, inducible traits. In this model, a rank-order switch in expected fitness, defined by {{costs and benefits of}} induction between defended and undefended morphs, predicts the risk level at which individuals should induce defences. Here, taking predator-induced morphological defences in Daphnia pulex as a threshold trait, we provide the first comprehensive investigation into {{the costs and benefits of}} a threshold trait, and how they combine to reflect fitness and predict the <b>switchpoint</b> at which induction should occur. We develop reaction norms that show genetic variation in switchpoints. Further experiments show that induction can confer a survival benefit and a cost in terms of lifetime reproductive success. Together, these two traits combine to estimate expected fitness and can predict the <b>switchpoint</b> between an undefended and a defended strategy. The predictions match the reaction norm data for clones that experience these costs and benefits, and correspond well to independent field data on induction. However, predictions do not, and cannot, match for clones that do not gain a benefit from induction. This study confirms that a simple theory, based on life history costs and benefits, is a sufficient framework for understanding the ecology and evolution of inducible, threshold traits...|$|E
40|$|AbstractShallow lakes {{typically}} {{can be in}} one of two contrasting states: a clear {{state with}} submerged macrophytes or a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton. Eutrophication may cause a switch from the clear to the turbid state, if the phosphorus loading exceeds a critical value. Recovery of the clear state is difficult as the critical loading for the switch back during oligotrophication is often lower. A system of interacting ecological processes makes both states stabilize themselves causing the observed hysteresis. The ecosystem of shallow lakes is analysed with PCLake, a dynamic model of nutrient cycling and biota – including phytoplankton, macrophytes and a simplified food web. The model was used to calculate the switchpoints in terms of critical phosphorus loading levels for a number of lake types. It turned out that the predicted critical phosphorus loadings differ per lake type, e. g. they decrease with lake area, mean depth and retention time, increase with relative marsh area and fishing intensity, and differ per sediment type. The findings were grossly comparable with empirical evidence. These outcomes were also used to build a metamodel. The results may be useful for lake management, by comparing the critical loadings for a given lake with the actual loading. If the actual loading clearly exceeds the upper <b>switchpoint,</b> nutrient reduction measures are recommended. If the loading approaches the upper <b>switchpoint,</b> or is in the intermediate range, a manager could try to increase the critical loading values of the lake, e. g. by hydromorphological measures. If the loading is well between the two switchpoints, an alternative is to force a switch by direct food web management...|$|E
40|$|Two {{very basic}} ideas in sexual {{selection}} are {{heavily influenced by}} numbers of potential mates: the evolution of anisogamy, leading to sex role differentiation, and the frequency dependence of reproductive success that tends to equalize primary sex ratios. However, being explicit about the numbers of potential mates is not typical to most evolutionary theory of sexual selection. Here, we argue that this may prevent us from finding the appropriate ecological equilibria that determine the evolutionary endpoints of selection. We review both theoretical and empirical advances on how population density may influence aspects of mating systems such as intrasexual competition, female choice or resistance, and parental care. Density can have strong effects on selective pressures, {{whether or not there}} is phenotypic plasticity in individual strategies with respect to density. Mating skew may either increase or decrease with density, which may be aided or counteracted by changes in female behaviour. <b>Switchpoints</b> between alternative mating strategies can be density dependent, and mate encounter rates may influence mate choice (including mutual mate choice), multiple mating, female resistance to male mating attempts, mate searching, mate guarding, parental care, and the probability of divorce. Considering density-dependent selection may be essential for understanding how populations can persist at all despite sexual conflict, but simple models seem to fail to predict the diversity of observed responses in nature. This highlights the importance of considering the interaction between mating systems and population dynamics, and we strongly encourage further work in this area...|$|R

The assembly free energy for fully ligated cyanomet Hb and for fully oxygenated Hb becomes less favorable by 1. 8 kcal when [NaCl] is increased from 0. 08 to 0. 7 M, whereas that of unligated Hb is practically insensitive to changes in [NaCl]. Values of 1. 6 and 0. 3 mol chloride release were found for the assembly of fully ligated and deoxy Hb, respectively; i. e., a net release of 1. 3 mol chloride is coupled to the ligation of tetramers for both oxygen and cyanomet ligation. The ligation-linked salt component at constant water activity was evaluated to be 1. 0 mol for the full oxygenation of the Hb tetramer in agreement with the overall value previously reported. When the detailed salt linkages accompanying all 16 stepwise cyanomet ligation reactions were experimentally resolved, only two "chloride" effects were found. The first chloride effect correlates with the ligation steps, which create tertiary constraint, and the second effect is coupled to the six <b>switchpoints</b> of quaternary T [...] >R transition. The distribution of these chloride effects agrees closely with predictions of the "symmetry rule mechanism.

40|$|There {{is a vast}} body of {{knowledge}} that eutrophication of lakes may cause algal blooms. Among lakes, shallow lakes are peculiar systems in that they typically can be {{in one of two}} contrasting (equilibrium) states that are self-stabilizing: a ‘clear’ state with submerged macrophytes or a ‘turbid’ state dominated by phytoplankton. Eutrophication may cause a switch from the clear to the turbid state, if the P loading exceeds a critical value. The ecological processes governing this switch are covered by the ecosystem model PCLake, a dynamic model of nutrient cycling and the biota in shallow lakes. Here we present an extensive analysis of the model, using a three-step procedure. (1) A sensitivity analysis revealed the key parameters for the model output. (2) These parameters were calibrated on the combined data on total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, macrophytes cover and Secchi depth in over 40 lakes. This was done by a Bayesian procedure, giving a weight to each parameter setting based on its likelihood. (3) These weights were used for an uncertainty analysis, applied to the <b>switchpoints</b> (critical phosphorus loading levels) calculated by the model. The model was most sensitive to changes in water depth, P and N loading, retention time and lake size as external input factors, and to zooplankton growth rate, settling rates and maximum growth rates of phytoplankton and macrophytes as process parameters. The results for the ‘best run’ showed an acceptable agreement between model and data and classified nearly all lakes to which the model was applied correctly as either ‘clear’ (macrophyte-dominated) or ‘turbid’ (phytoplankton-dominated). The critical loading levels for a standard lake showed about a factor two uncertainty due to the variation in the posterior parameter distribution. This study calculates in one coherent analysis uncertainties in critical phosphorus loading, a parameter that is of great importance to water quality managers. ...|$|R

Surprisingly, I’m learning that practitioners are hungry for conceptual resources, thoughts that stretch the boundaries, sometimes break the boundaries, of “common sense” approaches to identity categories. In these presentations, which I seek to make accessible, three specific theories are my tender destination. Time permitting on our panel, I’ll briefly touch on each of them. THEORY # 1 is the theory of the <b>switchpoint,</b> which is an asymmetrical crossing between two signs: often in my research between the signs “black” and “queer. ” I’m going {{to tell the story of}} my “gay” childhood by crossing it through a rarely-if-ever-seen “black” childhood, which is how I came to craft the theory of the <b>switchpoint.</b> THEORY # 2 involves the “gay” child arising from my story as a dramatization of the queer childhoods of all of us here, whoever we are, for we are “queer” (feel free to disagree….). Which leads, finally, to THEORY # 3, where I’ll begin. Sexual sameness does not exist. You are queer because we’re not the same, because we’re all “hetero,” because there’s no such thing as homo-sexuality. These three theories allow me to explain how the “gay” child has not been in History; how it has a backwards birth; how it is not, in any direct sense, a bio-category but a profound connection to a word or set of words that are enfleshed. What might the notion of a “gay” child do to conceptions of the child? Kid Orientalism, to put the matter cryptically, is one of its results...|$|E

40|$|Enlarged {{weapons and}} {{ornamental}} traits under sexual selection often show a positive allometric {{relationship with the}} overall body size. The present study explores the allometry of mandibles and their supporting structure, the head, in males of the European stag beetle, Lucanus cervus. This species shows a remarkable dimorphism in mandible shape and size that are used by males in intraspecific combats. Stag beetles were captured, measured, weighed, and released {{in the framework of}} a capture-mark-recapture study. The relationship of mandible length (ML) and head width in respect to the overall body size was described by a segmented regression model. A linear relationship was detected between ML and head width. The scaling relationships for both ML and head width identified the same <b>switchpoint,</b> highlighting the advantages of using combined results of weapons and their supporting structures in such analysis. These results led to a more consistent distinction of males in two morphologies: minor and major. The survival probability of individuals was dependent on the morphological class and was higher for minor males than for major. Elytron length and body mass of the individuals did not show any significant variation during the season. Differences in predatory pressure were detected between morphs by the collection and analysis of body fragments due to the predatory activity of corvids. Morphological differences and shift in demographic and ecological parameters between the two classes suggested that selection continues to favor intrasexual dimorphism in this species throughout a trade-off mechanism between costs and benefits of carrying exaggerated traits...|$|E
40|$|In {{traditional}} societies, {{knowledge is}} organized in hierarchical chains through which authority is legitimated by custom. Because {{the majority of}} the population is illiterate, sacred knowledge is conveyed orally and ritualistically, but the ultimate source of religious authority is typically invested in the Book. The hadith (sayings and customs of the Prophet) are a good example of traditional practice. These chains of Islamic knowledge were also characteristically local, consensual and lay, unlike in Christianity, with its emergent ecclesiastical bureaucracies, episcopal structures and ordained priests. In one sense, Islam has no church. While there are important institutional differences between the world religions, network society opens up significant challenges to traditional authority, rapidly increasing the flow of religious knowledge and commodities. With global flows of knowledge on the Internet, power is no longer embodied and the person is simply a <b>switchpoint</b> in the information flow. The logic of networking is that control cannot be concentrated for long at any single point in the system; knowledge, which is by definition only temporary, is democratically produced at an infinite number of sites. In this Andy Warhol world, every human can, in principle, have their own site. While the Chinese Communist Party and several Middle Eastern states attempt to control this flow, their efforts are only partially successful. The result is that traditional forms of religious authority are constantly disrupted and challenged, but at the same time the Internet creates new opportunities for evangelism, religious instruction and piety. The outcome of these processes is, however, unknown and unknowable. There is a need, therefore, to invent a new theory of authority that is post-Weberian in reconstructing the conventional format of charisma, tradition and legal rationalism...|$|E
40|$|Diadromy, {{the change}} of habitat salinity, is found in many fish species and is often facultative, i. e., not all {{individuals}} of a population are diadromous. In some Anguilla spp., Sr:Ca ratios on transects from core to periphery of otoliths have revealed that, within a river basin, some eels enter freshwaters as glass eels and remain there, some remain in coastal or estuarine waters, some move between the habitats after some years, and some move between habitats annually or irregularly. These various patterns of diadromy reflect two fundamentally different behaviors: migration of individuals arriving from the sea and settling {{at different levels of}} the watershed, and foraging that is initiated after settlement and may lead to habitat relocations. Migration is an internally-initiated process while foraging is environmentally-initiated. Diadromy is depicted as a conditional strategy, i. e., a threshold reaction norm responding to internal cues during migration and to environmental cues during foraging. During the migratory phase, internal cues for being a migrant vs. a settler are provided by individual energetic and ontogenetic status while, during foraging, environmental cues for dispersal are provided by agonistic interactions and resources availability. During both phases, the <b>switchpoint</b> for alternative movement decisions is underlaid by significant genetic variation so that the conditional strategy may evolve to an evolutionary stable state. We provide a speculative endocrine mechanism for proximate mediation of alternative migratory tactics, which is based on an antagonism between thyroid hormones and a growth hormone-cortisol group. Changes in selective pressures during the last decades (decreased densities in saltwater habitats and increased selection against upstream migrants) may have displaced the stable state of the conditional strategy and thus induced an adaptive drop in the proportion of diadromous individuals among populations...|$|E
40|$|Male Nicrophorus burying beetles utilize two {{alternative}} mate-finding tactics, representing {{an ideal}} model system {{to test the}} influence of environmental cues on the expression of alternative tactics. The 2 ̆ 2 searching 2 ̆ 2 tactic involves flying {{in search of a}} carcass on which to mate. This tactic can result in high levels of paternity, but is risky in that carcasses are rare and competition for carcasses is fierce. The 2 ̆ 2 signaling 2 ̆ 2 tactic, which involves emitting pheromone {{in the absence of a}} carcass to attract females, is energetically less costly, but a signalling male must mate with multiple females to achieve the same reproductive returns as a successful searcher. Most male burying beetles employ both tactics, but the amount of time spent employing each tactic differs between individuals. Because all males are phenotypically plastic in the time invested in alternative behaviors, the expression of the tactics is likely to be condition dependent. While size has been shown to have an effect on tactic expression, it does not explain all of the variation. As a conditional-strategy, an environmental cue, such as the availability of reproductive resources, may influence the 2 ̆ 2 <b>switchpoint</b> 2 ̆ 2 of when one tactic yields higher fitness than the other. We tested how the expression of alternative tactics is influenced by previous mating experience and the perceived availability of females versus carcasses by using a repeated-measures design in which mate-finding behavior of males was observed before and after exposure to: 1) multiple females but no carcasses, 2) multiple females and multiple carcasses, 3) multiple carcasses but no females, or 4) no females of carcasses (control). We found a significant time-by-treatment interaction for time invested in signaling, with both the control and multiple-female groups significantly increasing signaling time. Although the overall time-by-treatment interaction was not quite significant for time invested in searching, pairwise comparisons revealed that control, multiple-female, and multiple-carcass groups all significantly decreased time spent searching. Our results demonstrate that environmental cues do affect which alternative tactic male burying beetles employ, and that the chosen tactic is influenced by the availability of both receptive females and carcasses on which to breed...|$|E
40|$|An den beiden Ovarialkarzinomzelllinien SKOV- 3 und BG 1 wurden neben dem bereits in der Therapie etablierten Carboplatin die Proteasomen-Inhibitoren Bortezomib und MG- 115 und der CDK-Inhibitor Flavopiridol mittels Durchflusszytometrie auf ihre {{antiproliferative}} Wirkung untersucht. Dabei konnte im Rahmen der Zellzyklusanalyse und des Annexin-V-Assays für alle vier Medikamente eine zeit- und konzentrationsabhängige antiproliferative Wirkung nachgewiesen werden. Da die Signaltransduktionswege der Apoptose mögliche Angriffpunkte in der modernen Tumortherapie darstellen, wurden aus den beiden Hauptsignalwegen exemplarisch Proteine ausgewählt, deren Detektion mittels Western Blot über eine mögliche Aktivierung durch die Medikamente Auskunft geben soll. Während bei beiden Zelllinien die zeit- und konzentrationsabhängige Apoptoseinduktion über den extrinsischen Weg durch Bortezomib nachgewiesen werden kann, gelingt dies nach Inkubation mit Flavopiridol lediglich bei den BG 1 -Zellen. Neben der Wirkung der Reinsubstanzen auf die Ovarialkarzinomzelllinien wurde der Frage nach einem möglichen Synergismus von Flavopiridol und den Proteasomeninhibitoren in Kombination mit Carboplatin nachgegangen. Dabei zeigt nur die Kombination von Flavopiridol mit Carboplatin konzentrationsabhängig eine signifikant synergistische antiproliferative Wirkung. Nach simultaner Behandlung mit Bortezomib und Carboplatin lässt sich bei der SKOV- 3 -Zelllinie, sowohl durchflusszytometrisch als auch im Western Blot, sogar ein deutlich antagonistischer Effekt dokumentieren. Als Schaltstelle vieler Signaltransduktionswege in der Zelle bietet die Interaktion mit dem NFκB-Protein einen viel versprechenden Ansatz in der Entwicklung neuer Strategien der Tumortherapie. Mittels ELISA wurde deshalb dessen Aktivität im Zytosol beider Karzinomzelllinien nach Inkubation mit den vier Substanzen untersucht. Während sich bei den BG 1 -Zellen eine Zunahme der NfĸB-Aktivität sowohl durch Carboplatin als Reinsubstanz, wie auch in Kombination mit Flavopiridol und den beiden Proteasomen-Inhibitoren abzeichnet, kommt es bei den SKOV- 3 -Zellen lediglich durch Flavopiridol zu einer signifikanten Modulation des Aktivitätslevels. Auch nach Kombination mit Carboplatin zeigt nur jener mit Flavopiridol inkubierte SKOV- 3 -Ansatz einen signifikanten Synergismus durch den Zusatz des Platinderivats. In {{this study}} we examined the antiproliferating effect of carboplatin, which is already established in ovarian carcinomas as the first line therapy, {{as well as the}} proteasome-inhibitors bortezomib, MG- 115 and the CDK-inhibitor flavopiridol using ovarian carcinoma cell lines like SKOV- 3 and BG 1. Cell cycle-analysis and apoptosis-assay show time- and dose-dependent antiproliferating effect for all four drugs. Signal transduction pathways of apoptosis are potential working points in modern tumour-therapy. Exemplary proteins from both main pathways of apoptosis were selected, whose detection in western blot provides information on the potential activation of the apoptosis cascade. While both cell lines show a time- and dose-dependend induction of apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway after treatment with bortezomib, the effectiveness of flavopiridol can only be established for BG 1 -cells. Apart from effects of pure substances on tumour cells potential synergies of flavopiridol and proteasome-inhibitors with carboplatin were analysed. While for BG 1 -cells a significant dose-dependent synergistic antiproliferating effect after incubation with both flavopridol and carboplatin was detected, the SKOV- 3 -cellline only showed a tendency of increasing apoptosis without any correlate in western blot analysis. After simultaneous treatment with bortezomib and carboplatin an antagonistic effect on SKOV- 3 -cells by means of flowcytometry as well as western blot analysis can be demonstrated. Flowcytometry detected only an additive effect of a combined application of bortezomib with carboplatin on modulation of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis in BG 1 -cells. As a <b>switchpoint</b> of many signal transduction pathways in cells, the interaction with NFκB seems to provide a promising approach for the development of new strategies in tumour therapy. Via ELISA, we investigated the activity of the NFκB-protein in cytoplasma of ovarian cancer cell lines after incubation with carboplatin, flavopridol and proteasome inhibitors. While both single agent carboplatin as well as a combination of carboplatin with flavopiridol and proteasome-inhibitors in BG 1 -cells lead to increasing activity of NfĸB, only the treatment with flavopiridol showed a significant modulation for the case of SKOV- 3 -cells. However, the combined application of flavopiridol with carboplatin yields a significant synergistc effect...|$|E
