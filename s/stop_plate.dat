Introduction The increasing popularity of portable electronics {{and the concept of}} green computers have generated a need for low-power computer design.

40|$|Microprojectile {{methods of}} genetic {{engineering}} sometimes employ a macroprojectile which launches the microprojectiles when it hits a <b>stopping</b> <b>plate.</b> A study {{has been made of}} the relationship between the velocities of the macroprojectile and the microprojectile it launches. Macroprojectile velocities were measured using a beam blanking method and the microprojectile velocities were measured with a laser Doppler anemometer. Particles of tungsten, titanium dioxide and silicon carbide were investigated as microprojectiles. The microprojectile velocity was found to depend not only on the macroprojectile velocity but also on the microprojectile size and material, the bond strength with the macroprojectile and the gas flow that develops ahead of the macroprojectile. On average the microprojectile launch velocity was similar to the macroprojectile velocity. However, some tungsten particles had velocities twice this value. Experimental evidence suggests that these higher velocities were caused by early break-way of particles from the macroprojectile followed by further acceleration by aerodynamic drag arising from the gas flow ahead of the macroprojectile...|$|R

This device utilizes compressed air from a commercial airgun to propel macroprojectile and DNA-coated tungsten particles. The β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene {{was used to}} monitor transient expression in three distinct cell types of maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The highest level of GUS activity in cultured maize cells was observed when distance between <b>stopping</b> <b>plate</b> and target cells was adjusted to 4. 3 centimeters.

In a partial vacuum of 700 millimeters Hg, velocity of macroprojectile was measured at 520 meters per second with a 6 % reduction in velocity at atmospheric pressure.

GUS expression was also detected in wheat leaf base tissue of microdissected shoot apices. High levels of transient gene expression were also observed in hard, compact embryogenic callus of rice.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{analyzed}} {{the dynamics of}} the boundaries between the neural plate and the epidermis and between the neural plate and the notoplate. Our experiments confirm that these two boundaries have important roles in neurulation. Measurements of the lengths of neural fold (the boundary between epidermis and neural plate) in embryos of axolotls and newts reveal that neural folds abutting the prospective brain decrease in length while neural folds abutting the prospective spinal cord increase in length during neurulation. We tested the proposition that boundaries of the neural plate with epidermis and with notoplate are essential for proper neurulation. Cuts made along the boundaries with epidermis or with notoplate stop, or greatly diminish, neural plate elongation and tube formation. Explanting the axolotl neural plate without any bordering epidermis <b>stops</b> <b>plate</b> elongation and prevents neural tube closure, but neural plates explanted with a rim of epidermis elongate and close into tubes. Cutting the notoplate boundary stops midline elongation in the newt embryo or diminishes it in the axolotl embryo. We conclude that the notoplate boundary and part of the boundary of the epidermis that abuts the prospective spinal cord organize cell behavior to elongate the neural plate and help close the neural tube. The boundary of the neural plate with the epidermis is essential for tube closure both because it organizes plate elongation in the spinal cord region and because cell behavior becomes organized at the boundary such that neural folds are raised and a rolling moment is produced that helps form the neural tube...|$|R

40|$|Because mantle {{viscosity}} is temperature‐dependent, cold subducting lithosphere {{should be}} strong, which {{implies that the}} rapid, localized deformation associated with subduction should strongly resist plate motions. Due to computational constraints, the deformation of a subducting plate cannot be accurately resolved in mantle‐scale convection models, so its effect on convection is difficult to investigate. We have developed a new method for implementing subduction that parametrizes the deformation of the oceanic lithosphere within a small region of a finite element grid. By imposing velocity boundary conditions {{in the vicinity of}} the subduction zone, we enforce a geometry for subduction, producing a slab with a realistic thermal structure. To make the model dynamically consistent, we specify a rate for subduction that balances the energy budget for convection, which includes an expression for the energy needed to deform the oceanic lithosphere as it subducts. This expression is determined here from a local model of bending for a strong viscous lithosphere. By implementing subduction in this way, we have demonstrated convection with plates and slabs that resemble those observed on Earth, but in which up to 40 per cent of the mantle's total convective resistance is associated with deformation occurring within the subduction zone. This additional resistance slows plate velocities by nearly a factor of two compared to models with a weak slab. For sufficiently strong lithosphere, the bending deformation slows surface plates sufficiently that they no longer actively participate in global‐scale convection, which occurs instead beneath a ‘sluggish lid’. By introducing a low‐viscosity asthenosphere beneath the oceanic plate, we demonstrate that small‐scale convection at the base of oceanic lithosphere may limit plate thickness, and thus the resistance to bending, and cause plate velocities to depend on the strength of the bending lithosphere rather than on the viscosity of the underlying mantle. For a cooling Earth, the effective lithosphere viscosity should be nearly constant, but the mantle viscosity should increase with time. Thus, subduction‐resisted convection should produce nearly constant plate velocities and heat flow over time, which has implications for the Earth's thermal evolution. We estimate that this style of convection should apply if the effective viscosity of the bending lithosphere is greater than about 10 ^(23) Pa s, but only if some mechanism, such as small‐scale convection, prevents the bending resistance from <b>stopping</b> <b>plates</b> altogether. Such a mechanism could be fundamental to plate tectonics and Earth's thermal history...|$|R
