5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E

40|$|A {{manipulation}} of attitude function {{was used to}} test hypotheses that attitude function moderates (a) the strength of relations between values and attitudes, (b) the pattern of relations between values and attitudes, and (c) the role of values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prediction of behavioral intentions. Attitude function was manipulated by making salient either utilitarian or value-expressive reasons for attitudes toward donating to cancer research. We then measured subjects′ attitudes toward donating to cancer research, their perceived control over donating, their subjective norms regarding donating, and their intentions to donate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. Results indicated that <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value-expressive attitude condition exhibited significant value-attitude relations, whereas <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> utilitarian attitude condition did not. <b>In</b> addition, <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value-expressive attitude condition exhibited a pattern of value-attitude relations that was consistent with Schwartz′s (1992, in press) model of value associations, whereas <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> utilitarian attitude condition did not exhibit such a pattern. Finally, for <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value-expressive attitude condition, values predicted intentions to donate even when attitudes, norms, and perceptions of control were entered into <b>the</b> equation, whereas <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> utilitarian attitude condition did not manifest any relation between values and intentions.

The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E
5|$|Published posthumously, The Autobiography of MalcolmX is {{an account}} of the life of MalcolmX, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book {{describes}} Malcolm's childhood in Michigan, {{the death of his father}} under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. MalcolmX was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of MalcolmX's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his <b>subject,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Autobiography's epilogue.|$|E

5|$|Beer, as {{he still}} named himself, studied with Antonio Salieri and the German master {{and friend of}} Goethe, Carl Friedrich Zelter. Louis Spohr {{organised}} a concert for Beer at Berlin in 1804 and continued his acquaintance with the lad later in Vienna and Rome. A portrait of Jacob commissioned by the family at this time shows him 'confidently facing the viewer, his hair romantically dishevelled… his left hand rests on the keyboard, and his right hand grasps a musical manuscript… plac its <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradition of the young Mozart'. Beer's first stage work, the ballet Der Fischer und das Milchmädchen (The Fisherman and the Milkmaid) was produced in March 1810 at the Court Opera in Berlin. His formal training with the Abbé Vogler at Darmstadt between 1810 and 1812 was, however, of crucial importance, and at around this time he begins to sign himself 'Meyer Beer'. Here, with his fellow students (who included Carl Maria von Weber), he learnt not only the craft of composition but also the business of music (organising concerts and dealing with publishers). Forming a close friendship with Weber and other pupils, Meyerbeer established the Harmonischer Verein (Musical Union), whose members undertook to support each other with favourable press criticism and networking. On 12 February 1813 Beer received {{the first of the}} string of honours he was to accumulate throughout his life when he was appointed 'Court Composer' by Grand Duke Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt.|$|E
5|$|The pediments, metopes, and {{shield of}} the Parthenos all {{illustrate}} the mythological past {{and as the}} deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account {{for the absence of}} the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field, Connelly's {{solution to the problem of}} meaning poses as many problems as it answers.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that there are no referential null <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Germanic V 2 -languages, it has been claimed that the V 2 -property is universally in-compatible with referential null <b>subjects.</b> However, <b>in</b> this paper it is demonstrated that referential null <b>subjects</b> occur <b>in</b> several Old Germanic languages as well as in a number of non-standard Modern Germanic vernaculars, all of them V 2 -languages. Hence the assumed connection between V 2 -word order and non-present referential null subjects can be refuted. It is also shown that <b>the</b> referential null <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two groups of languages (Old and Modern) display different syntactic properties, in several respects.
