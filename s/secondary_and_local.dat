The Republic started work on its motorway network in the early 1980s; and historically, the road network there was once somewhat less well developed. However, the advent of the Celtic Tiger economic boom and an influx of European Union structural funding saw national roads and regional roads in the Republic come up to international standard quite quickly. In the mid-1990s, for example, the Republic went from having only a few short sections of motorway to constructing motorways, dual carriageways and other improvements on most major routes as part of a National Development Plan. Road construction in Northern Ireland now tends to proceed at a slower pace than in the Republic, although a number of important bypasses and upgrades to dual carriageway have recently been completed or are about to begin.|$|E

40|$|The American {{black bear}} (Ursus americanus) is a wide-ranging, large {{carnivore}} species that {{makes use of}} multiple habitat types throughout the year. In the northeastern US, black bears require large areas of relatively undisturbed forest and avoid development, such as urban and suburban areas. Roads represent another form of development that may affect the distribution of bears. However, the effects of roads remain largely unknown and represent a potential conservation concern. We sought to determine the relationship between roads and distribution of black bears in a forested region of southern Vermont. We examined the probability of occurrence of black bears using GPS-collar data (n = 30, 179 locations) collected from a marked population of bears (n = 8 females, 15 males) from 2011 to 2014. We then constructed a set of 7 candidate models to explain occupancy that included combinations of three road types: secondary, vehicular, and local. Model selection techniques {{were used to determine}} the best model in the set. Models were performed separately for male and female bears, which have been shown to exhibit different distribution patterns elsewhere. The top model for each sex was the most complex in the set, and included the additive combination of all three road types. For males, vehicular and local roads positively affected occupancy, whereas secondary roads had a negative influence on occupancy. For females, vehicular and secondary roads positively affected occupancy, whereas local roads negatively affected occupancy. Our results indicate that small, low traffic, residential and ATV roads influence bear distribution; most likely by providing easy pathways to travel through the forested landscape and food resources not found elsewhere. <b>Secondary</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> roads also affect sexes differently, which could result in demographic and genetic consequences. Models provide a measure of the effect of different roads on bear distribution that can help inform decision-making about development in the forested landscapes of Vermont...|$|E
40|$|Speed is an {{important}} factor of road accidents. This paper focusses on changes and differences in speed of the traffic flow and on speed differences between different vehicles. Based on an international literature survey the relevance of the speed related factors for road safety are described. Road categorization and delineation of speed limit zones are identified as the most important tools to obtain a more homogeneous speed pattern. Based on a series of case studies including the different urbanization typologies, it is shown that regarding the implementation of these two planning concepts, little has been achieved in Flanders. The scattered and ribbon shaped urbanization along the <b>secondary</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> roads and the step by step adaptation of speed limits on road segments by the different road authorities, give rise to a manifest lack of homogeneity. Based on the Flemish Road Signs Database a quantitative analysis (e. g. relating to the length of segments, number of speed limit changes on a road section, etc.) could be carried out. The database contains all traffic signs relevant for speed limits on the entire road network in Flanders, including the road sign position and the description of its characteristics. Based on the case studies both an analysis of the existing situation as well as an explorative assessment of a generic scenario (entering a general speed limit of 70 km/h in non-built up areas instead of the current limit of 90 km /h were described. By implementing this scenario, six out of seven speed limit signs can be removed and the workload for the drivers can be reduced proportionately. So speed limit policy and zoning can be regarded as key instruments for more road safety on local and secondary roads...|$|E
40|$|Despite its {{significance}} and frequent mentioning in the literature, {{the relationship between}} road investment and economic development has never been clearly understood. A significant number of scholars in this field have always emphasized {{the need for further}} research to examine this complex and dynamic relationship. Historically, investment in transportation networks has played a great {{role in the development of}} cities, regions, and nations. This positive view is attributed to the indispensable role that water transportation, and then rail transport, played in the early development of Europe and the United States. In recent years, many scholars, as well as policy makers, have disputed that investment in transportation, and in particular roads, in the regions of a highly developed country like the United States will have a great impact on economic development. This disagreement and speculation about the role of transportation investment, especially roads which constitute a large portion of the transportation network, on economic development has made justification for roads funding difficult. This is coupled with the recent decline in federal funding for many civilian programs, and in particular, regional economic development program, that include investment in road systems. Furthermore, rising construction and maintenance costs for major highway systems have substantially out-paced the current funding levels. As a result of the shortage of roads funding and the lack of federal support, individual states have started to take on more responsibility for keeping their road network intact. In almost all the states in the nation, and Oregon is no exception, the state Departments of Transportation have started to use economic development as a criterion for roads funding. Therefore, it is the objective of this dissertation to examine the longitudinal impact of the various types of roads investments on economic development in Oregon in order to better understand this dynamic relationship. Total road expenditures, capital expenditures in the three types of roads (primary, <b>secondary,</b> <b>and</b> <b>local),</b> total maintenance expenditures, and maintenance expenditures in the three types of roads are used as a measure of road investments. Total employment to growth and employment to growth in manufacturing and service sectors are used as a measure of economic development. In order to achieve the above objective, the Granger Causality test at different level of aggregation is used to examine this relationship. First, the state as a single aggregate unit is used to examine the effect of the various road investments on the three employment to growth sectors. Second, different spatial groupings, such as Portland Metropolitan Counties vs. the rest of the state Counties, Urban Counties, vs. Rural Counties, Interstate Counties vs. Non-Interstate Counties, Coastal Counties vs. Non-Coastal Counties, and the Department of Transportation 2 ̆ 7 s five designated regions are used to examine this relationship. Finally, the county level as a single disaggregate unit is also used. The results highlighted the complexity of the relationship between road investments and economic development. The nature of this relationship varies from one region to another, and mainly depends on the level of aggregation in determining the direction of this relationship. At the aggregate level, the state as one geographic unit, the various road investments have a positive impact on the employment to growth in this region. In particular, total road expenditure and capital expenditure on primary and secondary roads have a one-way directional relationship runs from the various road expenditures to employment to growth, and the effect of this investment is long-term. This analysis also indicates that the different spatial groupings have demonstrated different relationships. Nevertheless, the general pattern for most spatial groupings tends to suggest either a one-way directional relationship runs from the various road expenditures to employment to growth or a bi-directional relationship. No findings support the hypothesis that employment to growth in the three economic sectors causes road expenditures, with the exception of very few cases, especially at the lower end of the analysis at the county level, where the results are highly discrepant and mixed. In addition, this research indicates that the time-lag effect measured by lag-length and accumulative lag effect changes as the level of aggregation changes. However, the general pattern seems to indicate that total road expenditures and capital expenditures for the three types of roads, particularly primary and secondary roads, have a long-term effect on employment to growth. Also, the relative magnitude effect of total road expenditures and capital expenditures on primary and secondary roads is greater on the employment to growth than is the comparable effect of maintenance expenditures in most spatial groupings. Furthermore, the effect of the various road expenditures on the type of employment (manufacturing and service) depends greatly on the level of aggregation and the type of road Investment Finally, this study provides public policy makers, transportation planners, and regional economic developers a better understanding of the complex relationship between road investment and economic development. A better understanding of this highly complex and dynamic relationship can guide decision makers to best utilize their limited resources. In addition, this research offers insight into the theories and works in the field of transportation and economic development...|$|E

40|$|Urban {{pavements}} {{in developing}} countries often provide users with low level of services and result in negative impacts on the population and economy. Two main causes of deferring maintenance actions for urban pavements {{in developing countries}} were identified: an institutional organization that limits the optimization of resources assigned to urban pavements because current regulations may not be clear on the responsibilities and faculties of agencies in charge of urban pavement management, and; the lack of effective technical-economic tools that may help agencies {{in the decision-making process}} as an updated management system adapted to prevailing urban pavements maintenance requirements. Although the current state-of-the-art and the-practice of PMSs presents great developments in the last decade for interurban pavements, effective tools developed for urban pavement management are still a missing part of current practices. Compared with the management of interurban roads, the management of urban pavements is a comprehensive task given the complexity of urban networks, the coordination with various services and the variable traffic demands. Given this scenario for urban pavement management, {{there is a need for}} better understanding urban pavements performance for network management. An overall condition index that combines most relevant distresses affecting urban pavements performance is required for network analysis due to several pavement condition indices available were developed for interurban road networks (highways, express corridor, etc.); moreover, several performance models have been developed for particular distresses, and some of them for pavement condition indexes of interurban pavements. Then, their direct application to urban networks (streets, avenues, etc.) is not representative and their adaptability for these conditions requires previous adjustments and calibration. This research was focused on the network level analysis of urban pavements, towards the development of practical and sustainable technical tools to be further integrated into an Urban Pavement Management System (UPMS). The main objective was to calibrate an Urban Pavement Condition Index (UPCI) and Performance Models, technical components required for an UPMS, based on data collected in urban networks in Chile. UPCI for asphalt and concrete pavement, based on objective measures of surface distresses and evaluations of an expert panel was successfully calibrated and validated with a confidence level of 95 %. Multilineal regressions were performed to obtain the UPCI models. Three UPCI models were obtained for asphalt pavements with manual and automated data collection. The distresses resulted significance in asphalt pavement condition are fatigue cracking, transverse and reflection cracking, deteriorated patches, rutting, and potholes for manual data collected. IRI replaces potholes in the condition equation for automated data collected. One UPCI model was achieved with successfully validation for concrete pavements with manual data collection. The distresses representative of concrete pavement condition are longitudinal, transversal and oblique cracking, corner breaks, deteriorated patches, faulting, and deteriorate joints and cracks. Deteriorated patches have an important effect in the UPCI value for all UPCIs calibrated, where utility cuts are frequently observed, resulting in low quality patches and high probabilities of premature deterioration. This conclusion supports the primary hypothesis that special condition evaluation guidelines and indicators are required for urban pavements. Distress evaluation guidelines for asphalt and concrete pavements considering manual and automated surveys were developed and satisfactory validated with a 95 % of confidence level through repeatability and reproducibility analysis. This guideline proposes an evaluation methodology for the distresses included in the UPCI. Based on the field evaluation carried out during the research, recommendations about the frequency and sampling for pavement condition evaluation are given for different network hierarchies: primary, every 2 year, the complete network; secondary, every 4 year, the complete network, and; local, every four years samples of homogeneous sections. Performance models were performed based on probabilistic trends of UPCI observed during field evaluations for asphalt and concrete pavements. Five field evaluation campaigns were developed in three regions of Chile during a three-year analysis period for the calibration and validation of performance models. The climates included were dry, Mediterranean and humid. The probabilistic trend over time of data collected was analyzed using Markov chains with Monte Carlo simulation that facilitates the analysis of the deterioration trend with only two points of the curve condition over time, allowing the simulation of pavement performance within the timeframe of the research. Fourteen performance models were calibrated for different combination of three climates, two pavement types and three hierarchy networks, considering a pavement life cycle of 25 years. Twelve of them were successfully validated with a confidence level of 95 %. The models of asphalt in humid climate and concrete in dry climate need further analysis for their validation, considering more data collection in these climates. Hierarchies based on grouped functional classification were used: Primary Network (Express and Troncal streets), Secondary Network (Colectors and Services) and Local Network (Local and passages). Additionally, a comparative analysis was performed between the real equivalent axles demanding the sections and the equivalent axles admitted by their structures, in sections of Mediterranean climate. In other climates, the data was not enough to perform this analysis. Five models were obtained for asphalt pavement in mediterranean climate: three for the hierarchies and two for the design analysis. The latest two are recommended to use when information about traffic and structure is available. On the contrary, the models developed based on the hierarchy networks are recommended. Two performance models resulted for asphalt pavements in dry and humid climate: Models for humid climate presents higher deterioration rate than model for dry climate. However, both models present a shorter service life than their design. Likewise asphalts, five models were obtained for concrete pavements in mediterranean climate. Considering the models resulted from the analysis of the design, the deterioration trend does not present big differences within the two conditions analyzed. Therefore, for concrete pavements is recommend the use of the models calibrated based on the hierarchy networks. Two models resulted for concrete pavements in dry and humid climate: Both cases present a long service life; however, on the contrary of what is expected, the dry climate presents a deterioration more accelerated than humid climate. This behavior is probably a consequence of differences in construction standards and maintenance policies, noticed in interviews carried out with agencies of both regions. Finally, suitable P&M&R standards for urban pavement based on the urban pavement condition index and their performance models were developed for asphalt and concrete pavements. Three different standards are proposed for primary, <b>secondary</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> networks. The practical tools calibrated in this research can be easily implemented and used by local agencies, and simply adaptable over time and to different scenarios. The results of the study were developed with field data collected in Chilean cities; however, the results may be adapted and adopted in other countries for urban pavement management...|$|E
