25|$|German {{instruments}} were actually fairly {{similar to the}} Norden, even before World War II. A similar set of gyroscopes provided a <b>stabilized</b> <b>platform</b> for the bombardier to sight through, although the complex interaction between the bombsight and autopilot was not used. The Carl Zeiss Lotfernrohr 7, or Lotfe 7, was an advanced mechanical system similar to the Norden bombsight, although in form it was more similar to the Sperry S-1. It started replacing the simpler Lotfernrohr 3 and BZG 2 in 1942, and emerged as the primary late-war bombsight used in most Luftwaffe level bombers. The use of the autopilot allowed single-handed operation, and was key to bombing use of the single-crewed Arado Ar 234.|$|E

40|$|It is {{relatively}} straight-forward to derive comprehensive dynamics block diagrams for two- and three-axis balanced <b>stabilized</b> <b>platforms.</b> But {{trying to do}} it for four and higher order systems is getting rapidly such an amount of work, and the resulting block diagrams so extensive, that sensible simplification from the start if feasible could be very beneficial.

In this paper a method is shown to simplify the dynamics model of <b>stabilized</b> <b>platforms,</b> with the four-axis platform as the main example. The relevant equations are derived for the four-axis example, the block diagram is compiled from the equations after adding simple control loops around the dynamics model to get to the final expanded block diagram, and then some simulation results are shown. The method is validated by showing that the simulation results for a three-axis system are exactly the same for the comprehensive and simplified block diagrams, using the same method. It is proposed that it is therefore reasonable to expect similar findings for the four-axis case...|$|R

40|$|In 1817, F. Bohnenberger {{presented}} an apparatus {{consisting of a}} fast spinning rotor with cardanic suspension. His invention {{formed the basis for}} L. Foucault’s epochal studies on gyroscopic sensors {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. The development of instruments like the artificial horizon and the directional gyro is a direct result of this work. Later on, gyro technology led also to <b>stabilized</b> <b>platforms</b> forming the early variants of inertial navigation systems. Foucault’s initial intention of using Bohnenberger’s invention as a sensor was the provision of a device offering an inertial direction reference for surveying and navigation. Due to technical limitations, a gyro is, however, suitable for such a task during only a limited period of time. To enable a long-term usage, additional, complementary measurements are required. An artificial horizon therefore includes levelling sensors, and a directional gyro is typically coupled with a magnetic compass. On the other hand, the main feature of integrated navigation systems is the fusion of data from dis-similar signal sources. Thus, artificial horizons and directional gyros represent elementary forms of such systems. Modern integrated navigation systems of high performance consist of the combination of inertial strapdown systems (being the successor of <b>stabilized</b> <b>platforms)</b> and GPS receivers. In photogrammetry, they have become an essential tool for direct georeferencing. Nevertheless, their system structure is still traceable to the early gyro instruments mentioned. This classical system design being outlined in the following opens perspectives for new developments...|$|R

The A-1 systems do not have steerability of the roll (dutch) axis, only horizon leveling. These systems as well as the (A), will eliminate almost all of the angular disturbances. The drawback is that the (A-1) systems are closed architecture systems. The DP can only utilize the offered one or two cameras and lens combinations, normally a Mitchell R35 camera and a 10:1 zoom lens.|$|R

Numerical analysis of such a footing-foundation system requires comprehensive information about the treated layer, which usually requires a complicated laboratory test or field experiment. Such test or experiment is almost impossible for small and medium scale infrastructure projects because it is time consuming, labor-intensive, and very costly. In this study, some of the characteristics of the treated materials were obtained from the routine unconfined compressive tests and the rest were evaluated by application of a non-linear failure criterion. The estimated and measured parameters were then applied in finite element analyses to assess the effect of diameter, thickness, and mix type of a lime and cement treated platform on the bearing capacity and load-displacement behavior of a circular footing...|$|R
