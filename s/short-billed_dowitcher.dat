50|$|It is an {{inhabitant}} of North America, Central America, {{and northern}} South America. It is strongly migratory; it completely vacates in breeding areas during the snow-bound months. This species favors {{a variety of}} habitats including tundra in the north to ponds and mudflats in the south. It feeds on invertebrates often by rapidly probing its bill into mud in a sewing machine fashion. It and the very similar long-billed dowitcher were considered one species until 1950. Field identification of the two American Limnodromus remains difficult today. Distinguishing wintering or juvenile <b>short-billed</b> <b>dowitchers</b> from the long-billed species is very difficult and, even given examination their subtlety different body shapes, cannot always be isolated to a particular species. They differ most substantially in vocalizations. The names of American dowitchers are misleading, as there is much overlap in their bill lengths. Only a small percentage can be identified by this character alone.|$|R

On 22 August 1987 my father spotted a Ruby-throated Hummingbird in our backyard, and soon after that I saw two Wilson’s Warblers. Later on I saw another warbler, bluish-gray above and yellow below, prominent eye-ring, a hint of a band across the breast, and yellow feet, so I decided it was a Canada Warbler. And later the same day I saw about twenty Empidonax flycatchers and four more Wilson’s Warblers. And a week later we had a small warbler in our bird bath. The bird had very prominent wingbars, yellow below, light brown above, and when it flew it had white on the outside and around the tail like a Vesper Sparrow. We figured it to be a Pine Warbler. —Joel Jorgensen, Blair BLUEBIRD NEST BOXES. In 1985, Boy Scout Troop 18 of Gering made 150 bluebird nesting boxes as a conservation project and in honor of scouting’s 75 th anniversary.

40|$|Wind is a {{significant}} factor in the thermoregulation of chicks of shorebirds on the Arctic tundra. We investigated the effect of wind at speeds typical of near-surface conditions (0. 1 – 3 m s – 1) on metabolic heat production, evaporative cooling and thermal conductance of 1 - to 3 -week-old downy scolopacid chicks (least sandpiper Calidris minutilla; <b>short-billed</b> <b>dowitcher</b> Limnodromus griseus; whimbrel Numenius phaeopus). Body mass ranged from 9 to 109 g. To accurately measure the interacting effects of air temperature and wind speed, we used two or more air temperatures between 15 ° and 30 °C that produced cold stress at all wind speeds, but allowed chicks to maintain normal body temperature (approximately 39 °C). Thermal conductance increased by 30 – 50 % as wind speed increased from 0. 1 to 3 m s – 1. Conductance in Summary these chicks is somewhat lower than that of 1 -day-old mallard ducklings of similar mass, but higher than values reported for downy capercaillie and Xantus ’ murrelet chicks, as well as for adult shorebirds. Evaporative water loss was substantial and increased with mass and air temperature. We developed a standard operative temperature scale for shorebird chicks.

40|$|We {{measured}} resting and peak metabolic rates (RMR and PMR, respectively) during {{development of}} chicks of seven species of shorebirds: least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla; adult mass 20 22 g), dunlin (Calidris alpina; 56 - 62 g), lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes; 88 - 92 g), <b>short-billed</b> <b>dowitcher</b> (Limnodromus griseus; 85 - 112 g), {{lesser golden plover}} (Pluvialis dominicana; 150 - 156 g), Hudsonian godwit (Limosa haemastica; 205 - 274 g), and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus; 380 g). We tested two opposing hypotheses: the growth rate-maturity hypothesis, which posits that growth rate in chicks is inversely related to functional maturity of tissues, and the fast growth rate-high metabolism hypothesis, which suggests that rapid growth is possible only with a concomitant increase in either RMR or PMR. We have {{found no evidence that}} chicks of shorebirds with fast growth rates have lower RMRs or lower PMRs, as would be predicted by the growth rate-maturity hypothesis, but our data suggested that faster-growing chest muscles resulted in increased thermogenic capacity, consistent with the fast growth-high metabolism hypothesis. The development of homeothermy in smaller species is a consequence primarily of greater metabolic intensities of heat-generating tissues. The maximum temperature gradient between a chick's body and environment that can be maintained {{in the absence of a}} net radiative load increased rapidly with body mass during development and was highest in least sandpipers and lowest among godwits. Chicks of smaller species could maintain a greater temperature gradient at a particular body mass because of their higher mass-specific maximum metabolic rates...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Between spring 1976 {{and fall}} 1980 we studied the occurrence, abundance, and habitat use of birds over a 2000 -km 2 segment ofthe northcentral Alaska Peninsula. During this period {{observers}} were present 473 days and obtained records for all seasons. A total of 125 species was recorded; 63 % (79 of 125) were water-associated. The breeding avifauna {{was found to}} be a mixture of Panboreal (49 %), North her ican (34 %), and Aleutican (17 %) species. The Aleutican group was dominant in terms of biomass and numbers of individuals during the nonbreeding period. Forty-two species were confirmed breeding in the area and another 19 were suspected of breeding. The majority of birds occurred as migrants; 14 species were considered permanent residents and an additional 20 were winter residents. Our observations extended the known Alaska breeding distribution of American wigeon (Anus urnericana), black turnstone (Arenuriu melanocephalu), northern phalarope (Phuluropus loburus), <b>short-billed</b> <b>dowitcher</b> (Limnodromus griseus), western sandpiper (Culidris mauri), dunlin (C. alpinu), horned puffin (Fraterculu corniculara), tufted puffin (Lundu cirrhura), and orange-crowned warbler (Vermivoru celura). Our observations also extended the known postbreeding range or significantly changed the known status of bar-tailed godwit (Limosu lupponicu), whimbrel (Numenius phueopus), lesser yellowlegs (TringaJavipes), long-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus solopuceus), dunlin (Culidris alpinu), marbled murrelet (Bruchyrumphus marmorurus), American robin (Turdus migrutorius), yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroicu coronuru), and dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemulis).

40|$|Williams, Christopher K. I {{conducted}} {{my research}} on Chickaloon Flats, Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, {{which is a}} tidal mudflats located along {{the northern part of}} the Kenai Peninsula in upper Cook Inlet, Alaska, 2009 ??? 2010. It is a protected coastal estuary stopover area along the Pacific Flyway, covering 7 % of the total estuarine intertidal area of Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Almost one-third (23 of 73) of shorebird species recorded in Alaska use this stopover during spring and/or fall migrations. My objectives included 1) creating a current vegetation classification map and quantify vegetation changes from 1975 to 2005, 2) identify the driving factors of ephemeral pool presence, 3) document avian use of Chickaloon Flats during migration periods, and 4) conduct a multi-isotopic approach to estimate probable breeding and/or wintering origins of six species of shorebirds using Chickaloon during spring and fall migration of 2009 and 2010. I analyzed Hydrogen (dD), Carbon (d 13 C), and Nitrogen (d 15 N) isotopes from feathers and performed a likelihood-based assignment to inform North American (NA) and South American (SA) origins of six shorebird species. Only lesser yellowlegs feathers (Tringa flavipes) indicated wintering (n= 4, coastal SA) and breeding (n= 26, central Alaska) ranges. Estimated wintering ranges for least sandpipers (Calidris minutilla, n= 13) occurred in southern NA to northern SA, long-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus, n= 8) occurred in Mexico, and pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos, n= 11) occurred in northeastern SA. Estimated breeding ranges for greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca, n= 67) occurred in southwest Alaska, and <b>short-billed</b> <b>dowitcher</b> (Limnodromus griseus caurinus, n= 26) occurred in south-central Alaska. The analysis of stable isotopes to infer molt origins of birds is a useful and important tool in migration and conservation studies. I determined probable origins of long-distance shorebird migrants, some of high conservation concern, using an Alaskan stopover site, which identified habitats and previously unknown areas used by Alaskan breeding shorebirds. I observed 95 bird species throughout the spring and fall of 2009 and 2010, with 26 of those species breeding on Chickaloon. I observed several pulses of total birds during spring migration, and a more protracted fall migration with variable smaller pulses of birds. Estimated maximum daily shorebird numbers are 5, 638 during spring migration, and 20, 297 during fall migration. I created a recent vegetation classification of 7 vegetation types on Chickaloon Flats using 2005 Landsat TM imagery. I also quantified change of 3 mud/vegetation cover types from 1975 ??? 2005. The vegetated community type remained relatively stable over the 30 -year period, while the mud and mixed mud/vegetation cover types closest to Cook Inlet showed a relatively-small amount of change over time. The greatest change was an increase in mud area, indicating that the vegetated areas of Chickaloon may be slowly converting to a less productive mud community type. My research highlights the overall importance and value of Chickaloon Flats as a stopover and breeding grounds for a diversity of avian species, and long-distance migrant shorebirds in particular.

40|$|In most respects, {{this was}} a routine spring. While a few rarities and several {{interesting}} reports appeared, perhaps most interesting was {{the arrival of the}} electronic age. Foremost was the start-up of 2 ̆ 2 NEBIRDS, 2 ̆ 2 the Nebraska Birding Listserver set up and operated by Robert Price at Kearney. This resource should greatly enhance communication and collective learning amongst birders in the state. We have culled several reports from observations submitted to NEBIRDS, and several reporters now contact us by email. We urge observers to forward their email addresses; if we have questions on their reports, communication would be easy! Submit reports and comments to Ross Silcock by email at silcock@sidney. heartland. net. We also gather sightings reported to the Nebraska Birdline, operated by Loren and Babs Padelford at Bellevue; these reports are placed on the Internet through BIRDCNTR, a service of the National Bird Hotline Cooperative. We should note here that this report contains unverified observations as well as documented observations. And now to the birds! Considerable discussion has taken place about a very 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 warbler migration, 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 for birders, meaning low numbers of birds, While this is true, most species were indeed found, although very low numbers were found of Magnolia, Black-throated Green, Blackburnian, and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, and those that were reported occurred rather late in the migration period. Usually when we do not see many migrating warblers it means they have made long, non-stop flights with beneficial tailwinds right over us to their breeding ranges. Much has been made of the scarcity of migrant warblers this spring in the eastern United States, with blame allocated to habitat loss in the tropical wintering ranges, to forest fragmentation in the breeding ranges (in particular with the result of allowing cowbird access to deep-woods birds), and to extensive smoke encountered while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. The smoke, from major fires in Mexico, may have contributed to a slower migration for some species, but we will have to be patient (a human generation or two?) to see what if anything is actually happening. Joel Jorgensen, who did weekly surveys of the eastern Rainwater Basin in April and May, gathered important shorebird data. These data are presented in the relevant shorebird species accounts. Although few early and late dates were set, a few amazing high counts occurred during the report period: for example, 39 Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebes, 236 Horned Grebes, and 1, 732 McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspurs. Some interesting waterfowl appeared in the Rainwater Basin this spring, suggesting that scrutiny of the immense flocks can yield exciting discoveries: 2 nd state Bean Goose, 2 nd state Garganey, and even a Barnacle Goose, probably not a wild bird.
