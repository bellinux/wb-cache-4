Once the authorisation code has been received, the player will be given three separate options on how to proceed. <b>Standby</b> <b>mode</b> will postpone the nuclear launch, whereas a strategic launch will involve one nuclear warhead targeting a city.

500|$|Commander Miranda Keyes is the {{daughter}} of Jacob Keyes and Catherine Halsey, whom she lived with in her younger years. Halsey and Miranda had a falling out in which she changed her last name (then Halsey) to her father's name (Keyes). Miranda appears in Halo 2, Halo 3 and in the final chapter of Halo: The Cole Protocol. At the beginning of Halo 2, Keyes is present at an awards ceremony on board the Cairo defense platform above Earth to accept a medal posthumously for her father. Soon after, a Covenant fleet launches an attack on Earth, and Keyes takes control of the UNSC ship In Amber Clad and assists in the defense of New Mombasa, Kenya. When the Prophet of Regret retreats from Earth, Keyes orders In Amber Clad to follow; this results in the discovery of Installation 05, another Halo. Keyes, along with Johnson and a squad of Marines, head for Halo's library in order to retrieve the Activation Index and prevent the ring's activation while the Master Chief assassinates the Prophet of Regret; in the process, she and Johnson are captured by the Brute Chieftain Tartarus. As a [...] "Reclaimer," [...] only she or another human can insert the Index into Halo's control panel, and Tartarus attempts to make her do this. When the Arbiter tries to stop the firing, Tartarus forces Keyes to insert the Index, initiating Halo's firing sequence. After the Arbiter engages and kills Tartarus, Keyes successfully removes the Index and prevents Halo from activating, but inadvertently causes all the remaining Halo installations to enter <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> enabling the remote firing of these installations from The Ark. In Halo 3, Miranda Keyes returns to Earth and leads the pursuit of the Prophet of Truth through the portal he creates using the artifact buried under New Mombasa, which leads to the Ark. When Sergeant Johnson is captured by the Covenant to activate the installation, she attempts to rescue him, but is killed when Truth shoots her in the back with a Brute Spiker.|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, {{our main}} {{objective}} is to introduce and to support <b>standby</b> <b>modes</b> in next-generation devices for backbone networks. Our main idea consists of periodically reconfiguring nodes and links to meet incoming traffic volumes and operational constraints of real-world networks, such as reliability, stability, quality of service, and re-convergence times. To this purpose, the approach is mainly founded on two features already and largely present in today's networks and devices: the network resource virtualization and the modular architecture of nodes. By means of a Linux SW router prototype, we demonstrated that the proposed approach allows dynamically sleeping pieces of hardware in several network nodes, while maintaining good network performance levels, and without causing undesired network instabilities. © 2010 ACM...|$|R
2500|$|In Windows Vista, {{sleep mode}} is the default [...] "off" [...] power state for both desktop {{computers}} and mobile PCs such as laptops; sleep mode replaces the <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> seen in previous versions of Windows.

Vetoing the sleep process—which prevents the operating system from idling to sleep or from responding to sleep requests by users—was {{a significant source of}} power transition failures in previous versions of Windows and often resulted in decreased battery life, overheated systems, potential data loss, and an eventual user distrust of power-saving capabilities. During the development of Windows Vista, Microsoft indicated that it would allow the sleep process to be vetoed in the operating system, but subsequent investigations by the company revealed that this capability was frequently abused by application developers. However, administrators can still enable veto functionality through group policy.|$|E

We apply our model to a case study at a public organization in Qatar, and find that we can improve the availability-to-cost ratio by reducing the redundancy level and increasing the spare part inventories.

Furthermore, the SP technique takes the circuit's routing complexity into consideration which is critical for Deep Sub-Micron (DSM) implementations.
