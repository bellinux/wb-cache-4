5000|$|Mad C {{also works}} with <b>spray</b> <b>paints</b> on canvas. At her first solo gallery in 2015, Night and Day, she showcased {{works such as}} “Nineteen Nineteen” and “Twenty One Zero Six”. These works had either a black or white base (symbolic of her night and day work {{required}} of her for tagging), and investigated “the relationship between overlapping colors, light, glass and calligraphic movement”. For her canvases she is transferring her philosophy of connecting single parts to one piece - background, foreground, lines and shapes. To create those works, MadC uses <b>spray</b> <b>paint,</b> transparent <b>spray</b> <b>paint,</b> ink, watercolor, acrylic paint and acrylic markers. She is painting on canvas as well as carton from <b>spray</b> <b>paint</b> boxes. http://www.graffitiprints.com/artist/madc/ ...|$|R
25|$|The term taking The Rock {{refers to}} adding a {{completely}} new coat of paint whereas tagging is just <b>spray</b> <b>painting</b> marks on top of someone else's paint, typically to add {{the names of the}} painters or insults to the current holder of The Rock.|$|E
25|$|Motion control – {{for some}} applications, such as simple {{pick-and-place}} assembly, the robot need merely return repeatably {{to a limited}} number of pre-taught positions. For more sophisticated applications, such as welding and finishing (<b>spray</b> <b>painting),</b> motion must be continuously controlled to follow a path in space, with controlled orientation and velocity.|$|E
25|$|Power source – some robots use {{electric}} motors, {{others use}} hydraulic actuators. The former are faster, {{the latter are}} stronger and advantageous in applications such as <b>spray</b> <b>painting,</b> where a spark could set off an explosion; however, low internal air-pressurisation of the arm can prevent ingress of flammable vapours {{as well as other}} contaminants.|$|E

50|$|Smrt's {{most notable}} {{invention}} is the upside-down aerosol <b>spray</b> <b>paint</b> can: {{a can of}} <b>spray</b> <b>paint</b> {{that can be applied}} while holding the can upside down (which is impossible with typical <b>spray</b> <b>paint</b> cans). This is widely used in municipal and highway applications for outlining parking lots, turn lanes, center lines, crosswalks, etc. They are also commonly used for painting hashmarks and lines on athletic fields. His patents date back to 1977 and include paint application devices, vacuum sealed packing materials, geodesic domes, and mechanical arms.|$|R

25|$|Travellers in the US {{are said}} to speak English and Shelta, a form of Cant. The Cant spoken in the US {{is similar to the}} Cant spoken in Ireland, but differs in some respects in that the {{language}} has transformed into a type of pidgin English over the generations. They typically work in asphalting, <b>spray</b> <b>painting,</b> laying linoleum, or as itinerant workers to earn their living.|$|E
25|$|Aerosol paint, {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button. A form of <b>spray</b> <b>painting,</b> aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented aerosol paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides. The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a spray head.|$|E
25|$|Today {{extensive}} automation {{is practiced}} in practically {{every type of}} manufacturing and assembly process. Some of the larger processes include electrical power generation, oil refining, chemicals, steel mills, plastics, cement plants, fertilizer plants, pulp and paper mills, automobile and truck assembly, aircraft production, glass manufacturing, natural gas separation plants, food and beverage processing, canning and bottling and manufacture of various kinds of parts. Robots are especially useful in hazardous applications like automobile <b>spray</b> <b>painting.</b> Robots are also used to assemble electronic circuit boards. Automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines.|$|E

25|$|According to the Jerusalem Talmud's definition, {{the use of}} the Venturi tube {{spray system}} and <b>spray</b> <b>painting</b> would come under this prohibition, while butane or propane {{propelled}} sprays, which are common in deodorants and air fresheners, etc. are permissible to operate as the dispersal force generated isn't from air, rather from the propellent within the can. According to the Babylonian Talmud's definition, neither of the above spraying methods is involved in sorting undesirable from desirable and therefore not part of this heading. However, as mentioned, the Rema rules that, unusually, the Jerusalem Talmud's definition is the applicable one.|$|E
25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War (1980–88), Iraq {{developed}} its {{chemical weapons}} {{program with the}} help of Europeans countries (such as Germany and France), and used them large-scale against Iranians as well as against Iraqi Kurd. Iran was unprepared for chemical warfare. In 1984, Iran received gas masks from the Republic of Korea and East Germany, but the Korean masks were not suited for the faces of non-East Asian people and the filter only lasted for 15 minutes, and the 5,000 masks bought from East Germany proved to be not gas masks but <b>spray</b> <b>painting</b> goggles. As late as 1986, Iranian diplomats still traveled in Europe to buy active charcoal and models of filters in order to produce defensive gear domestically. In April 1988, Iran started domestic production of gas masks by the Iran Yasa factories.|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly few artists {{used the}} spray gun {{technique}} to create large expanses and fields of color sprayed across their canvases during the 1960s and 1970s. Some painters who effectively used <b>spray</b> <b>painting</b> techniques include Jules Olitski, {{who was a}} pioneer in his spray technique that covered his large paintings with layer after layer of different colors, often gradually changing hue and value in subtle progression. Another important innovation was Dan Christensen's use of a spray technique to great effect in loops and ribbons of bright color; sprayed in clear, calligraphic marks across his large-scale paintings. William Pettet, Richard Saba, and Albert Stadler, used the technique to create large-scale fields of multi-colors; while Kenneth Showell sprayed over crumpled canvases and created an illusion of abstract still-life interiors. Most of the spray painters were active especially during the late 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

The painting was cleaned days later. The Armenian state service for protection of historical and cultural reserves filed a civil lawsuit against Nikitenko in February 2015, in which the agency requested 839,390 AMD (~$1,760) to recover the damage resulting from vandalism. In an April 2015 decision the Kotayk Province court ruled to take Nikitenko into custody for 2 months and fine him the requested amount.|$|E

500|$|The boys readily {{admit to}} the <b>spray</b> <b>painting,</b> {{and explain to}} the city council that the word [...] "fag" [...] is not {{intended}} as an insult to homosexuals, and is being used only in reference to a contemptible person who rides a Harley motorcycle, or [...] "an inconsiderate douchebag", as Stan puts it. They call upon the council to formally recognize this new usage. Support from the town, including the local gay community (who realize that the boys weren't intending to insult them, but in fact, the bikers), results in a town ordinance declaring {{a change in the}} word's definition. This action leads to negative publicity {{from the rest of the}} nation, and further angers the displaced bikers who refuse to be labeled as [...] "fags" [...] (one rider even assaulted a news reporter for calling him fag to his face three times). They look up the word in the dictionary and learn its definition has adapted over the years: it previously meant [...] "an unpleasant old woman" [...] and a bundle of sticks.|$|E
