5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the <b>situation</b> <b>with</b> many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E

5|$|Another treaty dealing {{the matters}} of the {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended the decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark. Per the terms of this treaty, Norway relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula. However, the treaty {{did not address the}} <b>situation</b> <b>with</b> the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, Sands {{had become}} {{impatient}} with the Navy's bureaucracy. After discussing the <b>situation</b> <b>with</b> Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|By then, SAS {{had taken}} sixteen {{aircraft}} out of service, reduced production with 12% and fired 1,000 employees. The airline {{stated that they}} wished to renegotiate the agreement with the Braathens family and KLM to reduce the price. Because there had arrisen a <b>situation</b> <b>with</b> high over-capacity of aircraft, the value of planes had fallen. In addition, SAS demanded that Braathens reduce its fleet from 33 to 23 aircraft if the deal was to go through, threatening to terminate the purchase if the airline did not abide.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} years of the war, the tide was in favour of the regency, until, in the summer of 1342, Kantakouzenos was forced to flee to the court of Stefan Dušan of Serbia. However, from 1343 onwards, with the aid of his friend, Umur Beg of Aydin, Kantakouzenos began to reverse the <b>situation.</b> <b>With</b> the initial support of Stefan Dušan, Kantakouzenos regained much of Macedonia, and despite his failure to take Thessalonica, his Turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of Didymoteicho in Thrace. Gradually, Apokaukos's {{supporters}} abandoned him, including his son Manuel, who deserted his post at Adrianople and went over to the Kantakouzenos camp.|$|E
5|$|In the season's {{penultimate}} game, Maryland lost to Penn State, 48–0. Penn State halfback Lydell Mitchell {{had been}} recruited by Lester and {{originally intended to}} go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead. Lester was bothered by a similar <b>situation</b> <b>with</b> fullback Franco Harris, whose high school coach {{was a friend of}} Lester's. Lester attributed Maryland's football woes to the turnover at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings. Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3–7 record.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyze <b>situations</b> <b>with</b> discursive interactions in math classrooms, which may prompt student's understanding of teacher's speech. To analyze the <b>situations</b> <b>with</b> discursive interactions, this study used elements from Bakhtin's theory of language, mainly its concept of comprehension, and introduces the new concept of intermediate comprehension. The data used in a qualitative approach were collected from class observation through video-recorded lessons. The results showed three <b>situations</b> <b>with</b> discursive interactions that contribute to understanding of the school teacher's speech: 1) speech referring to everyday situations; 2) the teacher's speech math in a less rigorous way 3) teacher comparing different mathematical objects...|$|R
5|$|Longstreet {{made one}} final attempt {{to call off}} the assault. After his {{encounter}} with Pickett, he discussed the artillery <b>situation</b> <b>with</b> Porter and was informed that Porter did not have full confidence that all the enemy's guns were silenced and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted. Longstreet ordered Porter to stop Pickett, but the young colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear would take over an hour, and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them. The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a <b>situation</b> <b>with</b> no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes faced {{competition}} for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and Lord Gifford, two London financiers. They appointed as their agent Edward Arthur Maund, who had served with Sir Charles Warren in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885, {{towards the end of}} this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the <b>situation</b> <b>with</b> his own eyes. He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to Lord Knutsford, the British Colonial Secretary, seeking his approval for their designs.|$|E

5|$|The young King {{inherited}} a difficult <b>situation,</b> <b>with</b> {{over half of}} England occupied by the rebels {{and most of his}} father's continental possessions still in French hands. He had substantial support from Guala who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels. Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, where Henry gave homage to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord. Pope Honorius declared that Henry was the Pope's vassal and ward, and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom. As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a crusader and so entitled to special protection from Rome.|$|E

40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} in which situations teachers (would) investigate whether a student was lying or {{telling the truth}} and how these situations were perceived. Results of Study 1 indicate that teachers (would) interview students when it comes to use of unfair means, aggressive behavior, theft, absence without permission, bullying, and vandalism, whereat deceitful <b>situations</b> <b>with</b> rather light consequences were most frequently described. Moreover, participants perceived the frequency of occurrence of all situations as lower for themselves compared to colleagues. In both studies, the use of unfair means, absence without permission, and bullying (over a longer period) were rated as most frequently occurring in everyday school life. Further, deception detection was perceived as being mostly important in <b>situations</b> <b>with</b> severe consequences. Study 2 also demonstrates that <b>situations</b> <b>with</b> light consequences are perceived as situations where it is of relatively less importance to make accurate judgments, avoid wrongful accusation, and detect misbehavior, as compared <b>with</b> <b>situations</b> <b>with</b> severe consequences. Overall, teachers perceive avoiding wrong accusation as more important than detecting misbehavior. Influences of teachers’ perceptions on their behavior are discussed...|$|R
