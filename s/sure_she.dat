60|$|Rho. No; none of these: I'm <b>sure</b> <b>she's</b> young; and, for her humour, she laughs, sings, {{and dances}} eternally; and, which is more, we never quarrel about it, for I do the same.|$|R

25|$|There were no {{sports teams}} for girls {{when she was}} in high school, but she played a number of sports {{including}} basketball, in rec leagues and pickup.

To help make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> would be chosen, she bought the best basketball she could afford, so if the boys wanted to play with her basketball, they would have to pick her.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Stephen Kay, {{who had worked}} for the {{prosecution}} in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole.

Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of the early life of Agnes Salm-Salm. Many {{scholars}} believe that she worked in a circus, then as an actress in Cuba. In 1861 {{she returned to the}} United States but soon left her home in Vermont to visit her sister in Washington, D.C. who was getting married. Agnes stayed around Washington when she met Prince Felix Salm-Salm, a soldier of fortune, and a distant relation to the Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. She had been riding her horse one morning through the city when Felix first saw her and he made <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> was invited to a party that he would be attending. Soon Felix proposed to her and they were married in August 30, 1862, despite opposition from her family (he was Catholic and she was Protestant).|$|E
25|$|When Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting {{their new}} {{television}} sitcom I Love Lucy in 1951, director Marc Daniels, {{who had previously}} worked with Vance in a theater production, suggested her {{for the role of}} landlady Ethel Mertz. Lucille Ball had wanted either Bea Benaderet or Barbara Pepper, both close friends, to play the role. CBS refused Pepper on the grounds that she had a drinking problem, and Benaderet was already playing Blanche Morton on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. Arnaz then began searching for another actress and Daniels took him and producer Jess Oppenheimer to the La Jolla Playhouse to see Vance in the John Van Druten play The Voice of the Turtle. Watching her perform, Arnaz was convinced he had found the ideal actress to play Ethel Mertz. Ball was less <b>sure.</b> <b>She</b> had envisioned Ethel to be much older and less attractive; Vance was closer to Ball's age and attractive. Also, Ball, firmly entrenched in film and radio, had never heard of Vance, who was primarily a theater actress.|$|E
25|$|The San Francisco Bay Area Reporter, Inc., a free weekly {{newspaper}} serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) {{communities in the}} area, {{were one of the}} first to comment on their discontent with the matter:We have repeatedly voiced our displeasure over the transgender/lesbian storyline between Zarf/Zoe and Bianca. We disagree with the basic premise, Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman (and she did have a one-night stand with Leslie on New Year’s Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We don’t want her already messy love life in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasn’t <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> was even queer and then left her for another woman). We don’t want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.|$|E
