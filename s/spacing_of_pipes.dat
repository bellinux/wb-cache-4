40|$|Piped {{water is}} used to remove {{hydration}} heat from concrete dams during construction. By examining simple models we obtain an estimate for the temperature rise along the pipe network and within the concrete. To leading order, for practically useful networks, the temperature distribution is quasi-steady, so that exact analytic solutions are obtained. The temperature in the water increases linearly with distance along the pipe and varies logarithmically with radial distance from the pipe in the concrete. Using these results we obtained estimates for the optimal <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> and pipe length. Some preliminary work on optimal network design has been done. This is work in progress...|$|E

Studies were conducted on scaled down physical models having three layers of Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) pipes, wave steepness Hi/gT 2 varying from 0. 063 to 0. 849, relative width W/L varying from 0. 4 to 2. 65 and relative spacing S/D= 2 (S=horizontal centre-to-centre <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> D=diameter of pipes).

40|$|Personalization customizes {{information}} access. The PIPE ("Personalization is Partial Evaluation") modeling methodology represents {{interaction with}} an information space as a program. The program is then specialized to a user's known interests or information seeking activity by {{the technique of}} partial evaluation. In this paper, we elaborate PIPE by considering requirements analysis in the personalization lifecycle. We investigate the use of scenarios {{as a means of}} identifying and analyzing personalization requirements. As our first result, we show how designing a PIPE representation can be cast as a search within a <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>PIPE</b> models, organized along a partial order. This allows us to view the design of a personalization system, itself, as specialized interpretation <b>of</b> an information <b>space.</b> We then exploit the underlying equivalence of explanation-based generalization (EBG) and partial evaluation to realize high-level goals and needs identified in scenarios; in particular, we specialize (personalize) an information space based on the explanation of a user scenario in that information space, just as EBG specializes a theory based on the explanation of an example in that theory. In this approach, personalization becomes the transformation <b>of</b> information <b>spaces</b> to support the explanation of usage scenarios. An example application is described...|$|R

The study gives {{the analysis and}} the optimization <b>of</b> the <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pipes,</b> thickness <b>of</b> the plates, and diameters <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> for one type of material; galvanized iron. In the analysis, both material price and manufacturing processes are considered. The useful energy collection from the flat-plate collector per price of the absorber-plate is taken into account during the optimization process. The new absorber-plate is manufactured using hot-dip galvanization of iron and point welding. The absorber plate’s efficiency and price are determined together with those of three commercially available collectors manufactured in Turkey, absorber-plates of which {{are made up of}} aluminum and copper (ISTEK Aluminum and Copper, DAGSAN-Copper). For ISTEK’s aluminum collector, the intercept of the efficiency curve is 0. 90, for ISTEK’s copper collector, it is 0. 66. For DAGSAN’s copper the intercept is 0. 81, and for the collector that has galvanized iron absorber-plate it is 0. 82, which is increased to 0. 83 after new optimization. The price of the manufactured absorber-plate is $ 23. After new optimization the price is increased to $ 25. The cost of ISTEK’s aluminum collector it is $ 53, for ISTEK’s copper collector is $ 32, and for DAGSAN’s copper collector is $ 53. Time constants of the tested collectors ar...|$|R

Bypass {{pneumatic conveying}} systems also provide a passive capability to reduce minimum particulate transport velocities.

40|$|Ground source {{heat storage}} can {{condition}} buildings with reduced consumption of fossil fuels, {{an important issue}} in modem building design. However, seasonal heat storage can cause soil temperature fluctuations and possibly deformation of soft clays. This thesis evaluates the thermo-mechanical response of soft clays to seasonal heat storage and associated temperature fluctuations. A literature review reveals that, in normally consolidated to lightly overconsolidated clays, increases in soil temperature can lead to significant plastic strains {{and a reduction in}} soil strength. This behavior can be modeled through constitutive formulations that include thermal strain within the elasto-plastic framework of the well-known Modified Cam-Clay Model. The current research uses the MCC Picard (1994) model to study the ground response to a buried heat exchange <b>pipe.</b> The <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pipe</b> was found to govern the effectiveness of ground heat storage. With only one pipe in semi-infinite soil, heat transfer to the ground dissipates quickly and thermal-mechanical interaction is negligible; however, seasonal heat storage is not possible. Closely spaced heat pipes would permit effective seasonal heat storage, but could undergo significant thermally induced consolidation deformations. by Shoshanna Dawn Saxe. Thesis (S. M.)
