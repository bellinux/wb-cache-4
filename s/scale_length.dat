25|$|It {{has a wide}} range, thus its {{implementation}} can be difficult. The high B4 requires a taut, thin string, and consequently is prone to breaking. This can be ameliorated by using a shorter <b>scale</b> <b>length</b> guitar, by shifting to a different key, or by shifting down a fifth.

25|$|The shorter-necked, tenor banjo, with 17 ("short scale") or 19 frets, is also {{typically}} {{played with}} a plectrum. It became a popular instrument after about 1910. Early models used for melodic picking typically had 17 frets on the neck and a <b>scale</b> <b>length</b> of 19½ to 21½inches. By the mid-1920s, when the instrument was used primarily for strummed chordal accompaniment, 19-fret necks with a <b>scale</b> <b>length</b> of 21¾ to 23inches became standard. The usual tuning is the all-fifths tuning C3 G3 D4 A4, {{in which there are}} exactly seven semitones (a perfect fifth) between the open notes of consecutive strings. Other players (particularly in Irish traditional music) tune the banjo G2 D3 A3 E4 like an octave mandolin, which lets the banjoist duplicate fiddle and mandolin fingering. The popularisation of this tuning was usually attributed to the late Barney McKenna, banjoist with The Dubliners. Fingerstyle on tenor banjo retuned to open G tuning dgd'g' or lower open D tuning Adad' (three finger picking, frailing) have been explored by Mirek Patek.|$|E

25|$|The bass guitar is a {{stringed}} instrument played primarily with the fingers or thumb (either by plucking, slapping, popping, tapping, or thumping), or {{by using a}} plectrum. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and <b>scale</b> <b>length,</b> and four, five, or six strings. In 1936, the Audiovox bass, the earliest electric solidbody bass guitar made out of walnut and neck-through construction, was invented by Paul Tutmarc of Seattle, Washington. Later in 1951, the bass guitar was perfected when Leo Fender introduced the precision bass, a fretted, solidbody instrument.|$|E
25|$|The {{differences}} between the two models are the <b>scale</b> <b>length</b> (445mm of free string length in Lisboa guitars and 470mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model. Visually and most distinctively, the Lisboa model can easily be differentiated from the Coimbra model by its larger soundboard and the scroll ornament that usually adorns the tuning machine, in place of Coimbra's teardrop-shaped motif. Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between the both of them falls upon each player's preferences.|$|E

40|$|The {{anisotropy}} of heterogeneity <b>scale</b> <b>lengths</b> in {{the lower}} mantle is investigated by modelling its eVect on the high-frequency precursors of PKIKP scattered by the heterogeneities. Although models having either an isotropic or an anisotropic distri-bution of <b>scale</b> <b>lengths</b> can fit the observed coda shapes of short-period precursors, the frequency content of broad-band PKIKP precursors favours a dominantly isotropic distribution of <b>scale</b> <b>lengths.</b> Precursor coda shapes are consistent with 1 per cent fluctuations in P velocity in the wavenumber band 0. 05 – 0. 5 km− 1 extending to 1000 km above the core–mantle boundary, and with a D ◊ region open to circulation throughout the lower mantle. The level of excitation of PKIKP precursors observed in the frequency band 0. 02 – 2 Hz requires a power spectrum of heterogeneity that is nearly white or slowly increasing with wavenumber. Anisotropy of <b>scale</b> <b>lengths</b> may exist in a D◊ layer having larger horizontal than vertical <b>scale</b> <b>lengths</b> and produce little or no detectable eVects on PKIKP precursors for P-velocity perturbations as high as 3 per cent when averaged over a vertical scale of several kilometres, and much higher when averaged over scales of hundreds of metres or less...|$|R

40|$|Due to its {{exceptional}} brightness, comet Hale-Bopp {{offered the}} possibility for unprecedented long-term monitoring. Medium resolution long-slit spectroscopic data and images were obtained using the Danish Faint Object Spectrograph (DFOSC) at the 1. 54 m Danish telescope and the Boller and Chivens spectrograph at the 1. 52 m ESO telescope, La Silla, Chile. Pre-perihelion, comet Hale-Bopp was monitored from 4. 6 AU to 2. 9 AU and post-perihelion, the monitoring yields data from 3 AU up to a heliocentric distance of 5 AU. Production rates are often derived by using a simple Haser model to approximate the coma density distribution. This requires knowledge of the destruction <b>scale</b> <b>lengths</b> of the observed daughter species and its parents. As the brightness of most comets diminishes quickly with heliocentric distance, <b>scale</b> <b>lengths</b> have been determined only in comets around 1 AU.

40|$|When a {{supersonic}} flow encounters an obstacles, shocks form {{to divert the}} flow around the obstacle. The region between the shock and the obstacle is the sheath, where the {{supersonic flow}} is compressed, heated, decelerated, and deflected. Supersonic flows, obstacles, and thus sheaths are observed on many scales throughout the Universe. We compare three examples seen in the heliosphere, illustrating {{the interaction of the}} solar wind with obstacles of three very different <b>scales</b> <b>lengths.</b> Magnetosheaths form behind planetary bow shocks on scales ranging from tens to 100 planetary radii. ICME sheath form behind shocks driven by solar disturbances on <b>scale</b> <b>lengths</b> of a few to tens of AU. The heliosheath forms behind the termination shock due to the obstacle presented by the interstellar medium on <b>scale</b> <b>lengths</b> of tens to a hundred AU.

Plasma depletion layers are observed in planetary and ICME sheaths. Other features observed in some sheaths are wave activity (ion cyclotron, plasma), energetic particles, transmission of Alfven waves/shocks, tangential discontinuities turbulence behind quasi-parallel shocks, standing slow mode waves, and reconnection on the obstacle boundary.

40|$|Abstract—A scaling {{theory of}} double-gate {{interband}} tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) using a physics-based 2 -D ana-lytical model is presented. Ignoring the mobile {{charge in the}} channel, the electrostatic potential profile and electric field are analytically solved, and the current is calculated by integrating the band-to-band tunneling generation rate over {{the volume of the}} device. The analytical model has excellent agreement with the numerical results obtained from a commercial simulator and atomistic nonequilibrium Green function simulations for both heterojunction and homojunction TFETs. The analytical model allows us to quantitatively extract the electrostatic <b>scaling</b> <b>lengths</b> in TFETs and compare the short-channel effect of TFETs with that of MOSFETs. We conclude that double-gate TFETs exhibit superior short-channel performance than their MOSFETs coun-terparts at a longer gate length (greater than four times the <b>scaling</b> <b>length),</b> but the scalability of the TFETs degrades at a faster rate than MOSFETs do at smaller gate lengths (less than four times the <b>scaling</b> <b>length).</b> Index Terms—Analytical model, drain-induced barrier lower-ing (DIBL), drain-induced barrier thinning (DIBT), scalability, short-channel effect, tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET).
