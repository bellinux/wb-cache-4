40|$|Abstract—Social media {{increases}} the connectivity of people {{inside and outside}} an organisation. It {{is not just the}} implementa-tion of communication technology, but the transformation of working and organisational cultures. The paper presumes that social media provides new opportunities to the organisational knowledge creation process by amplifying knowledge created by individuals as well as crystallising and connecting it to an or-ganisation’s knowledge system. The process depends fundamen-tally on the individual’s tacit knowledge and its conversion into organisational explicit knowledge. Knowledge conversion is not a linear and sequential process, but a process which is affected by the individual’s emotions. This paper explores the interplay between knowledge and emotions in the organisational knowl-edge creation process in the context of social media. The paper concludes that knowledge and emotion <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media</b> contribute to the social identity, which {{increases the}} odds of al-truistic behaviour towards others in a way that benefits the or-ganisation.

This paper presents a comparative analysis covering a span of 17 months and hun-dreds of news events, using a method that combines auto-matic and manual annotations. We focus on climate change, a topic that is frequently present in the news through a number of arguments, from current practices and causes (e. g. frack-ing, CO 2 emissions) to consequences and solutions (e. g. ex-treme weather, electric cars). The coverage that these dif-ferent aspects receive is often dependent on how they are framed—typically by mainstream media. Yet, evidence sug-gests an existing gap between what the news media pub-lishes online and what the general public <b>shares</b> <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media.</b> Through the analysis of a series of events, including awareness campaigns, natural disasters, governmental meet-ings and publications, among others, we uncover differences in terms of the triggers, actions, and news values that are prevalent in both types of media.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we want to}} {{know how}} knowledge, {{available}} and <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media</b> networks (like Twitter, Facebook, Hyves, blogs, wickis etc,) does influence processes of risk definition in policy-making processes regarding ‘wicked problems’ and how this can be explained? Little is known about how policy relevant knowledge in social media based networks is created and shared and how it influences the shaping of public policy processes. The research strategy in this paper involves a comparative case study. The following two Dutch cases could be relevant: the vaccination against uterus cancer and the vaccination against the Mexican swine flu. In both cases, the RIVM (Dutch research institute for public health) played a major role. Based on the two case studies, the most important conclusion is that knowledge, produced in social networks, had no influence on processes of risk definition in policy-making processes. Three explanations are given. First, the factor time plays an important role. In 2009, social networks were less prominent than in 2011 (Lievrouw, 2011). Second, an institutional approach can explain why policymakers of the RIVM ignored knowledge, produced in social networks (March & Olsen, 1989). Finally, from a strategic point of view, the RIVM may have chosen not to pay attention to knowledge, produced in social networks (Lindblom, 1959) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an ethnography {{conducted with}} the Los Angeles-based community arts organization called Machine Project. Operating both a storefront gallery in Echo Park and as a loose association of contemporary artists, performers, curators, and designers, Machine Project seeks to make "rarefied knowledge accessible" through workshops, site-specific installations and performances, lectures, and various participatory projects. Machine Project exists as but one instantiation of a larger movement in contemporary art around "alternative spaces," or organizations and projects that resist and/or refigure the discursive structures imposed on art by institutions of cultural heritage and the art market. Alternative and artist-run spaces often operate with a Do-It-Yourself and independent ethos, and are often sustained by its communities of artists and the publics that support them. Many of the efforts of alternative spaces are process-based operations, whether as an exhibition space for experimental forms of contemporary art, forums and workshops {{on a range of}} topics, performances, participatory projects, among others. Records created about the events, programs, and operations of these alternative spaces are often elusive, if created at all. Historically, alternative and artist-run spaces have been invested in community building, the public circulation of aesthetic knowledge, the exposing of museums and other institutions of cultural heritage as discursive frames, and public participation. How does documentation serve to support such orientations? If an alternative or artist-run space describes its operations in terms of values like community participation and relational aesthetics, how might such values be folded into the production, circulation, and preservation of its records?This dissertation is comprised of two primary sections. The first section includes a critical review of the archival science literature, identifying fundamental concepts of archival theory and practice that are directly relevant to the research questions, such as the principle of provenance, evidence, and records creation. This section also includes a chapter devoted to describing and assessing ethnography as a methodological approach for archival research, drawing in insights culled from social systems theory and information theory. The second section of the dissertation is comprised of observations and reflections on Machine Project and its documentation practices at three levels of analysis. The first level explores documentation issues that emerge out of the organization's collaborations with arts institutions. The second level adopts a finer-grained view and looks at collaborative relationships between artists affiliated with Machine Project. The third level looks to notions of community as they are expressed in a selection of Machine Project's events and programs, and analyzes the documentation produced by audiences and <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media</b> spaces. The dissertation concludes with reading of Machine Project's documentation practices through the theoretical lens of the records continuum, which forms the basis for a critique of the records continuum and the burgeoning area of research on community archiving. Following this critique, the dissertation then presents a series of recommendations for future research and describes the metaphorical figure of the "itinerant archivist" as a conceptual intervention and strategy for self-reflection among archival scholars and practitioners...|$|E
5000|$|Corporate blogs may {{be written}} {{primarily}} for consumers (business-to-consumer) or primarily for other businesses (B2B). Certain corporate blogs {{have a very}} high number of subscribers. The official Google Blog is currently in the Technorati top 50 listing among all blogs worldwide. The number of subscribers, blog comments, links to blog posts, and the number of times a post is <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> other <b>social</b> <b>media</b> are indicators of a blog's popularity, potential influence, and reach. While business blogs targeted to consumer readers may have a high number of subscribers, comments, and other measures of engagement; corporate blogs targeted to other businesses, especially those in niche industries, may have a very limited number of subscribers, comments, links, and sharing via <b>social</b> <b>media.</b> Accordingly, other metrics are often evaluated to determine the success and effectiveness of B2B blogs ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Researchers {{debate whether}} tacit {{knowledge}} sharing through Information Technology (IT) is actually possible. However, {{with the advent}} of social web tools, {{it has been argued that}} most shortcomings of tacit knowledge sharing are likely to disappear. This paper has two purposes: firstly, to demonstrate the existing debates in the literature regarding tacit knowledge sharing using IT, and secondly, to identify key research gaps that lay the foundations for future research into tacit knowledge sharing using social web. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews current literature on IT-mediated tacit knowledge sharing and opens a discussion on tacit knowledge sharing through the use of social web. Findings - First, the existing schools of thoughts in regards to IT ability for tacit knowledge sharing are introduced. Next, difficulties of sharing tacit knowledge through the use of IT are discussed. Then, potentials and pitfalls of social web tools are presented. Finally, the paper concludes that whilst there are significant theoretical arguments supporting that the social web facilitates tacit knowledge sharing there is a lack of empirical evidence to support these arguments and further work is required. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of the review includes: covering only papers that were published in English, issues of access to full texts of some resources, possibility of missing some resources due to search strings used or limited coverage of databases searched. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the fast growing literature on the intersection of KM and IT particularly by focusing on tacit knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media</b> space. The paper highlights the need for further studies in this area by discussing the current situation in the literature and disclosing the emerging questions and gaps for future studies...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to measure successful knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> general. However, limited study {{has been done to}} assess successful knowledge <b>sharing</b> through <b>social</b> <b>media.</b> Hence, <b>in</b> this paper intend to discuss our approach to assess knowledge sharing among personal <b>social</b> <b>media</b> user. <b>In</b> order to achieve our objective, we proposed to integrate Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Markov Chain (MC) technique to investigate the pattern of the shared knowledge through <b>social</b> <b>media.</b> Markov Chain will be used to model the knowledge sharing success through expert opinion and stochastic process. We anticipate the outcome of the assessment in a form of a final matrix showing the probability of successful knowledge sharing through <b>social</b> <b>media.</b> The elements <b>in</b> each row of the Markov Chain transition matrix will be calculated using Analytic Hierarchy Process. The assessment tool produce from our research is expected to benefit policy maker or internet user in order to enhance their knowledge <b>sharing</b> strategy <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media</b> application...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the perception of informational professionals’ knowledge <b>sharing</b> practices <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>media</b> platforms. The specific objectives of the study included learning professionals’ perceptions and awareness of knowledge sharing using <b>social</b> <b>media,</b> understanding their opinions and beliefs, and gaining familiarity with and reasons for using these tools. Open & close ended web-based questions were sent out by email to the international training program (ITP) participants. Findings indicated that most of the respondents’ were aware of using <b>social</b> <b>media</b> and that they used <b>social</b> <b>media</b> for knowledge sharing. Speed and ease of use, managing personal knowledge, easier communication with users and colleagues and powerful communication tool are the areas that motivated them to use it. It also stated some barriers like lack of support, familiarity, trust, unfiltered information and fear of providing information. The study was limited to the perceptual aspect of the issue, specifically from the individuals’ opinions and sentiments...|$|R
40|$|From selfies and memes to hashtags and parodies, <b>social</b> <b>media</b> {{are used}} for mundane and {{personal}} expressions of political commentary, engagement, and participation. The coverage of politics reflects the social mediation of everyday life, where individual experiences and thoughts are documented and <b>shared</b> online. <b>In</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> and Everyday Politics, Tim Highfield examines political talk as everyday occurrences on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, Tumblr, Instagram, and more. He considers the personal and the political, the serious and the silly, and the everyday within the extraordinary, as politics arises from seemingly banal and irreverent topics. The analysis features international examples and evolving practices, from French blogs to Vines from Australia, via the Arab Spring, Occupy, #jesuischarlie, Eurovision, #blacklivesmatter, Everyday Sexism, and #illridewithyou. This timely book will be a valuable resource for students and scholars in media and communications, internet studies, and political science, as well as general readers keen to understand our contemporary media and political contexts...|$|R
