500|$|University of Florida {{historian}} David Colburn stated, [...] "There is {{a pattern}} of denial with the residents and their relatives about what took place, and in fact they <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> on several occasions they don't {{want to talk about}} it, they don't want to identify anyone involved, and there's also a tendency to say that those who were involved were from elsewhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|Current U.S. {{policy is}} not working, {{as the level of}} {{violence}} in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation. Making no changes in policy would simply delay the day of reckoning at a high cost. Nearly 100 Americans are dying every month. The United States is spending $2 billion a week. Our ability to respond to other international crises is constrained. A majority of the American people are soured on the war. This level of expense is not sustainable over an extended period, especially when progress is not being made. The longer the United States remains in Iraq without progress, the more resentment will grow among Iraqis who believe they are subjects of a repressive American occupation. As one U.S. official <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> [...] "Our leaving would make it worse. ... The current approach without modification will not make it better." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1980 {{fan club}} interview, Noddy Holder {{spoke of the}} success in Belgium: [...] "What {{happened}} in Belgium was that Return to Base was available on import, and it started to climb the import charts. I don't know why, it {{was as much a}} surprise to us as it was to anybody. Warner Bros. Records then <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> due to it starting to show some action, would we want to release it over there as a major release. We thought [...] "why not?" [...] – and now it's the number one album over there!" [...] Speaking of [...] "I'm a Rocker", Holder said: [...] "That was the track getting the most airplay from the album. But it's not just a case of that applying in Belgium – we've had so many people writing to us asking why we've not released it as a single. [...] "I'm a Rocker" [...] is not even one of our songs though – it's a Chuck Berry number." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornell {{said that}} [...] "Hands All Over" [...] {{is about how}} humans defile the environment, and that [...] "Full on Kevin's Mom" [...] is about [...] "a {{friend of mine who}} slept with another friend of mine's mom. The guy who did it <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> 'Yeah, full on Kevin's mom'." [...] The lyrics of [...] "I Awake" [...] were {{originally}} part of a note written by Yamamoto's then girlfriend Kate McDonald. In the late 1990s, an urban legend circulated on internet message boards which stated that Yamamoto, after writing the music, wrote some lyrics on the back side of McDonald's note. When Yamamoto gave the paper containing these lyrics to Cornell, Cornell looked at {{the wrong side of the}} sheet and believed McDonald's note was the lyrics to Yamamoto's song. There was less material on the album intended as humorous compared with Ultramega OK. However, the song [...] "Big Dumb Sex" [...] was written as a parody of glam metal bands, who often metaphorically addressed sexual intercourse in their lyrics. The song, with its many uses of [...] "fuck", was the reason the album gained a Parental Advisory sticker upon release.|$|E

2500|$|The families' lawyer, Des Collins, said: [...] "Prior to the trial, {{the council}} {{maintained}} that {{a thorough investigation}} had led it {{to the conclusion that}} there was no link between the reclamation work and the children's birth defects. It also maintained that had any convincing evidence been shown that the children had good claims then the council would have wanted to compensate them appropriately without going to trial. Today that link has been established and the evidence provided. The children now call upon the council to fulfil their pre-trial promises without delay." [...] Collins said of the legal battle: [...] "I've been made out to be a shyster and an ambulance-chaser. The council has stonewalled, obstructed and prevaricated all the way through this. They didn't need to. If they'd ever <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> 'Look, we're not admitting liability, but we'll co-operate with you to find out what really happened', I wouldn't have minded. Instead, they tried to shut us out and paint us as the baddies... They've tried at every turn to stop us getting at the truth. Now they claim they can't afford to pay. I'm not impressed." ...|$|E

[...] said Riegel of the [...] "grueling" [...] day. [...] "It was insane, in fact. [...] and I were on the set from 9 a.m. to like 7:30 at night, {{just the two of}} us." [...] Havins agreed and relayed, [...] "It was so intense to tape. It was a long, long day, a 12-hour tape day." [...] They were warned by All My Children executives that the episode would be [...] "especially" [...] demanding. [...] "I don't think they've ever handed that much material to just two actresses before, so they wanted us to be prepared," [...] said Riegel. [...] "It was the most dialogue I've ever had in my entire life. To the point where several weeks before they gave me the script, our producer, Julie , sat us down and <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> 'This is just so important.,'" [...] added Havins. [...] "And she turned to me and said, 'We're almost nervous because it's so much material. If it's too much, let us know.' It was that dialogue-heavy." ...|$|E
