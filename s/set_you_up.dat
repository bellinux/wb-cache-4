500|$|An {{unusually large}} amount of in-camera effects {{were used for the}} pilot in place of {{computer}} generated imagery, including [...] "upside-down day"; shots of Haller using his abilities, where multiple takes of debris were filmed in controlled camera movements and then overlayed on shots of Stevens acting on his own; a montage that appears as a single camera movement, pulling [...] "back in slow motion as we see David Haller’s childhood progress"; and a one-shot action sequence—actually filmed in two shots that were later connected with visual effects—that saw the camera mounted on a cable and run down a hill side. Hawley admitted {{that it would be a}} challenge for the series' other directors to maintain this quality of visuals with much less time to film each episode: Hawley had 21 days to film the pilot, but the subsequent episodes were only scheduled 8 days of filming each. Some of these shoots ultimately had to be extended to 10 or 11 days filming to meet Hawley's vision, which he said were [...] "not good calls to have but what are you going to do? It’s a huge show." [...] Keller felt that each episode in the season was noticeably different from the others, calling the series a uniquely [...] "director-driven show.
