5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a <b>single</b> <b>cable.</b> Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E
25|$|The mono design uses a <b>single</b> <b>cable</b> {{from its}} towers {{and is one}} of the lesser-used {{examples}} of the class.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{electronics}} helped too. Former analogue-based instrumentation {{was replaced}} by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization and operation. This was accompanied by the fieldbus revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a <b>single</b> <b>cable)</b> means of communicating between control systems and field level instrumentation, eliminating hard-wiring.|$|E

25|$|A {{cable car}} is superficially {{similar to a}} funicular, but differs from such a system in that its cars are not {{permanently}} attached to the cable and can stop independently, whereas a funicular has cars that are permanently attached to the propulsion cable, which is itself stopped and started. A cable car cannot climb as steep a grade as a funicular, but many more cars can be operated with a <b>single</b> <b>cable,</b> making it more flexible, and allowing a higher capacity. During the rush hour on San Francisco's Market Street Railway, a car would leave the terminal every 15 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The Navy deploys {{a rescue}} helicopter, but a {{combination}} of strong winds and stampeding guests cause the helicopter to crash, setting the helipad ablaze. Naval rescue teams attach a breeches buoy to an adjacent skyscraper and rescue a number of guests, including Patty Simmons, Duncan's daughter. Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the external scenic elevator allowing twelve people, including Mueller, the children, and a fireman one trip down, with the remaining eight being ladies chosen by lottery, including Roberts' girlfriend Susan. An explosion leaves the elevator hanging by a <b>single</b> <b>cable,</b> where Mueller falls to her death. A Navy helicopter saves the rest.|$|E

Furthermore, the linear and nonlinear vibration analysis of <b>single</b> <b>cables</b> and cable structures are carried out by using the derived stiffness matrix.

25|$|In 1983, ABC sold KXYZ to the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. On January 4, 1984, The New York Times {{reported}} that ABC, through its subsidiary ABC Video Enterprises, had exercised its {{option to purchase}} up to 15% (or between $25 million and $30 million) of Getty Oil's shares in ESPN, which would allow it to expand its shares at a later date. In June 1984, ABC's executive committee approved the company's interest acquisition in ESPN, and ABC arranged with Getty Oil to obtain an 80% stake in the channel, while selling the remaining 20% to Nabisco. That year, ABC and Hearst reached an agreement with RCA to merge ARTS and competing arts service, The Entertainment Channel, into a <b>single</b> <b>cable</b> channel called Arts & Entertainment Television (A); the new channel subsequently leased a separate satellite transponder, ending its sharing agreement with Nickelodeon to become a 24-hour service. Meanwhile, ABC withdrew from the theme park business for good when it sold the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park.|$|E

50|$|Coax {{cable is}} often used to carry data/signals from an antenna to a receiver—from a {{satellite}} dish to a satellite receiver, from a television antenna to a television receiver, from a radio mast to a radio receiver, etc.In many cases, the same <b>single</b> coax <b>cable</b> carries power in the opposite direction, to the antenna, to power the low-noise amplifier.In some cases a <b>single</b> coax <b>cable</b> carries (unidirectional) power and bidirectional data/signals, as in DiSEqC.|$|R
2500|$|Lining was dangerous, as it {{was only}} the <b>single</b> <b>cable</b> that {{prevented}} the vessel from being washed downstream and likely wrecked. [...] Any use of a cable on board a vessel was also hazardous to the crew. [...] On October 15, 1907, at 8:30 am, while Oregona was lining through Clackamas Rapids, the lining cable became tangled in the sternwheel of a nearby steamer, the Ruth. [...] A deckhand on Oregona, Virgil K. Pollard, was caught in a loop of the cable, which tightened around his legs, severing both legs six inches (152mm) [...] above the ankles. [...] The injured deckhand brought a legal action against the Ruth. [...] When the case was presented to U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Bean, he ruled that accident was held to be the fault of the Ruth, for ignoring the warning signals of the Oregona to stand away while the deckhand was engaged in coiling the cable which was still paid out from the Oregona following an unsuccessful lining attempt. [...] Judge Bean awarded the deckhand, who was 19 years of age {{at the time of the}} accident, $12,000 in damages.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the other}} {{recommendations}} in the report was {{the introduction of the}} ring circuit system (often informally called a [...] "ring main"). [...] In this arrangement a cable connected to a fuse, or circuit breaker, in the distribution board was wired in sequence to a number of sockets before being terminated back at the distribution board, thus forming a ring final circuit. In the ring circuit, each socket-outlet was supplied with current by conductors {{on both sides of the}} 'loop.' This contrasts with the radial system (which is also used in the UK, often in the same installation) wherein a <b>single</b> <b>cable</b> runs out radially, like a spoke, from the distribution board to serve a number of sockets. [...] Since the fuse or circuit breaker for a ring circuit has to be rated for the maximum current the ring could carry (30A or 32A for a breaker), additional protection is required at each socket-plug connection. [...] Theoretically, such protection could have been designated either within the socket or within the plug. [...] However, to ensure that this protection has a rating matched to the appliance flexible cord fitted to the plug, a fuse rated between 1A and 13A is incorporated into each plug. Wired connections may also be connected to the ring, and these are also required to include a suitably rated fuse. The ring circuit in the UK requires the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets, but the BS1363 system is not limited to use with ring circuits.|$|E
