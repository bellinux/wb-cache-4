40|$|How do {{shortfalls}} in {{crude oil}} productioncaused by wars {{and other political}} events in the Middle East affect economic growth and infla-tion in major industrialized countries? Public dis-cussion of this question has been shaped by the eco-nomic experience of the 1970 s and early 1980 s. The conventional wisdom leaves little doubt that oil supply shocks abroad were {{to blame for the}} eco-nomic malaise of the 1970 s. This has led to the con-cern that history might repeat itself if a new oil sup-ply shock were to occur, say {{in the form of a}} cut-back of Iranian oil production and exports, as recently discussed in the media. Thus, understand-ing the effects of such politically motivated <b>short-falls</b> <b>in</b> crude oil <b>production</b> is more important than ever...|$|R
40|$|Inland {{and marine}} capture {{fisheries}} <b>productions</b> <b>in</b> Ghana have {{more or less}} stabilised. Moreover, the increasing population is always putting pressure on the demand for fish which capture and marine productions alone {{are not able to}} meet. The national demand for fish is always greater than the country can supply and the gap is widening year after year. However, fish is the most important animal protein in Ghana accounting for about 82 % of protein consumption. Moreover, the relatively cheaper price of fish compared to the other animal proteins means that the year-after-year <b>short-fall</b> <b>in</b> fish <b>production</b> will affect the protein in-take of the poorer segments of the society in the near future if nothing is done about it. For example according to Tradezone, even though the national fish demand for 2007 was 913, 992 tonnes, the country was able to supply only 511, 836. The development of aquaculture has been seen {{to be one of the}} best solutions to the problem. The positive side is that the geo-ecological climate of the country is generally favourable for aquaculture development. These include the vast water surfaces of the dug-outs, dams, lagoons, the Volta Lake (the largest man-made lake in the world) and other water bodies. Nonetheless, this vast potential has not been tapped due to number of bottlenecks such as the availability of quality feed among others. Following the results of my studies and work, I therefore propose that; 1. The local agricultural products and by-products should be tested scientifically in order to formulate cheap feed for aquaculture development. 2. Integrated Agriculture-Aquaculture (IAA) should be promoted and developed since it is resource and ecologically efficient and at the same time economically beneficial to farmers. 3. The agricultural extension officers should be trained in fish farming techniques so that that they can help advice farmers more especially on issues of integrated agriculture-aquaculture. 4. Women should be encouraged and motivated to enter into aquaculture and 5. Finally, the Aquaculture Development Committee (ADC) should assist farmers in the acquisition of soft loans and land which have been major stumbling blocks to the development of aquaculture...|$|R

50|$|The {{bank lending}} channel presumes that {{monetary}} policy changes will drain bank deposits {{so long as}} banks cannot easily replace the <b>short-fall</b> <b>in</b> deposits by issuing other uninsured liabilities. The abolition of reserve requirements on certificates of deposit in the mid-1980s made it much easier for banks facing falling retail deposits to issue new liabilities not backed by reserve requirements.

On the contrary, the fact that banks can raise funds through liabilities that pay market interest rates exposes banks to an external finance premium as well.

40|$|I {{study the}} link between real {{activity}} and deflation, taking into account measurement problems in 19 th century CPI data.

30|$|Timber {{extraction}} by {{final felling}} constitutes a major nutrient output from the system. The amount of nutrients accumulated in wood and bark at 19 years old is considered as an approximation {{of what is}} extracted in the final harvesting {{at the end of}} the rotation. Based on the models proposed by Fernández-Moya, Murillo et al. (2014), harvesting (bole and bark) of teak at age 19 from a stand with 150 trees ha- 1 would remove nutrients as shown in Table 3. Hence, nutrient export by timber extraction {{at the end of the}} rotation represents approximately half of the estimated nutrient accumulation of mature stands, varying between 23 and 73 %, depending on the element. Clearly, removing large amounts of nutrients through timber harvesting over several rotations could cause of nutrient depletion and soil degradation, and consequently cause a decrease in forest productivity. This scenario has also been reported by other authors (e.g. Rennie 1955; Miller 1984; Fölster and Khanna 1997; Worrel and Hampson 1997; Evans and Turnbull 2004; Evans 2009). Although the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) (2004) and several other authors (e.g. Rennie 1955; Worrel and Hampson 1997) recommend fertiliser application to sustain short-cycle plantation productivity, the need to evaluate the sustainability of the plantations in terms of nutrient cycling is still a voluntary requirement and perhaps this is a major <b>short-fall</b> <b>in</b> some socio-political instruments such as these certification schemes.|$|R

This trend has generated a new constellation of institutional challenges, for one apparent result of industrial sponsorship of university-based biomedical research is a threat to university governance as altered allegiances emerge and as the potential for financial gain appears almost limitless.

40|$|Abstract—The {{evaluation}} of the existing facilities maintenance management practices and processes in major public hospitals in Kenya has been studied. The study was established to determine how they managed {{the life cycle of}} the medical equipment. The results offered management the opportunity to appraise the overall maintenance program being made by the facilities maintenance management. It also sought improvement of efficiency and more effective utilization of available resources. A computer programme was developed to improve the status of the facility maintenance management in the major hospitals in Kenya. Interviews were used to obtain detailed information concerning the performance of the maintenance organizations. The structured interviews were carried out with key personnel of each organization categorized into three respondent groups, namely the hospital, consultant and contractor. Eight hospitals replied positively to the questionnaires. The results were analyzed and displayed in a histogram with assistance of a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SSPS) program. The challenges encountered in this research included hospital’s policy and technological resources. The completion of the study assisted the facilities maintenance management in the hospitals to determine its performance status and pin-point areas where there are <b>short-falls</b> <b>in</b> the organization’s service. The maintenance computer program was developed based on the results to improve the existing facilities maintenance management practice and processes in major hospitals in Kenya.

It acts as an alternative living arrangement, primarily for the elderly who need a safe and homely long-term residential based environment with 24 -hour care available. RCHJE provides lodging, meal services and assistance with daily living activities for the elderly people. The absence of common standards regarding the establishment and running of RCHJE in Malaysia sets a wide degree of difference between the qualities of care provided by the care homes. Reports reveal that RCHJE in Malaysia deliver poor quality of healthcare services and facilities and it is yet to achieve the level of satisfactory.

40|$|While {{the growing}} {{importance}} of off-farm earnings suggests large benefits accrue to farmers from efforts to expand off-farm income opportunities, survival still depends on greater efficiency. To comprehensively gauge the economic health of farm operator households we interpret off-farm income as an output along with corn, soybeans, livestock, and other crops. To accomplish this task we use two related methodologies. First, using 2000 data, we setup a multiactivity cost function to analyze labor allocation decisions within the farm operator household {{and also to}} estimate returns to scale and scope. Second, using 1996 - 2000 data, we follow an input distance function approach to estimate returns to scale, technical progress, cost economies, and technical efficiency [...] and compare the relative performance of farm operator households with and without off-farm wages and salaries. Our preliminary results suggest that over our sample period, scale economies are a primary factor driving up farm operator household size and decreasing the competitiveness of small farm operator households in the base farm operator household model where off-farm income is constrained to zero. But small farm operator households appear to achieve efficiency levels more comparable to larger farm operator households when off-farm income is accommodated. The evidence therefore suggests that while <b>short-falls</b> <b>in</b> these productivity components are decreasing the competitiveness of small farm operator households as agricultural structure changes, corn/soybean farm operator households have partially adapted to such pressures by increasing off-farm income and, therefore, achieving economies of scope.

40|$|Background In the UK, {{although}} 40 % {{of patients}} with lung cancer are diagnosed following an emergency admission (EA), data is limited on their needs and experiences as they progress through diagnostic and treatment pathways. Methods Prospective data collection using medical records, questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Multivariate logistic regression explored associations between diagnosis following EA and aspects of interest. Questionnaire responses with 95 % confidence intervals were compared with local and national datasets. A grounded theory approach identified patient and carer themes. Results Of 401 patients, 154 (38 %) were diagnosed following EA; 37 patients and six carers completed questionnaires and 13 patients and 10 carers were interviewed. Compared to those diagnosed electively, EA patients adjusted results found no difference in treatment recommendation, treatment intent or place of death. Time to diagnosis, review, or treatment was 7 - 14 days quicker but fewer EA patients had a lung cancer nurse present at diagnosis (37 % vs. 62 %). Palliative care needs were high (median [IQR] 21 [13 - 25] distressing or bothersome symptoms/issues) and various information and support needs unmet. Interviews highlighted in particular, perceived delays in obtaining investigations/specialist referral and factors influencing {{success or failure of}} the cough campaign.

5000|$|The {{exigencies of}} the Second World War impelled the {{training}} {{of large numbers of}} both military and civilian staff, and in the United Kingdom this led to the adoption of B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning as a strategy for achieving the requisite behaviour modification. By the 1950s and 1960s these stimulus-response methods were introduced into education, but were seen as being to mechanical. The response was a move to more cognitivist and constructivist approaches. In 1966 the Nuffield Foundation introduced the Resources for Learning project. This involved the teacher introducing a problem, the pupils formulating an hypothesis and then the pupils designing and carrying out an experiment. Kim Taylor an ex-headmaster soon took over as Director of the project. However experience soon showed that a more instructional approach was better at being effective. This led to greater reliance on instructional design. This involved consideration of the scientific principles of pedagogy as well as attention to the equipment to be used to present the resources, which was seen as having managerial implications. Kim Taylor wrote Resources for Learning, (1971), which predicted significant changes if resource-based methods were to be effectively deployed. One of the issues he highlighted was that as a modern economy created pressure for a universalised education, which would require a shift away from [...] "teacher-as-craftsman" [...] as the situation would generate a significant <b>short-fall</b> <b>in</b> teachers.

The simulations show that the LFS divertor heat fluxes are reduced with N 2 -injection in similar fashion in both configurations, qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. The simulations show no substantial {{difference between the two}} configurations in the reduction of the peak LFS heat flux as a function of divertor radiation, nitrogen concentration, or pedestal Zeff. Consistently, experiments show similar divertor radiation and nitrogen injection levels for similar LFS peak heat flux reduction in both configurations. Nevertheless, the LFS strike point is predicted to detach at 20 % lower separatrix density in the vertical than in the horizontal configuration. However, since the peak LFS heat flux in partial detachment in the vertical configurations is shifted towards the far scrape-off layer (SOL), the simulations predict no benefit in the reduction of LFS peak heat flux for a given upstream density in the vertical configuration relative to a horizontal one. A factor of 2 reduction of deuterium ionization source inside the separatrix is observed in the simulations when changing to the vertical configuration. The simulations capture the experimentally observed particle and heat flux reduction at the LFS divertor plate in both configurations, when adjusting the impurity injection rate to reproduce the measured divertor radiation. However, the divertor D α -emissions are underestimated by a factor of 2 – 5, indicating a <b>short-fall</b> <b>in</b> radiation by the fuel species.

40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} the control strategy for a hybrid natural ventilation wind catchers and air-conditioning {{system and to}} assess the contribution of wind catchers to indoor air environments and energy savings if any. Design/methodology/approach – Most of the modeling techniques for assessing wind catchers performance are theoretical. Post-occupancy evaluation studies of buildings will provide an insight into the operation of these building components and help to inform facilities managers. A case study for POE was presented in this paper. Findings – The monitoring of the summer and winter month operations showed that the indoor air quality parameters were kept within the design target range. The design control strategy failed to record data regarding the operation, opening time and position of wind catchers system. Though the implemented control strategy was working effectively in monitoring the operation of mechanical ventilation systems, i. e. AHU, did not integrate the wind catchers with the mechanical ventilation system. Research limitations/implications – Owing to <b>short-falls</b> <b>in</b> the control strategy implemented in this project, it was found difficult to quantify and verify {{the contribution of the}} wind catchers to the internal conditions and, hence, energy savings. Practical implications – Controlling the operation of the wind catchers via the AHU will lead to isolation of the wind catchers in the event of malfunctioning of the AHU. Wind catchers will contribute to the ventilation of space, particularly in the summer months. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates the value of POE as indispensable tool for FM professionals. It further provides insight into the application of natural ventilation systems in building for healthier indoor environments at lower energy cost. The design of the control strategy for natural ventilation and air-conditioning should be considered at the design stage involving the FM personnel...|$|R
