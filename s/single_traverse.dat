Washington; it involves repeated gain and loss of elevation between individual summits along the way. The fact that the range stretches less than twenty miles {{from one end to}} the other and most of its main trails are easily accessible from major through roads errantly suggests that the terrain embraced by the Presidentials lacks remoteness. In truth, the range is a wind ravaged wilderness. A basic Presidential Traverse encompasses almost 9,000' of combined vertical, doubled when difficult downclimbing is included. Adding the principal sub-peaks stretches this to almost 20,000' of up- and downclimb in a <b>single</b> <b>traverse.</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} the spore counts of Alternaria and Cladosporium using the single longitudinal traverse and twelve transverse traverses methods. Both the single and twelve traverses methods generally showed similar average daily concentration fluctuations of the two studied spore types on the same days, although the <b>single</b> <b>traverse</b> method usually presented higher spore concentrations. However, analysing the distribution of concentrations obtained using both methods, there were days when the single or twelve traverses method showed a rise or fall in concentration which was not reflected by the other method. In case of Cladosporium higher daily concentrations obtained using the twelve traverses method occurred more frequently in the months of the highest spore concentrations. The higher concentrations of Alternaria spores obtained using this method occurred more frequently in the months of the lowest concentrations. Analysis of correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient r) between those variables (number of days with higher concentration and monthly concentration) showed that the correlation was significant for Cladosporium and not significant for Alternaria, for both at the significance level &# 945;= 0. 05. The results of the Wilcoxon's Paired Sample Test indicated that for both taxa the average daily concentrations obtained using the 1 traverse method were significantly higher than those obtained using the 12 traverses method...|$|E
40|$|Late Precambrian crustal {{evolution}} in the Northeastern Desert of Egypt culminated in a major episode of strong extension, accompanied by bimodal igneous activity and deposition of clastic sediments in restricted terrigenous basins. These sediments, known as the Hammamat Series, record the uncovering ofthe evolving crust of the region. We have undertaken petrographic, geochemical, and Rb-Sr and K-Ar geochronologic studies of Hammamat samples collected along a <b>single</b> <b>traverse.</b> The lower half of a 400 m thick section consists of coarse detritus hed from nearby ensimatic terranes, while the upper half was derived from rapid reworking of bimodal igneous rocks {{similar to those of}} the Dokhan Volcanics and Pink Granites, units that are preserved within the region. Rb-Sr whole-rock analyses give an 8 -point isochron age of 585 + _ 15 Ma with an initial STSr/~Sr of 0. 70323 ± 0. 00013, interpreted toapproximate closely the time of sedimentation. This is very similar to the K-Ar ages of the coarser clay fractions (2 - 0. 5 #m) (588 - 567 Ma). This result is consistent with stratigraphic considerations and other geochron-ological studies indicating that Hammamat deposition occurred at ~ 590 Ma. Rb-Sr analyses of leached and unleached size fractions indicate thermal resetting at 524 + _ 17 Ma accompanied or followed by fluxing of a radiogenic Sr-rich pore fluid (STSr/S~Sr = 0. 7124).

40|$|The Burkard Volumetric Spore Trap is {{a common}} and {{efficient}} instrument used to collect outdoor air samples. In North America, two slide counting methods {{have been widely used}} by aerobiologists: the <b>single</b> longitu-dinal <b>traverse</b> method and the twelve transverse traverse method. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the two counting methods by assessing fungal spore concentrations of ascospores, basidiospores, smut teliospores, Cladosporium, Alternaria, Epicoccum, Curvularia, Drechslera, Pithomyces, other spores, and total spores at two metropolitan Tulsa, Oklahoma sites (Tulsa and Hectorville) during September 1996. Results showed that both methods were sensing parallel fluctuations in average daily spore concentration, although the twelve trans-verse traverse method usually resulted in higher concentrations. At the Tulsa site, the twelve transverse traverse method gave statistically higher concentrations than the <b>single</b> longitudinal <b>traverse</b> method except for Epic-occum, Pithomyces, smut teliospores, and other spores. At the Hectorville site, however, only Cladosporium and basidiospores showed that the twelve transverse traverse method was statistically higher than the <b>single</b> longitu-dinal <b>traverse</b> method. Comparison with concentrations obtained by counting the total slide surface of two slides indicated that neither method was equivalent to the total slide spore count, although the twelve transverse traverse method gave a lower absolute percent difference from the total slide surface concentration. While the twelve transverse traverse method gave slightly better approximations of the spore concentration, the increase in accuracy may not justify the extra effort required to analyze with this method. 1...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{platforms}} for archaeological purposes {{have increased}} in use over the last 20 years {{with many of the}} developments coming from Continental Europe. Mobile platform developments have mainly focused on one type of instrumentation, offering multiple sensors, depths of detection or frequencies. This development of mobile platforms has focused on data acquisition rates but has not considered the physical impact on the soil. The Geoscan Research Mobile Sensor Platform (MSP 40) was intended to improve survey efficiency and remain a lightweight system. The platform can collect two earth resistance configurations that show directional variation of the current flow through soil. Additional sensors were integrated on to the square frame of the hand-pulled cart to record simultaneous fluxgate gradiometer data and a microtopographic surveys. Ground based geophysical investigation will always have a physical impact on a site. The MSP 40 is no exception but careful selection of wheel types and the lightweight frame limit the damage compared to many mobile arrays. The MSP 40 has been tested on a number of different soils at various times of the year with encouraging results; however issues with overcoming the contact resistance of electrodes remain. The continuous collection rate and combination of techniques means a slight drop in data quality is inevitable. However the increased data density, multiple-sensors and improved rate of collection offset reductions in data quality. The research has shown that the MSP 40 can perform low impact rapid site assessments on ¿vulnerable¿ sites, whilst maximising the information gained from a <b>single</b> <b>traverse.</b> AHRC, Geoscan Researc...|$|E

Sections cut from all five lung lobes were used to prepare CR- 39 neutron-induced 235 U fission fragment autoradiographs. A <b>single</b> <b>traverse</b> across a CR- 39 autoradiograph of a tissue section, from the left lung of all the rats, was made using a motorized microscopic stage. The traverse was divided into 10 fields. The track counts per field were used to test for homogeneity of track distribution and to assess {{if there was any}} tendency for tracks {{to be related to the}} peripheral region of the lung. Full raster scans across the entire tissue image were made on left lung autoradiographs from two animals killed at each time point to assess the homogeneity of fission fragment track distribution throughout the entire section. There was no evidence of any temporal change in the proportion of tracks associated with the lung periphery. At all time points PI, the track distribution was significantly nonhomogeneous, suggesting a nonuniform pattern of tissue irradiation from the 234 U alpha particles. At time points from 180 to 720 days PI, large clusters of macrophages were observed in some of the sections taken from all five lung lobes.

40|$|Potential {{measurements}} {{as negative}} as [...] 1. 67 EHO volts in 1 N KC 1 solution pH 3. 2, have been {{measured on a}} freshly cut aluminum surface by a technique devised by Hagyard and co-workers (1, 2). A poly-thene-coated aluminum rod immersed in 1 N KC 1 solu-tion was cut by a ruby travell ing at 1000 cm/sec. Po-tential measurements were made using a high- im-pedance cathode follower coupled to an oscilloscope. From the instant the cut was made into the aluminum, its potential was recorded by photographing a <b>single</b> <b>traverse</b> of the oscilloscope trace. A typical potential measurement is shown in Fig. 1. The initial rapid potential rise to the peak was at-tributed to the dissolution of aluminum charging the double layer. After reaching the peak potential, {{only a small fraction}} of the electrode surface was thought to remain actively anodic whi le the slower hydrogen discharge process took place over most of the metal surface. The exponential fall in potential was at-tr ibuted to the polarization of the anodic and cathodic processes. The information gained using this tech-nique enabled the kinetics for aluminum dissolution and hydrogen discharge on aluminum to be studied. The object of the present work was to confirm the validity of the measurements made by the above technique. The possible alternative explanations of the potential behavior of freshly cut aluminum that were considered by the authors were (a) that in-stantaneous high temperatures were generated at the cut surface by the shearing action of the ruby cutter; the high temperatures would be rapidly reduced by heat dissipation into the bulk of the metal, (b) severe stressing and dislocation of the aluminum elec-trode surface followed by relaxation of the surface structure; the peak in this case would be a stress po-tential.

40|$|Abstract. With {{technology}} advancement {{and increasing}} popularity of location-aware devices, trajectory data are ubiquitous {{in the real}} world. Trajectory corridor, {{as one of the}} moving patterns, is composed of con-catenated sub-trajectory clusters which help analyze the behaviors of moving objects. In this paper we adopt a three-phase approach to dis-cover trajectory corridors using Fréchet distance as a dissimilarity mea-surement. First, trajectories are segmented into sub-trajectories using meshing-grids. In the second phase, a hierarchical method is utilized to cluster intra-grid sub-trajectories for each grid cell. Finally, local clus-ters in each single grid cell are concatenated to construct trajectory corridors. By utilizing a grid structure, the segmentation and concatena-tion need only <b>single</b> <b>traversing</b> of trajectories or grid cells. Experiments demonstrate that the unsupervised algorithm correctly discovers trajec-tory corridors from the real trajectory data. The trajectory corridors us-ing Fréchet distance with temporal information are different from those having only spatial information. By choosing an appropriate grid size, the computing time could be reduced significantly because the number of sub-trajectories in a single grid cell is a dominant factor influencing the speed of the algorithms...|$|R

40|$|After the 921 Earthquake {{occurred}} in 1999, the relative position of original satellite control points and mapping control points {{have been changed}} due to collision, distortion, dislocation and other factors. Therefore, in land survey correction, the arranged mapping control points before earthquake cannot be restored for survey. TWD 97 {{is often used to}} reconstruct mapping control points in the resurvey area, but this system cannot integrate with survey using TWD 67 before earthquake. This study aims to solve this problem. This study adopted periphery triangulation points of the experiment area and pre-seismic basic control points as basis for reconstruction of basic control points. The remaining point position which serves as common points and rearranged basic control points were used for static survey of GPS satellite positioning. Furthermore, trilateration survey was used to calculate error compensation of survey girds. Comparison analysis was conducted for coordinates of common point location of basic control points before and after earthquake to find out the ground movement after earthquake and evaluate feasibility of design schemes. According to the evaluation results, TWD 97 was used to survey and reconstruct mapping control points after disaster, and <b>single</b> <b>traverse</b> survey was used to recalculate TWD 67 coordinates of point location. The bundle adjustment was used to restore TWD 67 coordinates system before earthquake, and extract conversion parameters and standard deviations of common points so as to provide results of TWD 97 coordinates system and TWD 67 coordinates system for future reference for arrangement of mapping control points in disaster area. The results indicated that four parameters model and least square method is desirable. Average precision of the conversing results of values in the resurvey areas was within 6 cm, which meets the precision requirements of land survey correction stipulated in Article 73 of Regulations for Cadastral Survey. 自從 88 年 921 大地震後原有衛星控制點、圖根點，因擠壓、扭曲、錯動等種種因素導致相對位置產生變化，致辦理土地複丈時，無法恢復地震前布設之圖根點施測，數值重測區補建圖根點時多係採用TWD 97 坐標系統為測量基準與原重測前TWD 67 系統無法接軌，爰有本研究之動機。 研究方法係採用實驗區外圍三角點及地震前布設之基本控制點為依據，辦理基本控制點清理補建，利用殘存點位為共同點加入重新布設之基本控制點辦理GPS衛星定位靜態測量，並應用當時重測時據以計算之三角三邊測量程式作網形平差計算，比較分析地震前後之基本控制點共同點位坐標，了解地震後地層位移量，評估設計可行方案，根據評估結果連測災後補建TWD 97 圖根點，單導線測量重新計算點位TWD 67 坐標，以整體平差方式恢復地震前之TWD 67 坐標系統，萃取出共同點之轉換參數及標準差，期能提供較均勻之TWD 97 坐標系統與TWD 67 坐標系統成果，以提供日後災區圖根布設參考。 經由研究成果得知轉換結果以四參數及最小二乘配置法轉換模式較好；數值重測區轉換成果相對位置平均精度可達 ± 6 公分以內，符合地籍測量實施規則 73 條規定辦理土地複丈之精度要求。目 錄 摘要…………………………………………………… [...] …………iii Abstract…………………………………………………. ……… [...] iv 表目錄…………………………………………………… [...] ……. viii 圖目錄………………………………………………………. ………ix 第一章 緒論…………………………………………………………. 1 第一節 前言. ……………………………………………… [...] 1 第二節 研究動機與目的……………………………………… 2 一、研究動機…………………………………………… [...] 2 二、研究目的……………………………………………… 2 三、研究假設……………………………………………… 3 第三節 研究方法……………………………………………… 3 第二章 文獻回顧……………………………………………………. 5 第三章 研究理論與方法…… [...] ………………… [...] …… 10 第一節 衛星定位測量原理…………………………………. 10 一、全球定位系統………………………………………. 10 二、GPS衛星定位測量方法……………………………… 13 三、e-GPS即時動態定位系統…………………………… 15 四、虛擬基準站即時動態定位技術（VRS-RTK）……… 16 第二節 TWD 67 與TWD 97 大地基準……………………………. 18 一、TWD 67 大地基準……………………………………… 18 二、TWD 97 大地基準……………………………………… 19 第三節 坐標轉換…………………………………………… 21 一、四參數坐標轉換……………………………………. 21 二、六參數坐標轉換……………………………………. 22 三、七參數坐標轉換……………………………………. 22 第四節 三角三邊測量………………………………………. 23 第五節 最小二乘配置法……………………………………. 24 第六節 統計測試……………………………………………. 25 第四章 研究流程與成果分析…………………………………… [...] 28 第一節 研究流程………………………………………. …… 28 一、已知點檢測…………………………………………. 28 二、基本控制點清理補建…………………………… [...] . 31 三、靜態GPS測量與成果計算分析…………………… [...] 33 四、控制點整體平差計算TWD 97 坐標…………………… 34 五、控制點坐標轉換TWD 67 坐標………………………… 35 六、圖根點單導線計算TWD 67 坐標……………………… 35 七、圖根點整體平差計算TWD 67 坐標…………………… 36 八、成果精度分析…………………………. …… [...] …… 36 九、各實驗區實地檢測驗證……………………………. 36 十、結果分析…………………… [...] …. ………………… 37 第二節 實驗區簡介…………………………………………. 37 第三節 研究過程……………………………………………. 39 一、已知三角點計算分析………………………………. 39 二、基本控制點計算………………… [...] ………………. 44 三、控制點坐標轉換比較分析…………………………. 45 第四節 成果及精度分析……………………………………. 47 第五節 實驗區實地檢測成果………………………………. 50 第六節 統計分析……………………………………………. 55 第五章 結論與建議…………………… [...] . ………… [...] . 56 第一節 結論…………………… [...] . ………… [...] 56 第二節 建議…………………… [...] . ………… [...] 57 參考文獻…………………… [...] . …… [...] 58 附錄一：四參數轉換與整體平差較差比較表…………………. 61 附錄二：六參數轉換與整體平差較差比較表…………………. 8...|$|E
40|$|Geoelectric {{traverses}} {{have been}} made in several regions of the F 1 anders, in order to test their usefulness for mapping purposes. The three regions selected had previously been covered by a grid of resistivity soundings mostly in Wenner arrangement. In the Beernem area different arrays have been used along the same line. These multiple traverses have provided data which allowed a comparison of the different arrays as well as a detailed subdivision in geoelectrical homogeneous zones coinciding with lithological units. Along traverse 136 GP/EE axial dipole measurements {{have been made}} over a distance of 2, 7 km. For every point two values were determined : one for an array 2 - 20 - 2 and another for a 5 - 20 - 5 array. The first number stands for the length in meters of the current electrode separation, the third for the length of the voltage electrode separation, and the second for the distance between the two inner electrodes of bath dipoles. On the traverse 136 - 212 GP / AA Wenner arrangement perpendicular to the line has been used over a distance of 9, 6 km to determine at each spot Q 20 ' Q 40 ' and Q 80. Along the same line apparent resistivities have been measured with axial dipole arrays 2 - 20 - 2, 5 - 20 - 5, 5 - 40 - 5 and 10 - 40 - 10, parallel with the line. In the Westhoek area, a part of the coastal plain with salt-water encroachment in the unconfined aquifer, 21 traverses (194 GPW to 194 GPW 21) have been run in the vicinity of Veurne (Furnes). The resistivities Q 10 were measured by a longitudinal Wenner array. Since the traverses had been confined to a geoelectric homogeneous zone a quantitative interpretation could be performed. A relationship between Q 10 and the depth of the saltwater - fresh water interface was computed from previous soundings. This relationship has been used to convert the apparent-resistivity data along the traverses into depth to interface values. The polder area of the F 1 emish Valley north of Ghent also has an unconfined aquifer with brackish water at variable depths. The situation is very similar to the one in the coastal plain although the variations here may not so readily find an explanation. One <b>single</b> <b>traverse</b> 142 GPW 1 of 3550 m length has been run with a Wenner array for Q 10. A relationship based upon former soundings has been used to convert resistivity data into interface depths. Resistivity traversing proves to be a very accurate and speedy tool for detailed mapping. Even a qualitative interpretation of a traverse, multiple if possible, can be sufficient to outline the boundaries between lithological or hydrogeological units. Quantitative interpretation is possible when in conjunction with a sounding grid, previously established, a relationship between the fixed electrode array and the unknown factor is found. Once a relationship is established, fixed-electrode separations allow a more detailed survey than resistivity soundings. These have to be long enough to obtain a reliable curve and hence average depth or resistivity data over longer a distance than fixed-electrode measurements which tend to be as short as possible. When traversing for qualitative purpose dipole arrangements have an advantage over Wenner arrangement in being speedier...|$|E

40|$|In wavelength-division-multiplexing networks, the {{fault-tolerance}} is {{very important}} since failures {{may lead to a}} significant amount of data loss. At the same time, the waveband switching technique is very interesting since it can save switching ports in optical cross-connections. In addition, the hierarchical routing in multidomain optical networks is very challenging since the interdomain routing is based on aggregative virtual topology. However, previous works did not jointly consider the three issues. We propose two schemes, segment-based protection (SBP) and path-based protection (PBP), to provide the fault-tolerance and waveband grooming in multidomain optical networks. In SBP, for each connection we first compute an interdomain loose route based on virtual topology, and then we compute the intradomain exact path-pairs in each <b>single</b> domain <b>traversed</b> by the loose route based on physical topology.

One of the objectives of this work is to establish a statistical relationship between pressure and velocity signals during both the uncontrolled steady state and the transient processes of attachment/separation. After establishing the physics of the control, a separation criterion based on scale differentiation of coherent structures during the process of flow separation is proposed.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{reliable}} detection, sizing, and sorting {{of viruses}} and nanoparticles {{is important for}} biosensing, environmental monitoring, and quality control. Here we introduce an optical detection scheme for the real-time and label-free detection and recognition of single viruses and larger proteins. The method makes use of nanofluidic channels in combination with optical interferometry. Elastically scattered light from <b>single</b> viruses <b>traversing</b> a stationary laser focus is detected with a differential heterodyne interferometer and the resulting signal allows single viruses to be characterized individually. Heterodyne detection eliminates phase variations due to different particle trajectories, thus improving the recognition accuracy as compared to standard optical interferometry. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by resolving nanoparticles of various sizes, and detecting and recognizing different species of human viruses from a mixture. The detection system can be readily integrated into larger nanofluidic architectures for practical applications...|$|R

Algorithmic complexity attacks force the victim to spend its entire scheduling quantum inside a <b>single</b> system call <b>traversing</b> the kernel's hash table of cached file names. The attacker creates {{a very large number of}} files with names that hash to the same value as the file the victim will look up.|$|R

In 1968, a <b>single</b> Hoverwork SR.N6 <b>traversed</b> a 2,400 route of inhospitable jungle terrain within central South America, between Manaus, Brazil and Trinidad, Caribbean, for a National Geographic scientific expedition. Between Hoverwork and Hovertravel, a fleet of up to nine SR.N6s was employed on both scheduled and chartered operations around the world.|$|R
40|$|RFID {{middleware}} collects and filters RFID {{streaming data}} gathered continuously by numerous readers to process requests from applications. These requests are called continuous queries. The problem when using {{any of the}} existing query indexes on these continuous queries is {{that it takes a}} long time to build the index because it is necessary to insert a large number of segments into the index. KDB-tree is an index which can dispose multidimensional data. It is also a dynamic balance tree that has a good query performance and high spatial usage. This paper propose an aggregate transformation algorithm for querydata filtering, and applies KDB-tree into RFID event filtering to improve the performance of query. Comparing to other indexes, the result of simulation shows that KDB-tree index outperforms others in synthesized consideration of storage cost, insertion time cost and query time cost. In particular the query time cost of KDB-tree is distinctly lower than others because it provides <b>single</b> path <b>traverse</b> in the query process...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{multiple}} scatterings on {{the propagation of}} hard partonic jets in a dense nuclear medium is studied {{in the framework of}} deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) off a large nucleus. Power counting arguments based on the Glauber improved Soft-Collinear-Effective-Theory are used to identify the class of leading power corrections to the process of a <b>single</b> parton <b>traversing</b> the extended medium without emission. It turns out that the effect of longitudinal drag and diffusion (often referred to as straggling) is as important as transverse scattering, when relying solely on power counting arguments. With the inclusion of momentum exchanges in both transverse and longitudinal directions between the traversing hard parton and the constituents of the medium, we derive a differential equation for the time (or distance) evolution of the hard parton momentum distribution. Keeping up to the second order in a momentum gradient expansion, this equation describes in-medium evolution of hard jets which experience longitudinal drag and diffusion plus the transverse broadening caused by multiple scatterings from the medium.
