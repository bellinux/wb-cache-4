40|$|High {{performance}} Cu doped MgB 2 bulks {{were prepared}} by an in-situ method with carbon-coated amorphous boron as precursor. It {{was found that}} the usage of carbon-coated boron in present work leads to the formation of uniformly refined MgB 2 grains, as well as a high level of homogeneous carbon doping in the MgB 2 samples, which significantly enhance the Jc in both Cu doped and undoped bulks compared to MgB 2 bulks with normal amorphous boron precursor. Moreover, minor Cu can service as activator, and thus facilitates the growth of MgB 2 grains and improves crystallinity and grain connectivity, which can bring about the excellent critical current density (Jc) at <b>self</b> <b>fields</b> and low fields (the best values are 7 x 105 A/cm 2 at <b>self</b> <b>fields,</b> and 1 x 105 A/cm 2 at 2 T, 20 K, respectively).

The influence of J c (B) on the <b>self</b> <b>field</b> losses in a superconductive tube fed by a transport current in incomplete penetration is studied for two reasons. First, superconducting power cables have a geometry that resembles a tube and second, for high-temperature superconduc-tors, the variation of J c (B) is important especially for low mag-netic fields like <b>self</b> <b>field.</b> An analytical calculation of the distribu-tion of the magnetic field B(r; t) by using a linearized law J c (B) is presented. FromB(r; t) one deduces J(r; t) andE(r; t). The an-alytical expressions of those were used to calculate the analytical instantaneous power p(t). The losses in the superconducting tube are the average value of p(t). They are numerically calculated and compared with the measurements taken on a sample whose charac-teristic J c (B) was previously measured. With the linear model, the calculated losses are closer to the measured losses than for the Bean model, but the J c (B) identification remains the main problem...|$|E
