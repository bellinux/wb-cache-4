There is currently no compelling explanation as to why it should not result in a cosmological constant that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed. However, <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not yet have any fully coherent quantum theory of gravity, there is likewise no compelling reason as to why it should.|$|E
25|$|The Western Wall {{served as}} the {{retaining}} wall {{of the first and}} second Temple. According to tradition, its sanctity is two-fold – it is the closest spot on earth to the location of the first and second Temples that Jews are allowed to access. Tradition holds that there are areas of the Temple Mount that are forbidden for any Jew in a state of ritual impurity to traverse. <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have a Temple now, we cannot expunge ritual impurity, thus should a Jew walk atop the Temple Mount, he or she may be defiling certain sacred areas. In addition to the proximity to the Temple Mount, tradition holds that the Western Wall was built by donations made by the poor of Israel and that such self-sacrifice confers a special protection to the site. The Temple Mount is now occupied by the Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. In Islamic tradition, Mohammed ascended to heaven from the Temple Mount.|$|E

2500|$|Some philosophers, such as John Locke (who is {{considered}} one of the most influential thinkers of the Enlightenment and an empiricist) argue that the Innate Knowledge thesis and the Innate Concept thesis are the same. Other philosophers, such as Peter Carruthers, argue that the two theses are distinct from one another. As with the other theses covered under the umbrella of rationalism, the more types and greater number of concepts a philosopher claims to be innate, the more controversial and radical their position; [...] "the more a concept seems removed from experience and the mental operations we can perform on experience the more plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not experience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our concept of the former is a more promising candidate for being innate than our concept of the latter.|$|E
2500|$|A {{consequence}} of this argument is that abortion is wrong in all the cases where killing a child or adult with {{the same sort of}} future as the embryo would be wrong. [...] So for example, if involuntary euthanasia of patients with a future filled with intense physical pain is morally acceptable, aborting embryos whose future is filled with intense physical pain will also be morally acceptable. [...] But it would not do, for example, to invoke the fact that some embryo's future would involve such things as being raised by an unloving family, <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not take it to be acceptable to kill a five-year-old just because her future involves being raised by an unloving family. [...] Similarly, killing a child or adult may be permissible in exceptional circumstances such as self-defense or (perhaps) capital punishment; but these are irrelevant to standard abortions.|$|E

60|$|Freedom of Contract {{is an idea}} no {{one outside}} a debating society dreams of realizing in the state.

We protect women who are physically and economically weak in this manner, not so much for their own good as the good of the race. The state already puts literary property into a class apart by limiting its duration. At a certain point, which varies in different circumstances, copyright expires. It is possible for an author, whose fame comes late, to be present as a row of dainty volumes in half the comfortable homes in the world, while his grandchildren beg their bread. The author's blood is sacrificed to the need the whole world has of cheap access to his work.

But he is not familiar with the interior of the great fane; it fails to draw him, doubtless because he has no time in his busy, practical life for the cultivation of the aesthetic faculties.
