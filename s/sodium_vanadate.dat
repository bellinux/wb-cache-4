On the other hand, IFN-gamma production induced in cultures of PBMC treated or not with vanadate, was strongly inhibited by incubation with the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor herbimycin A.

Upon removal of vanadate from the culture medium and re-incubation of cells in vanadate-free medium, the surface AGEPC receptors were restored within 7 h after the removal of vanadate.

As a potent radiation protector administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight (20 mg/kg) prior to total body irradiation (TBI) by intra-peritoneal (ip) in-jection, it completely protected mice from hematopoietic syndrome and partially from gastrointestinal syn-drome. In the present study, radiation mitigation effects from vanadate were investigated by ip injection of vanadate after TBI in mice.

At 11 degrees C the recovery time was significantly elevated to 40. 1 +/- 6. 7 min. At 20. 9 degrees C the shape recovery time varied directly with the isotropic RBC tension induced by the pipetting. <b>Sodium</b> orthovanadate (<b>vanadate,</b> 200 microM), which inhibits the phospholipid translocase, blocks the shape recovery.

It was hypothesized that the increase in cytosolic pressure during the pipette aspiration induced an isotropic tension in the RBC membrane followed by a net inside-to-outside membrane lipid translocation. After a sudden release of the aspiration pressure the cytosolic pressure and the membrane tension normalized immediately, but the translocated phospholipids remained temporarily "trapped" in the outer layer, causing an area excess and hence the echinocytic shape.

It was abolished by omission of extracellular Ca 2 + but unaffected by blockers of adrenergic or muscarinic receptors. Comparison {{of the changes in}} membrane potential, 86 Rb efflux and 45 Ca efflux that vanadate and ouabain produced in B-cells made it possible to exclude the hypothesis that vanadate increases insulin release by blocking the <b>sodium</b> pump. <b>Vanadate</b> was also without effect on cAMP levels. On the other hand, it markedly changed the characteristics of the Ca(2 +) -dependent electrical activity and of the oscillations of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + recorded in B-cells stimulated by 15 mM glucose. In the steady state, Ca 2 + influx was increased by vanadate, and this resulted in a rise in cytoplasmic Ca 2 +. The exact mechanisms underlying these changes could not be established but a blockade of K channels was excluded. In the presence of LiCl, vanadate markedly increased inositol phosphate levels in islet cells. This effect was attenuated but not suppressed by omission of Ca 2 +. A small increase in inositol bisphosphate was still produced by vanadate in the absence of LiCl. These results suggest that vanadate both stimulates phosphoinositide breakdown and inhibits inositol phosphate degradation. In conclusion, vanadate does not induce insulin release, but markedly potentiates the stimulation by glucose. This property is not due to an inhibition of the sodium pump or to a rise in cAMP concentration. It results from a complex interplay between changes in B-cell membrane potential, phosphoinositide metabolism and Ca 2 + handling...|$|R

An unresolved question concerning this cross-talk is whether heat shock factor (HSF 1) activity is required for this response. We addressed this issue by modulating HSF 1 activity with compounds acting by distinct mech-anisms: <b>sodium</b> <b>vanadate</b> (SV), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases; and wortmannin, an inhibitor of DNA-de-pendent protein kinase. Using HSF 1 - and GR-responsive CAT reporters, we demonstrate that SV inhibits both HSF 1 activity and the stress potentiation of GR, while having no effect on the hormone-free GR or HSF 1. Par-adoxically, SV increased hormone-induced GR activity in the absence of stress. In contrast, wortmannin in...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} I present a 23 Na/ 51 V-NMR study of <b>sodium</b> <b>vanadate</b> as pure compound, and the {{influence}} of very small amounts of Sodium substitution by Calcium and Lithium is reported and discussed. The measurements of spin-lattice relaxation for 23 Na and 51 V are also presented. The <b>sodium</b> <b>vanadate</b> is found to have a double phase transition. The two transitions are close together and take place around 34 K. Above the transition temperature there is one V site in the mixed oxidation state 4. 5 + and there is one Na site. A consistency for a number of un-doped and very slightly doped samples of three vanadium valences is argued, confirming a charge ordering transition at transition temperature, in good qualitative agreement with Bernert’s model and as well in quantitative and qualitative agreement with Sawa’s monoclinic structure. Below the transition temperature sodium is found to have ten sites. The number of the Na site is continuously developed with decreasing the temperature below transition temperature. This continues development of the Na sites demonstrates that the second transition is continues. The detailed spin-lattice relaxation rate for 23 Na in both, the pure and the doped samples, in transition region, provided evidence for a non-symmetric and complex transition peak structure which we relate to the onset of more than one transition occurring at slightly different temperatures. This scales with the transition temperature reduction provided by lithium and calcium doping. The two transitions (i. e. dimerization and charge ordering) are intimately related. We investigated the spin-gap by means of Vanadium and Sodium spin-lattice relaxation temperature dependence well below transition temperature. The analysis of the single crystal data reveals a significant anisotropy {{in the nature of the}} gap, which is sensitive to Calcium and Lithium doping, indicating that is constrained to the ladder plane...|$|E
40|$|Nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission by fluxing ions {{across the}} membrane {{in response to}} neurotransmitter binding. We show here that during affinity purification of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo, phosphatidic acid, but not other anionic or zwitterionic phospholipids, is hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol. The phospholipase C activity elutes with the acetylcholine receptor and is inhibited by a lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase inhibitor, <b>sodium</b> <b>vanadate,</b> but not a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide. Further, the hydrolysis product of phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, enhances the functional capabilities of the acetylcholine receptor {{in the presence of}} anionic lipids. We conclude that a phospholipase C activity, which appears to be specific for phosphatidic acid, is associated with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The acetylcholine receptor may directly or indirectly influence lipid metabolism in a manner that enhances its own function...|$|E

Because of its production by adipocytes {{and its ability to}} increase preadipocyte proliferation, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) could participate in the paracrine control of adipose tissue development. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine which enzyme activities are involved in exogenous LPA hydrolysis by preadipocytes and adipocytes. Using a quantitative method, we observed that extracellular LPA rapidly disappeared from the culture medium of 3 T 3 F 442 A preadipocytes. This disappearance was strongly slowed down in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitors, <b>sodium</b> <b>vanadate</b> and sodium pervanadate. By using [(33) P]LPA on intact 3 T 3 F 442 A preadipocytes, we found that 90 % of LPA hydrolysis resulted from LPA phosphatase activity biochemically related to previously described ectolipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (LPPs). Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that 3 T 3 F 442 A preadipocytes expressed mRNAs of three known Lpp gene subtypes (1, 2, and 3), with a predominant expression of Lpp 1 and Lpp 3. Differentiation of 3 T 3 F 442 A preadipocytes into adipocytes led to an 80 % reduction in ecto-LPA phosphatase activity, with a concomitant down-regulation in Lpp 1, Lpp 2, and Lpp 3 mRNA expression. Despite this regulation, treatment of 3 T 3 F 442 A adipocytes with <b>sodium</b> <b>vanadate</b> increased LPA production in the culture medium, suggesting the involvement of ecto-LPA phosphatase activity in the control of extracellular production of LPA by adipocytes. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that hydrolysis of extracellular LPA by preadipocytes and adipocytes mainly results from a dephosphorylation activity. This activity (i) occurs at the extracellular face of cell membrane, (ii) exhibits biochemical characteristics similar to those of the LPP, (iii) is negatively regulated during adipocyte differentiation, and (iv) plays an important role in the control of extracellular LPA production by adipocytes. Ecto-LPA phosphatase activity represents a potential target to control adipose tissue development...|$|E
