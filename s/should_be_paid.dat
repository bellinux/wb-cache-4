5|$|In the report, Hamilton {{felt that}} the {{securities}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> at full value to their legitimate owners, including those who took the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable {{and that the government}} should honor the contracts, as they formed the basis of public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.|$|E
5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The plaintiff {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid.</b> Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but that they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would {{be paid for by}} Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Robert Baer (a former North Jersey {{prosecutor}} and municipal judge) lost {{a breach of}} contract lawsuit he filed against Chase {{in federal court in}} Trenton, New Jersey, alleging he helped create the show, but Baer won a ruling that a jury should decide if and how much Baer <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for services as a location scout, researcher, and consultant. The gist of Baer's argument: in addition to Chase's own sources and ideas, some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in The Sopranos were allegedly inspired by tours and conversations the series creator had with Tony Spirito ("a restaurateur and admitted gambler who says he often did 'favors' such as chauffeuring for wiseguys he had known all his life. His old pals included reputed notorious figure John 'Uncle Johnny' Riggi and Louis 'Fat Lou' LaRasso, a late underboss of the DeCavalcante crime family"), Thomas Koczur (a homicide detective for the Elizabeth Police Department), and people Spirito and Koczur introduced Chase to, in addition to communications and input provided by Baer, who'd introduced Chase to Spirito and Koczur in the first place.|$|E

5|$|Various {{other plans}} were {{considered}} to address the debt issues during the first session of Congress, but none were able to generate widespread support. In September 1789, with no resolution in sight and the close of that session drawing near, Congress directed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to prepare a report on credit. In his Report on the Public Credit (the first of three fiscal and economic policy reports), Hamilton called for the federal assumption of state debt and the mass issuance of federal bonds. Hamilton believed that these measures would restore the ailing economy, ensure a stable and adequate money stock, and {{make it easier for}} the federal government to borrow during emergencies such as wars. He also proposed redeeming the promissory notes issued by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution at full value. Many former soldiers had sold their notes at a fraction of face value, believing them to be worthless. He planned to buy back the promissory notes from their current holders. This idea drew loud objections from many who were of the opinion that the notes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> back either to the original holder or to both the current and original holder.|$|E

If the Secretary of State determines that a reward <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid,</b> he or she must also determine the market value of the treasure (assisted by the Treasure Valuation Committee), the amount of the reward (which cannot exceed the market value), to whom the reward <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> and, if more than one person <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid,</b> how much each person should receive.|$|E
