The integrators do not aim at resolving <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> and are therefore very robust in application. As the integrators do work with the integral of the contact forces and not with the forces itself, the methods can handle both non-impulsive motion and impulsive events like impacts. As a drawback, the accuracy of time-stepping integrators is low. This lack can be fixed by using a step-size refinement at <b>switching</b> <b>points.</b> Smooth parts of the motion are processed by larger step sizes, and higher order integration methods {{can be used to}} increase the integration order.|$|E

40|$|The Karnik-Mendel {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} compute the centroid of interval type- 2 fuzzy sets, determining the <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> needed for the lower and upper bounds of the centroid, through an iterative process. It is commonly acknowledged {{that there is no}} closed-form solution for determining such <b>switch</b> <b>points.</b> Many enhanced algorithms have been proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the Karnik-Mendel algorithm. However, all of these algorithms are still based on iterative procedures. In this paper, a direct approach based on derivatives for determining the <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> without multiple iterations has been proposed, together with mathematical proof that these <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> are correctly determining the lower and upper bounds of the centroid. Experimental simulations show that the direct approach obtains the same <b>switch</b> <b>points,</b> but is more computationally efficient than any of the existing (iterative) algorithms. Thus, we propose that this algorithm should be used in any application of interval type- 2 fuzzy sets in which the centroid is required...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that computer users placed in a deferrable multitasking situation generally postpone secondarytask interruptions until points of low mental workload in the primary task. Studies examining this phenomenon have relied on empirical data that explicitly show user <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> in the course of multitask performance. This paper addresses a related question: Can these same <b>switch</b> <b>points,</b> found empirically in a multitasking context, be inferred solely from single-task data? We investigate this question and propose an approach that analyzes a particular behavioral signature in single-task dataâ€”outliers in the distributions of time between task actionsâ€”to infer multitasking breakpoints. We evaluate this approach using behavioral data from a user-interface task, showing how the proposed methodâ€™s inferences from singletask data match well to the real <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> observed during multitask performance...|$|R

50|$|A Signal Transfer Point (STP) is {{a router}} that relays SS7 {{messages}} between signaling end-points (SEPs) and other signaling transfer points (STPs). Typical SEPs include service <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> (SSPs) and service control points (SCPs). The STP {{is connected to}} adjacent SEPs and STPs via signaling links. Based on the address fields of the SS7 messages, the STP routes the messages to the appropriate outgoing signaling link. Edge STPs can also route based upon message body content using deep packet inspection techniques, and can provide address translations and screen content to limit the transfer of messages with dubious content or sent from unreliable sources. To meet stringent reliability requirements, STPs are typically provisioned in mated pairs.|$|E
