The increasingly common use of manipulators in production of moulds and cores can lead to generation of new types of flaws, caused by breakage in moulds and cores which could occur during mould assembly.

40|$|Orientation imaging {{microscopy}} (OIM) {{was performed}} on hot twisted polycrystalline 304 stainless steel specimens in order to study the characteristics of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in low stacking fault energy FCC metals. Microtexture analyses were carried out and the misorientation statistics of the recrystallized areas were derived. The results revealed that multiple twinning controls the formation of new orientations. DRX macrotextures were also measured in torsion and compression. These textures are highly sensitive to the deformation (Zener-Hollomon) parameter Z. High Z values lead to overall textures controlled by nucleation, whereas, at low Z values, selective growth is more predominant. A deformation and recrystallization model based on the OIM measurements and the steady state properties is proposed. The observed strong brass-type deformation textures were simulated by introducing <b>self</b> <b>hardening</b> coefficients.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been the {{development}} of a masonry cement according to DIN 4211 including a high content of lignite fly ash (BFA). These demands are nearly fulfilled by a mixture of an average ''Rheinisch'' BFA with cement clinker, blast furnace slag and different admixtures. The investigated fly ash is originated from a power plant, fired with mixed lignite. Verifying the recipe, using a selection of ashes and clinkers with different compositions provided positive results. The prerequisite for this target is the careful arrangement of components. With a suitable selection of ingredients and correct dosage of admixtures it is possible to produce a masonry cement with up to 40 percent BFA.

40|$|The ai m of {{the present}} work was to analyze the {{influence}} of the setting reaction on the injectability of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) pastes. Even if the injection was performed early after mixing powder and liquid, powder reactivity was shown to play a significan t role in the injectability of TCP pastes. Significant differences were observed between the injection behavior of non - hardening β - TCP pastes and that of <b>self</b> - <b>hardening</b> α - TCP pastes. The differences were more marked at low liquid - to - powder ratios, using fi ne powders and injecting through thin needles. α - TCP was in general less injectable than β - TCP and required higher injection loads. Moreover, clogging was identified as a mechanism hindering or even preventing injectability, different and clearly distingui shable from the filter - pressing phenomenon. α - TCP pastes presented transient clogging episodes, which were not observed in β - TCP pastes with equivalent particle size distribution. Different parameters affecting powder reactivity were shown to affect also p aste injectability. Thus, whereas powder calcination resulted in an increased injectability due to lower particle reactivity, the addition of setting accelerants, such as hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, tended to reduce the injectability of the TCP pastes, e specially if adjoined simultaneously with a Na 2 HPO 4 solution. Although as a general trend faster setting pastes were less injectable, some exceptions were found to this rule. For example, whereas in absence of setting accelerants fine TCP powders were more injectable than the coarse ones in spite of their shorter setting times, when setting accelerants were added this trend was inverted, and coarse powders were more injectable than the fine onesPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

The present work investigates the compression and blast behaviour of Fe- 18 Mn- 1. 5 Al- 0. 6 C TWIP steel using various diffraction techniques and single crystal plasticity finite element method modelling. The compression behaviour of TWIP steel has been investigated at various strain rates with different strains, including a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus, and the results exhibited outstanding strain hardening. This unique feature is ascribed to mechanical twinning occurring during deformation which was proven by microstructural and crystallographic characterization and analysis. Mechanical twinning heavily generate during straining while slip makes a contribution. Tensile deformation favours twinning activity as compared to compression. An Explosive Bulge Test (EBT) was successfully conducted on the TIWP steel which provides a feasible way of strengthening the material and the grain refinement, caused by this pre-blast technique, was the main strengthening mechanism.
