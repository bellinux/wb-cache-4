60|$|The Duchess was {{not only}} a believer in the {{existence}} of a sunken treasure of alluring proportions; she also believed that she knew of a method by which the said treasure might be precisely located and cheaply disembedded. An aunt on her mother’s side of the family had been Maid of Honour at the Court of Monaco, and had taken a respectful interest in the deep-sea researches in which the Throne of that country, impatient perhaps of its terrestrial restrictions, was wont to immerse itself. It was through the instrumentality of this relative that the Duchess learned of an invention, perfected and very nearly patented by a Monegaskan savant, by means of which the home-life of the Mediterranean sardine might be studied at a depth of many fathoms in a cold white light of more than ball-room brilliancy. Implicated in this invention (and, in the Duchess’s eyes, the most attractive part of it) was an electric <b>suction</b> <b>dredge,</b> specially designed for dragging to the surface such objects of interest and value as might be found in the more accessible levels of the ocean-bed. The rights of the invention were to be acquired for a matter of eighteen hundred francs, and the apparatus for a few thousand more. The Duchess of Dulverton was rich, as the world counted wealth; she nursed the hope, of being one day rich at her own computation. Companies had been formed and efforts had been made again and again during the course of three centuries to probe for the alleged treasures of the interesting galleon; with the aid of this invention she considered that she might go to work on the wreck privately and independently. After all, one of her ancestors on her mother’s side was descended from Medina Sidonia, so she was of opinion that she had as much right to the treasure as anyone. She acquired the invention and bought the apparatus.|$|E

40|$|<b>Suction</b> <b>dredging</b> {{for gold}} in river {{channels}} is a small-scale mining practice whereby streambed material is sucked up a pipe, passed over a sluice box {{to sort out}} the gold, and discarded as tailings over another area of bed. Natural resource managers should be concerned about <b>suction</b> <b>dredging</b> because it is common in streams in western North America that contain populations of sensitive aquatic species. It also is subject to both state and federal regulations, and has provided the basis for litigation. The scientific literature contains few peer-reviewed studies of the effects of dredging, but knowledge of dredging practices, and the biology and physics of streams suggests a variety of mechanisms linking dredging to aquatic resources. Effects of dredging commonly appear to be minor and local, but natural resource professionals should expect effects to vary widely among stream systems and reaches within systems. Fishery managers should be especially concerned when dredging coincides with the incubation of embryos in stream gravels or precedes spawning runs soon followed by high flows. We recommend that managers carefully analyze each watershed so regulations can be tailored to particular issues and effects. Such analyses are part of a strategy to (1) evaluate interactions between <b>suction</b> <b>dredging</b> and other activities and resources...|$|R

40|$|<b>Suction</b> <b>dredging</b> for cockles removes large cockles from tidal {{flats and}} may also cause {{mortality}} of non-target fauna and make the habitat less suitable for some species. This study examines whether <b>suction</b> <b>dredging</b> for cockles on tidal flats of the Dutch Wadden Sea had affected densities of non-target fauna, directly after fishing and one year later. Densities of non-target fauna in two randomly chosen undredged locations were compared to densities at the surrounding heavily commercially dredged area. A significant negative effect of cockle dredging on densities of 0 -group Macoma balthica was observed and this effect persisted one year after dredging. The dredged area appeared to be less suitable for settlement of mussels Mytilus edulis. No significant effects of dredging on the mudsnail Hydrobia ulvae and on 0 and 1 -group C. edule were found. For the mobile young Macoma balthica {{it seems unlikely that}} the effect found after one year was still due to the mortality caused by dredging and this suggests that the habitat was less suitable as a consequence of dredging. Thus, even in the highly dynamic ecosystem of the Wadden Sea, effects of bottom disturbance by cockle dredging may persist after one year. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
