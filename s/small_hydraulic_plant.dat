40|$|Biological {{water quality}} changes in two Mediterranean river basins from {{a network of}} 42 {{sampling}} sites assessed since 1979 are presented. In order to characterize the biological quality, the index FBILL, designed to characterize these rivers" quality using aquatic macroinvertebrates, is used. When comparing the data from recent years to older ones, only two headwater sites from the 42 had improved their water quality to good or very good conditions. In the middle or low river basin sites or even in headwater localities were river flow is reduced, the important investment to build up sewage water treatment systems and plants (more than 70 in 15 years) allowed for a small recovery from poor or very poor conditions to moderate water quality. Nevertheless still a significant number (25 %) of the localities remain in poor conditions. The evolution of the quality in several points of both basins shows how the main problems for {{the recovery of the}} biological quality is due to the water diverted for <b>small</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>plants,</b> the presence of saline pollution in the Llobregat River, and the insufficient water depuration.

40|$|Configuration is {{a process}} of {{creating}} complex systems out of a finite set of predefined objects. This process may enclose the selection, the assemblage and the adaptation of these objects. In this paper we want to describe how the configuration of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>plants</b> can be supported. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>plant</b> is a complex system that consists of electronic, mechanical, and hydraulic components. Such a system has to be configured according to particular customers’ demands. Before installing and setting a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>plant</b> into operation, it must be checked whether it contains faults and whether it fulfills the required demands. Since such a configuration process is rather creative, it cannot be automated completely. But, it is possible to support the process of checking, detecting faults and designing a hydraulic circuit in an appropriate way. Our idea of “appropriate ” orients itself by the usual working documents of experts within the hydraulic domain. Since the central working document is the drawing of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>plant,</b> one key idea is the graphical description of hydraulic problems using knowledge based techniques. For this, we have been developing the prototypic system art deco that enables a user to examine hydraulic systems as follows: While a hydraulic circuit is drawn, basic checks are performed and associated knowledge bases are built automatically in order to reproduce the physical model of the system. Upon the base of this model arbitrary parts of the circuit can be investigated easily. ...|$|R

40|$|The work {{deals with}} {{the design of the}} force control in a {{hydraulic}} workbench for primary flight actuators, to be used for hardware-in-the-loop simulations of a modern Fly-By-Wire Flight Control System. For this application, a high-bandwidth force response is needed in order to simulate aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces, but plant uncertainties can imply significant limitations. The variation of structural stiffness, due to hinge play and hinge local deformation, the uncertainties related to the flight actuator stiffness and the ones related to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>plant</b> parameters lead to the necessity of a robust approach to the design of the force control. In the paper, a nominal LTI model of the plant is developed and the closed-loop force control is designed by means of a loop-shaping approach for different values of the bandwidth. The stability of the closed-loop force-controlled system is then verified by a robustness analysis, assuming the structural stiffness, the flight actuator stiffness, and some of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>plant</b> characteristics as uncertain parameters. The bandwidth of the force control is determined by finding an optimal compromise between dynamic performance and stability margin. Finally, in order to overcome the additional problems related to the flight actuator movements due to aircraft manoeuvres, a compensation feedback based on the flight actuator acceleration is proposed...|$|R
