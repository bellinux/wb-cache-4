The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. Animals had both a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.|$|E

2500|$|Curly's childlike mannerisms {{and natural}} comedic charm {{made him a}} hit with audiences, {{particularly}} children.

Although having no formal acting training, his comedic skills were exceptional. Many times, directors would simply let the camera roll freely and let Curly improvise. Jules White, in particular, would leave gaps in the Stooge scripts where Curly could improvise for several minutes. In later years, White commented: [...] "If we wrote a scene and needed a little <b>something</b> <b>extra,</b> I'd say to Curly, 'Look, we've got a gap to fill this in with a [...] "woob-woob" [...] or some other bit of business.'

[...] The foundation itself, he explains is: [...] "actually two foundations in one.
