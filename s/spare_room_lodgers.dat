6000|$|I {{was quite}} {{unprepared}} {{for such a}} reply as this: Cristel had surprised me. To begin with, her father was [...] "well-connected," [...] {{as we say in}} England. His younger brother had made a fortune in commerce, and had vainly offered him the means of retiring from the mill with a sufficient income. Then again, Giles Toller was known to have saved money. His domestic expenses made no heavy demand on his purse; his German wife (whose Christian name was now borne by his daughter) had died long since; his sons were no burden on him; they had never lived at the mill in my remembrance. With all these reasons against his taking a stranger into his house, he had nevertheless, if my interpretation of Cristel's answer was the right one, let his <b>spare</b> <b>rooms</b> to a <b>lodger.</b> [...] "Mr. Toller can't possibly be in want of money," [...] I said.|$|R

6000|$|So {{ended their}} discourse, which, for any very {{appropriate}} service it could render Fanny, {{might as well}} have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her. It had never occurred to her, on the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. To prevent its being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish, the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants, and allow a <b>spare</b> <b>room</b> for a friend, of which she made a very particular point. The <b>spare</b> <b>rooms</b> at the Parsonage had never been wanted, but the absolute necessity of a <b>spare</b> <b>room</b> for a friend was now never forgotten. Not all her precautions, however, could save her from being suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display of the importance of a <b>spare</b> <b>room</b> might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny. Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris-- ...|$|R
