5|$|Below {{the central}} level {{there are several}} {{commissions}} for discipline inspection (CDI). The CDI's composition is decided by the CDI a level above it, and endorsed by its party committee and the committee superior to it; the establishment of discipline commissions {{at the local level}} is decided by the upper-level party committee. The main duties and responsibilities of local CDIs are to educate party members on their duties and rights, preserve party discipline, uphold party decisions, see that party members exercise their duties in accordance with the party constitution, examine cases and investigate corruption. It is expected to report its findings regularly to its corresponding-level party committee. If a member of the local party committee is involved in corruption, the local CDI <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> the party committee at the corresponding level and the CDI at the level above to approve a full investigation. Before the 2014 reforms it was difficult for the CDIs to carry out their responsibilities; although they no longer needed approval from the secretary of the corresponding-level party committee, CDI officials were often appointed to positions of power within the institutions they were tasked to supervise (see above). The 2004 reforms increased CDI independence from the party committee; they were previously elected by the corresponding-level party committee, but beginning in 2004 CDI membership was selected by the upper-level CDI. The 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee in 2013 again reformed the CCDI's structure, with each CDI directly responsible to the CCDI.|$|E

25|$|In 1861, Andrew persuaded Thomas {{to invest}} in the Columbia Oil Company, and it paid off handsomely. That Andrew Carnegie <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> an 18-year-old boy to be a stock {{investor}} was not unusual. When Andrew traveled to Scotland with his mother and a friend in 1862, he left Thomas in charge of his numerous business affairs (assets by that time nearing $47,860 or $8.5 million in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars).|$|E
25|$|If among monks or nuns occurs {{a quarrel}} or dispute or dissension, the young monk <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> {{forgiveness}} of the superior, and the superior {{of the young}} monk. They should forgive and ask forgiveness, appease and be appeased, and converse without restraint. For him who is appeased, there will be success (in control); for him who is not appeased, {{there will be no}} success; therefore one should appease one's self. 'Why has this been said, Sir? Peace is the essence of monasticism'.|$|E
25|$|If this be impossible, however, {{two will}} suffice. The bishop chooses the consultors, half {{at his own}} option, the other half after {{nomination}} by the clergy. The bishop <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> {{the advice of his}} consultors as to holding and promulgating a diocesan synod; dividing parishes; committing a parish to religious; constituting a committee for diocesan seminaries; choosing new consultors or examiners non-synodically; concerning transactions about church-property where the sum involved exceeds five thousand dollars; exacting new episcopal taxes beyond the limits designated by the canons.|$|E

25|$|Stairs' {{orders were}} to take Katanga with or without Msiri's agreement. If they found a BSAC {{expedition}} had beaten them and had a treaty with Msiri they should await further orders. If they obtained a treaty and a BSAC expedition arrived, they <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> it to withdraw and use force to make them comply if necessary. Moloney and Stairs were quite prepared for this eventuality. They were aware that in 1890, Cecil Rhodes had seized Manicaland {{in the face of}} Portuguese claims by sending an armed unit under Frederick Selous to occupy the territory and force the Portuguese to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|In another Greek story {{involving}} Scorpio without Orion, Phaeton (the mortal male {{offspring of}} Helios) {{went to his}} father, who had earlier sworn by the River Styx to give Phaeton anything he <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> for. Phaeton wanted to drive his father's Sun Chariot for a day. Although Helios tried to dissuade his son, Phaeton was adamant. However, when the day arrived, Phaeton panicked and {{lost control of the}} white horses that drew the chariot. First, the Earth grew chill as Phaeton flew too high and encountered the celestial scorpion, its deadly sting raised to strike. Alarmed, he dipped the chariot too close, causing the vegetation to burn. By accident, Phaeton turned most of Africa into desert and darkened the skin of the Ethiopian nation until it was black. Eventually, Zeus was forced to intervene by striking the runaway chariot and Phaeton with a lightning bolt {{to put an end to}} its rampage and Phaeton plunged into the River Eridanos.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was {{a medical}} doctor and this {{assisted}} his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners {{to be allowed to}} stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she could hear him if he asked for her help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew intimate details about him and that he had asked for her help, and she told him that he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.|$|E

25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone <b>should</b> <b>ask,</b> they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

500|$|Joseph P. Kennedy {{had been}} a patron of Le Pavillon, but after Decré and Meyzen opened their new restaurant, Kennedy {{switched}} his patronage to La Caravelle, dining there regularly when in New York. [...] It became a popular place for the Kennedy family to visit. Fessaguet chose and trained René Verdon to be chef at the White House when John F. Kennedy was elected president the year after opening. Verdon spent some weeks working with Fessaquet on the Kennedy family's favorite dishes. President Kennedy was especially fond of La Caravelles vichyssoise and chicken in champagne sauce. [...] He often requested them as [...] "take out" [...] orders and would have them heated up on the plane as he traveled. Decré and Meyzen renamed the dish on their menu; Poularde Maison Blanch then became [...] "White House Chicken". In 1964, the Kennedys held a family reunion at La Caravelle; one of the subjects of discussion at the reunion {{was said to be}} whether Robert F. Kennedy <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> to be nominated as vice president at the upcoming 1964 Democratic National Convention. Joseph P.

500|$|As did the nation, fraternities at Dartmouth {{went through}} {{difficult}} {{times during the}} Great Depression. [...] The decade of the 1930s saw almost no building projects {{at all in the}} fraternity system, and many houses could no longer afford regular maintenance. [...] One of the great tragedies at Dartmouth College occurred on a winter night in 1934, when nine members of Theta Chi died from carbon monoxide poisoning after a metal chimney on a dilapidated coal furnace {{in the basement of the}} chapter house broke in the night. [...] In 1935, Dartmouth historian and professor Leon Burr Richardson asserted in a survey that, in light of the national suffering, the fraternity chapters <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> themselves if they had [...] "any excuse for existence." [...] Four fraternities dissolved during the Great Depression (Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omega, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Sigma Alpha Mu), and two (Phi Kappa Sigma and Alpha Chi Rho) merged to pool scarce resources in order to survive. [...] All of the surviving fraternities closed for the duration of World War II, as the campus was largely (although not exclusively) used to educate, train, and house Navy sailors and Marines in the V-12 Navy College Training Program.|$|E
500|$|After Uttanka {{completed}} his education, {{he asked his}} guru Veda about gurudakshina (fee to the teacher). Veda suggested that he <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> his wife and give him the gift that she desired. The guru's wife harboured a grudge against Uttanka, as he had refused to fulfil her desire in her fertility period. She asked Uttanka to get the earrings of King Pushya’s queen in three days {{so that she could}} wear them during a religious fast on the fourth day. Uttanka set out to accomplish the task. On the way, he encountered a giant who was riding a huge bullock and sought his blessings. The giant asked Uttanka to eat the dung and drink the urine of the animal. Uttanka hesitated but ultimately complied after being informed that his guru, Veda, had acted likewise. Uttanka then went to King Pushya and conveyed to him the wish of his guru’s wife for the earrings of his queen so that he could pay his gurudakshina. The king asked Uttanka to meet his wife in her chambers. However, he could not find the queen there. Pushya informed Uttanka that his queen does not appear before any impure person who has not performed the ritual ablutions. After performing the ablutions, Uttanka met the queen and asked her for the earrings, which she granted. She warned Uttanka that Takshaka, the king of Nagas (serpents), was after the divine earrings and he should therefore take guard against him.|$|E

Their presence attracted crowds and Papps shouted [...] "let's have a scream from those who want Bobby and Frank to marry". The crowds went [...] "berserk" [...] and voiced their approval– which gave the go ahead for their on-screen marriage plans. The storyline played out on-screen when Frank decides that he <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> Bobby to marry him, despite still feeling hurt by Roo's actions. He picks Bobby up from school wearing a tuxedo in a Rolls-Royce and takes her to a picnic in the woods. He sets up a meal of fish and chips.
