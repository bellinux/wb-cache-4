The rest, including Whitlock, Fitch and Chamberlain, had been on the staff of USAFIA. MacArthur reported to Marshall that there were no qualified Dutch officers in Australia, and that the Australian Army had a critical <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> officers, which he did not wish to exacerbate. Nevertheless, several Dutch and Australian army officers, as well as some American naval officers, served in junior positions on the staff.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} demolitions was small prior to World War I but had become {{considerable}} by 1955, when one house was demolished every five days. As early as 1944, the trustees of Castle Howard, convinced {{there was no}} future for Britain's great houses, had begun selling the house's contents. Increasing taxation and a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> were already ensuring that {{the old way of}} life had ended. The wealth and status of the owner provided no protection to the building as even the more wealthy owners became keen to free themselves of not only the expense of a large house, but also the trappings of wealth and redundant privilege which the house represented. Thus, it was not just the smaller country houses of the gentry which were wiped from their – often purposefully built – landscapes, but also the huge ducal palaces. Alfred Waterhouse's Gothic Eaton Hall, owned by Britain's wealthiest peer was razed to the ground in 1963, {{to be replaced by a}} smaller modern building. Sixteen years earlier the Duke of Bedford had reduced Woburn Abbey to half its original size, destroying façades and interiors by both Henry Flitcroft and Henry Holland. The Duke of Devonshire saved Hardwick Hall by surrendering it to H.M. Treasury in lieu of death duties, which were charged at the maximum rate of 80% of the total value of an estate, but this solution was rarely acceptable to the government. As late as 1975, the British Labour government refused to save Mentmore, thus causing the dispersal, and emigration, of one of the country's finest art collections.|$|E

For many years the Tribune was published twice weekly — Wednesdays and Saturdays — but during the Second World War <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> and paper necessitated the change to a weekly paper. In 1925 the business was purchased by Messrs Hogan and Gardiner and then followed other proprietors, Herbert Davies and [...] John S. Richardson, and by his widow, Rena M.

Countries that suffer from poverty, civil and political unrest or conflict, and other dangerous public health issues such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis often suffer from a severe burden and breakdown within the healthcare system. This breakdown puts many people at risk, specifically women. Many hospitals within these conditions suffer from <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> supplies, and other forms of medical technology that would be necessary to perform reconstructive obstetric fistula repair.

2500|$|The jobs {{available}} to the prisoners were few; between 1930 and 1960, about 200 inmates out of a population averaging 550 had something to do. [...] In the 1940s and '50s, most prisoners spent twenty-two {{hours a day in}} their cells. [...] The industries that were available were managed not by civilians or guards, but, due to the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> at the prison, by a system of inmate overseers. [...] Called [...] "con-bosses," [...] these privileged inmates had complete control over their areas, reserving the right to choose which inmates worked under them, how much work they received, and {{what they had to do}} to receive work at all. [...] Since work meant not only something to do other than sit in a cell but also time earned off a sentence, this system led to rampant corruption, favoritism, and ill-feelings among the prisoners, since the con-bosses often sold positions or used them as leverage for any number of illicit favors.|$|E

2500|$|First Lady Carol Judge made {{improvements}} to the state system of hospitals and psychiatric hospitals a priority during the mid-1970s. She had first encountered poor, substandard conditions at Warm Springs State Hospital as a nursing student during the early 1960s. She visited twelve state hospitals {{in an effort to}} call attention to poor living conditions for patients. She wrote and printed a four-page, yellow brochure called [...] "Have a Heart: The Human Side of Boulder River School and Hospital and Warm Springs State Hospital," [...] which she distributed to state lawmakers and other influential individuals throughout Montana. In the brochure, Carol Judge wrote specifically about Warm Springs State Hospital, [...] "Here, as in Boulder, we find a terrible <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> poor wages and inadequate housing. Patients are overcrowded in decaying buildings, which are impossible to keep clean, and this encourages the spread of disease. The drab and depressing surroundings lack stimulating things to do for learning, therapy and recreation." [...] She included pictures of the hospitals in the publication. Governor Thomas Judge, in response to the First Lady's campaign, proposed sweeping reforms to the state's mental hospitals, which received solid support from state legislators and other groups. Montana lawmakers increased funding to improve living and working conditions at both Warm Springs State Hospital and the Boulder River School and Hospital. The government of Montana also began a deinstitutionalization of some patients, by moving them out of psychiatric hospitals and into local living centers. Opposition to the group homes was often high in local communities. In response, the operators of the group homes would invite Carol Judge, who was popular as First Lady, to their openings and events to speak with neighbors and community leaders.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Organized triage {{has been}} useful method in {{immediate}} classification of {{large number of}} patients. Urgent intervention and evaluation of patients in Emergency Department result in shorter patient waiting time and, therefore, intensifying the quality of supervision. This study aimed at determining the causes of delays in patient triage in Emergency Departments (EDs) {{in the city of}} Tabriz. Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in 18 hospitals of Tabriz, Iran. A questionnaire developed for this study was the only tool used in data collection. They were filled in by selected sample <b>of</b> ED <b>staff,</b> consisting 22 physicians and 135 nurses. The data was analyzed using the SPSS v. 15. 0 statistical software and descriptive analyses were used. Results: Findings {{of this study indicate that}} 75 % of the survey was conducted in public and 25 % in private hospitals. Based on the study results, major reasons of delay in patients priority processing include <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>staff</b> (65 %), large number of patients (50. 3 %), <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>staff</b> (38. 2 %), <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> hospital resources (31. 2 %), <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> medical equipment (26. 8 %), patients evaluation (13. 4 %), diagnostic tests (12. 1 %), advanced age of patients (5. 7 %), early age of patients (5. 1 %). Conclusions: Results of the study indicate that some of the major reasons of delay in priority processing <b>of</b> patients include <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>staff</b> and large number of patients. Therefore, increasing staff number can be an efficient way to effectively manage the patient population in Emergency Department...|$|R

There was a cholera epidemic with 33,150 detected cases and 981 deaths, a fatality rate of 3%. Yet, the number of people seeking aid at health facilities decreased by 25% in that same period.

Findings indicated that geographical, financial and cultural accessibility were satisfactory. Functional accessibility seemed problematic.
