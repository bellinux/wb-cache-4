He is wearing a dark suit and a light shirt. He is {{an old man with}} unkempt hair. He is grabbing onto a wooden platform in front of him. On the platform are several <b>ring</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> <b>clamps.</b> A large section of pipe can be seen behind him. The walls of the room are made of corrugated metal.

Several versions were available, including one piece and two piece suits. The one piece suits were available with long or short legs and sleeves, and with front, neck or back entry. Neck entry suits were sealed by overlapping the neck opening and the hood over a grooved neck <b>ring,</b> <b>and</b> <b>clamping</b> {{with a large}} elastic O-ring. The two piece suit shirt and pants were also available separately and could be sealed together at the waist by a system similar to the neck entry suit.|$|R

50|$|The {{aluminum}} disk was twenty-two {{inches in}} diameter and was faced with an aluminum disk of equal size with a facing of just {{over a quarter of}} an inch in thickness. The traversing wheel was eighteen {{inches in diameter}} with a 1.5 in working face, strawboard rings eighteen inches outside diameter by three inches radial dimension. It was clamped between cast iron members supporting the strawboard <b>rings</b> inside <b>and</b> <b>clamping</b> them sideways. This fibrous friction wheel is splined to slide on a sleeve seventeen inches in diameter variably carried on a steel shaft thirteen inches in diameter. It journaled in swinging boxes so that the wheel can be pressed against or separated from the iron, aluminum-faced driving disk, which is motor driven.|$|R

The enclosed single mount was used on some early destroyer classes, {{but by the end}} of World War II, it was mainly found on the many minelayers and auxiliaries which were developed from the older classes of destroyers, as well as on most of the destroyer escorts, and many large auxiliaries (repair ships, destroyer tenders, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|Despite her limited {{knowledge}} of professional wrestling at the time, Waldek began {{a career in}} Chicago, Illinois. She adopted the name [...] "Ella Waldek" [...] because, in her words, “who could <b>stand</b> in a <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> autograph an eleven letter last name?” Waldek earned the nickname [...] "The Policeman" [...] and also worked under the names [...] "Jackie Lee" [...] and [...] "Charming Carmen". She adopted the short arm scissor lift as one her signature maneuvers. Over {{the course of her}} career, Waldek worked matches with other female wrestlers, including Mae Young.|$|R
50|$|Spring clamps are {{typically}} {{made from a}} strip of spring steel, cut so that one side has a narrow protrusion centered on the end, {{and the other side}} a pair of narrow protrusions on either side. The ends of these protrusions are then bent outwards, and the strip rolled to form a ring, with the protruding tabs intermeshing. To use the clamp, the exposed tabs are pressed towards each other (typically using pliers), increasing the diameter of the <b>ring,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>clamp</b> is slid onto the hose, past the portion that will go onto the barb. The hose is then fit onto the barb, the clamp expanded again, slid onto the portion of the hose over the barb, then released, compressing the hose onto the barb. Clamps of this design are rarely used for high pressures or large hoses, as they would require unwieldy amounts of steel to generate enough <b>clamping</b> force, <b>and</b> be impossible to work with using just hand tools. They are commonly used on automotive cooling system hoses several inches in diameter, for example on most water-cooled Volkswagen automobiles.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} college girls, driving a light blue matador, arrive at Chola Picnic Village. They book {{a hotel room}} by a picnic spot. At night they {{go out to the}} beach, light a bonfire, and enjoy singing and dancing. After the song ends, the girls return to the hotel. One of the girls, Vasanthi, {{separates}} from the group. She comes across a pi shaped bell <b>stand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rings</b> it three times. A man, P.R.K, appears, riding on a carriage. He looks into her eyes, and rides Vasanthi down, grabbing her hair and kidnapping her.|$|R
50|$|A Utility clamp is a {{laboratory}} apparatus resembling {{a pair of}} scissors. The screw in the middle works as the wide adjustment of 2-prong. It composes of 3 parts: 2-prong adjust, metal rod, <b>and</b> <b>clamp</b> down (attach the clamp to the <b>ring</b> <b>stand</b> for adjust the height). This apparatus is connected to <b>ring</b> <b>stand</b> or retort stand.

5000|$|Triple X {{began as}} a team under Vince Russo's [...] "Sports Entertainment Xtreme" [...] faction. They began teaming on December 18, 2002 {{defeating}} the team of Amazing Red and The S.A.T.. One of the unique trends begun by Triple X was the [...] "Triple X Rule" [...] (which is precedented by the earlier Freebird Rule). When Low Ki and Elix Skipper won the NWA World Tag Team Championship on January 22, 2003, from America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), TNA officials permitted them to allow Christopher Daniels to defend the title as well. Before each tag team match, all three members of Triple X would <b>stand</b> in the <b>ring,</b> <b>and</b> only when the bell rang would it be known which {{two of the three}} would be competing.|$|R

5000|$|The {{glass master}} is rotated in the {{electroforming}} tank while a pump circulates the electroforming solution {{over the surface}} of the master. As the electroforming progresses, nickel is not electroplated onto the surface of the glass master, since that would preclude separation. Plating is rather eschewed through passivation and, initially, because the glass is not electroconductive. Instead, the metal coating on the glass disc, actually reverse-plates onto the nickel (not the mandrel) which is being electrodeposited by the attraction of the electrons on the cathode, which presents itself as the metal-coated glass mistress, or, premaster mandrel. Electroplating, on the other hand, would have entailed electrodepostion directly to the mandrel along with the intention of it staying adhered. That, and the more rigorous requirements of temperature control and purity of bathwater, are the main differences between the two disciplines of electrodeposition (invented by Luigi Brugnatelli and often credited to another Luigi - Sr. Galvani). The metal stamper first struck from the metal-coated glass is the metal master (and we shouldn't make a master from another master as that would not follow the nomenclature of the sequence of siring that is germane to electroforming) This is clearly a method opposite to normal electroplating. Another difference to electroplating is that the internal stress of the nickel must be controlled carefully, or the nickel stamper will not be flat. The solution cleanliness is important but is achieved by continuous filtration and usual anode bagging systems. Another large difference is that the stamper thickness must be controlled to ±2% of the final thickness so that it will fit on the injection moulding machines with very high tolerances of gassing <b>rings</b> <b>and</b> centre <b>clamps.</b> This thickness control requires electronic current control and baffles in the solution to control distribution ...|$|R

50|$|At Chikara's Season eight finale titled Three Fisted Tales {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} the main event between The Colony (Fire Ant and Soldier Ant) and The Osirian Portal (Amasis and Ophidian), two masked men came from the crowd. Tursas pushed the barrier down and walked into the ring until all the Chikara roster came out to the ring. Not long after, UltraMantis Black demanded they identify themselves; one of them was Ares and the other was Tursas. After this the members of BDK attacked the rest of the Chikara roster. At the end Ares and Tursas {{along with the rest of}} BDK <b>stood</b> in the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> Ares ordered Vökoder and Pink Ant to unmask themselves; they were revealed as Tim Donst and Pinkie Sanchez respectively. After this all BDK members performed the Cross and Tursas turned off the lights at the end of the show. Over the next three years, Tursas competed in different matches with BDK and won (2010) with Ares and Claudio Castagnoli. He began working in a minor role, making signs and writing messages. In 2011 Chikara announced Tursas' profile had been removed, thus ending his time in the BDK.|$|R
