First, interviews were conducted with eight academics who maintain a research interest in parking, to validate key stakeholders and their parking dilemmas as identified from literature. Second, interviews with 20 representatives spanning an assortment of key stakeholder groups affected by parking were undertaken, to determine their perspectives on the value of parking. The findings indicate that a considerably broader reach of stakeholders are affected by parking than the existing literature suggests, and the process of means by which <b>stakeholders</b> <b>value</b> parking is more sophisticated than previously thought.

Tangible aspects cover financial factors such as return on capital, cash flow and profitability, while the intangible aspects are related to non-financial {{factors such as the}} organisational core values. Therefore, this article aimed to test the performance excellence model based on core values indicators. This excellence model consists of six value-based performance criteria, which are leadership, culture, productivity-focused, employee-focused, stakeholder-focused and overall performance. Each criterion is measured using six core values of performance indicators. A total of 12 hypotheses have been put forward to test the relationships amongst the six criteria of excellence in the model. The model is analysed using structural equation modeling with AMOS software version 18. 0 using maximum likelihood estimation. The questionnaire was developed and distributed to the respondents in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Malaysia; out of 1, 100 questionnaires distributed, 537 questionnaires were returned. The results of the modeling analysis revealed that the fit statistics of value-based performance excellence model for HEI is admissible. From the results, it is found that the leadership values have significant impact on the university culture values, employee <b>values</b> and the <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values.</b> Similarly, the culture values significantly affect the productivity values and employee values. Furthermore, employee values have significant influence on the productivity and <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values.</b> In addition, the productivity and <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values</b> significantly influence the university performance. However, {{the results of the study}} also found that there is no significant relationship between the leadership values and the productivity values, and between the culture <b>values</b> and the <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values</b> in the university settings. Furthermore, the relationship between the employee values towards university performance is found to be insignificant. From the study, it can be concluded that the relationships that are statistically significant and practically important should be given a due attention by the authorities in order to enhance the performance of the university through value-based indicators...|$|R

The objectives of this WP were as follows: • Identify and map the diverse range of <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values</b> in Open Access data and data dissemination and preservation. • Map <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values</b> on to research ecosystems using case studies from different disciplinary perspectives. In summary, our research activities clearly found an overall drive for Open Data Access within the policy documents, which is part of a wider drive for open science in general. The values underpinning this move are the view of science as an open enterprise, where knowledge is sought and where discovery rests on scientists working together to solve specific challenges, which increasingly are becoming interdisciplinary in nature. The argument for publicly funded science to be made open to the public is also strong, although it is not often clear how this openness should be operationalised. When discussing Open Data there is a clear tendency to refer to science as a whole sector, thus there is a danger that the differences between disciplines are ignored in further policy making. Each discipline has different methods for gathering and analysing data. Data may be images, numerical, narrative, statistical and presented in small, medium or large datasets which might be discrete or interlinked. Some disciplines deal with sensitive data while others deal with data that may have IPR or legal issues. It is important that these differences be acknowledge in further policy for Open Data as it will inform the debate about whether we require subject specific requirements, or common infrastructure for Open Data Access...|$|R

40|$|In mid term program {{evaluations}} evaluators {{are often}} {{confronted with the}} double task of retrospectively judging the program's merit and worth {{while at the same}} time advising decision makers concerning future adjustments in courses of action. In such cases, it can be argued that it is particularly important that evaluators take into account the divergent views and needs of different stakeholder groups. In principle, program theory evaluation can constitute a sound basis for dealing with the double objective of retrospective judgment and proactive program improvement. However, as argued in the paper, current approaches in program theory evaluation may not be sufficiently equipped to systematically deal with divergent <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values.</b> Taking into account lessons from the literature on <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values</b> in evaluation, an alternative methodological framework is presented. The framework combines program theory evaluation with elements of multicriteria decision aid. An example is used to illustrate the framework. ...|$|R

This approach involves the explicit consideration of <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values</b> and an evaluation of the TWRS alternatives in terms of these values. Such evaluations need to be consistent across decisions. Thus, an effort was undertaken to develop a consistent, quantifiable set of measures that can be used by TVVRS to assess alternatives against the <b>stakeholder</b> <b>values.</b> The measures developed also met two additional requirements: 1) the number of measure should be relatively small; and 2) performance with respect to the measures should be relatively easy to estimate...|$|R

5000|$|The term Social Innovation, {{as defined}} by Stanford Social Innovation Review (SSIR), refers to a {{methodology}} of solving societal problems through new mechanisms that harness human and financial capital, and often stand {{at the crossroads of}} non-profit, public, and private sectors. Specifically, SSIR frames social innovation as [...] "a novel solution to a social problem that is more effective, efficient, sustainable, or just than existing solutions and for which the value created accrues primarily to society as a whole rather than private individuals". [...] Social innovation refers to invention and new problem solving methods not only in non-profits, but also more broadly in how social entrepreneurs seek to address human development challenges, how impact investors think about providing capital to organizations who maximize <b>stakeholder</b> <b>value,</b> and how mission-driven businesses and socially responsible corporations lever their comparative advantages to improve societal outcomes.|$|E
50|$|Public value {{describes}} {{the value that}} an organization contributes to society. The term was originally coined by Harvard professor Mark H. Moore who saw it as the equivalent of shareholder value in public management. Public value is supposed to provide managers with a notion of how entrepreneurial activity {{can contribute to the}} common good. Nowadays, public value is no longer limited to the public sector, but is used by all types of organization, including non-governmental organizations and private sector firms. Therefore, the public value researcher Timo Meynhardt from the University of St. Gallen and HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management uses the term to generally raise the question about organizations' contribution to the common good. He believes that current management concepts, such as shareholder value, <b>stakeholder</b> <b>value,</b> customer value, sustainability or corporate social responsibility, should legitimize themselves in regard to their impact on the common good.|$|E
