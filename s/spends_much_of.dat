5|$|It <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{its time}} {{underwater}} {{in order to}} hunt, but returns to land to digest, rest, and reproduce. It has very potent neurotoxic venom which it uses to prey on eels and small fish. Because of their affinity to land, banded sea kraits often encounter humans, but the snakes are not aggressive and only attack in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky's prior {{work for}} the Russian {{military}} and his education at a KGB-sponsored technical college has led to controversy about whether he uses his position to advance Russian government interests and intelligence efforts. According to Kaspersky, allegations of dubious connections with Russian agencies began after {{he got his first}} clients in America. He <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his working life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite of the allegations.|$|E

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{its time}} climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E
5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his time {{sitting on top of}} a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali {{is said to be the}} most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E
5|$|Amy rescues Sonic from {{imprisonment}} {{and asks}} him {{to marry her}} but yet again Sonic refuses to in Sonic Adventure 2. When she looks for Sonic (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for Sonic. Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and the other characters neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup at the space colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his friend on the ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E

5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{its time}} lying buried {{on the sea}} floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks {{of up to}} 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
5|$|The train {{carrying}} {{the women and}} children is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor and encourages the Jews to observe the Jewish Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.|$|E

5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background, using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character. The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud. The young James Bond <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his early life abroad, becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father's work as a Vickers armaments company representative. Bond is orphaned at the age of 11 when his parents are killed in a mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix.|$|E

5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the day buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state {{for at least five}} hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} {{that allow them to}} learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{has generally}} nocturnal habits and <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the day {{buried in the}} substrate. It {{has been known to}} follow the rising tide to forage in water barely deep enough to cover its body. This species preys upon small invertebrates, including crustaceans, annelid worms, and bivalve and gastropod molluscs, and bony fishes. It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. In Delaware Bay, this species feeds predominantly on the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata, and its overall dietary composition is virtually identical to that of the roughtail stingray (D.centroura), with which it shares the bay. The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium brevissime and Kotorella pronosoma, the monogenean Listrocephalos corona, and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and Multicalyx cristata.|$|E

5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E
5|$|In Part 2, Phoebe {{tries to}} contact someone by phone to warn them about Rachel, {{eventually}} getting through to Joey {{at the hotel}} and stirring up homesickness in him. At the rehearsal dinner, Ross introduces his parents, Jack and Judy (Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles) to Emily's, Steven and Andrea (Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders). Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but when they discover extravagant costs Ross <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the evening trying to bargain down his future in-laws. Chandler makes a toast that is not well received by the guests and Monica is taken aback when a drunken guest mistakes her for Ross's mother. She and Chandler console each other over alcohol and wake up in bed together the next morning. Rachel eventually boards a plane, after forgetting her passport, and annoys other passengers (including guest star Hugh Laurie) by telling them about her relationship with Ross. At the hall, she sees how happy Ross is with Emily and just wishes him luck. Phoebe phones Joey to hear the wedding, to the annoyance of Ross. As Ross says his vows, he accidentally says Rachel's name rather than Emily's, registrar to ask Emily if he should continue, while the camera shoots from character to character, settling on a shocked Rachel.|$|E
5|$|Maho is Shuichi's sister. She is {{one year}} older than Shuichi is, and at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son, she is in the sixth grade of elementary school. Maho shows a strong interest in clothes, and <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> her money on new apparel. She is a big fan of a teen fashion model named Maiko, and to meet her, Maho auditions for the same modeling agency as Maiko. After she is hired and becomes recognized as a model, Maho enjoys being asked her autograph by complete strangers. While her modeling career initially starts out slowly, Maho soon gains confidence in her abilities, and becomes friends with Maiko and two other models, Anna Suehiro and Tamaki Satō. In contrast to her younger sibling, Maho is very out-spoken and tends to be rough with Shuichi, even hitting or slapping Shuichi on occasion, and she often forces things on Shuichi with little consideration of Shuichi's opinion. She does not like Shuichi's cross-dressing and gets angry and disturbed when she finds Shuichi dressed as a girl. In junior high school, Maho becomes attracted to her classmate Riku Seya, and eventually starts dating him.|$|E
