5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name <b>suggests,</b> <b>it</b> was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more {{difficult}} than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), {{an object}} {{orbiting}} a young companion star {{at a distance}} of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> could not have formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|Named Alchiba, Alpha Corvi is a white-hued star of {{spectral}} type F1V {{and magnitude}} 4.0, 48.7 ± 0.1 light-years from Earth. It exhibits periodic {{changes in its}} spectrum over a three-day period, which <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> is either a spectroscopic binary or (more likely) a pulsating Gamma Doradus-type variable. If the latter is the case, it {{is estimated to be}} 1.39 times as massive as the Sun. According to Bayer's atlas, it lies above the bird's beak.|$|E

5|$|Sigtuna (990), one of {{the oldest}} cities in Sweden, is known for its Viking Age history and rune stones. In medieval times, coins were minted at Sigtuna, and legend <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> was the royal seat for a time, {{signified}} by the crown on its arms. The crown appeared in the city seal in 1311, and carried through to the municipal arms granted in 1971. Blazon: Azure, a crown Or between three mullets argent.|$|E
5|$|Squab pie is a {{traditional}} dish from South West England, with early records showing it was associated with Cornwall, Devon and Gloucestershire. Although the name <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> contains squab (young domestic pigeon), in fact it contains mutton and apples. The pie was eaten {{around the world in}} the 1900s, though outside South West England it generally did contain pigeon. It is no longer a popular dish, with less than 3% of British teenagers surveyed having eaten it.|$|E
5|$|T. ludovicianus is {{traditionally}} placed {{within its own}} genus as its only representative of North America, but recent DNA work <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> is closely allied with the Bewick's wren. A distinct population in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua, and in Guatemala is treated as a separate species, either known as Cabot's wren or white-browed wren (Thryothorus albinucha). It is considered a subspecies of T. ludovicianus by some authors, however.|$|E

50|$|Overall, {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} of the effect of calcium supplements in cancer prevention: some studies <b>suggest</b> <b>it</b> might decrease the risk, but others <b>suggest</b> <b>it</b> might increase the risk. Consequently, the National Cancer Institute does not recommend the use of calcium supplements for this purpose.|$|R

5|$|Young {{individuals}} have yellowish or greenish tail tips {{and engage in}} caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, within striking distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> is a daytime activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic {{study of}} South American Armillaria species {{concluded}} that A.luteobubalina is in a lineage that includes A.montagnei, {{and these are}} sister to a lineage containing A.paulensis, a species known from a single specimen collected in São Paulo, Brazil. Although they are very similar, specimens of A.luteobubalina have smaller spores than Argentinian specimens of A.montagnei, and their distinctness is well-supported with phylogenetic analysis. Based on analysis of pectic enzymes, A.luteobubalina {{is closely related to}} A.limonea, a species found in New Zealand; this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003 and 2006. Molecular analysis of 27 collections of A.luteobubalina from southwest Western Australia and one from Traralgon revealed four distinct polymorphic groups. The genetic variety <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> is native to Australia.|$|E

5|$|As its {{common name}} <b>suggests,</b> <b>it</b> is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul {{the taste of}} a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay <b>suggests,</b> <b>it</b> will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|E
5|$|Gaelic {{continued}} to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5|$|In the North Island, Māori {{cultivated}} selected {{forms of}} C.australis for food. One of these, called tī para or tī tāwhiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple ﬂeshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of C.australis, {{it has a}} rubbery, pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar Cordyline 'Thomas Kirk'. Recent and unpublished DNA work <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> derives from C.australis of the central North Island.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like Apatosaurus were too massive {{to support their}} own weight on dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now {{thought to have been}} fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of Apatosaurus <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> was a ground-height, nonselective browser. It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.|$|E
5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the date when this was done is unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> was in its present position by then.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and <b>suggests</b> <b>it</b> {{represents}} a process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process}} of acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
