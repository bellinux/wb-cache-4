40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Voltage {{calibration}} {{methods used}} with X-ray tubes are either electrical procedures requiring direct electrical connection or ionization techniques which require no electrical {{connection to the}} generating system. One major restriction {{on the use of}} electrical methods for measuring the voltage applied to X-ray tubes is that special electrical adaptors are required to bring the conductors out of the grounded tube housing or high-voltage cables. X-ray installations are not normally equipped with these special adaptors and in most cases the use of the X-ray tube would be restricted by the presence of the external high-voltage adaptor. High voltage measuring methods which do not require electrical connection to the X-ray generating system employ direct or indirect ionization techniques to measure the applied voltage. The K-edge calibration method, used in this project, is a direct ionization method based upon the detection of the K-series fluorescent radiation from various secondary radiators. The two main advantages of this method are accuracy and the elimination of electrical connections to the X-ray generating system. Published information on this method lacked data in the region extending from 40 kV to 67 kV. The lack of calibration data in this voltage range was due to the unavailability of <b>secondary</b> <b>radiator</b> elements of suitable purity. Certain rare earth elements were used to provide calibration measurements within this voltage range. The oxides of cerium, samarium, gadolinium, holmium and ytterbium were used and calibration data was obtained at 40. 43 kV, 46. 85 kV, 50. 23 kV, 55. 61 kV, and 61. 31 kV, respectively. The K-edge calibrations for tin (29. 2 kV) and tantalum (67. 5 kV) were used to provide an experimental base line. These data, combined with previous reference values, permit the use of the K-edge ionization calibration method throughout the entire voltage range commonly used in diagnostic X-ray procedures. Reproducible results can be obtained using this kilovoltage calibration method if certain variables are rigidly controlled. The geometrical arrangement of all the equipment must remain constant throughout the entire period of time during which the measurements are taken at the K-edge. Changes in geometry alter the amount of scattered radiation and the effective thickness of the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiator.</b> The oxide <b>secondary</b> <b>radiator</b> must not be subjected to mechanical shock or vibration after final positioning in the beam and its moisture content must be held constant throughout the entire measurement period. Changes in any of these parameters result in errors in the ionization chamber readings. The accuracy and wide voltage range make the K-edge ionization method of X-ray tube kilovoltage measurement a reliable procedure for use in X-ray physics. Most other kilovoltage measuring methods encounter problems at high tube currents and short exposure times. The ionization method is restricted only by the intensity limits of the ionization chambers and if these are selected properly then this method may be used at tube currents and exposure times where most other methods fail...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the coded aperture mask to high energy gamma-ray astronomy will provide the capability of locating a cosmic gamma-ray point source with a precision of a few arc-minutes above 20 MeV. Recent tests using a mask in conjunction with drift chamber detectors {{have shown that the}} expected point spread function is achieved over an acceptance cone of 25 deg. A telescope employing this technique differs from a conventional telescope only in that the presence of the mask modifies the radiation field {{in the vicinity of the}} detection plane. In addition to reducing the primary photon flux incident on the detector by absorption in the mask elements, the mask will also be a <b>secondary</b> <b>radiator</b> of gamma-rays. The various background components in a CAMTRAC (Coded Aperture Mask Track Chamber) telescope are considered. Monte-Carlo calculations are compared with recent measurements obtained using a prototype instrument in a tagged photon beam line...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{excessively}} long decays in a listening room with strong low-frequency modes is problematic, expensive, and sometimes impossible with conventional passive means. A systematic methodology {{is presented to}} design active modal equalization able to selectively reduce the mode decay rate of a loudspeaker–room system at low frequencies {{in the vicinity of}} a sound engineer’s listening location. Modal equalization is able to increase the rate of initial sound decay at mode frequencies, and can be used with conventional magnitude equalization to optimize the reproduced sound quality. Two methods of implementing active modal equalization are proposed. The first modifies the primary sound such that the mode decay rates are controlled. The second uses separate <b>secondary</b> <b>radiators</b> and controls the mode decays with additional sound fed into the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiators.</b> Case studies are presented of implementing active modal control according to the first method. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{generated}} {{pure water}} is exhausted with the residual air {{and a small}} fraction of formation heat through the “air outlet” pipe. The formation heat of the PEMFC power module is so large that the cooling subsystem is necessary to reject the redundant heat {{in order to maintain the}} optimal operating temperature of the PEMFC stack. The cooling subsystem consists of the primary and secondary radiators which reside in the lower left and lower middle sections of the power plant, respectively. The <b>secondary</b> <b>radiator</b> is applied for heat transfer of the stack condenser that is used to insure that enough process water be made available at all time for air humidification. The primary radiator will suck air and exhaust it through the shutter of the locomotive framework. Under normal conditions, the leaked hydrogen will be exhausted through the ventilation outlet of the PEMFC stack module, and the ventilation fans located on the upper side of the locomotive will assist in precluding confinement of any accidentally leaked hydrogen.|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. This paper {{describes}} a thermal switching cryogenic heat pipe, which {{is needed to}} thermally manage two CCD cameras within the ABC instrument on the NASA/JPL SIM Lite telescope. The primary requirement is to transport 12 W from the 150 K CCD cameras to a 140 K primary radiator 1. 4 m away. The heat pipe is a 1. 5 cm OD Al axial groove design with methane as the working fluid, which provides 75 W-m of transport capacity at 140 K. A secondary requirement is to periodically heat (decontaminate) the CCD cameras to 293 K with minimal heater power. To meet the decontamination requirement, the heat pipe was modified to provide thermal switching by using small diameter SS tubing to connect it to a liquid trap (LT) cooled by a small <b>secondary</b> <b>radiator</b> (SR) which is thermally isolated from the primary radiator (PR). The LT is a scaled-up version of the LTs used on the CRISM flight system. During normal operation, a small heater keeps the LT filled only with vapor. During decontamination, the LT heater is turned OFF, the PR is heated by midsized heaters and/or heat pipe conduction, the SR-cooled LT captures the working fluid effectively turning the heat pipe OFF, and a small evaporator heater raises the instrument temperature to 293 K. When the LT heater is re-enabled, the system returns to normal operation. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and testing of this demonstration system...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} number of domestic and industrial boilers are in operation in Ukraine. Nitrogen oxides are the most dangerous among all combustion products that pollute the atmosphere, therefore, one should take some measures for decreasing the formation of nitrogen oxides during combustion. The {{studies were carried out}} at the boilers of low power (100 kW) with a tubular radiator and an open end. The studies in the furnaces of industrial steam boilers having a tubular radiator with a closed end have not been done. The numerical study results of the gaseous fuel combustion processes in the furnace of a DE- 10 / 14 steam water-tube boiler are presented. The fuel-air mixture is formed by premixing the 15 % part of the air with a primary burner twist factor n= 2. 4 and a secondary burner twist factor n= 1. 6, and an air excess factor αв= 10. As a result of the studies, the temperature and velocity distributions of gases in the combustion chamber, the density of heat flows on the screen tubular surfaces, and the concentrations of the combustion components were determined. Flue gas recirculation in the volume of 80 - 100 % is provided, and the reversible movement of combustion products towards the combustion front provides a reduction in the concentration of nitrogen oxides up to 123 - 125 mg/m 3 at the furnace outlet. Disadvantages are the following: the formation of stagnant zones {{near the end of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>radiator.</b> The optimum diameter of the tubular radiator equals to two burners diameters and tubular radiator is located at a distance of one meter from the burner cutoff...|$|E
