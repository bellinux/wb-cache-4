5000|$|The program became noted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>monologues</b> {{delivered}} by Julia in indignation to other characters, a character trait {{that began in}} the second episode, when Julia verbally castigated a beauty queen who had made fun of Suzanne. That speech, which Julia ends by emphatically saying, [...] "And that, Marjorie, just so you will know, and your children will someday know....is the night....the lights....went out.....in Georgia!" [...] became a fan favorite. Dixie Carter, a registered Republican, disagreed with many of her character's left-of-center commentaries, and eventually made a deal with <b>the</b> producers that <b>for</b> every speech she gave, Julia would get to sing a song in a future episode.|$|R

5000|$|A study {{examining}} {{memory and}} embodied cognition illustrates that people remember {{more of the}} gist of a story when they physically act it out. [...] Researchers divided female participants randomly into 5 groups, which were [...] "Read Only," [...] "Writing," [...] "Collaborative Discussion," [...] "Independent Discussion," [...] and [...] "Improvisation." [...] All participants received a monologue about teen addiction and were told {{to pay attention to}} details about the character and action in <b>the</b> <b>monologue.</b> Participants were given 5 minutes to read <b>the</b> <b>monologue</b> twice, unaware of a future recall test. In the [...] "Read Only" [...] condition participants filled out unrelated questionnaires after reading <b>the</b> <b>monologue.</b> In <b>the</b> [...] "Writing" [...] condition participants responded to 5 questions about the story {{from the perspective of the}} character in <b>the</b> <b>monologue.</b> They had 6 minutes to answer each question. In the [...] "Collaborative Discussion" [...] condition participants responded from the character's perspective to the same questions as the [...] "Writing" [...] group, but in groups of 4 or 5 women. They were also given 6 minutes per question and everyone participated in answering each question. The [...] "Independent Discussion" [...] condition was the same as the [...] "Collaborative Discussion," [...] except 1 person answered each question. In the [...] "Improvisation" [...] condition participants acted out 5 scenes from <b>the</b> <b>monologue</b> in groups of 5 women. The researchers suggest that this condition involves embodied cognition and will produce better memory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>monologue.</b> Every participant played the main character and a supporting character once. Participants were given short prompts from lines in <b>the</b> <b>monologue,</b> which were excluded from the memory test. Participants had 2 minutes to choose characters and 4 minutes <b>for</b> improvisations. <b>The</b> recall test was <b>the</b> <b>monologue</b> with 96 words or phrases missing. Participants had to fill in the blanks as accurately as possible.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{monologue}} data such as {{lecture and}} commentary by professionals {{have been considered}} as valuable intellectual resources, and have been gathering attention. On the other hand, {{in order to use}} these monologue data effectively and efficiently, it is necessary <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>monologue</b> data not only just to be accumulated but also to be structured. This paper describes the construction of a Japanese spoken monologue corpus in which dependency structure is given to each utterance. Spontaneous monologue includes a lot of very long sentences composed of two or more clauses. In these sentences, there may exist the subject or the adverb common to multi-clauses, and it may be considered that the subject or adverb depend on multi-predicates. In order to give the dependency information in a real fashion, our research allows that a bunsetsu depends on multiple bunsetsus. 1...|$|R
