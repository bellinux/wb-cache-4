40|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>Functioning</b> in Breast Cancer Survivors Heidi M. King ABSTRACT Breast cancer {{diagnosis}} and treatment has been suggested to effect <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Little is known about how breast cancer patients compare to women without a history of cancer on measures of <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning,</b> {{as well as the}} psychological and physical factors may contribute to these difficulties. To address these issues, 71 breast cancer patients and 40 of their nominated friends were recruited and served as participants. All women received and returned via the mail measures on general background information, depression, fatigue, marital satisfaction, body image, vaginal symptoms, and <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> All the psychological and physical variables assessed correlated with a measure of overall <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> in the expected directions. With the exception of the physical variable of vaginal problems (p = 006), where the patient group reported more problems, the groups did not differ on any remaining physical or psychological variables. On the overall measure of <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning,</b> {{no significant differences were found}} between the two groups. Additional exploratory analyses in which only women treated with chemotherapy were compared to the non-cancer participants yield similar patterns of results. In addition, there was no evidence of interactive effects of age and breast cancer status on <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> These results suggest that <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> in women treated for breast cancer is similar that of a non-cancer comparison with the exception of more menopausal symptoms. Continued research and interventions towards addressing menopausal symptoms may lead to even improved <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> among breast cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Goal: To {{longitudinally}} investigate <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> in {{testicular cancer}} patients {{during the first}} year, and {{examine the effect of}} relationship status (with a partner or single) and depressive symptoms on <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Patients and methods: 93 testicular cancer patients (39 % single) treated in two large referral centers for testicular cancer filled in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and CES-D after orchiectomy (T 1) and 3 (T 2) and 12 (T 3) months later. Results: Orgasmic functioning, overall satisfaction and total <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> decreased between T 1 and T 2 and increased to an above T 1 level at T 3. Levels of erectile functioning and intercourse satisfaction were higher at T 3 than at T 1 and T 2. Desire remained stable. Type of treatment did not affect <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Singles reported worse <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> at all measurement times than committed patients, and comparable desire. One year after surgery, singles also reported worse <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> on three domains when compared with norms. Depressive symptoms were highest and significantly but weakly related to one domain of <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> at T 1, to three domains at T 2, and to none at T 3. Early depressive symptoms had small to moderate predictive power on <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> at T 2, but not at T 3. Conclusion: <b>Sexual</b> <b>functioning,</b> but not desire, fluctuates during the first year after testicular cancer. Type of treatment and depressive symptoms were no risk factors for sexual dysfunction in the longer term. Singles reported more sexual problems than patients in a relationship and norms, they may need more information and guidance concerning their sexuality.

5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and <b>sexual</b> <b>function.</b> Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E
5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. <b>Sexual</b> <b>function</b> has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury.

Aim: To determine whether, and to what degree, body image concerns (evaluative, affective, and behavioral) influence aspects of women’s <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> (desire, arousal, and orgasm). Methods: Eighty-eight sexually active women in heterosexual romantic relationships completed surveys assessing evaluative, affective, and behavioral body image and <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Body composition data also were collected using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Main Outcome Measures: <b>Sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> was assessed using the desire, arousal, and orgasm subscales of the Female <b>Sexual</b> <b>Functioning</b> Index. Results: Hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that poor evaluative, affective, and behavioral body image were detrimental to women's <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Specifically, dissatisfaction with one's body predicted decrements in desire (β = − 0. 31, P <. 05) and arousal (β = − 0. 35, P <. 01). Similarly, feeling that others evaluate one's body negatively predicted decrements in desire (β = 0. 22, P <. 05) and arousal (β = 0. 35, P < . 01). Feeling negatively about one’s appearance predicted decrements in arousal (β = 0. 26, P <. 05). Negative thoughts and feelings about one’s body during a sexual encounter (body image self-consciousness) predicted decrements in arousal (β = − 0. 37, P <. 01) and orgasm (β = − 0. 25, P <. 05). Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest important linkages between body image and <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> constructs and indicates that interventions to improve body image could have concomitant benefits related to sexual experience...|$|R

An electronic database research was performed to identify all the studies on the relation between endometriosis and <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> published in the period 2000 to 2016.

After the screening process, a total of 9 studies investigating the relation between endometriosis and female <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> were considered. Overall, these studies indicated that around two thirds of women with endometriosis have some form of sexual dysfunction not limited to deep dyspareunia. These findings suggest that the global sexual impact of endometriosis requires further investigation, focusing not only on pain during intercourse but also on psychological and relational dimensions, including partner's <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Because <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon, the ideal treatment for endometriosis-related sexual dysfunctions should be conducted by a multidisciplinary team composed of gynecologists, sexologists, and psychologists/psychotherapists...|$|R
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect <b>sexual</b> <b>function,</b> and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E

40|$|Introduction.   There {{has been}} little {{research}} published {{on the impact of}} intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) methods on <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Aims.   This study aimed: (i) to assess different aspects of <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning,</b> including the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women using a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS); (ii) to compare this prevalence with that among copper-releasing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) users; and (iii) to identify the relationship between psychological variables and <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> in women using one of the aforementioned IUCs. Methods.   In a multicenter cross-sectional study, 845 women with an IUC were invited to fill out a questionnaire. The latter was returned by 402 (48 %) of them: 353 women were LNG-IUS users (88 %) and 49 were Cu-IUD users (12 %). The questions asked pertained to depression, well-being, marital relation quality, and <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Main Outcome Measures.   <b>Sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> was measured with the Short <b>Sexual</b> <b>Functioning</b> Scale. Results.   One-third of LNG-IUS users (33 %) reported a sexual dysfunction. Of those, 20 % reported an increased sexual desire, 25 % a decreased sexual desire, 5 % arousal problems, and 8 % orgasm problems. Women using a LNG-IUS did not differ significantly in distribution, type, or prevalence (32. 9 % vs. 36. 7 %) of sexual dysfunction, nor in depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory score; 4. 7 vs. 3. 9; P =  0. 33), general well-being (WHO- 5 well-being scale score; 16. 8 vs. 17. 7; P =  0. 170), or partner relationship quality (Dyadic Adjustment Scale score; 107 vs. 108; P =  0. 74) compared to Cu-IUD users. Overall, the perceived influence of IUCs on <b>sexual</b> <b>functioning</b> was in the lower range and did not differentiate LNG-IUS greatly from Cu-IUD-users.

5|$|Although {{problems}} with <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their <b>sexual</b> <b>function</b> and benefit from education about it.

Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject.
