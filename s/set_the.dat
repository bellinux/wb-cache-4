On these tyres, Hamilton <b>set</b> <b>the</b> fastest time, followed by Button and Ricciardo. The track dried quickly however, and soon the cars returned to the pit lane to switch to slick tyres. Hülkenberg twice <b>set</b> <b>the</b> fastest time, but was beaten to pole position by Hamilton. Rosberg went faster as well, but lost his second place on the grid to Hülkenberg due to his five-place grid penalty. Vettel went fourth fastest, but was relegated as well, handing third on the grid to Button, who had <b>set</b> <b>the</b> fifth fastest time. Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Valtteri Bottas, Verstappen and Felipe Massa rounded up the top ten. It was Hülkenberg's second front row start of his career, the first having been his pole position at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Hill's {{entered his}} first drag race at the Flying Fish Lodge in Karnack, Texas in 1955. Hill drove his home-built hot rod {{to the track}} and won the event. The hot rod had a Model T frame and an Oldsmobile V8 engine. In 1958, he built his second dragster using parts that his {{employer}} allowed him to scavenge {{while working as a}} sales engineer at a foundry in Wichita Falls, Texas. He used the dragster to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> Texas state low elapsed time (e.t.) that year with a 9.93-second pass. The following year, Hill won the state championship with a 9.25-second pass at 161miles per hour (259kilometers per hour). Hill won his first national event in 1959 in a Hot Gas race at an American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) national championship event in Great Bend, Kansas. Hill earned $500 for an appearance at Inyokern, California to race Jack Chrisman and his Sidewinder dragster. One of his four passes in the 1960 event <b>set</b> <b>the</b> B/Gas dragster record at 163.04mph (262.39km/h), so Hill quit his job to become a full-time drag racer. Later that season he <b>set</b> <b>the</b> a new A/Gas low e.t. at 8.84seconds and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> speed record in the class at 161.29mph (259.57km/h).|$|E
