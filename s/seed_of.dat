5|$|The games {{interacted with}} each other: players could begin {{with any of}} the three titles and have the actions of the first game affect the story of the other two, a concept {{conceived}} by Okamoto. More than ten of Flagship's scenarists, among them Resident Evil writer Junichi Miyashita, worked simultaneously on the three stories. The developers considered using a cell phone adapter to transfer data, but later decided on a password system. The limitations of this system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too complicated, so the team scaled back to two titles at Miyamoto's suggestion. Condensing the games into a single cartridge was never considered, as the prospect of multiple endings and the added replay value afforded by the ability to play the titles in either order was very attractive. Oracle of Seasons was adapted from Mystical <b>Seed</b> <b>of</b> Power, Oracle of Ages was adapted from Mystical <b>Seed</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom, and Mystical <b>Seed</b> <b>of</b> Courage was canceled.|$|E

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> size on the {{germination}} and seedling {{development was}} carried out on four local varieties of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) walp), oloyin,drum, ifebrown and local white.

Six <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> each sort were planted in a plastic pot filled with sandy-loamy soil in three replicates.

40|$|The {{effect of}} several saline {{solutions}} (as given by six salts) and salt stress (as given by 0. 1 - 2 m sodium chloride solutions) on the germination <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> six selected tropical forest tree species was investigated. Saline solutions (0. 2 m) {{of the six}} salts used had highly significant effects on seed germination {{in most of the}} tree species. Sodium sulphate (Na 2 So 4) permitted germination in the <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> Ceiba pentandra and Tectona grandis presoaked in its 0. 2 m solution for 36 and 48 h respectively. The Zinc sulphate (ZnSO 4) solution enhanced the germination <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> Terminalia ivorensis and Terminalia superba. Solution of Potassium per Manganate favoured the germination <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> T. grandis, T. ivorensis and T. superba.

5|$|Allan Cunningham sent <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> G.juniperina to England in 1820; it {{was grown}} there the {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage. Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a skin rash.|$|E
