5|$|Local {{residents}} have become critical of Hyde Park as a concert venue, {{due to the}} sound levels, and have campaigned for a maximum <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> of 73 decibels. In June 2012, Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney found their microphones switched off after Springsteen had played a three-hour set during the Park's Hard Rock Calling festival, and overshot the 10:30pm curfew time.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E

25|$|A Weighting {{curve is}} a graph {{of a set}} of factors, that are used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is frequency weighting in <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> for example by the use of a weighting filter in a <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> meter, to arrive at readings of loudness in Phons or in decibels (dB) above the threshold of hearing. (see A-weighting).|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of a Windflow Technology turbine installed at Gebbies Pass near Christchurch encountered opposition from local residents who raised concerns about noise. The neighbouring valley was very sheltered, and therefore had very little background sound. Because of this, Windflow offered to comply with low <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> of 30 dBA, 10 dBA lower than the District Council's usual requirement of 40 dBA. However, <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> were at 35 dBA, so Windflow modified the gearbox, which reduced the turbine's <b>sound.</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>levels</b> were again measured and this time be within the requirement of its resource consent.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} from sound {{overexposure}} has a considerable prevalence. Identification of sound hazards is crucial, as prevention, {{due to a}} lack of definitive therapies, is the sole alternative to hearing aids. One subjectively loud, yet little studied, potential sound hazard is movie theaters. This study uses smart phones to evaluate their applicability as a widely available, validated <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> (SPL) meter. Therefore, this study measures <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> in movie theaters to determine whether <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> exceed safe occupational noise exposure limits and whether <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> in movie theaters differ as a function of movie, movie theater, presentation time, and seat location within the theater. DESIGN Six smart phones with an SPL meter software application were calibrated with a precision SPL meter and validated as an SPL meter. Additionally, three different smart phone generations were measured in comparison to an integrating SPL meter. Two different movies, an action movie and a children's movie, were measured six times each in 10 different venues (n = 117). To maximize representativeness, movies were selected focusing on large release productions with probable high attendance. Movie theaters were selected in the San Francisco, CA, area based on whether they screened both chosen movies and to represent the largest variety of theater proprietors. Measurements were analyzed in regard to differences between theaters, location within the theater, movie, as well as presentation time and day as indirect indicator of film attendance. RESULTS The smart phone measurements demonstrated high accuracy and reliability. Overall, <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> in movie theaters do not exceed safe exposure limits by occupational standards. <b>Sound</b> <b>levels</b> vary significantly across theaters and demonstrated statistically significant higher <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> and exposures in the action movie compared to the children's movie. <b>Sound</b> <b>levels</b> decrease with distance from the screen. However, no influence on time of day or day of the week as indirect indicator of film attendance could be found. CONCLUSIONS Calibrated smart phones with an appropriate software application as used in this study can be utilized as a validated SPL meter. Because of the wide availability, smart phones in combination with the software application can provide high quantity recreational sound exposure measurements, which can facilitate the identification of potential noise hazards. <b>Sound</b> <b>levels</b> in movie theaters decrease with distance to the screen, but do not exceed safe occupational noise exposure limits. Additionally, there are significant differences in <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> across movie theaters and movies, but not in presentation time...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{measurements}} {{in building}} acoustics are measurements of <b>sound</b> <b>levels.</b> The measured <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> can be broadband or band-limited, frequency-weighted, and time-averaged or time-weighted.

25|$|The devocalization {{procedure}} {{does not}} take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark {{just as much as}} before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half as loud as before, or less, and it is not as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> and sharpness of the dog's bark.|$|E
25|$|According to the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, {{the risk}} of hearing damage from digital audio players depends on both <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> and {{listening}} time. The listening habits of most users are unlikely to cause hearing loss, but some people are putting their hearing at risk, because they set the volume control very high or listen to music at high levels for many hours per day. Such listening habits may result in temporary or permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, and difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments.|$|E
25|$|Although A-weighting {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a quasi-peak detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones. Psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow-band circuits are common.|$|E

40|$|A {{listening}} {{test was}} conducted to investigate whether A-or C-weighed <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> are most suitable as indicator of annoyance due to wind turbine noise. The tests consisted of fifteen different wind turbine noises presented at eight <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> together with pink noise signals as reference sounds. A total number of 31 persons performed the listening test divided into two subgroups. The first group comprising of 20 students conducted the test in a semi anechoic chamber, and the second group of 11 residents annoyed by wind turbine noise in their homes, conducted the test in their own homes. Results from both subgroups showed that A-weighed <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> were a more accurate description of wind turbine noise annoyance than C-weighed <b>sound</b> <b>levels.</b> The residents found the same wind turbine noises more annoying than the students, indicating a higher sensitivity to wind turbine noise among persons a priori annoyed by this noise and exposed to this source in their residential settings.

25|$|A-weighting {{began with}} work by Fletcher and Munson which {{resulted}} in their publication, in 1933, {{of a set of}} equal-loudness contours. Three years later these curves were used in the first American standard for <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> meters. This ANSI standard, later revised as ANSI S1.4-1981, incorporated B-weighting as well as the A-weighting curve, recognising the unsuitability of the latter for anything other than low-level measurements. But B-weighting has since fallen into disuse. Later work, first by Zwicker and then by Schomer, attempted to overcome the difficulty posed by different levels, and work by the BBC resulted in the CCIR-468 weighting, currently maintained as ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which gives more representative readings on noise as opposed to pure tones.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, it will {{be noted}} that A-weighting {{would be a better}} match to the {{loudness}} curve if it fell much more steeply above 10kHz, and it is likely that this compromise came about because steep filters were difficult to construct {{in the early days of}} electronics. Nowadays, no such limitation need exist, as demonstrated by the ITU-R 468 curve. If A-weighting is used without further band-limiting it is possible to obtain different readings on different instruments when ultrasonic, or near ultrasonic noise is present. Accurate measurements therefore require a 20kHz low-pass filter to be combined with the A-weighting curve in modern instruments. This is defined in IEC 61012 as AU weighting and while very desirable, is rarely fitted to commercial <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> meters.|$|E
25|$|SFO {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. {{airports}} to conduct a residential sound abatement retrofitting program. Established by the FAA in the early 1980s, this program evaluated the cost effectiveness of reducing interior sound levels for homes near the airport, within the 65 CNEL noise contour. The program made use of a noise computer model to predict improvement in specific residential interiors for a variety of noise control strategies. This pilot program was conducted for a neighborhood in South San Francisco and success was achieved in all of the homes analyzed. The costs turned out to be modest, and the post-construction interior <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> tests confirmed the predictions for noise abatement. To date over $153 million has been spent to insulate more than 15,000 homes in the neighboring cities of Daly City, Pacifica, San Bruno, and South San Francisco.|$|E
