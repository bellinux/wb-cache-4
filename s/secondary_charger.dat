Ignition of the <b>secondary</b> <b>charge</b> was accomplished by the high pressure gases behind the bullet. Resulting muzzle velocities were determined for various amounts of three granular and one liquid propellant. Pressure-time curves were obtained for one of the faster burning powders. Adiabatic bomb calorimeter testing and published data were used to determine the heats of combustion. The data suggested that the rate of energy release, and not the heat of combustion, was the dominant factor in this experiment. A velocity increase of three per cent and a kinetic energy increase of seven per cent were obtained for eight milliliters of <b>secondary</b> <b>charge.</b> The results also indicated that a more optimum location of the <b>secondary</b> <b>charge</b> was possible.

The <b>secondary</b> <b>charge</b> exchange of hot and/or fast neutral H with cold (∼ 7500 K—McComas et al. (2012, 2015); Schwadron et al. (2015); Bzowski et al.

50|$|A {{shrapnel}} shell {{consists of a}} shell casing filled with steel or lead balls suspended in a resin matrix, with a small explosive charge {{at the base of}} the shell. When the projectile is fired, it travels a pre-set distance along a ballistic trajectory, then the fuse ignites a relatively weak <b>secondary</b> <b>charge</b> (often black powder or cordite) in the base of the shell. This charge fractures the matrix holding the balls in place and expels the nose of the shell to open a path for the balls, which are then propelled out of the front of the shell without rupturing the casing (which falls to earth harmlessly and can be retrieved and reused). These balls continue onward to the target, spreading out in a cone-shaped pattern at ground level, with most of their energy coming from the original velocity of the shell itself rather than the lesser force of the <b>secondary</b> <b>charge</b> that freed them from the shell. Since the cone of impact is relatively small, no more than 10 to 15 times the diameter of the shell, true {{shrapnel shell}}s needed to be carefully sighted and judiciously used in order to maximize their impact on the enemy.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe density {{function}} theory {{is used to}} study the density profiles and the transport properties of an ion-exchange membrane system submitted to an electric potential drop. As the ionic density increases, hard sphere interaction between ions becomes dominant and the ion size {{must be taken into}} account. The results show that the density distribution and the transport properties depend on the bulk electrolyte density. At equilibrium the charge inside the electric double layer (EDL) adjacent to the membrane decreases and the membrane electric potential increases as the bulk density increases. For high bulk density of unsymmetric electrolyte, <b>secondary</b> <b>charge</b> layers are observed inside the EDL. In the membrane the anion-density-to-bulk-density ratio increases when the bulk density increases from small to moderate values owing to the membrane potential increase. But it decreases abruptly at high bulk density values owing to the increase of the non-ideal electrostatic interaction. At a given electric potential drop, the current/voltage curves follow the variation of this ratio with respect to the bulk density at equilibrium. As the current density approaches the limiting one, the amplitude of the <b>secondary</b> <b>charge</b> layers decreases and the EDL thickness increases...|$|R

The maximum dust charge density was ~&minus; 3. 5 &times; 10 9 e m&minus; 3 and the dust layer was characterized by a few strong dust layers where the dust charge density at the upper edges changed by factors 2 – 3 over a distance of &#x 2272; 10 m, while the same change at their lower edges were much more gradual. The upper edge of this layer is also sharp, with {{a change in the}} probe current from zero to IDC=&minus; 10 &minus; 11 A over ~ 10 m, while the same change at the low edge occurs over ~ 500 m. The second dust layer at ~ 85 – 92 km was in the height range of a comparatively weak PMSE layer and the maximum dust charge density was ~&minus; 10 8 e m&minus; 3 . This demonstrates that PMSE can be formed even if the ratio of the dust charge density to the electron density P=NdZd /n_e&#x 2272; 0. 01. In spite of the {{dust detector}} being constructed to reduce possible <b>secondary</b> <b>charging</b> effects from dust impacts, it was found that they were clearly present during the passage through both layers.
