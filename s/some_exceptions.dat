5|$|In 2009, 86% of cadmium {{was used}} in batteries, {{predominantly}} in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2V. The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide). The European Union put a limit on cadmium in electronics in 2004 of 0.01%, with <b>some</b> <b>exceptions,</b> and reduced the limit on cadmium content to 0.002%.|$|E
5|$|The various {{philosophical}} {{theories in}} the early Upanishads {{have been attributed to}} famous sages such as Yajnavalkya, Uddalaka Aruni, Shvetaketu, Shandilya, Aitareya, Balaki, Pippalada, and Sanatkumara. Women, such as Maitreyi and Gargi participate in the dialogues and are also credited {{in the early}} Upanishads.There are <b>some</b> <b>exceptions</b> to the anonymous tradition of the Upanishads. The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, for example, includes closing credits to sage Shvetashvatara, and he is considered the author of the Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated {{that it was impossible to}} develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally. She noted that, while there were <b>some</b> <b>exceptions,</b> most Heathen groups were 60–70% male in their composition.|$|E

5|$|Bank of America Stadium {{is owned}} entirely by the Panthers, making them {{one of the}} few teams in the NFL to own the {{facility}} they play in. The stadium was specially designed by HOK Sports Facilities Group for football and also serves as the headquarters and administrative offices of the Panthers. On some days the stadium offers public tours for a fee. Private tours for groups are offered for a fee seven days a week, though there are <b>some</b> <b>exceptions,</b> and such tours must be arranged in advance.|$|E
5|$|Niobium in the Earth's crust {{comprises}} one stable isotope, 93Nb. By 2003, {{at least}} 32 radioisotopes had been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 113. The most stable {{of these is}} 92Nb with a half-life of 34.7million years. One of the least stable is 113Nb, with an estimated half-life of 30milliseconds. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable 93Nb tend to decay by β+ decay, {{and those that are}} heavier tend to decay by β− decay, with <b>some</b> <b>exceptions.</b> 81Nb, 82Nb, and 84Nb have minor β+ delayed proton emission decay paths, 91Nb decays by electron capture and positron emission, and 92Nb decays by both β+ and β− decay.|$|E
5|$|Smilodon {{and other}} saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted {{patterns}} (which {{appears to be}} the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species that live in the open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with <b>some</b> <b>exceptions.</b> Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.|$|E

In gene finding, {{the hidden}} Markov models usually {{have to be}} {{expanded}} to include additional requirements, such as the codon frame information, site-specific statistics, and state-duration probability information, and must also follow <b>some</b> <b>exception</b> rules. For example, the start of an initial exon typically begins with [...] "ATG", final exons end with a stop codon [...]...|$|R
5|$|The code defines how {{sequences}} of nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid {{will be added}} next during protein synthesis. With <b>some</b> <b>exceptions,</b> a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme {{is often referred to}} as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply the genetic code, though variant codes (such as in human mitochondria) exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{first group}} of {{converts}} to Islam in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside. This {{was followed by the}} general acceptance of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, with <b>some</b> <b>exceptions.</b> According to Ibn Ishaq, this was influenced by the conversion of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (a prominent Medinan leader) to Islam. Medinans who converted to Islam and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>some</b> <b>exceptions</b> to {{this general}} rule. Gallium and {{germanium}} have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively {{because of the}} d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity. The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth, {{appears to be an}} artifact of data selection (and data availability)—methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Robinson Crusoe of the novel, who craved human contact, {{most of the}} Warsaw Crusoes {{tried to}} avoid it at all cost. This contradiction was noted by both the Robinsons and those who wrote about them after the war. Being {{discovered}} by the Germans in almost all cases meant immediate death. There were, however, <b>some</b> <b>exceptions,</b> the best known being that of Szpilman's encounter with Wilm Hosenfeld, a captain of the Wehrmacht who helped to hide and feed him. In a few instances those captured were first forced to help the Germans with the looting of the city's ruins, before being either executed or sent to the Pruszków camp.|$|E
5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, there are <b>some</b> <b>exceptions</b> to this general rule, {{especially when the}} proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are <b>some</b> <b>exceptions.</b> Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
