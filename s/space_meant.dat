5|$|Sega {{was able}} to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row due to the Genesis' head start, a lower price point, and a larger library of games when {{compared}} to the Super Nintendo at its release. Sega had ten games for every game on SNES, and while the SNES had an exclusive version of Final Fight, one of Sega's internal development teams created Streets of Rage, which had bigger levels, tougher enemies, and a well-regarded soundtrack. ASCII Entertainment reported in the spring of 1993 that Genesis had 250 titles versus 75 for Super Nintendo, but limited shelf <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> that stores typically offered 100 Genesis and 50 Super Nintendo titles. The NES was still the leader, with 300 titles and 100 on shelves.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} between 27 February and 25 April 1967. The budget was £275,000. At this time, Hammer was {{operating}} out of the Associated British Studios in Elstree, Borehamwood. However, a lack of <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> that production was relocated to the nearby MGM Borehamwood studio. There were no other productions working at the MGM Studios at this time so the Quatermass crew had full {{access to all the}} facilities of the studio. Roy Ward Baker was particularly pleased {{to be able to use}} MGM's extensive backlot for the exteriors of the Underground station. The production team included many Hammer regulars, including production designer Bernard Robinson who, as an in-joke, incorporated a poster for Hammer's The Witches (1966) into the dressing of his set for the Hobbs End station. Another Hammer regular was special effects supervisor Les Bowie. Roy Ward Baker recalled he had a row with Bowie, who believed the film was entirely a special effects picture, when he tried to run the first pre-production conference. Bowie's contribution to the film included the Martian massacre scene, which was achieved with a mixture of puppets and live locusts, and model sequences of London's destruction, including the climactic scene of the crane swinging into the Martian apparition.|$|E
25|$|The Rose turret was a roomy design {{equipped}} with two M2 Browning heavy machine guns. The turret {{was driven by}} hydraulics, and the hydraulic system was easier to use than that in previous designs. The considerable internal <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> that the turret could be fitted with two seats: a layout in which one man operated the guns and the other fed targeting data into the gunsight computer was developed, but not used in practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{studio was}} {{relocated}} {{to the former}} Olympia Knitting Mills building in the late 1990s, and added a 16-track tape machine. The extra <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> the studio could serve as offices for K Records and provide artist and musician housing. Other businesses in the mill included independent musician service companies offering services such as tour booking, promotion, and artist studio space. In 2016, Johnson acknowledged that the studio hadn't generated the income he had anticipated for the label.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the house}} {{reflects}} changing tastes as well. The interior's rooms are less grand than most earlier Victorian homes, suggesting a <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> for living {{as opposed to}} entertaining, and the more open placement {{of the kitchen and}} other backrooms suggest a more egalitarian attitude than a strictly Victorian home would. The contrast between the values of the Queen Anne style and the Colonial Revival is also represented by the marbleized mantelpiece and unpainted oak stair respectively.|$|E
25|$|Moving {{into the}} 20th century, the Jewellery Quarter {{benefited from the}} actions of the {{initiatives}} set up for jewellers and the industry grew to a size it had not witnessed. It reached a peak in 1914 with over 20,000 people being employed in the trade in the area. The suppliers of precious stones, tools and packaging also benefited. Throughout the growth, the Jewellery Quarter maintained its composition of small workshops with the larger factories being located on the northern fringe, producing lower quality jewellery. The lack of <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> that courts of worker's properties were being taken up by business owners to expand their businesses.|$|E

Through their attacks on cafés cantantes and their promotion of the sardana and choral societies, Catalan nationalists posited an identity that denied the industrial system that Catalans themselves created and that effaced the problems that came with it. In the end, however, the Catalan nationalists’ attempts to render flamenco performers and their performances obsolete failed because foreigners and profit-seeking Catalans and Andalusians kept stoking the flames of an exoticized Barcelona...|$|R

25|$|Paddington {{approaches}} {{had been}} resignalled by British Rail {{in the early}} 1990s to allow bidirectional working. The number of signals and limited trackside <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> that most signals were in gantries over the tracks; the curvature of the lines meant {{that it was not}} always obvious which signal was for which track. Reflective line identification signs had therefore been added but, the inquiry report noted, they were closer to the signal to the right hand side than to the signal for the line to which they related. However, misreading of which signal related to which track cannot have caused the fatal crash, because at the time all the other gantry 8 signals were also showing red.|$|E
25|$|The Labor/ICC and Archives {{buildings}} were opened in 1935. Numerous strikes (see below) had delayed {{the opening of}} the building for almost a year. In April 1934, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins asked for additional (if minor) design changes. Pressing needs for office <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> that a portion of the ICC building was occupied before the structure was finished. Minor alterations were made to the Labor building (such as creating a private rather than shared bathroom for the female Secretary) in January 1935. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins dedicated the two buildings at a ceremony in the Departmental Auditorium on February 26, 1935, attended by AFL President William Green. The Labor building's final cost was $4.5 million and the ICC portion of the structure cost $4.45 million. The two {{buildings were}} connected by the 2,000-seat Departmental Auditorium (renamed the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in 1987). Meanwhile, construction forged ahead on the Archives building. Already considered too small to hold all the materials in its possession, a proposal had been made to add another story to the building. This proposal was rejected in March 1935. The National Archives building was occupied in November 1935, but had no formal dedication. Although the Archives structure {{had been one of the}} top priorities of almost all planners, it was one of the last buildings to be opened. Archives staff began moving into the building in November 1935, and the exhibition rotunda was opened to the public in November 1936. Records were not transferred in large numbers to the building until April 1937.|$|E
2500|$|The library {{has also}} tried to provide public space for various activities, such as study and leisure reading, though its history {{is marked by a}} {{struggle}} to do this consistently. The lack of <b>space</b> <b>meant</b> the popularity of the original library was something of an embarrassment. The 1968 building was more spacious, especially after later alterations. 1973 saw the addition of the mezzanine floor; and 1993, the addition of a Young Adult room, as well as a Large Print lounge. However, there was little room for much expansion, which led to the curtailment of some service development. This {{was one of the reasons}} for the new building project started in 2005. The temporary location in the Leisure Centre, offered two tables in the magazine-newspaper-computer area, along with a few sofa chairs. The Children's section also had some seating (pictured). But, after pressure from Cr Hartley the children's play equipment was cut back by more than half. [...] The original costs was to spend $80,000 on the children and the final cost was only $30,000 and the landscaping was also slashed, a reduction that is reflected in the final arrangements.|$|E

5000|$|The use of {{ablative}} cooling, high-pressure steel construction, {{and large}} [...] "empty" [...] <b>spaces</b> <b>meant</b> that a CRPU was heavy, with relatively low performance. The {{diameter of the}} tubing also put a hard limit on the engine diameter, preventing use of an efficient, high-expansion nozzle for the upper stages. However, ganging CRPUs into three stages was sufficient to reach orbit. Meanwhile, the low cost of each CRPU, after the economies of scale gained by producing hundreds or possibly thousands of them per year, would have still left the vehicle cheaper than its contemporaries. Additionally, {{the large number of}} small engines firing simultaneously would have given a high degree of reliability and a relatively smooth ride.|$|R
40|$|Being {{acquainted with}} the sports practiced in a town implies {{necessarily}} {{an analysis of the}} geographical space where these activities take place. In this sense, this study tried to check how the sports leisure spaces are portrayed in the specific literature. For this purpose, three spatial expressions of leisure in the city were analysed: the square, the park and the public school. The distinction presented in the literature, mainly the one referring to architecture and urbanism, is not enough to delimit the public <b>spaces</b> <b>meant</b> for leisure in a sports perspective. Though it is an important space of relation and symbolic exchanges regarding culture and the shaping of citizenship, conceptional constructions have not contributed to the development of sports leisure in the city...|$|R

40|$|The {{discussion}} on the educational systems in varied countries seems endless. There are different viewpoints {{from one country to}} another; yet, as the demand on the labour market has become global and, implicitly, the access to the jobs has been extended, the question naturally rises, to what extent are the educational systems convergent and can they generate an identical offer, based on similar skills of the candidates from different countries, aspects which should create equal employment opportunities.

Nek Chand’s Rock Garden in the Chandigarh city of India is an environmental education spot visited by millions of tourists each year. City administration considered this project as violation of city’s master plan in the beginning but later on agreed to maintain this monument.

40|$|We {{tackle the}} problem of the {{estimation}} of a vector of means from a single vector-valued observation $y$. Whereas previous work reduces the size of the estimates for the largest (absolute) sample elements via shrinkage (like James-Stein) or biases estimated via empirical Bayes methodology, we take a novel approach. We adapt recent developments by Lee et al (2013) in post selection inference for the Lasso to the orthogonal setting, where sample elements have different underlying signal sizes. This is exactly the setup encountered when estimating many means. It is shown that other selection procedures, like selecting the $K$ largest (absolute) sample elements and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, can be cast into their framework, allowing us to leverage their results. Point and interval estimates for signal sizes are proposed. These seem to perform quite well against competitors, both recent and more tenured. Furthermore, we prove an upper bound to the worst case risk of our estimator, when combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, and show that it is within a constant multiple of the minimax risk over a rich set of parameter <b>spaces</b> <b>meant</b> to evoke sparsity.
