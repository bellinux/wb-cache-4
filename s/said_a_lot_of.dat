500|$|Before Yao's {{first meeting}} with Shaquille O'Neal on January 17, 2003, O'Neal said, [...] "Tell Yao Ming, Ching chong-yang-wah-ah-soh", {{prompting}} accusations of racism. O'Neal denied that his comments were racist, {{and said he was}} only joking. Yao also said he believed O'Neal was joking, but he <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Asians would not see the humor. In the game, Yao scored the Rockets' first six points of the game and blocked O'Neal twice in the opening minutes as well as altering two other shots by O'neal, all 4 of those attempts coming right at the rim, and made a game-sealing dunk with 10seconds left in overtime. Yao finished with 10points, 10rebounds, and 6blocks; O'Neal recorded 31points, 13rebounds, and 0blocks. O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the final}} line-up was decided, they flew to Italy to {{become acquainted with}} each other. Speaking about this first meeting, Stevens remarked that the group [...] "felt {{comfortable}} with each other from the beginning". Several {{members of the group}} have since stated that the [...] "S" [...] in S Club 7 stands for Simon, after the group's creator, although the official line has always been ambiguous. The group's entry on the Popjustice website states that at one point they were nearly called [...] "Sugar Club" [...] instead of the name that stuck. [...] Another theory is that the group is so-named because [...] "S" [...] is the first letter of the word [...] "seven". McIntosh, in a December 2012 interview, <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Simon Fuller's success has been based on the number 19 (owning 19 Entertainment); therefore, as [...] "S" [...] is the 19th letter of the alphabet, the [...] "S" [...] was put into S Club 7.|$|E
500|$|During the 2016 Republican primaries, McCain said {{he would}} support the Republican nominee {{even if it was}} Donald Trump, but {{following}} Mitt Romney's March 3 speech, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's [...] "uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues". [...] Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as [...] "crazies", and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: [...] "He insulted me, and he insulted everyone in that room... He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he's <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> very bad things about a lot of people." [...] Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump. [...] McCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election. The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trmp voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements. [...] However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy broke, he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump. McCain stated that Trump's [...] "demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults" [...] made it [...] "impossible to continue to offer even conditional support" [...] and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead [...] "write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president." [...] McCain, now 80 years of age, went on to defeat Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States States Senator from Arizona.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a New York Times article, saying [...] "In a way, Joe's right.

In the post-fight interview, Bellew said, [...] "I’m over the moon, listen it’s over, it’s put to bed. We <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things.

In August 2010, RedOne revealed that he was working on Scherzinger's debut album, stating: [...] "I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it wasn't consistent. Her new record – it's the real her." [...] Scherzinger <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> her first studio album was about her split with Lewis Hamilton before they reunited. Scherzinger said that she wanted to create songs which [...] "lend themselves to live performances". She said she likes to record [...] "empowering" [...] ballads. Scherzinger's vocals on ballads have been compared to Kelly Clarkson. She said that she wanted her debut album to be [...] "in your face and strong".

60|$|He {{sat there}} {{a quarter of}} an hour, talking as if he might not soon see them again--unless indeed they should come to England, a course he {{strongly}} recommended. Why shouldn't they come to England in the autumn?--that struck him as a very happy thought. It would give him such pleasure to do what he could for them--to have them come and spend a month with him. Osmond, by his own admission, had been to England but once; which was an absurd state of things for a man of his leisure and intelligence. It was just the country for him--he would be sure to get on well there. Then Lord Warburton asked Isabel if she remembered what a good time she had had there and if she didn't want to try it again. Didn't she want to see Gardencourt once more? Gardencourt was really very good. Touchett didn't take proper care of it, but {{it was the sort of}} place you could hardly spoil by letting it alone. Why didn't they come and pay Touchett a visit? He surely must have asked them. Hadn't asked them? What an ill-mannered wretch!--and Lord Warburton promised to give the master of Gardencourt a piece of his mind. Of course it was a mere accident; he would be delighted to have them. Spending a month with Touchett and a month with himself, and seeing all the rest of the people they must know there, they really wouldn't find it half bad. Lord Warburton added that it would amuse Miss Osmond as well, who had told him that she had never been to England and whom he had assured it was a country she deserved to see. Of course she didn't need to go to England to be admired--that was her fate everywhere; but she would be an immense success there, she certainly would, if that was any inducement. He asked if she were not at home: couldn't he say good-bye? Not that he liked good-byes--he always funked them. When he left England the other day he hadn't said good-bye to a two-legged creature. He had had half a mind to leave Rome without troubling Mrs. Osmond for a final interview. What could be more dreary than final interviews? One never said the things one wanted--one remembered them all an hour afterwards. On the other hand one usually <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things one shouldn't, simply from a sense that one had to say something. Such a sense was upsetting; it muddled one's wits. He had it at present, and that was the effect it produced on him. If Mrs. Osmond didn't think he spoke as he ought she must set it down to agitation; it was no light thing to part with Mrs. Osmond. He was really very sorry to be going. He had thought of writing to her instead of calling--but he would write to her at any rate, to tell her a lot of things that would be sure to occur to him as soon as he had left the house. They must think seriously about coming to Lockleigh.|$|E
