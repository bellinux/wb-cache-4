40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to trace the {{development}} of the Singapore Ship Registry, from the introduction of open registry in 1969 until the tightening of registration requirements from the late 1970 s. The extraordinary growth of the Singapore merchant marine is analysed {{in the light of the}} policies of the Singapore government. In many respects, the opening of the registry mirrors the Singapore economic policies in general, as it facilitated the growth of domestic employment and production, without necessitating large domestic investments. The shift in the shipping policy in the late 1960 s was motivated by the wish to save foreign exchange, create employment opportunities and exert greater control over the country’s foreign trade. However, the opening of the registry for <b>shipowners</b> <b>of</b> all nations should also been seen in relation to the desire to promote Singapore as a maritime centre. Certain characteristics of the Singapore fleet and the pragmatism of the authorities in establishing and disbanding the open registry distinguish the Singapore registry from some of the other important Flags <b>of</b> <b>Convenience.</b> The opening <b>of</b> the registry in the late 1960 s, motivated by the stigma associated with being a Flag <b>of</b> <b>Convenience,</b> represents one important shift in the Singapore shipping policy. When the open registry had reached its sell-by date, and the initial problems had been alleviated, the authorities’ strategies were reversed. The shift towards tighter requirements illustrates the pragmatism with which the Singapore authorities have changed their shipping policy...|$|R

500|$|While flag <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> ships {{have been}} {{involved}} with some of the highest-profile oil spills in history (such as the Maltese-flagged , the Bahamian-flagged , the Marshallese-flagged Deepwater Horizon, and the Liberian-flagged SS Torrey Canyon, [...] and [...] ) the most common environmental criticism they face regards illegal fishing. These critics of the flag <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> system argue that many of the FOC flag states lack the resources or the will to properly monitor and control those vessels. The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) contends that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) vessels use flags <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> to avoid fisheries regulations and controls. Flags <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> help reduce the operating costs associated with illegal fishing methods, and help illegal operators avoid prosecution and hide beneficial ownership. As a result, flags <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> perpetuate IUU fishing which has extensive environmental, social and economic impacts, particularly in developing countries. The EJF is campaigning to end the granting <b>of</b> flags <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> to fishing vessels as an effective measure to combat IUU fishing.|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages [56]- 60. In {{a sample}} {{population}} of 246 Illinois Dietetic Association members, their use <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> {{food and the}} factors affecting their use were determined. Subjects received food frequency forms to estimate their use of various categories <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> foods per month and a questionnaire assessing work status, household composition and other demographic information. The convenience foods used most frequently were breads/bakery and gravies/sauces. Dietetic association members used convenience foods from 3 to 240 times a month The mean monthly use <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> foods was 64. 6. The following factors were found to significantly influence the use <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> foods: the extent of cooking responsibilities, enjoyment of cooking, and taste preferences for homemade cooking. Those who purchased the food they liked without considering the cost {{were more likely to}} use convenience foods. Age, work status, household composition and the nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> foods did not affect the use <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> foods in this study. Thus, the use <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> foods was related more to cooking roles and attitudes than to demographic factors. This study seems to show that despite the fact that these subjects are knowledgeable about nutrition, they still use convenience foods which are often thought of as less healthy due to their higher salt, sugar, fat, and calorie content.
