5|$|Dance Again... the Hits is {{the first}} {{greatest}} hits album of American singer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on July 20, 2012, by Epic Records, {{to coincide with the}} launch of her first world tour, the Dance Again World Tour. Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, Love?, which was released by Island Records in May 2011 after her departure from Epic Records in 2010. As Lopez owed the label one last album to fulfill her contract, she began work on a new greatest hits album in November 2011. She later became unsure whether <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with plans to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album, eventually deciding on the former.|$|E

25|$|Inayat Khan insisted adamantly that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and was {{competent}} for the work. Her only concern, she said, was her family, and Vera sensed {{immediately that}} this was, {{as she had}} suspected, where the problem lay. Inayat Khan had found saying goodbye to her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, she said. As Vera had advised her, she had told her mother only half the truth: she had {{said she was going}} abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|E
25|$|Dwarkanath Ganguly {{was born}} on the Bengali New Year's Day, 1st Baisakh (mid-April), 1845 at Magurkhanda village in Bikrampur, now in Bangladesh. At the time of Ganguly's birth, his father, Krishnapran Ganguli lived in Faridpur in {{connection}} with some family work. His mother hailed from a rich family. Once <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{on a pilgrimage to}} Puri. In those days, one had to use boats and elephants for transport. Her parent's family would have been too happy to support her financially for that but she was too upright a person to accept such support. Instead, she covered the long distance for the pilgrimage on foot. This incident portrays the strong will power of Ganguly's mother. The same would be apparent in his life later.|$|E

Gordon and Gessi demanded that Ahmed Pasha allow them to meet the girl alone, had their request granted after much arm-twisting and then met the girl who ultimately revealed <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home. Gordon and Gessi threatened to go to the British and Italian press if she was not released at once, a threat that proved sufficient to win the girl her freedom.|$|E

Lin was involved in another original Korean screenplay Magic Touch of Fate, co-starring Taiwanese actor Alec Su and Korean idol Kangta. This series is the highest-budgeted miniseries in Asian television history (as of 2011). By this time, Lin had been in show business for almost a decade, with nearly non-stop filming. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to school; since high school, studying abroad had been her dream. In the winter of 2004, after filming Magic Touch of Fate, Lin decided to study language and acting for three months in New York City.

During their affair, she inspired him with a short story (published as Head and Shoulders) which his agent sold to the Saturday Evening Post for $300 and then the film rights to it for $2500. This money enabled him to marry Zelda, who had put their engagement on hold until he earned some money.|$|E
25|$|VanDerveer was {{determined}} to play basketball in college. Her first choice was Mount Holyoke, but as one of five children, it wasn't financially possible for her to attend Mount Holyoke, so she chose Albany where her father had studied for his doctorate. It wasn't a great team, but she knew the coach, which helped with the decision. The team turned out not be challenging enough. Although naturally a guard, she jumped center, and lead the team in many categories, despite being the freshman on the team. She decided she needed a bigger challenge so she talked some of her friends into attending the AIAW National Championship, where she watched many teams, took notes, and decided where <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> She chose Indiana where she transferred and spent three years, making the Dean's List {{each of the three}} years.

25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanying’s family. Compared with her little sisters, she was quite lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The only way to do was to get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance to get an education.|$|E
