The Greys' task is to chase children and smack passers-by with whips: willow twigs were commonly used for this purpose, which is a reference to the tradition of whipping with green twigs on Easter Monday.

40|$|The water {{resources}} {{in the country are}} limited considering the future demand. Moreover rainfall is confined to monsoon season and unevenly distributed both in space and time. At present various storages have been constructed to store water for various purposes. In case of heavy rainfall water gets spill over or in case of less rainfall there may be drought situation. Most of cases due to uneven rainfall in the basin or sub basin some storages/dams attain its maximum capacity, while some do not. On the other hand some basin has excess water available and some have deficit, while some basin/sub basin have exhausted the use of available water. This paper represents the review of past work on the use of surface water by checking all possibilities like diversion of water from one basin/sub basin to other basin or sub basin, use of water by diverting it through available natural drain or local nallah from the catchment area of one reservoir to other, allowing <b>spill</b> <b>water</b> from dams to drains/river/local nallah by using existing canal system as a feeder canals etc. Attempts are also made to cover all methodology and techniques for water transfer in inter and intra basin.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Dec. 27, 2013 - June 27, 2014 During {{spring and early summer}} hydropower projects are often forced to <b>spill</b> <b>water</b> through their spillways due to increased river flows of the runoff season. Flows which are directed through spillways [...] instead of through turbines [...] contain a substantial amount of energy. Stemming from the high energy content, spillway flows entrain air at the point of impingement with the lower reservoir; furthermore, entrained air can be carried deep into the plunge pool. This process results in the transfer of mass from air to the liquid phase, which can ultimately cause supersaturation of Total Dissolved Gas (TDG) downstream of hydropower projects. Under certain conditions, high enough levels of TDG supersaturation can harm fish and other aquatic biota. For this reason, many hydropower facilities are currently studying methods to reduce dissolved gas generation caused by spillway flows. The present research effort utilizes Computational Fluid Dynamics to examine spillway jet characteristics for the prediction of TDG downstream of an arch dam. In seeking to make TDG predictions, flow at the spillway exit is analyzed and correlated to historical TDG data for known conditions at a specific hydropower project. Once this calibration step is complete, TDG predictions can be made by running numerical models of the spillway with potential structural modifications and analyzing hydrodynamic quantities at the spillway exit plane. Based on the results presented herein, the developed methodology appears to be a viable technique for analyzing structural alternatives for TDG abatement at hydropower projects with free, plunging jets. Results from the current work were compared to estimates made by another TDG prediction method, and similar trends were observed. Potential improvements to the developed methodology have been identified and suggested as future topics of research...|$|E
