5|$|Dan Ferreira {{is a fan}} of Elvis Presley, {{portrayed as}} a womaniser and a bully. He claims to be a widower, talking about his wife as being dead, both to the {{neighbours}} and his children, but they have merely separated after she had an affair with his best friend, with whom <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in.</b> Ash is portrayed as the intelligent member of the family, the standard of his education being much higher than his siblings, so much so that he is a lecturer. He has an on/off problem with gambling, something that presumably led to the breakup of his first marriage, before he is seen on screen. Kareena is in a relationship with Tariq, though it is not a sexual one. Ronny works as a DJ under the name DJ Ronny Flawless, and Tariq is his best friend and promoter.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} and {{sister-in-law}} were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). First {{taken care of by}} tenants, he was completely bedridden for {{most of his time in}} Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. <b>She</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of Leaves of Grass in 1876, 1881, and 1889.|$|E

25|$|She {{had plans}} for a Federal style mansion on the riverfront {{property}} drawn up and hired a local builder.

Annie, who was 11 years her junior, became warmly attached to her, a sentiment that Deckers did not reciprocate at the time. Nevertheless, Pécher visited Deckers regularly in her convent, went to live near where Deckers stayed when sent to study at Leuven, and even fell into a deep depression and tried to kill herself when it seemed Deckers was about to be sent to a mission country.|$|E

25|$|Sparhawk-Jones {{struggled}} with depression, like her father, {{and when she}} was not well she burned her paintings, which reduced the number of works available for sale. In 1913, Sparhawk-Jones had a mental breakdown and lived in the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane for three years. The experience was hard on her and she was forever changed. Sparhawk-Jones was terrified and lonely at the asylum, and may have been subject to opium or sedative drugs. <b>She</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> with her mother after she was released from the hospital in 1916. Sparhawk-Jones dealt with the losses of her teacher William Merritt Chase, who died in 1916, and Morton Shamburg, who died in 1918. She said that she did not work as an artist for about 12 years.|$|E
25|$|Without any obvious cause Genie's {{incontinence}} immediately resurfaced, and {{was especially}} severe {{for the first}} few weeks after <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> but persisted at a lower level for several months. In contrast to Butler's writings, the Riglers observed Genie still acted out her anger on herself and noted that certain situations in particular, such as spilling containers of liquid, sent her into tantrum behavior, which doctors attributed to her having been beaten for these actions as a child. The research team recorded her speech being much more halting and hesitant than Butler described, writing that Genie very rarely spoke and that, for {{the first three months of}} her stay, almost always used one-word utterances. Unless she saw something which frightened her both her speech and behavior exhibited a great deal of latency, often several minutes delayed, for no clear reason, and she still had no reaction to temperature. She continued to have a very difficult time controlling her impulses, frequently engaging in highly anti-social and destructive behavior.|$|E

When Jason is stalked by crazed artist Franco (James Franco), Sam is targeted. Jason rescues Sam, saying he'd always choose to save her when she's in trouble. Sonny was accused and put on trial for the Claudia's murder, but Michael confessed was sentenced to prison. Jason made a deal and sent himself to prison to protect Michael. While upset, Sam supported his decision. Before Jason turned himself in, they go away together and spend a few days at a cabin. Sam remained supportive and visited him regularly in prison. Jason and Michael are later permanently released from prison, and Jason reunites with Sam. When Sonny's old flame Brenda Barrett (Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo) was targeted by the Balkan, Jason acted as her bodyguard and <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> with him. Sam was initially jealous of Brenda, but Jason assured her that he loved her. Determined to get Brenda out of the penthouse quickly, Sam and Jason began searching for the Balkan.|$|E
25|$|By 1915, she had {{relocated}} to Denver and had married salesman Richard Peete. They had a daughter, Frances Ann (known as Betty), in 1916. The couple fought constantly and finally separated {{in the summer}} of 1920. Shortly thereafter, Peete left her estranged husband and daughter and moved to Los Angeles. It was there that she met Jacob C. Denton, a recent widower with a teenage daughter who had made millions as a mining engineer before retiring. Denton met Peete when she inquired about Denton's 14-room English Tudor mansion (located at 675 South Catalina Street near Wilshire Boulevard) which Denton was hoping to rent out for $350 a month while he traveled for business. For unknown reasons, Denton agreed to allow Peete to rent the mansion for $75 a month. <b>She</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> on May 26, a few days before Denton was to leave on his business trip. The true nature of Peete and Denton's relationship is unclear; she has been identified as Denton's live-in girlfriend, housekeeper and tenant {{despite the fact that she}} never signed a lease. Peete would later claim the two were romantically involved.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} in Genie's new placement was extremely rigid {{and gave her}} far less access to her favorite objects and activities, and her caretakers rarely allowed her mother to visit. Soon after <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> they began to subject her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, resulting in both incontinence and constipation resurfacing and causing her to revert to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the strongest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again they would never let her see her mother, making her terrified of opening her mouth for fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As a result, she was extremely frightened of eating or speaking, and she became extremely withdrawn and almost exclusively relied on sign language for communication. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have regular contact with her, continuing to conduct weekly meetings to continue her testing, and she noted the extreme deterioration in Genie's condition. She quickly started petitioning to have Genie taken out of the home, but Curtiss said that both she and social services had a difficult time contacting John Miner, only succeeding after several months. In late April 1977, with assistance from David Rigler, Miner removed her from this location.|$|E

The couple wanted to have children, but Radner suffered miscarriages, and doctors could not determine the problem. After experiencing severe fatigue and suffering from pain in her upper legs on the set of Haunted Honeymoon, Radner sought medical treatment. Following a number of false diagnoses, she was found to have ovarian cancer in October 1986. Over the next year and a half, Radner battled the disease, receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. The disease finally went into remission, giving the couple a respite, during which time Wilder filmed See No Evil, Hear No Evil. By May 1989, the cancer returned and had metastasized. Radner died on May 20, 1989. Wilder later stated, [...] "I always thought she'd pull through." ...|$|E
