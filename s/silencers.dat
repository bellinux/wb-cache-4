5|$|Great {{confidence}} {{was placed in}} being able to reduce the noise of a turbojet and massive strides by SNECMA in silencer design were reported during the programme. However, by 1974 the spade <b>silencers</b> which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective. The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise but it was not developed.|$|E
50|$|Crossfire hired <b>Silencer</b> to kill Hawkeye when Hawkeye and Mockingbird {{found out}} there were illegal {{activities}} {{taking place at}} Cross Technological Enterprises. <b>Silencer</b> followed Hawkeye back to his apartment and attempted to kill him in his sleep. Hawkeye awoke before <b>Silencer</b> was able to shoot and, {{with the help of}} Mockingbird, foiled the assassins attempt at his life. <b>Silencer</b> was able to escape by jumping out a window. Later that night, Hawkeye and Mockingbird broke into Cross Technological Enterprises to try to find incriminating evidence, but were interrupted by <b>Silencer.</b> During the fight, both <b>Silencer</b> and Hawkeye fell out of a window and landed on Hawkeye’s skycycle. The two fought on the skycycle until they both fell towards a smokestack. Hawkeye fell into the smokestack, while <b>Silencer</b> fell onto the rim. Believing Hawkeye to be dead, <b>Silencer</b> turned away {{looking for a way to}} climb down. It was then that Hawkeye grabbed <b>Silencer’s</b> foot and pulled him into the smokestack and (presumably) falling to his doom.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely <b>silencers</b> bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|In the post-apocalyptic environment, {{ammunition}} is a {{rare and}} essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse, military-grade ammunition is used as currency. Players can avoid consuming all the valuable currency by using lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and other items. The military-grade ammunition {{can be used to}} purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as scopes and <b>silencers,</b> which improve weapon efficiency, can be purchased with these bullets.|$|E

5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice <b>silencers</b> and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} types of cis-acting RNA {{sequence}} elements present in pre-mRNAs and they have corresponding trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. Splicing <b>silencers</b> are sites to which splicing repressor proteins bind, reducing {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These can be located in the intron itself (intronic splicing <b>silencers,</b> ISS) or in a neighboring exon (exonic splicing <b>silencers,</b> ESS). They vary in sequence, {{as well as in the}} types of proteins that bind to them. The majority of splicing repressors are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) such as hnRNPA1 and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). Splicing enhancers are sites to which splicing activator proteins bind, increasing the probability that a nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These also may occur in the intron (intronic splicing enhancers, ISE) or exon (exonic splicing enhancers, ESE). Most of the activator proteins that bind to ISEs and ESEs are members of the SR protein family. Such proteins contain RNA recognition motifs and arginine and serine-rich (RS) domains.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{and others}} have defined a {{transcriptional}} <b>silencer</b> critical for the proper expression of the CD 4 gene at all stages of T cell development. In this report, we use biochemical techniques to identify three different factor-binding sites within the CD 4 <b>silencer,</b> denoted sites I, II, and III. Using transgenic analyses, we determine that although all three factor-binding sites are important for <b>silencer</b> activity, there is significant redundancy in {{that the presence of}} either site II alone, or the combination of sites I and III permits <b>silencer</b> function. Thus, our data indicate that the mechanism of function of the CD 4 <b>silencer</b> is extremely complex. Further biochemical analyses indicate that the factor binding to site II has the same sequence specificity as a factor binding to an E box site in the CD 4 enhancer; thus, a member of the bHLH factor family may be important in mediating <b>silencer</b> function...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} CD 4 {{expression}} {{is essential for}} proper T lymphocyte development. We have previously described a cis-acting <b>silencer</b> element required for repressing transcription of the CD 4 gene. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel factor that binds to a critical functional site in the CD 4 <b>silencer.</b> This factor, referred to as silencer-associated factor (SAF), {{is a member of}} the helix-turn-helix factor family and shares sequence similarity with the homeodomain class of transcriptional regulators. Introduction of a specific mutation into the SAF binding site in the CD 4 <b>silencer</b> abrogates <b>silencer</b> activity in transgenic mice, supporting the hypothesis that SAF is important in mediating <b>silencer</b> function. Although SAF is expressed in all lymphocytes, immunofluorescence studies indicate that SAF is present primarily in the cytoplasm in T cells in which the endogenous <b>silencer</b> is nonfunctional, whereas it is presen...|$|R

25|$|Eukaryotic genes {{also contain}} {{regulatory}} sequences beyond the core promoter. These cis-acting control elements bind transcriptional activators or repressors to {{increase or decrease}} transcription from the core promoter. Well-characterized regulatory elements include enhancers, <b>silencers,</b> and insulators. These regulatory sequences can be spread over a large genomic distance, sometimes located hundreds of kilobases from the core promoters.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{determinants}} of splicing work in an inter-dependent manner that depends on context, so that the rules governing how splicing is regulated from a splicing code. The presence of a particular cis-acting RNA sequence element may increase {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be spliced in some cases, but decrease the probability in other cases, depending on context. The context within which regulatory elements act includes cis-acting context that is established by the presence of other RNA sequence features, and trans-acting context that is established by cellular conditions. For example, some cis-acting RNA sequence elements influence splicing only if multiple elements are present in the same region so as to establish context. As another example, a cis-acting element can have opposite effects on splicing, depending on which proteins are expressed in the cell (e.g., neuronal versus non-neuronal PTB). The adaptive significance of splicing <b>silencers</b> and enhancers is attested by studies showing that there is strong selection in human genes against mutations that produce new <b>silencers</b> or disrupt existing enhancers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In one of {{the screw}} {{compressor}} system, designed <b>silencer</b> was not optimal. A great challenge was the large variation in operating conditions, especially the variation of the molecular weight of the gas. There was need to optimize the <b>silencer.</b> This paper describes the acoustic modelling tools to optimize the acoustic performance of the <b>silencer.</b> Optimization steps carried out {{are based on the}} process parameters (molecular weight and speed of sound of the gas) and geometric parameters (size of <b>silencer,</b> thickness and length of the absorption core). For this acoustic modelling COMSOL has been used extensively. A 3 -D model of the <b>silencer</b> has been used in the present investigation. Transmission losses and pressure pulsation reduction ratios were calculated for each case. Results are presented below...|$|R
50|$|Sometime later, fellow {{team member}} Hardcase confessed to <b>Silencer</b> {{that he would}} die a virgin, without ever having felt {{the love of a}} woman.

Shortly afterwards, the team defended a chocolate factory from being plundered by the Horde. The fight proved unusually easy, and Hardcase decided to exit the factory and hunt down some of the fleeing Hordians, taking <b>Silencer</b> along with him. As they exited hand-in-hand, however, the Hordians from a ship above activated a microwave cannon which incinerated both Hardcase and <b>Silencer,</b> leaving behind their charred skeletons. <b>Silencer</b> and Hardcase were then seen hand-in-hand moving to the afterlife together.|$|R
40|$|The {{glutathione}} transferase P (GST-P) gene {{is specifically}} expressed during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis of the rat, whereas mRNA of this gene is virtually undetectable in normal liver. We have previously identified {{a stretch of}} DNA, that acted negatively in transcription, at 400 bp upstream from the cap site of the rat GST-P gene. Further characterization has revealed that this negative fragment functions in an orientation and position independent manner, suggesting that it is acting as a <b>silencer.</b> This <b>silencer</b> consists of multiple negative elements to which nuclear factors bind. This <b>silencer</b> is active not only in rat non-hepatoma and hepatoma cells but also in human and mouse cell lines, suggesting that these elements function as general regulators of basal gene expression. At least two proteins bind to this <b>silencer</b> fragment, one of which, designated SF-A (<b>Silencer</b> Factor A), has been partially purified. SF-A binds to several regions in this <b>silencer,</b> and likely {{plays an important role}} on negative regulation of this gene...|$|R

40|$|Expression {{of the cdc}} 2 gene is induced steeply at the G 1 -S-phase boundary. The {{previous}} {{analysis of}} promoter elements that confer inducibility revealed the enhancer at positions- 276 to- 265. Enhancer activity is suppressed by the upstream sequence that seems to contain the <b>silencer.</b> The <b>silencer</b> element was analyzed by fusing several oligonucleotides covering the <b>silencer</b> region upstream of the enhancer in the cdc 2 promoter-luciferase construct. Oligonucleotide IV, which suppressed enhancer activity, was further dissected {{by the introduction of}} base substitutions and by forming the DNA-protein complexes with quiescent rat cell extract. The <b>silencer</b> element, AAGTAGTAAAAATA, was finally identified at positions- 374 to- 360, which resembles the enhancer sequencer but contains extra internal AG residues. <b>Silencer</b> complexes were formed with the quiescent cell extract, whereas the amounts of the complexes decreased with the progression of the cell cycle, and nearly no complexes were formed with the late G 1 cell extracts. Conversely, the enhancer complex begins to be formed after late G 1. Among the three <b>silencer</b> complexes, the formation of the slowest-migrating complex (complex Ill) was inhibited by the enhancer sequence, suggesting that a common factor interacts with both the <b>silencer</b> and enhancer. These results suggest that the conversion of complex formation from the <b>silencer</b> to the enhancer site regulates the induction of cdc 2 promoter activity at the G 1 -S-phase boundary...|$|R
40|$|The HMR E <b>silencer</b> is {{required}} for SIR-dependent transcriptional repression of the silent mating-type locus, HMR. The <b>silencer</b> also behaves as an origin of replication (ARS element) and allows plasmids to replicate autonomously in yeast. The replication and segregation properties of these plasmids are also dependent on the four SIR genes. We have previously characterized two DNA-binding factors in yeast extracts that recognize specific sequences at the HMR E <b>silencer.</b> These proteins, called ABFI (ARS-Binding Factor) and GRFI (General Regulatory Factor), are not encoded {{by any of the}} SIR genes. To investigate the biological roles of these factors, single-base-pair mutations were constructed in both binding sites at the HMR E <b>silencer</b> that were no longer recognized by the corresponding proteins in vitro. Our results indicate that the GRFI-binding site {{is required}} for the efficient segregation of plasmids replicated by the HMR E <b>silencer.</b> SIR-dependent transcriptional repression requires either an intact ABFI-binding site or GRFI-binding site, although the GRFI-binding site appears to be more important. A double-mutant <b>silencer</b> that binds neither ABFI nor GRFI does not mediate transcriptional repression of HMR. The replacement of HMR E with a chromosomal origin of replication (ARS 1) allows partial SIR-dependent transcriptional repression of HMR, indicating a role for replication in <b>silencer</b> function. Together, these results suggest that the SIR proteins influence the properties of the HMR E <b>silencer</b> through interactions with other DNA-binding proteins...|$|R
