40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to specify the relationships between animal species (cow versus goat) and the contents of fat-soluble constituents (fatty acids, carotenoids, retinol and α-tocopherol) in raw milk farmhouse cheeses. Four hundred and thirty-two farmhouse cheeses (74 farms × 6 - 7 cheeses), including 306 cow's milk cheeses and 126 goat's milk cheeses, produced in real herd management conditions throughout the year, were collected. The conditions of milk production were identified beforehand by means of surveys. In order to limit the confounding effects related to the management practices specific to each animal species, the effect of animal species was studied only within cheeses associated with conditions of milk production common to both animal species. Except for C 8 : 0, C 10 : 0 and β-carotene, and to a lesser extent C 4 : 0, the levels of which in cheese clearly differed according to the animal species, the variability within species was higher than the variability between <b>species.</b> <b>Caprine</b> milk fat was on average richer (P 30 % richer) and to a lesser extent C 6 : 0, C 12 : 0 and C 18 : 0 (from 8 to 25 % higher) than bovine milk fat. On the other hand, bovine milk fat was richer (P 30 % richer) and to a lesser extent C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 3 n − 3 (from 16 to 23 % richer). Caprine milk fat was completely devoid of β-carotene. In conclusion, the results of this work indicate that, under real herd management conditions, the animal species (cow versus goat) is a strong influencing factor of the nutritional composition of cheese...|$|E

The {{current study was}} designed {{with the objective of}} investigating the frequency and clinico-pathological profile of caprine mycoplasmosis in two districts in the northern zone of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Three hundred nasal swabs were collected, 150 each for Swat and Buner from goats showing clinical signs of respiratory mycoplasmosis. In districts Swat and Buner, 21. 3 % and 31. 3 % samples were mycoplasma positive (respectively). All isolates were identified as Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri by biochemical and growth inhibition testing. Blood and serum samples from 30 mycoplasma positive goats were collected for studying hematological and blood biochemistry profile. Hematological results showed that there was a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in Total Erythrocyte Count (TEC), Packed Cell Volume (PCV) and hemoglobin concentration while significant increase (P< 0. 05) in the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin and Mean Corpuscular Volume value was recorded. Blood biochemistry revealed that total serum protein and albumin were decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) while there was a significant increase (P< 0. 05) in serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and globulin fraction of serum.

40|$|Brucellosis is a reemerging {{infectious}} {{zoonotic disease}} of worldwide importance. In human, it is {{mainly caused by}} Brucella melitensis, a natural pathogen for goats. In India, {{a large number of}} goats are reared in semi-intensive to intensive system within the close vicinity of human being. At present, there is no vaccination and control strategy for caprine brucellosis in the country. Thus, to formulate an effective control strategy, the status of etiological agent is essential. To cope up with these, the present study was conducted to isolate and identify the prevalent Brucella <b>species</b> in <b>caprine</b> brucellosis in India. The 30 samples (fetal membrane, fetal stomach content and vaginal swabs) collected throughout India from the aborted fetus of goats revealed the isolation of 05 isolates all belonging to Brucella melitensis biovars 3. All the isolates produced amplification products of 1412 and 720 [*]bp in polymerase chain reaction with genus and species specific 16 S rRNA and omp 31 gene based primers, respectively. Moreover, the amplification of omp 31 gene in all the isolates confirmed the presence of immuno dominant outer membrane protein (31 [*]kDa omp) in all the field isolates of B. melitensis in aborted foetus of goats in India.

40|$|Abstract Background Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{has become}} a routine non invasive cardiac diagnostic tool in most species. However, evaluation of intracardiac blood flow requires reference values, which are poorly documented in goats. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the repeatability, the variability, and to establish the reference values of PW measurements in healthy adult Saanen goats. Using a standardised PW Doppler echocardiographic protocol, 10 healthy adult unsedated female Saanen goats were investigated three times at one day intervals by the same observer. Mitral, tricuspid, aortic and pulmonary flows were measured from a right parasternal view, and mitral and aortic flows were also measured from a left parasternal view. The difference between left and right side measurements and the intra-observer inter-day repeatability were tested and then the reference values of PW Doppler echocardiographic parameters in healthy adult female Saanen goats were established. Results As documented in other <b>species,</b> all <b>caprine</b> PW Doppler parameters demonstrated a poor inter-day repeatability and a moderate variability. Tricuspid and pulmonary flows were best evaluated on the right side whereas mitral and aortic flows were best obtained on the left side, and reference values are reported for healthy adult Saanen goats. Conclusions PW Doppler echocardiography allows the measurement of intracardiac blood flow indices in goats. The reference values establishment will help interpreting these indices of cardiac function in clinical cardiac cases and developing animal models for human cardiology research. </p...|$|R

This study was undertaken to determine the occurrence of staphylococcal ocular infections of food producing animals in Nsukka Southeast, Nigeria, and to determine the antibiogram of the isolated staphylococci. A total of 5, 635 food producing animals were externally examined for signs of clinical ocular conditions. Animals that showed clinical eye lesions were further examined using pen light to assess the entire globe and the pupillary reflex. Blindness was assessed using menace blink reflex, palpebral reflex and obstacle methods. Isolation and identification of staphylococcal isolates from ocular swabs were done by standard methods. Antibiogram of the isolates was determined by disc diffusion method. Sixty-three (1. 1 %) of the examined animals showed signs of ocular condition. Thirty-one (49. 2 %) of the cultured swabs yielded Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Isolation rates from different animal <b>species</b> were <b>caprine</b> (60 %), ovine (33. 3 %), bovine (12. 5 %), and porcine (0 %). Resistance of the isolates was 100 % to ampicillin/cloxacillin, 90 % to tetracycline, 80 % to streptomycin, 71 % to chloramphenicol, 20 % to erythromycin, 16 % to gentamicin, and 0 % to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Twenty-five (81 %) of the isolates were multi-drug resistant.

40|$|Objective: To {{unify the}} {{purification}} and activation of plasminogens {{from three different}} <b>species,</b> namely: human, <b>caprine</b> and canine. Materials and methods: Lysine-Sepharose 4 B and sephacel DEAE were used, for affinity and ion-exchange chromatography, respectively. The N-terminal sequence was determined for both the intact and degraded plasminogens. Results: Bands of 92 kDa corresponding to native plasminogens were identified in the three species. Their N-terminal sequences {{were found to be}} EPLDDY, DPLDDY and XXLDDY for human, caprine and canine plasminogen, respectively. Furthermore, the degraded in vivo circulating plasminogens from the three species were purified and their N-terminal sequences were KVYLSE, RITLL and RIYLS for the human, caprine and canine, in that order. Conclusion: Activation of the three plasminogens confirmed the formation of the typical electrophoretic bands for human plasmin corresponding to the heavy A and the light B chains which were also identified in the caprine and canine plasmins.

40|$|Liver is {{involved}} in several vital functions such as synthesis, secretion, storage and metabolism of plasma proteins and in detoxifying functions. In the present study, hepatocytes were obtained by disaggregation of caprine liver caudate lobe. The cells were cultured under controlled conditions in a CO 2 incubator at different temperatures. The function of hepatocyte culture was evaluated in terms of secretion of albumin, urea and acitivity of Lactate dehydrogenase. Cells were cultured at three different temperatures, i. e. 37, 40 and 42 o C, and at each temperature, the culture was propagated for 24, 48 and 72 h time interval respectively. At 37 oC, the concentration of albumin and urea increased in the culture temporally where as activity of LDH decreased by 72 h. The least square mean (LSM) concentration of albumin, urea in culture decreased and activity of LDH increased significantly (P< 0. 01) at 40 and 42 oC, when compared with respective values at 37 oC. Hence effect of thermal stress(40 and 42 oC) on activity of hepatocyte antioxidant enzymes (super oxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) and TGF β secretion in vitro was further evaluated. It was observed that there was significant increase (P< 0. 01) in {{the activity of the}} antioxidant enzymes. The LSM activity of all the enzymes increased significantly at 40 and 42 oC when compared with the enzyme activity at 37 oC, but increase in the secretion of TGF β could be observed only at 42 oC post 48 h of incubation. TGF β is associated with apoptosis and cytotoxicity. It was observed that viability of the cells decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) only at 42 oC post 48 h of incubation. It can be concluded that hyperthermic conditions were observed to be stressful for hepatocytes during in vitro conditions, which proved to be more significant at 42 oC post 48 h of incubation. Further work has to be carried out with some supplements which can reduce the hyperthermic effect. In vivo studies in <b>caprine</b> <b>species</b> will give further insight on thermal stress.

However, {{research into}} archaeological domestic populations has been hindered by the difficulty of recording and interpreting enamel hypoplasia in high-crowned <b>species</b> such as <b>caprines</b> and cattle. This research develops a methodological approach for recording enamel hypoplasia in high-crowned species which is applied to modern and archaeological caprine populations from three geographically distinct regions (Orkney, Kenya and Iceland). Modern caprines with known life histories are used to investigate baseline {{factors such as the}} impact of the environment and nutrition on the frequency and severity of enamel hypoplasia in caprines. These baselines are then used to interpret enamel hypoplasia in archaeological populations. Results indicate that enamel hypoplasia frequency and severity can be linked to variation in the climate /environment as well as nutrition levels in caprine populations. By comparing enamel hypoplasia frequency and severity between populations with similar baseline factors, variation in animal management strategies can be identified. Physiological and seasonal stress events including birth, weaning, and seasonal periods of malnutrition are also identified using enamel hypoplasia in both modern and archaeological populations. ...|$|R

Tulathromycin, a triamilide macrolide antibiotic found to be safe and effective against respiratory bacterial pathogens in cattle and swine, was formulated to enhance persistence in lung tissue. The Minor Use Animal Drug Program (National Research Support Project- 7) identifies and supports research directed at meeting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for drug approval in minor species or for minor uses in major species.

40|$|Intradiscal {{pressure}} (IDP) is {{an essential}} biomechanical parameter and {{has been the subject}} of numerous in vivo and in vitro investigations. Although currently available sensors differ in size and measurement principles, no data exist regarding inter-sensor reliability in measuring IDP. Moreover, although discs of various species vary significantly in size and mechanics, the possible effects of sensor insertion on the IDP have never been investigated. The present in vitro study aimed to address these issues. The synchronized signals of two differently sized pressure transducers (Ø 1. 33 and Ø 0. 36 mm) obtained during the measurements in two <b>species</b> (bovine and <b>caprine)</b> and their influence on the measured pressure were compared. First, the discs were subjected to three loading periods, and the pressure was measured simultaneously to assess the inter-sensor reliability. In the second test, the effect of the sensor size was evaluated by alternatingly inserting one transducer into the disc while recording the resulting pressure change with the second transducer. Although both sensors yielded similar pressure values (ICC: consistency: 0. 964 - 0. 999; absolute agreement: 0. 845 - 0. 996) when used simultaneously, the sensor size was determined to influence the measured pressure during the insertion tests. The magnitude of the effect differed between species; it was insignificant in the bovine specimens but significant in the caprine specimens, with a pressure increase of 0. 31 - 0. 64 MPa (median: 0. 43 MPa) obtained when the larger sensor was inserted.

Here, we analysed 2469 characters draw from three distinct molecular markers, i. e. two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and 12 S rRNA) and one nuclear fragment (exon 4 of the κ-casein gene). The taxonomic sampling includes all genera putatively described as caprines, {{as well as several}} other bovid genera in order to elucidate the position of caprines within the family Bovidae, and to determine the exact {{composition of the}} group. Phylogenetic analyses confirm firstly that Pseudoryx and Saiga do not belong to caprines, and secondly, that all tribes classically defined in the literature are not monophyletic, supporting the inclusion of all <b>caprine</b> <b>species</b> into a unique enlarged tribe Caprini sensu lato. Our results are in contradiction with previous investigations suggesting a sister-group relationship between Ovis (sheep and mouflons) and Budorcas (takins). By using a molecular calibration point at 18. 5 Mya for the first appearance of bovids, we estimated divergence times with our molecular data. We also performed biogeographic inferences to better understand the origin and diversification of caprines during the Neogene. Our analyses suggest that caprines shared a common ancestor with Alcelaphini and Hippotragini in the middle-late Miocene (13. 37 ± 0. 70 Mya). Our results also indicate that the extant generic diversity of caprines resulted from a rapid adaptive radiation during the late Miocene, at 10. 96 ± 0. 73 Mya. We propose that this adaptive radiation resulted from the acquisition of reduced metacarpals, a key innovation which occurred during the late Miocene as a consequence of insularity isolation in the mountainous mega-archipelago between Mediterranean and Paratethys Seas...|$|R

The aims of this study were: a) to compare the effects of murine strain, blastocyst stage and inner cell mass (ICM) isolation techniques on the efficiency of deriving murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines in murine species and b) to compare the effects of in vivo- and in vitro-derived blastocyst sources as well as to establish effective technologies to isolate and culture ESC in <b>caprine</b> <b>species.</b> Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were derived from murine foetuses (13. 5 to 14. 0 d. p. c.), cultured up to Passage 2 (P 2), cryopreserved and thawed at each passage to be used as feeder cell layer for mESC and gESC cultures. In order to obtain the blastocyst sources for production of mESC and gESC lines, somatic cell nuclear transfer (in vitro) and in vivo flushing were carried out in this study. For isolation of the inner cell mass (ICM) from blastocyst, whole blastocyst culture, manual cut and laser dissection were compared among respective treatment groups to derive mESC and gESC lines. In murine, a total of 71 (ICR), 38 (CBA/ca), 22 (C 57 BL/ 6 J) mESC lines were produced from 971, 758 and 709 murine blastocysts, respectively. Five blastocyst stages were cultured on the MEF with 3 ICM isolation techniques. ICM outgrowths were disaggregated by trypsin/EDTA (0. 05...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{adherence}} {{interactions between}} mycoplasmas and mammalian cells {{are important for}} host colonization and may contribute to subsequent pathogenic processes. Despite significant progress toward understanding the role of specialized, complex tip structures in the adherence of some mycoplasmas, particularly those that infect humans, less is known about adhesins through which other mycoplasmas of this host bind to diverse cell types, even though simpler surface components {{are likely to be}} involved. We show by flow cytometric analysis that a soluble recombinant fusion protein (FP 29), representing the abundant P 29 surface lipoprotein of Mycoplasma fermentans, binds human HeLa cells and inhibits M. fermentans binding to these cells, in both a quantitative and a saturable manner, whereas analogous fusion proteins representing other mycoplasma surface proteins did not. Constructs representing nested N- or C-terminal truncations of FP 29 allowed initial mapping of this specific adherence function to a central region of the P 29 sequence containing a 36 -amino-acid disulfide loop. A derivative of FP 29 containing a mutation converting one participating Cys to Ser, precluding intrachain disulfide bond formation, retained full activity. Together these results suggest that the direct interaction of M. fermentans with a ligand on the HeLa cell surface involves a limited segment of the P 29 surface lipoprotein and requires neither the disulfide bond nor the contribution of adjacent portions of the protein. Earlier results indicating phase-variable display of monoclonal antibody surface epitopes on P 29, now recognized to be outside this ligand binding region, raise the possibility that variation of mycoplasma surface architecture might alter the presentation of the binding region and the adherence phenotype. Preliminary results further indicated that FP 29 could inhibit binding to HeLa cells by Mycoplasma hominis, a distinct human mycoplasma species displaying the phase-variable adhesin Vaa, but not that by Mycoplasma capricolum, an organism infecting <b>caprine</b> <b>species.</b> This result raises the additional, testable possibility that a common host cell ligand for two human mycoplasma species may be recognized through structurally dissimilar adhesins that undergo phase variation by two distinct mechanisms, governing protein expression (Vaa) or surface masking (P 29) ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{different}} hypotheses of casein micelle structure {{have been}} proposed from the data obtained in the investigations carried out on micelles {{over the past twenty}} years. The present comparative study of caprine (goat) and ovine (sheep) casein micelle systems with that of the bovine was made in an attempt to demonstrate the validity of these hypotheses. The casein contents, mineral levels, and Ca:phosphate ratios in the skim milks varied between species, but no significant differences in the Ca:phosphate ratios in the casein micelles or the sera were found. There were major differences between the electrophoretic patterns of the casein samples from the different <b>species.</b> Both <b>caprine</b> and ovine caseins contained two prominent bands in the β-casein region, while caprine casein also contained a smaller proportion of its casein in more mobile components (αS-caseins) than the bovine. Three major αS-caseins were observed in ovine casein, and one major αS-casein in the majority of the caprine casein samples. Bovine, caprine and ovine caseins, isolated from the whole milks, were separated into their major components by ion exchange chromatography. The κ-, β-, and αS-caseins which were isolated accounted for 15 %, 35 % and 50 %, respectively of bovine casein, 10 %, 60 % and 25 %, respectively of caprine casein and 10 %, 45 % and 35 %, respectively of ovine casein. The caprine and ovine caseins were identified as αS-, β- and κ-type caseins by their chemical and physical characteristics. The bovine, caprine and ovine κ-caseins were readily hydrolysed by rennin and were able to stabilize the Ca sensitive αS- or β-caseins. Caprine β 1 - and β 2,-caseins which were present in equimolar amounts, had nearly identical amino acid compositions, and were similar to that of bovine β-casein A 2. The α 1 component, however, contained an additional phosphate residue. The temperature dependent Ca sensitivities and the temperature dependent polymerization of the caprine β-caseins were similar to that of bovine β-casein. However, β 1 -casein appeared to associate more easily than β 2 -casein, despite its higher net negative charge. Viscosity measurements indicated that the conformation of the two caprine β-caseins was similar to that of bovine β-casein, both at 4 °C and at 25 °C. The major caprine αS-casein was more similar to the minor bovine αS 3,-casein than to bovine αS 1 -casein. This was demonstrated by their behaviour on gel electrophoresis with Mg buffers, Ca sensitivities, amino acid compositions and molecular weights. The two ovine β-caseins were similar to each other, and to the caprine and bovine β-caseins. The relationship between the ovine β-caseins was {{similar to that of the}} caprine β-caseins. Two of the three major ovine αS-caseins were isolated. These were both similar to each other, and to bovine αS 1 -casein. The properties of the αS-caseins from the three species were more variable than those of the β-caseins, which in turn were more variable than the κ-caseins. The casein micelles from caprine, ovine and bovine milks were all highly solvated and roughly spherical. Although their size distributions varied, the micelles were in each case composed of sub-units about 12 nm in diameter. Gel chromatography of sub-micellar casein aggregates from the three species indicated that they had similar hydrodynamic sizes and appeared to be in equilibrium with their component caseins. The finding that similar sized sub-units are formed in the casein micelles in the milks of the various species, suggests that the differing proportions of the various component caseins must compensate for the differences observed in the properties of the caseins. It appears likely that not enough emphasis has been given to the role of β-casein in micelle structure, and β- and αS-caseins may be interchangeable...|$|R
40|$|Q fever is a {{worldwide}} zoonosis {{caused by an}} intracellular bacterium, Coxiella burnetii. Small ruminants (goats and sheep) are considered as the most common animal reservoir for human infection. Since the recent Q-fever Dutch outbreak, the initial objective of this PhD thesis was to study the situation of this disease in Belgium. Q fever is endemic in our country. It is present in goat (herd prevalence ranging from 6. 3 to 12. 1 %) and bovine (etiologic agent of 1 % of abortions) herds. Monitoring of goat bulk tank milks and bovine abortion products allowed genotyping of C. burnetii strains circulating in our country. The genetic profiles of the caprine samples were of a great variability than the bovine samples which displayed a more homogeneous pattern. The reference Nine Mile strain (isolated from ticks in the United States) had a genetic profile different {{from all the other}} isolates. These initial results prompted us to hypothesize the presence of host specificity within the C. burnetii <b>species.</b> Totally, five <b>caprine</b> (CbBEC 1 - 5) and one bovine (CbBEB 1) strains were isolated. In milk, two shedding profiles were identified which were either continuous (type I) and associated to the Dutch genotype; or discontinuous (type II) and linked to other genotypes. In parallel with field studies, we developed experimental models, in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (mice). With these models, we showed that there was no hyper-virulent behavior displayed by the Dutch-type caprine strain and we reinforced the host specificity hypothesis previously formulated. Indeed, the strain isolated from cattle showed greater proliferative potential than the caprine strain in allogeneic bovine macrophagic cell line. Another objective of this work aimed at improving the current diagnostic tools and vaccination. By phage display analysis, we looked for peptides mimicking the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of C. burnetii. A monoclonal antibody directed against the virenose (specific sugar of the C. burnetii LPS) was used for selection. Two phage-enzymes were identified. Tests to confirm their diagnostic application have failed because of low specific binding. The last part of the study dealt with vaccination, so as currently applied in field setting. In Belgium, goat positive farms are vaccinated with Coxevac®, the only authorized vaccine. This vaccine is produced with a strain not circulating in Europe (Nine Mile). Use of Coxevac® led to a reduction in shedding of C. burnetii but did not prevent infection of new farms. Moreover, vaccination reduced the excretion of bacteria after a period of 5 to 6 months and several injections were needed. Given the weaknesses of the current vaccination program, we tested new vaccine candidates in the mouse model. Vaccines prepared from CbBEC 1 and CbBEB 1 strains showed better protection than the Nine Mile-derived vaccine. These results further supported the hypothesis of host specificity within C. burnetii. The protective efficacy of the two mimetic peptides selected by phage display was not relevant. The tools developed along with this PhD work were of paramount importance 1) to improve the expertise of the animal Q fever National Reference Laboratory, 2) to conduct a deep epidemiological study in the field, and 3) at the research level, to better understand the dynamic of infection of C. burnetii in experimental models. La fièvre Q est une zoonose de répartition mondiale qui est due à une bactérie intracellulaire : Coxiella burnetii. Les sources principales de contamination pour l’homme sont les produits d’avortement des petits ruminants domestiques. Suite à l’épidémie des Pays-Bas, le premier objectif de ce travail était d’étudier la situation de la fièvre Q en Belgique. Nous avons déterminé que la fièvre Q est endémique dans notre pays. Elle est présente dans le cheptel caprin (6. 3 à 12. 1 % de prévalence troupeau) et bovin (agent étiologique de 1 % des avortements). L’observation d’un regroupement génotypique en fonction de l’espèce hôte, nous a amené à émettre l’hypothèse qu’au sein de l’espèce C. burnetii, il pourrait y avoir des sous-types différents (hypothèse de spécificité d’hôte). Ce suivi nous a également permis de déterminer deux types d’excrétion dans les laits de tank caprins. Au vu de la diversité des génotypes, nous avons mis au point, en parallèle de l’étude sur le terrain, des modèles d’infection in vitro (lignées cellulaires) et in vivo (souris). Dans ce travail, nous avons également essayé d’améliorer les outils de diagnostic et de vaccination en recherchant des mimes peptidiques du lipopolysaccharide de C. burnetii par phage display. L’amélioration de l’outil vaccinal suivait deux axes. Nous avons, d’une part, analysé la vaccination mise en place par les autorités belges. D’autre part, étant donné les faiblesses du vaccin actuel, nous avons testé de nouveaux candidats vaccins dans un modèle vaccinal murin. (SC - Sciences) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
