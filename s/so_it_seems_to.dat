25|$|Finally, it supposes {{that there}} is some {{physical}} distinction between a conscious observer and a non-conscious measuring device, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> require eliminating the strong Church–Turing hypothesis or postulating a physical model for consciousness.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, {{astronomer}} Robert Cumming of the Stockholm Observatory notes that, [...] "The name 'minor planet' [...] {{been more}} or less synonymous with 'asteroid' {{for a very long}} time. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me pretty insane to complain about any ambiguity or risk for confusion with the introduction of 'dwarf planet'." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the judges}} {{explained}} that the court had jurisdiction because the case brought up a legal issue, that of statutory interpretation (whether the 1911 Act {{could be used to}} enact the 1949 Act), rather than being examination of parliamentary proceedings. Lord Bingham noted that the bill was not enacted by both Houses of Parliament, as it was in Pickin, and that [...] "the appellants have raised a question of law which cannot, as such, be resolved by Parliament ... <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me necessary that the courts should resolve it, and that to do so involves no breach of constitutional propriety". Lord Nicholls distinguished Jackson from Pickin as a case examining the correct interpretation of the 1911 Act, an evaluation for the courts rather than Parliament; Lord Hope concurred, noting that there was no absolute prohibition on courts evaluating the validity of Acts of Parliament; and Lord Carswell agreed that the case raised [...] "a question of law which falls within the scope of courts of law carrying out their regular function". All nine judges accepted that the court had jurisdiction to consider whether the 1949 Act was valid.|$|E
60|$|At least, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me--and I consoled {{myself for}} the coming death [...] with the reflection: BEHOLD, THE WORLD IS PASSING AWAY!" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} {{mention of his}} name the girl's face {{distinctly}} darkened and her answers became curiously studied, almost evasive--or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> Serviss.|$|R
2500|$|There {{seems to}} be a certain logic in female homosexuality. For if it is true, broadly speaking, we acquire our first sexual proclivities in infancy, girl {{children}} who are petted and fondled by their mothers, nurses and female relatives acquire what might be said to be a [...] "normal" [...] sexual affection for their own sex. But this is not true of male children, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me that there is a very fundamental difference between male and female homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after departure, the {{traveling}} twin sees the stay-at-home twin {{with no time}} delay. At arrival, the image in the ship screen shows the staying twin as he was 1year after launch, because radio emitted from Earth 1year after launch gets to the other star 4years afterwards and meets the ship there. During this leg of the trip, {{the traveling}} twin sees his own clock advance 3years and the clock in the screen advance 1year, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> advance at [...] the normal rate, just 20image seconds per ship minute. This combines the effects of time dilation due to motion (by factor ε=0.6, five years on earth are 3years on ship) {{and the effect of}} increasing light-time-delay (which grows from 0 to 4years).|$|E
6000|$|... “Of course!” he said. “Still, he had {{apparently}} {{no intention of}} doing <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me we are {{under no obligation to}} Colonel Morales in one respect.” ...|$|E
60|$|As it was, however, we {{had come}} a long {{distance}} from our friends, and already sacrificed a life uselessly, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me then in my bitterness of spirit.|$|R
60|$|He sulked {{after that}} most of the way to the Rue du Hasard, or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> Andre-Louis. At least he sat silent, gloomily {{thoughtful}} to judge by his expression.|$|R
60|$|Before I {{could make}} reply {{the old man}} was striding off in the {{direction}} of the village, walking as spritely, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, as I myself might have done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glenn, you {{distress}} me {{when you}} talk like this," [...] replied Carley, soberly. [...] "You did not use to talk <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me you are bitter against women." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had come}} into a {{condition}} of vast perplexities. For {{the first time in}} my life, at least <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me now in this retrospect, I looked at my existence as a whole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you find}} it <b>so?</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me there's a great difference. I can imagine {{that at the end}} of ten years we might have a very {{pleasant}} correspondence. I shall have matured my epistolary style." ...|$|E
60|$|Every few minutes, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, {{though in}} reality the {{intervals}} may perhaps have been longer, a ghostly face would appear at the carriage-window, and ask to see our tickets.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little too}} much <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me that her {{mistress}} allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sickness}} of {{fear was}} stealing over me. My voice, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, disappointed at the effect it had produced, had retired, sulky, into my boots, whence {{it refused to}} emerge.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no knowing to what depth utter ruin {{may reduce}} {{a man who}} has been born to better things. He falls into idleness, and then comforts himself with drink. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, being here, I {{will deliver}} it, seeing that <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be fated. Tell me, do you chance {{to know a}} certain Small One who is great, a certain Old One whose brain is young, a doctor who is called Opener-of-Roads?" ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> us, reader, {{now that}} we have closed the record of it; {{nevertheless}} it was no dream, but a sad and stern reality to those who played their part in it--to those who sorrowed and suffered, sixty years ago, in the Pirate City.|$|E
60|$|And {{as she did}} <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{her that}} someone passing breathed upon her lips a little kiss: {{and for a while}} she did not move. Then, {{treading}} softly, she looked into the room.|$|R
6000|$|His dumb {{sacrifice}} passing their comprehension, {{had been}} rejected--or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> him He {{could not understand}} that they had spared him. Why! He {{was as good as}} they! His pride was hurt. No! They should not get him now! ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Sellars' languishing {{eyes were}} fixed upon me; Miss Sellars' red lips pouted and twitched; Miss Sellars' white bosom rose and fell. Never, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, had <b>so</b> large an amount of beauty been {{concentrated}} in one being.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Captain Eli. [...] "If she can't {{afford to}} keep the little gal, she can't afford to give no Christmas trees nor stockin's, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me, cap'n, that that little gal would {{be a pretty good}} child to help us keep Christmas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet," [...] {{rejoined the}} Baital impudently, [...] "if Tribikram had not {{preserved}} her bones {{how could she}} have been restored to life? And if Madhusadan had not learned the science of restoring the dead to life {{how could she have}} been revivified? At least, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me. But perhaps your royal wisdom may explain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you did it, anyway. And I have a {{right to}} feel hurt, and I do feel hurt, to have you treat me <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me that when a person goads, and crowds, and in a manner forces another person to talk, it is neither very fair nor very good-mannered to call what he says clack." ...|$|E
60|$|I owed it <b>to</b> myself--at least <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me--not {{to let it}} be {{supposed}} that I, too, had meanly deserted her. Dreadful as the prospect was, I felt that I must see her once more, {{and for the last}} time.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{was changed}} save {{for that and}} a terrible astonishment. The little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence, and {{the stillness of the}} evening, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, had {{scarcely}} been broken.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so {{glad you}} say No." [...] He spoke passionately, and yet there was banter in his voice, or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> her. [...] "It is because you fear to be told; it is because you had hoped that I did not know." ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{seemed to}} have had enough of this eerie conversation. Of course {{it is easy to}} laugh at natives and their superstitions, but, after a long life of experience, I am bound to admit that they are not always devoid of truth. The native has some kind of sixth sense which the civilised man has lost, or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It iss of no use," [...] said Fergus, {{when this}} became evident, [...] "for {{us to keep}} up a stern-chase after them. They have got {{too much of a}} start, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me, boys, we could not do better than follow up the tracks of Daniel Davidson an' make sure that he has got clear away from them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! my daughter, be plain, I pray of you, for I cannot {{understand}} your counsels. Were it not better {{to give to}} these people the red stones which they desire, and send them secretly from the land, saying that they had vanished into the earth again, for <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me we should be rid of much shame and trouble?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} smiled frightfully, at least <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> his companion: but he {{maintained}} {{the appearance of}} composure. In the mean time Peterchen, having secretly dispatched another messenger to the cooks, turned his serious attention to the difficulty that had just arisen.|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} for <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> the girls, but to request the {{assistance}} of the officer, who continued to skate round and round them at a distance of about ten yards. So again the elder young lady, seizing her opportunity, made appeal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hundreds of them, Sir Knight," [...] {{one of the}} men panted out; [...] "at least, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me; but indeed, we {{were this}} side of the village when they rushed into it; and, seeing that nought could be done to resist them, we fled at once." ...|$|R
