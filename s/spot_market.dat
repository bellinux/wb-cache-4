5|$|Tulips {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the <b>spot</b> <b>market)</b> occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy tulips {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed unenforceable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While {{contracting}} offers {{potential advantages}} for contracting parties {{it may also}} impose externalities on growers and processors who use <b>spot</b> <b>markets.</b> As independent growers shift into contracting, <b>spot</b> <b>markets</b> thin, which may force independent farmers to travel further and search harder to find inputs and to market their product. Thin <b>spot</b> <b>markets</b> also impose timing and coordination costs on growers and processors, especially when products are perishable or when processors need {{a steady supply of}} product for efficient operation of their facilities. Thus, the more <b>spot</b> <b>markets</b> thin the more growers and processors are inclined to contract. Transaction-cost externalities therefore engender too much contracting. The model provides an explanation for grower opposition to the introduction of contracting into a region even when individual growers benefit from accepting a contract on the margin, and it establishes the conditions for optimal regulation. The model also helps to explain why input and product transactions might shift abruptly from <b>spot</b> <b>markets</b> to contracts...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral supply {{contracts}} {{are widely used}} {{despite the presence of}} <b>spot</b> <b>markets.</b> In this paper, we provide a potential explanation for this prevalence of {{supply contracts}} even when <b>spot</b> <b>markets</b> are liquid and without delivery lag. Specifically, we consider the determination of an equilibrium forward contract on a nonstorable commodity between two firms that have mean-variance preferences over their risky profits and negotiate the forward contract through a Nash bargaining process. We derive the unique equilibrium forward contract in closed form and provide an extensive analysis. We show that it is the risk-hedging benefit from a forward that justifies its prevalence in spite of liquid <b>spot</b> <b>markets.</b> In addition, while a forward does not affect production decisions due to the presence of <b>spot</b> <b>markets,</b> it does affect inventory decisions of the storable input factor due to its hedging effect against the inventory risk. We also show that price volatilities and correlations are important determinants of the equilibrium contract. In particular, the equilibrium forward price can be nonmonotonic in the spot price volatility and can decrease as the initial spot price increases...|$|R

Issues such as forward contract pricing {{and the impact of}} the introduction of banking are highlighted. The following findings are presented in the paper: 1) Domestic emissions forward markets prices are greater than expected future spot prices if the market comprises regulated emitters only; 2) Forward prices can however, become lower than expected future spot prices as the trade volume of non-emitter market participants exceeds that of regulated emitters; 3) When the regulatory authority allows banking, the current <b>spot</b> trade <b>market</b> and future <b>spot</b> <b>markets</b> are linked to each other. As a result, the increase of uncertainty on the future <b>spot</b> <b>markets</b> are linked to each other.

25|$|The {{competitive}} market {{did not actually}} open until May 2002. Participation in the retail market was voluntary, with customers having the option of entering into contracts or rates being set in the five-minute <b>spot</b> <b>market.</b> Retail consumers were also free to enter fixed-rate contracts. For those that opted out of the contract option, electricity rates passed through a smoothed <b>spot</b> <b>market</b> price. When the market opened in May, wholesale prices averaged 3.01 cents per kWh. For a number of reasons, however, including an especially hot summer, a reduction in domestic generating capacity, and an increasing reliance on a limited import capacity, prices began to rise sharply. In July, average wholesale price was 6.2 cents per kWh. Under surmounting pressure from consumers, the government adopted the Electricity Pricing, Conservation and Supply (EPCS) Act in December 2002. The legislation capped retail prices at 4.3 cents per kWh and Ontario Power Generation (the successor of Ontario Hydro's electricity generation division) was to provide customers with a rebate for 100% of all electricity charges above that mark, retroactive to the market opening and continuing until 1 May 2006. Transmission and distribution rates were also frozen at their existing levels and would remain unchanged until 1 May 2006. The net result was a complete cessation of new investment in generation capacity and a significant cutback in new investment in transmission and distribution.|$|E

25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the <b>spot</b> <b>market</b> for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the <b>spot</b> <b>market</b> for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E
25|$|Libya’s {{isolation}} {{became even}} more pronounced following the 1992 imposition of United Nations sanctions designed to force Gaddafi to hand over two suspects indicted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The sanctions, imposed on 31 March 1992, initially banned sales of equipment for refining and transporting oil, but excluded oil production equipment. Sanctions were expanded on 11 November 1993, to include a freeze on Libya's overseas assets, excluding revenue from oil, natural gas, or agricultural products. Under these condition, NOC Chairman Abdallah al-Badri emphasized reducing new projects and upgrading domestic facilities. Joint ventures were initiated with Veba, Petrofina, North African Petroleum, the Petroleum Development Co. (Republic of Korea) and Lasmo. Foreign operators were encouraged to produce exclusively for export, limited to national oil companies with pre-sanctions equity in Libya.
