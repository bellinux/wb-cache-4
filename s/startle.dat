5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (<b>startle)</b> in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can <b>startle</b> inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) <b>startle</b> displays. For example the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, {{is illustrated in}} a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out {{both sides of the}} head, making it a startling sight.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to <b>startle</b> them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{games were}} <b>Startling</b> Odyssey and <b>Startling</b> Odyssey II. Contrary to their number associations, the series progressed backwards; hence, the supposed <b>Startling</b> Odyssey III: Miriam no Seisen, would've {{been the first}} chronologically, followed by <b>Startling</b> Odyssey II: Maryu Sensou, and then <b>Startling</b> Odyssey I: Blue Evolution.|$|R

5|$|Some cicadas such as Hemisciera maculipennis display bright deimatic flash {{coloration}} {{on their}} hindwings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to <b>startle</b> predators, giving the cicadas time to escape. The majority of cicadas are nocturnal {{and rely on}} camouflage when at rest, but some species are aposematic; the Malaysian Huechys sanguinea has conspicuous red and black warning coloration, is diurnal, and boldly flies about {{in full view of}} possible predators.|$|E
5|$|The pupae of some moths {{are able}} to wriggle their abdomen. The three caudal {{segments}} of the pupal abdomen (segments 8–10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two-three segments {{at the end of}} the abdomen, more basal taxa such as the Micropterigidae can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before eclosion. The pupae of Hepialidae {{are able to}} move back and forth in the larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines. Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of <b>startle</b> value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few hawk moths, such as Theretra latreillii, the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a rattling or clicking sound which adds to the <b>startle</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly {{pigmented}} {{darker than the}} back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. The pattern is used both in <b>startle</b> or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to <b>startle</b> and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E
5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk and honey badger with strong defences—the offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to <b>startle</b> inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E
5|$|While it {{contains}} some small role-playing elements, Dawn of Mana diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles {{of the series}} to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay in a full 3D world. Incorporating the Havok physics engine, the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to <b>startle</b> enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only to reset to his base abilities with each new zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. Unlike many of its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component.|$|E

25|$|Excited utterances: Statements {{relating}} to <b>startling</b> events or condition made while the declarant {{was under the}} stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. This is the exception that may apply to the 'police officer' scenario listed above. The victim's cries of help were made under the stress of a <b>startling</b> event, and the victim is still under {{the stress of the}} event, as is evidenced by the victim's crying and visible shaking. An excited utterance {{does not have to be}} made at the same time of the <b>startling</b> event. A statement made minutes, hours or even days after the <b>startling</b> event can be excited utterances, so long as the declarant is still under the stress of the <b>startling</b> event. However, the more time that elapses between a <b>startling</b> event and the declarant's statement, the more the statements will be looked upon with disfavor.|$|R
5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of <b>startle,</b> counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E
5|$|Insects in {{the group}} are plant-eaters, with a few species at times {{becoming}} serious pests of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. They protect themselves from predators by camouflage; when detected, many species attempt to <b>startle</b> the predator with a brilliantly-coloured wing-flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the rainbow grasshopper have warning coloration which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs {{are the subject of}} attack by parasitoids and predators.|$|E
5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to <b>startle</b> or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hippocampal sharp waves (SPWs) {{are among}} the {{earliest}} neural population patterns observed in infant mammals. Similarly, <b>startles</b> {{are among the}} earliest behavioral events observed. Here we provide evi-dence indicating that these two events are linked mechanistically soon af-ter birth in freely moving and head-fixed 1 to 4 -day-old rats. EMG electro-des and intrahippocampal silicon depth electrodes were used to detect the presence of <b>startles</b> and SPWs, respectively. In intact pups, the majority of sharp waves were preceded by <b>startles</b> (average latency: 161 ms). When the hippocampal formation was surgically separated from the brainstem, however, sharp waves and <b>startles</b> still occurred, but now independently. In addition, unrelated to <b>startles</b> or SPWs, gamma oscillations were detected in several subjects, as were neocortical " that propa-gated passively into the hippocampus. The cooccurrence of sharp waves and <b>startles</b> provides the opportunity for Hebbian changes in synaptic effi-cacy and, thus, is poised {{to contribute to the}} assembly of neural circuits early in development.

5|$|Snakes, {{like other}} reptiles, have a skin {{covered in a}} scale. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. A scale protects {{the body of the}} snake, aids it in locomotion, allows {{moisture}} to be retained within, alters the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage, and in some cases even aids in prey capture (such as Acrochordus). The simple or complex colouration patterns (which help in camouflage and anti-predator display) are a property of the underlying skin, but the folded nature of scaled skin allows bright skin to be concealed between scales then revealed in order to <b>startle</b> predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to <b>startle</b> the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E
5|$|Drunken Angel {{is often}} {{considered}} the director's first major work. Although the script, {{like all of}} Kurosawa's occupation-era works, {{had to go through}} forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster (yakuza) with tuberculosis, it was also the director's first film with Toshiro Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one (Ikiru) of the director's next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in Drunken Angel, his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by Takashi Shimura, who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that Marlon Brando's defiant stance would <b>startle</b> American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious Kinema Junpo critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.|$|E

25|$|Serotonin is a monoamine {{neurotransmitter}} {{which has}} been associated with schizophrenia.

40|$|In a pilot study, {{aspects of}} <b>startling</b> noises were investigated. For a typical {{synthetic}} broadband sound, i. e. uniform exciting noise, {{the influence of}} the following stimulus parameters on <b>startling</b> reactions were studied: (1) Magnitude of a level increase (5 [...] . 40 dB, 10 ms rise time) above a pedestal of 45 dB (2) Level increase of 30 dB for pedestals between 40 and 55 dB as well as 20 dB for pedestals between 50 an 65 dB (10 ms rise time). (3) Rise times between 1 and 300 ms for a level increase of 35 dB above a 50 dB pedestal. For the parameters considered in the pilot study, the magnitude of the level increase of a rising edge was found to be crucial for the <b>startling</b> reaction. Rise times between 1 and 10 ms lead to similar <b>startling</b> reactions, which were approximately halved for 200 ms rise time. In a first approach to modeling <b>startling</b> reactions to synthetic noises, the increase in percentile loudness N 5 proves promising. Additionally, to predict <b>startling</b> of technical sounds, the onset rate of the loudness-time function seems to be of importance...|$|R
