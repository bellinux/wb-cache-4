5000|$|Simultaneous seminars: Students are {{arranged}} in multiple small groups and placed {{as far as possible}} from each other. Following the guidelines of the <b>Socratic</b> <b>Seminar,</b> students engage in small group discussions. Simultaneous seminars are typically done with experienced students who need little guidance and can engage in a discussion without assistance from a teacher/facilitator. According to the literature, this type of seminar is beneficial for teachers who want students to explore a variety of texts around a main issue or topic. Each small group may have a different text to read/view and discuss. A larger <b>Socratic</b> <b>Seminar</b> can then occur as a discussion about how each text corresponds with one another. Simultaneous Seminars can also be used for a particularly difficult text. Students can work through different issues and key passages from the text.|$|E

A Socratic Circle is not a debate. The goal of this activity is to have participants work together to construct meaning and arrive at an answer, not for one student or one group to “win the argument”.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This essay {{concerns}} Christina Rossetti’s poem Goblin Market {{and its use}} in a Swedish {{upper secondary}} classroom. The purpose of this essay was to analyse the poem through a Marxist perspective and investigate how both {{the analysis of the}} poem and the poem itself could be used when teaching English to an upper secondary class. This was done in two stages; firstly by analysing the Victorian society’s effect on Rossetti’s poem through a Marxist criticism perspective and secondly by using a specific pedagogic method called the Socratic Dialogue method when analysing the use of the analysis and the poem in the classroom. When analysing the poem and how it has been affected by its contemporary society, it becomes clear that the poem provides a critique in several ways towards consumerism and social ideals of Victorian Britain. Concerning the use of the poem and the analysis in the upper secondary English classroom it is evident that the poem and the literary analysis combined provides an interesting view on Victorian Britain for the pupils to discuss while having <b>Socratic</b> <b>seminars...</b>|$|R

Robert Maynard Hutchins, head of the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1951, brought Adler to the university and implemented a program (known as the Chicago Program and, later, the Hutchins Plan) based on Adler's ideas.The Chicago program comprised sequences in the natural sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences which were supposed to integrate past and present work within these divisions of knowledge. In addition, these sequences were capped by work in philosophy and history. The emphasis in teaching was on small classes with bright students, where discussion could supplant monologue as the dominant pedagogic technique.... At the same time, in order to retain high academic standards and contact with the [...] "frontiers of knowledge", the College's pedagogy emphasized reading originals (sometimes although not invariably, defined as Great Books).Shimer, affiliated with the University of Chicago since 1896, adopted the Hutchins plan (including University of Chicago syllabi, comprehensive examinations and several university instructors) in 1950. When Hutchins left the university in 1951 and it abandoned the Hutchins Plan, Shimer continued to use it and it is still reflected in the college's curriculum.|$|E

Ensemble directors and music educators have noticed that many students are music-illiterate. While students enjoy listening to and performing music, many students cannot accurately or thoughtfully describe the thematic ideas that are represented in the music they are listening to. In this study, students participated in three Socratic seminars that used a work of music as the assigned "text. " Students were guided through the process of listening to a work of music and making annotations. Various guides and strategies for annotating music were provided. Students participated in open-ended question based discussions that aimed to discover the theme of the music.

40|$|<b>Socratic</b> <b>seminars</b> {{have long}} been practiced internationally by {{educators}} and philosophers {{as a supplement to}} classroom teaching and coaching. However, the rationales and effects of this methodology including how these effects are achieved have not been thoroughly investigated or systematically analyzed. The first section of this study is a theoretical review of literature, investi-gating the pedagogical rationales for using a Socratic methodology. The second section is an analysis of sixteen seminars conducted over three years with children from five to sixteen years old. The students’ body language and group interaction were analyzed closely through a phenomenological approach. The analysis focused on how the seminar culture was taught and learned and whether the intended methodology made a difference. The literature review reveals that the various Socratic traditions describe a set of methodological steps to attain similar objectives. By using these steps, intellectual and dialogical habits of mind are expected to be internalized. The seminar analysis shows that the skilled participants shifted their interaction towards an “inquiring” dialogue over time, and that the distribution of rhetorical power changed to a more cooperative communication. The students’ learning proceeded through a series of stages, partly different from the anticipated ideal. The facilitator’s ability to handle rule breaking, and to create a safe environment for intellectual exploration, was significant. The findings show that intricate “silent” moves like gestures and glances helped maintain a productive and egalitarian seminar culture. The participants developed their thinking skills over time, evolving from relativism to critical examination...|$|R

The goals {{of this study}} were to (a) seek defensible curriculum through prior research that engages and challenges students enrolled in gifted programs and (b) gather effective strategies and curriculum used to teach academically gifted students from student and teachers??? perspectives. Eighty student participants completed an eight question survey that elicited six Likert scale responses and two open ended responses. Six GATE teachers volunteered to participate in a six question interview for additional quantitative data. Participants completing surveys came from six local elementary schools and were all students in fourth and fifth grade enrolled in GATE. Surveys indicated that most students felt that teachers understood their unique learning styles, and that the GATE curriculum connected to their lives and interests. Several innovative student ideas were collected from the data related to effective curriculum {{to be used in the}} program. The interview participants provided defensible strategies used in their curriculum that included the use of student interest surveys prior to designing curriculum, <b>Socratic</b> <b>Seminars</b> (Roberts and Billings 1999), and tasking gifted students to conduct expanded research of subject matter and then teaching back to the class (Renzulli, 2007).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find out how Socratic seminars can foster critical thinking and respect among students. <b>Socratic</b> <b>seminar</b> in this study is a student-centered activity in which students independently discuss a theme assigned by their teacher. Since teacher‘s role is minimal in this activity, students must be able to manage the discussion by asking a new question when a previously asked question has been completely answered and giving a chance for students who have not contributed to the discussion. Through the process of asking and answering questions, students can reflect on their understanding and perspectives on the assigned themes. In addition, by having conflicting opinions and thoughts, students can learn how to deal with differences and thus foster their respect toward others. The participants were 15 students of bridging program class conducted by the International Program of Universitas Islam Indonesia. They participated in a series of Socratic seminars in which they were required to read assigned texts, prepare questions, and be actively involved in the seminars. The data were collected through observation, open-ended questionnaire, and semi-structured interview.

It centers on the artwork of Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco, early twentieth century muralists who expressed in their paintings the cultural tensions and aspirations of Mexicans throughout history. Through a series of short activities, the students learn to interpret the artists’ symbols and analyze their philosophical assumptions and insights. Teachers select strategies from below depending upon the level of the class and time constraints. To understand the historical context for the art, students read a short essay on Mexico from 1910 – 1939. The teacher projects two of Diego Rivera’s works on a large screen and discusses key elements of art with the students. Pairs analyze another painting by Rivera and share their findings with the class. The same steps are taken with a painting by Orozco. Pairs question each other about the paintings.
