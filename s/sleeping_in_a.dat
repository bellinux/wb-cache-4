Thompson remained a resident there until he turned 18 in 1945.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Rio Grande and arriving at Ojo de Agua at approximately 1am, the Mexican raiders attacked the village's garrison. The American {{soldiers who had}} been <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wooden building stubbornly resisted. The Americans were heavily outgunned, though, as the Signal Corps personnel were armed only with pistols. In the fighting Sergeant Schaeffer was killed, {{and as a result}} command devolved to Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith who by that time had also been wounded three times. In addition to attacking the garrison, the raiders robbed the post office and attacked the home of the Dillard family, setting their house on fire and stealing their livestock.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Boone {{returned}} to North Carolina {{to bring his}} family back to Kentucky. In the autumn of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including (according to tradition) the family of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone's Station. He began earning money at this time by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so settlers needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash from various settlers and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he was <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the settlers forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do.|$|E

5|$|Agârbiceanu {{recalled}} {{an idyllic}} childhood, with summers spent tending to his father's sheep and <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stick hut. An avid reader of stories by Petre Ispirescu, he attended school {{in his native}} village and in Blaj, graduating from the Superior Gymnasium in 1900. Literary historians describe this as the period of his literary debut, which was a collaboration with Unirea newspaper. There, Agârbiceanu published a feuilleton (signed as Alfius), poetry, and, in 1900, the short story În postul Paștelui ("At Lent"). Agârbiceanu also served {{as secretary of the}} Blaj Literary Society, at the time the city's only Romanian-speaking literary body still tolerated by the Hungarian authorities. He soon became a correspondent of Răvașul, a Cluj-based newspaper, signing his first pieces there with the pen name Alfius, then as Agarbi or Potcoavă ("Horseshoe").|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
5|$|One of Reich's first {{patients}} was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old woman {{with whom he}} had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but {{in the early days of}} psychoanalysis the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich's diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of sepsis after <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bitterly cold room she had rented as a place for her and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings). Kahn's mother suspected that her daughter had died after a botched illegal abortion, possibly performed by Reich himself. According to Christopher Turner, she found some of her daughter's bloodied underwear in a cupboard.|$|E

5|$|Wallenberg started <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} house each night, {{to guard}} against being captured or killed by Arrow Cross Party members or by Adolf Eichmann's men. Two days before the Soviet Army occupied Budapest, Wallenberg negotiated with Eichmann and with Major-General Gerhard Schmidthuber, the supreme commander of German forces in Hungary. Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member Pál Szalai to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded the occupying Germans to prevent a Fascist plan {{to blow up the}} Budapest ghetto and kill an estimated 70,000 Jews. The note also persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a death march of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over.|$|E
5|$|Players can unlock Vincent by {{the halfway}} point of Final Fantasy VII, when Cloud Strife and his allies find him <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coffin in the {{basement}} of Shinra Mansion in Nibelheim. Cloud mentions his quest to stop the game's antagonist, Sephiroth, who Vincent recognizes as the son of Lucrecia Crescent. Vincent joins the group when he learns that they may eventually meet up with Hojo, against whom Vincent has an unexplained vendetta. Later, Vincent finds Lucrecia inside a cave, and his backstory is partly revealed. Vincent {{was a member of the}} Turks, an elite group of Shinra agents. While serving as Lucrecia's guard, he fell in love with her, but she ultimately decided to remain faithful to Hojo, who persuaded her to use her unborn baby in his experiments. When protesting about the nature of these experiments, Vincent was shot by Hojo, who subsequently began to experiment on him as well. This resulted in him not aging and having the ability to transform in various demons. Not being able to protect Lucrecia, Vincent felt a strong guilt which led him to his isolation. Overcome by guilt, Lucrecia sealed herself away in Mako crystals. Upon entering the cave in the game, Lucrecia revives and asks Vincent if Sephiroth is still alive, but Vincent lies and tells her that he is dead.|$|E

25|$|A motif {{that entered}} European art during the Renaissance {{was the idea}} of a statue of a nymph <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grotto or spring.

The report, and an accompanying poem supposedly on the fountain describing the sleeping nymph, are now generally concluded to be a fifteenth-century forgery, but the motif proved influential among artists and landscape gardeners for several centuries after, with copies seen at neoclassical gardens such as the grotto at Stourhead.|$|E
