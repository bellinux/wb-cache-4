50|$|Medicine Bow Peak is {{the highest}} peak in the Snowy Range, {{a part of the}} Medicine Bow Mountains, about 35 miles west of Laramie, Wyoming. It lies within Medicine Bow National Forest and {{is the highest}} point in {{southern}} Wyoming. The summit lies in extreme western Albany County, but the mountain's lower reaches stretch westward into eastern Carbon County. The summit is more than 12,013 feet (3,661 m) high and is visible from Snowy Range Pass, elevation 10,847 ft (3,300 m), on Wyoming Highway 130, a Wyoming Scenic Byway.

50|$|The northward route going {{north from}} Huaraz follows the Rio Santa {{to the north}} end of the Callejón de Huaylas, where it {{branches}} into two. The minor branch goes steeply westward up to the ancient town of Huaylas and then northwestward down to the coast. The main highway goes north beside the Cañón del Pato through a dozen one-lane tunnels, precipitously descends several thousand meters by <b>switch-backs</b> and hairpin curves on the one-lane rocky roadway, and arrives at the town of Huallanca. Here there is a connection with the Santa Railway. The highway again splits. The most heavily traveled fork continues generally west to the coastal city of Chimbote where it connects with the Pan-American Highway. The other fork goes from Huallanca northward and upward into the northern Peruvian Andes.|$|R

50|$|The easiest {{and most}} popular route is the East Ridge via Red Pine Lake trail up Little Cottonwood Canyon. The trail is {{approximately}} 3 miles to lower Red Pine lake and roughly 1/2 {{mile to the}} upper Red Pine Lake. From here proceed southwest up the steep talus slope {{to the top of}} the 'false summit'. A well-defined trail should be visible here in the absence of snow. Continue west along the ridge through a series of large boulders to a second steep slope. You can either wrap around this slope to the south and <b>switch-back</b> up to the summit (easier) or just continue west until you reach the summit (steep).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>switch-backs</b> {{stop when}} the plateau is reached, {{a point that}} {{is marked by a}} small rest area made from rocks and cement. The trail then leads down off the plateau into a dry streambed. Caution should always be taken when {{entering}} a dry streambed in any desert, as it is a prime place for flash floods. The trail follows the streambed down. There are multiple trails leading down this small canyon wash, but they all lead to the same place and never stray more than 30 ft away from each other. The trail meanders down this streambed for approximately 5 mi until the canyon starts to open up into another canyon. This spot is marked by a dramatic increase in vegetation. Follow the trail down the new canyon to the left.|$|R

The trail can be traveled by foot, by horseback, or on a mule service the Havasupai offer. The mule service can also be purchased for luggage/packs only, which allows an easier hike and the ability to bring down more luxuries. The trail starts out at the hilltop, where it <b>switch-backs</b> {{down the side of the}} canyon for about ¾ of a mile.

60|$|I {{have almost}} {{forgotten}} {{in the interest of}} the human spectacle that there is a sea somewhere about at Rockaway Beach, and it is this that the people have come for. I might well forget that modest sea, it is so built out of sight by the restaurants and bath-houses and <b>switch-backs</b> and shops that border it, and by the hotels and saloons and shows flaring along the road that divides the village, and the planked streets that intersect this. But if you walk southward on any of the streets, you presently find the planks foundering in sand, which drifts far up over them, and then you find yourself in full sight of the ocean and the ocean bathing. Swarms and heaps of people in all lolling and lying and wallowing shapes strew the beach, and the water is full of slopping and shouting and shrieking human creatures, clinging with bare white arms to the life-lines that run from the shore to the buoys; beyond these the lifeguard stays himself in his boat with outspread oars, and rocks on the incoming surf.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe phase split problem, {{formulated}} as an unconstrained minimization of the Gibbs free energy, {{is commonly}} solved by the second-order Newton method, {{preceded by a}} number of first-order successive substitutions. For difficult problems, the convergence radius of the Newton method may be small and a high number of successive substitution iterations may be required before the switch, or in repeated <b>switch-backs.</b> An interesting alternative is given by the quasi-Newton methods, representing a good compromise between complexity and convergence speed. The quasi-Newton BFGS method exhibits a super-linear convergence rate (in some cases without step length control) and a rank two update of the Hessian matrix guarantees a hereditary positive definiteness. In this work, a scaling methodology is proposed for finding the appropriate change of variables for phase equilibrium problems; applied to the two-phase split problem, the resulting change of variables leads to a Hessian matrix of the form H = I + D + ND, where I is the identity matrix, D is a diagonal matrix with elements vanishing at the solution, and ND is an effective low-rank matrix. The results of numerical experiments carried out on several test cases show that the BFGS method using the proposed variables is more robust and efficient than previous implementations (from the literature and open source codes). A two-parameter cubic equation of state was used in this work, but any equation of state can be used. The quasi-Newton methods are particularly suited for thermodynamic models for which the Hessian matrix is difficult or costly to obtain...|$|R

Five ruminally and duodenally cannulated steers (305 kg) were fed a corn-alfalfasoybean meal diet (17 % CP), with or without lasalocid, in a three period, <b>switch-back</b> experiment. Ruminal pH, ammonia, volatile fatty acids, and amino acid and peptide concentrations were unaffected by lasalocid. Lasalocid reduced (P<. 05) ruminal protease activity by 15 %, but did not change deaminase activity. Digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, fiber, and crude protein were similar between treatments. Intestinal flows of microbial and feed crude protein fractions, as well as amino acids, remained unchanged when lasalocid was fed. Thus, in this experiment, lasalocid failed to decrease feed protein degradation in the rumen and, therefore, was unable to increase the supply of crude protein or amino acids to the small intestine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A new {{technique}} that reduces stacking fault (SF) density in 3 C-SiC, termed <b>switch-back</b> epitaxy (SBE), is demonstrated regarding {{its effects on}} morphological and electrical properties. SBE is a homoepitaxial growth process on backside of 3 C-SiC grown on undulant-Si. The key feature of SBE, the surface polarity of residual SFs in 3 C-SiC, which cannot be erased by heteroepitaxial growth on undulant-Si, is converted from the Si-face to the C-face. The SF density {{on the surface of}} 3 C-SiC grown by SBE shows a remarkable decrease to one-seventh lower than that on undulant- Si. The leakage current of pn-diode epitaxially fabricated on the 3 C-SiC substrate grown by SBE decreases to as low as one-thirtieth that on 3 C-SiC substrate grown without SBE. These results suggest that SBE eliminates the SFs on the surface of 3 C-SiC and subsequently reduces the leakage current at pn-junction thus fabricated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} series and shunt flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) controllers. The comparison is made using frequency domain methods under the framework of individual channel analysis and design (ICAD). A 5 th order model synchronous generator feeding into a large system via a tie-line system is considered. The system includes a shunt compensator {{in the form of a}} static VAr compensator (SVC) or a series compensator in the form of a thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC).

Fundamental analyses are carried out using ICAD to explain the dynamic behaviour of the generator affected by the shunt or series FACTS devices. Using the ICAD framework, an in-depth comparison is made between the abilities of the SVC and TCSC to eliminate the problematic <b>switch-back</b> characteristic intrinsic to synchronous generators...|$|E
40|$|Équipe 104 : NanomatériauxInternational audienceWe present 77 K isotherms of krypton {{adsorption}} on {{bundles of}} closed highly-pure HiPco single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Two volumetric adsorption protocols were used, {{one with an}} increasing Kr dose per injection (IAD), one with a constant dose (CAD). Detailed microstructural examination showed that the SWCNTs combine into small bundles (of 25 - 30 SWCNTs) which are heterogeneous in diameter with a consequential range of interstitial channel (IC) shapes and sizes. The IC-sites are the subnanoscaled pores with alternating enlargements and constrictions along the tube axes. This results in adsorption dosing (AD) dependent characteristics of the low-pressure region of the isotherm. In the IAD protocol the <b>switch-back</b> behavior of the isotherm stemmed from metastable adsorption. Using the CAD protocol, different branches are observed. Well-pronounced substeps were established which we interpret as corresponding {{to the formation of}} various phases of confined Kr with different atoms arrangement. The height of a given substep obtained in different measurements depends on the AD value which can strongly influence the population of the site. Some substeps existing only for certain values of AD suggests the existence of a certain selectivity or of a preferential phase formation according to this value...|$|E
40|$|The {{boundary}} conditions, as-fabricated shape, and height-to-depth {{ratio of}} an arch characterize its bistability. We investigate this by modeling planar arches with torsion and translational springs at the pin joints {{anchored to the}} ground. A pinned-pinned arch, a special case of the model, has superior bistable characteristics as compared to a fixed-fixed bistable arch, {{which is also a}} particular case of the model. Arches with revolute flexures at the ends retain bistable characteristics of the pinned-pinned arches while being amenable for easy fabrication. However, equilibrium equations for such arches become intractable for analytical solution unlike the extreme cases of fixed-fixed and pinned-pinned arches. Therefore, a semi-analytical method for analysis and shape-synthesis of bistable arches with general boundary conditions is developed in this work. This is done by numerically determining critical points in the force-displacement curve. These critical points correspond to switching and <b>switch-back</b> forces and travel between the two states thereby enabling synthesis for desired behavior. We present design and optimization examples of bistable arches with a variety of boundary conditions and as-fabricated shape without prestress. We also propose two approaches to design a new class of asymmetric bistable arches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding {{supplemental}} biotin on net absorption and metabolism of nutrients by the portal-drained viscera (PDV; the gut, pancreas, spleen and associated fat) and liver of lactating dairy cows was measured. Three cows in early to mid-lactation catheterised for measurements of net nutrient absorption and metabolism by the PDV and liver were fed a total-mixed ration {{with or without}} supplemental biotin at 20 mg/day using a <b>switch-back</b> design (ABA v.

There was also no effect of feeding biotin on net release of glucose by the liver, net liver removal of glucose precursors (propionate, alanine, lactate) or net liver release of p-hydroxybutyrate. Feeding biotin increased net PDV release of ammonia. Reasons for the response are not certain, but a numerical increase in net PDV release of acetate suggests that rumen or hindgut fermentation was altered. Results {{of the present study}} do not support the hypothesis that supplemental biotin increases liver glucose production in lactating dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simplified method {{to analyze and}} design a bistable pinned-pinned arch with torsion springs at the pin (revolute) joints. Finite, but not zero, values of torsion spring constants offer the dual advantage of being amenable to monolithic compliant bistable arches wherein torsion springs are realized with equivalent revolute flexures; and giving enhanced range of travel between the stable states and reduced switching forces. However, the equilibrium equations become intractable for analytical solution unlike the extreme cases of fixed-fixed and pinned-pinned arches. Therefore, a new method for analyzing and designing novel bistable arches is presented here by determining critical points in the force-displacement curve. First, the equilibrium equations for post-buckling analysis are derived by writing the deflected profile as a linear combination of the buckling mode shapes of the corresponding straight beam with torsion springs at the pinned ends. These equations are then used to find the critical points with maximum, minimum, and zero forces. The critical points not only provide an approximate view of the bistable force-displacement curve but also enable synthesis of arches with desired behaviour. By using this semi-analytical method, we present {{an example of an}} arch with reduced switching force, large <b>switch-back</b> force, and enhanced travel between the two stable states...|$|E
40|$|The TCSC, {{a mature}} {{member of the}} FACTS technology, is the {{electronically-controlled}} counterpart of the conventional series bank of capacitors. Its major bene-fits are its ability to regulate power flows along the com-pensated line and to rapidly modulate its effective imped-ance. In this paper, fundamental analysis of the synchro-nous generator – TCSC system using Individual Channel Analysis and Design, is carried out. The main benefits of this approach in control system design tasks are elucidated. Fundamental analysis is used to explain the generator dynamic behaviour as affected by the TCSC. The system is modelled as a 3 x 3 multivariable plant. Moreover, a control system design for the system is presented, with particular emphasis in the closed-loop performance and stability and structural robustness assessment. The percentage of series compensation is varied (50, 25 and 10 %) by changing the firing angle of the TCSC. It is formally shown that {{the addition of the}} TCSC improves the dynamical performance of the synchronous machine by substantially decreasing the electrical distance and therefore considerably reducing the awkward <b>switch-back</b> characteristic exhibited by synchro-nous generators. However, the TCSC inclusion brings on fragility to the global system, making it non-minimum phase and introducing adverse dynamics in the speed channel of the synchronous machine. QC 2012020...|$|E
