50|$|Each pot bank {{made its}} own saggars from fire clay. In the <b>saggar</b> maker's workshop, clay would be rolled around a wooded form by the <b>saggar</b> maker, while a lad would knock the bottom using a mawl and an iron mould. A <b>saggar</b> could be {{expected}} to last for around 40 firings after which it had to be replaced. During biscuit firing, tableware cups and bowls were put on a fine layer of flint dust {{on the bottom of the}} <b>saggar,</b> while flatware was supported like a sandwich between layers of flint. They had to be stacked carefully to prevent distortion during firing. Then the <b>saggar</b> was topped and sealed to prevent any fumes or kiln debris entering the <b>saggar</b> and discolouring the wares. During the second firing, the glost firing, the glazed ware was held by pins, saddles, spurs and thimbles, as any contact point would leave a blemish on the glaze. Sorting the thimbles for reuse was one of the lowest jobs in the potbank.|$|E

50|$|From {{the twentieth}} century studio potters have used <b>saggars</b> to create {{decorative}} ceramic pieces. In this use <b>saggars</b> are {{used to create a}} localised reducing atmosphere, or concentrate the effects of salts, metal oxides and other materials on the surface of their ware.|$|R
50|$|The unfired ceramic ware {{was placed}} in <b>saggars</b> and then biscuit fired, before being glazed and again placed in <b>saggars</b> prior to being glost fired. Ware may then be decorated, and placed on {{refractory}} bats and fired again such as in a muffle kiln.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Saggar</b> Maker's Bottom Knocker [...] was a name {{considered}} sufficiently amusing {{for it to}} {{be featured}} on the television panel show What's My Line?. Whilst <b>saggar</b> making was a skilled craft, bottom knocking was far less skilled, consisting of beating clay into a metal ring.|$|E
50|$|This {{standard}} Bizen technique causes scarlet {{lines to}} appear as though painted with a brush. The pattern results from rice straw wrapped around the piece before firing in the kiln. The piece is placed in a box-like container called a <b>saggar.</b> The <b>saggar</b> is covered so that the pottery is shielded from direct contact with flames or flying ashes. Protected like this, the pieces in the <b>saggar</b> turn white due to a chemical reaction. Alkaloids in the straw combine with the iron in the clay; the straw-covered areas react and create red and brown burn marks.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-nine {{samples of}} kiln {{furniture}} or technical ceramic (firing plate, <b>saggars,</b> spacers, props, wads) and six samples of building ceramics (bricks, tiles) from {{the manufacture of}} Granges-le-Bourg were studied by optical microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The kiln furniture is chemically inhomogeneous and belong to a CaO- + MgO-poor (firing plate, <b>saggars)</b> or a CaO- + MgO-rich (props, spacers, wads) group. Bricks and tiles pertain to the first group which was manufactured using decarbonatized top layers of local Triassic dolomitic marls. For the second group, the deeper layers were used.

50|$|Some pots may be {{carefully}} prepared for <b>saggar</b> firing. One method creates a smooth surface covered with clay slip, terra sigillata, which responds particularly {{well to the}} <b>saggar</b> technique. This slip covering may be burnished to achieve a gloss. Prepared pots are nestled into saggars filled with beds of combustible materials, such as sawdust, less combustible organic materials, salts and metals. These materials ignite or fume during firing, leaving the pot buried in layers of fine ash. Ware produced in filled saggars may display dramatic markings, with colours ranging from distinctive black and white markings to flashes of golds, greens and red tones. Porcelain and stoneware are ideal for displaying the surface patterns obtained through <b>saggar</b> firing. In addition {{to the use of}} saggars, some studio potters bundle pots and burnable materials within a heavy wrapping of metal foil.|$|E
50|$|A {{bottle oven}} kiln is {{protected}} by an outer hovel which helps to create an updraught. The biscuit kiln was filled with <b>saggars</b> of green flatwares (bedded in flint) by placers. The doors (clammins) were bricked up and then the firing began. Each firing took 14 tons of coal. Fires were lit in the firemouths and baited every four hours. Flames rose up inside the kiln and heat passed between the bungs of <b>saggars.</b> They controlled {{the temperature of the}} firing using dampers in the crown. The firing was monitored by Bullers rings placed in the kiln. A kiln would be fired to 1250C.|$|R
50|$|Traditional kilns were wood firing, which {{required}} the pots {{to be protected}} in the glaze and luster firings by <b>saggars</b> or to be fired in a muffle kiln. Except for those making luster ware, modern tin-glaze potters use electric kilns.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottle oven}} kiln is {{protected}} by an outer hovel, which helps to create an updraught. The biscuit kiln was filled with clay sealed <b>saggars</b> of green (un-fired) flatwares (bedded in flint) by placers. The doors (clammins) were bricked up and the firing began. Each firing took 14 tons of coal. Fires were lit in the firemouths and baited every four hours, flames rose up inside the kilns, heat passed between the bungs of <b>saggars.</b> They controlled {{the temperature of the}} firing using dampers in the crown. The temperature was gauged by watching the contraction of bullers rings (a pyrometric device placed in the kiln). A kiln would be fired to 1250C.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, closed-container saggars {{have been}} used to shield {{ceramics}} from the direct contact of flames and from damage by kiln debris. Lehman, however, pioneered using a <b>saggar</b> for the opposite purpose: to encapsulate ceramic pieces within a particular atmosphere: [...] "My approach to saggar-firing is to wrap pots in fresh vegetation and place them in the <b>saggar</b> on their sides, atop a bed of sawdust. I then cover the pot entirely with sawdust and place the lid on the <b>saggar.</b> During the firing, due to the presence of heat and pressure - and due to the relative absence of oxygen - the vegetation turns to 'activated charcoal', and in the process, releases a film of carbon. When everything works just right, the film of carbon penetrates the porous porcelain pot. The images you see on the pots are the result of that 'carbon transfer', similar to the fossil-formation process called 'carbonization.'" ...|$|E
50|$|Placing {{and drawing}} the kiln was {{the job of}} placers. Placers would take the unfired {{greenware}} that was drying in the greenhouse (or the glost placing shop) and stack it in the <b>saggar.</b> They would seal the <b>saggar,</b> then carry it into the bottle oven on their heads. Each loaded <b>saggar</b> weighed around 56 lb. They were stacked in bungs {{in such a way}} so the most delicate wares were protected. A bung of saggars would be 12 or 13 high, {{on the top of the}} bung would be unfired newly moulded green saggars. In the centre of the bottle oven is the well-hole, over it, saggars with no bottoms would be placed in the pipe-bung: this formed a chimney to draw the fires. When the kiln was full, the clammins were bricked up leaving one brick short to form a spyhole so the firemen could watch the buller's rings to judge the temperature of the firing.|$|E
5000|$|In Electric Kiln Ceramics, Richard Zakin elaborates on how {{the effects}} of rake and [...] "smoke-reduction firings" [...] can be {{achieved}} through using a simple electric kiln, rather than more elaborate wood-fired kilns. He specifically names Dick Lehman and Gerry Caplan with pioneering this approach: [...] "Smoke-reduction firings {{require the use of}} a <b>saggar,</b> which is a sealed container placed inside the firing chamber. A bed of flammable material such as sawdust is placed in the base of the <b>saggar</b> and the ware is placed on top. More flammable material is packed around the piece. The <b>saggar</b> is then put into the kiln and fired. As it burns, the sawdust carbonizes the surface of the piece, creating a rich, highly varied surface." [...] Zakin notes that this offers modern ceramic artists the [...] "convenience and flexibility of the electric kiln" [...] while also allowing them to [...] "exploit the right and complex effects of smoke reduction." ...|$|E
50|$|Wares {{were placed}} inside stacked <b>saggars</b> on a floor of quartz sand; as the <b>saggars</b> {{protected}} their contents from direct flame both fuel and air could be introduced {{directly to the}} interior through vents, allowing temperature regulation throughout the kiln. Peepholes were used to observe the colour of flame, which changes according to the conditions and temperature. The hottest part of the kiln next to the firebox was used for crackle glazes; following inwards high-fired green and red glazes in a reducing atmosphere, then uncoloured, blue-glazed, and decorated ware at a moderate temperature, followed at the back by glazes to be fired at a lower temperature and turquoise-glazed ware in an oxidising atmosphere.|$|R
2500|$|The wares {{are fired}} to stoneware, in Western terms, though {{qualifying}} as [...] "high-fired" [...] in Chinese terms, {{which is often}} translated as porcelain. Like other celadons, the glaze colour is given by iron oxide fired in a reducing atmosphere. [...] The kilns were fired by coal, and until the final years <b>saggars</b> were used. [...] A characteristic northern type of [...] "horseshoe-shaped" [...] or mantou kiln was used, named after the Chinese bun it resembles in shape; {{one of a group}} excavated at Yaozhou was unusually well-preserved, allowing accurate plans to be made. [...] Towards the end, after <b>saggars</b> were abandoned, a ring was left unglazed in the centre of vessels, which avoided pieces stacked directly in piles from sticking together, but detracts from their appearance.|$|R
50|$|The biscuitwares are glazed. They fired {{again in}} the bigger glost kilns- again they are placed in sealed <b>saggars,</b> items {{separated}} by kiln furniture such as stints, saddles and thimbles. The table-ware would then be decorated by transfers or by painting {{and placed in the}} muffle kiln.|$|R
50|$|The saggars {{were used}} for the biscuit and the glost firing. They were {{expected}} to last for about 40 firings; each potbank made their own in a <b>saggar</b> making workshop. Saggars were made from fireclay, by a <b>saggar</b> maker and two assistants: the framemaker and the bottom knocker. The framemaker beat the clay into a sheet on a metal table using a large mallet, the mow or mawl. Using a frame he would cut it to size, sprinkle it with sawdust and wrap it round a wooden block to make the walls. The framemaker was usually an apprentice in his late teens. The bottom knocker, usually a boy in his early teens, did the same on a smaller scale, constructing the round or banjo-shaped bottom. Again the mow was used to beat the air out of the clay and flatten the sheet. The <b>saggar</b> maker was an experienced craftsman who paid his assistants out of his piece-work earnings: he took the bottom and the sides onto a wheel and using his thumbs joined the sides to the bottom. The green saggars were dried and then placed on the top of bungs during the next firing of the kiln.|$|E
50|$|The museum {{allows the}} visitor {{to explore the}} bottle kilns and {{exhibits}} the principal ancillary rooms: the engine house, the slip room, <b>saggar</b> making workshop. It shows aspects of working with clay- including hands on displays of throwing, moulding and decorating. Colour and gilding is presented as interpretive panels.|$|E
50|$|Sagger clay (also <b>saggar</b> clay) (not to be {{confused}} with the fine grained sagger ball clay which fires to a light cream) is a course grained fire clay which gets its name from the saggers or saggars which it is used to make. Saggars are containers used in the kiln to protect and support pieces, including stacking saggars to allow the production of more pieces in one firing.|$|E
50|$|Though many Song and Yuan dynasty qingbai bowls {{were fired}} {{upside down in}} special {{segmented}} <b>saggars,</b> a technique first developed at the Ding kilns in Hebei province. The rims of such wares were left unglazed but were often bound with bands of silver, copper or lead.|$|R
50|$|The {{clay and}} ground bone were mixed in the sliphouse. Bowls plates and saucers were pressed, jiggered and jolleyed or moulded from the slip. The green (un-fired) china {{was left to}} dry in the greenhouse. At {{the same time the}} <b>saggars</b> that would hold them in the kiln were made.|$|R
50|$|Abū'l-Qāsim {{described}} {{the use of}} earthenware <b>saggars</b> with a fitting lid. Although Miletus ware bowls were stacked in the kiln {{one on top of}} the other separated by spurs, the lack of spur marks on Iznik fritware suggests that saggards were used. Firing was done in an updraft kiln, to about 900 °C.|$|R
5000|$|The {{firing process}} was with bowls placed {{upside down in}} the kiln, which meant that the glaze had to be wiped from the rim, which left a rough rim, and many pieces were given a thin metal rim in silver or a [...] "brassy alloy". [...] The Ding kilns {{developed}} stepped saggars, allowing several bowls, slightly reducing in size, to be fired in the same <b>saggar,</b> increasing the efficiency of kiln loading.|$|E

50|$|Rogo {{was arrested}} {{due to his}} alleged {{connection}} with the Kikambala hotel bombing in 2002 together with his father-in-law, Said <b>Saggar</b> Ahmed, Kubwa Mohammed Seif and Salmin Mohammed Khamis. Rogo first became known by the Kenyan security agents after this arrest. In June 2005, Rogo and other suspects were released. The high court Justice John Osiemo said that the prosecutors were unable to prove that Rogo, along with three others, were connected to the attack. Then Rogo started developing relations with groups in Somalia, using his madrassa, called Sirajul Munir, in Mtwapa to recruit Kenyan people to these Somalian groups.|$|E
50|$|Bottle kiln: {{a type of}} {{intermittent}} kiln, usually coal-fired, formerly used in {{the firing}} of pottery; such a kiln {{was surrounded by a}} tall brick hovel or cone, of typical bottle shape. The tableware was enclosed in sealed fireclay <b>saggars,</b> as the heat and smoke from the fires passed through the oven it would be fired at temperatures up to 1400 C.|$|R
50|$|Electric kilns: kilns {{operated}} by electricity {{were developed in}} the 20th century, primarily for smaller scale use such as in schools, universities, and hobby centers. The atmosphere in most designs of electric kiln is rich in oxygen, {{as there is no}} open flame to consume oxygen molecules. However, reducing conditions can be created with appropriate gas input, or by using <b>saggars</b> in a particular way.|$|R
50|$|Fire clay is {{resistant}} to high temperatures, having fusion {{points higher than}} 1,600 °C F, therefore it is suitable for lining furnaces, as fire brick, and for manufacture of utensils used in the metalworking industries, such as crucibles, <b>saggars,</b> retorts and glassware. Because of its stability during firing in the kiln, {{it can be used}} to make complex items of pottery such as pipes and sanitary ware.|$|R
