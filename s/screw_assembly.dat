A typical ball screw may be 90 percent efficient, versus 20 to 25 percent efficiency of an Acme lead screw of equal size. Lack of sliding {{friction between the}} nut and screw lends itself to extended lifespan of the <b>screw</b> <b>assembly</b> (especially in no-backlash systems), reducing downtime for maintenance and parts replacement, while also decreasing demand for lubrication. This, combined with their overall performance benefits and reduced power requirements, may offset the initial costs of using ball screws.|$|E

40|$|JumpSport, a major {{trampoline}} company, {{has requested}} Cal Poly {{to design a}} custom play-structure consisting of large diameter balls with two types of connectors-long rod connections and very close connectors (for a ball-to-ball type connection). By {{the end of the}} project, appropriate testing will be carried out on the connections and a full-scale model will be constructed. After an extensive design process, our team of three decided on a rod connection style for both the long and short connectors. These consist of a hook that latches into a loop protruding from the ball where the hook is attached by a power screw. The hook/power <b>screw</b> <b>assembly</b> is covered by a sleeve and plunger style cover assembly. The sleeve rides the threads of the power screw to tighten or loosen the fit of the plunger surface to the ball. Thus, the plunger acts to cover the hook while creating a suction to the ball so that the connection stays tight. For the short connector length is equal to approximately four inches so that adequate space is provided for a hand or foot to fit between the balls. The long connector is approximately four feet in length. This length is equal to the sum of one ball diameter and two short connectors so that at any time the created play-structure can be easily altered. The prototypes will be produced by the team-Gary Johnson, Rosalie Mangione, and Steve Rose. The initial parts will be machined and an at home molding process will be used to replicate parts. Purchased parts in conjunction with these self-made parts will be assembled by the team. Structural testing was conducted on both styles of connectors. The ball used to adequately measure the desired features are produced by Mondo. This Mondo product uses a plastic we intend to use except for a larger diameter. Testing on the Mondo products allows us to obtain the necessary test results without the need to produce a ball with the correct diameter. These tests include {{but are not limited to}} maximum weight capacity, tensile and shear tests on the loop alone, etc. This data was used to determine Young’s Modulus for the Mondo ball’s plastic. This information was useful in relating our calculated data to our tested data. In the end, a full scale prototype was made and assembled using an alternative to the Mondo ball so as to meet the diameter requirements. The reason for a full scale prototype is to model the connection points also designed by the team. From this full scale prototype we learned that simply adhering loops to the balls is not an appropriate substitution because it cannot even handle the static loads of the structure simply supporting itself. However, this prototype did yield useful information about the ergonomic qualities of the structure. Connecting a ball that will be suspended in the air proved difficult for two adults and would be impossible for young children alone. Due to these problems, a decision cannot yet be made without further testing using more appropriate materials. However, as the project stands currently, it is not a viable product...|$|E
40|$|The {{advanced}} technology of today {{has reduced the}} need of testing medical equipment on human patients. The invention of the lung simulator {{has made it possible}} to test ventilators without putting the condition of test patients in jeopardy. The device also allows medical staff to be trained in a safe and more rapid way. Several types of lung simulators are available. The digitally controlled variant is the most versatile one for simulations. This type has easily adjustable static and dynamic properties, which, in contrary to traditional passive mechanical simulators, make it possible to simulate different types of breathing. The available design of a digitally controlled lung simulator, however, has one major drawback. The system uses a motor-ball <b>screw</b> <b>assembly</b> to drive a piston in the air compartment. One of the properties of this assembly is that the motor shaft motion is negligibly affected (not ‘backdrivable’) by air pressure exerted on the piston by an external source. The result of this is a feedback system that needs to realize the entire dynamic response to pressure changes, by active control of the motor. Because of this, the system can easily become unstable for certain settings of the static and dynamic properties. The objective of this thesis is to determine what the best alternative actuator is for the lung simulator, to the end of making it more stable than the current version. By improving the existing lung simulator and improving its range of operation, and its performance, it can be made more effective and accurate, which will result in better healthcare. To reach this goal, firstly the desired requirements for the lung simulator will be obtained from the end user. After this, a literature study about alternative actuators shall be conducted. With the results of the literature study, a ranking of the alternative actuators are determined. From the literature study eight alternative actuators have come up. These are the moving coil actuator, moving iron actuator, permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), ironless core motor, piezoelectric actuator, pneumatic actuator, hydraulic actuator and wax motor. The most important requirements on which the different actuators are evaluated are backdrivability, force linearity, force, precision, speed and stroke length. Of the eight alternative actuators, except for the PMSM and the ironless core actuator, all the others have an insufficient score on {{one or more of the}} requirements. A comparison of the PMSM and the ironless core actuator shows that the backdrivability of the ironless core actuator is better, and that it has the best overall score. The conclusion is that the ironless core actuator is the most suitable alternative for the lung simulator. The use of the actuator should increase the stability of the lung simulator. However, no testing was possible because of malfunctioning hardware and time shortage. Therefore no practical confirmation could be obtained about the effects of the new actuator on the system. It is recommended to put the top-ranked actuators to the test in a prototype. From the test results it will be possible to confirm whether the instability of the original lung simulator was indeed caused by the actuator, and whether the ironless core motor is indeed the best suitable alternative actuator for the lung simulator.

An analysis of 3 D finite elements was performed to {{evaluate the}} distribution of the equivalent stress (triple stress state) in a Schanz screw fixed bicortically and orthogonally to a tubular bone, using two mounting patterns: (1) thread/shaft transition located 20 mm from the anchorage of the Schanz screws in {{the entrance to the}} bone cortex and (2) thread/shaft transition located 3 mm from the anchorage of the Schanz screws in entrance to the bone cortex. The simulations were performed maintaining the same direction of loading and the same distance from the force vector in relation {{to the center of the}} hypothetical bone. The load applied, its direction, and the distance to the center of the bone were constant during the simulations in order to maintain the moment of flexion equally constant. The present calculations demonstrated linear behavior during the experiment. It was found that the model with a distance of 20 mm between the Schanz screws anchorage in the entrance to the bone cortex and the thread/shaft transition reduces the risk of breakage or fatigue of the material during the application of constant static loads; in this model, the maximum forces observed were higher (350 MPa). The distance between the Schanz screws anchorage at the entrance to the bone cortex and the smooth thread/shaft transition of the screws used in a femoral distractor during acute distraction of a fracture must be farther from the entrance to the bone cortex, allowing greater degree of elastic deformation of the material, lower mechanical stress in the thread/shaft transition, and minimized breakage or fatigue.

The posterior stabilization was done using pedicle <b>screw</b> and rod <b>assembly,</b> and fusion was done using hydroxyapatite and beta-tricalcium phosphate mixed with bone marrow aspirate as a bone graft substitute over one side of spine and autologous bone graft obtained from iliac crest over other side of spine. The patients were followed up to a minimum of 12 months. Serial radiographs were done at an interval of 3, 6, and 12 months and CT scan was done at one year follow-up. Graft incorporation and fusion were assessed at each follow-up. The study was subjected to statistical analysis using chi-square and kappa test to assess graft incorporation and fusion. Results: At the end of the study, radiological graft incorporation and fusion was evident in all the patients on the bone graft substitute side and in 29 patients on the autologous bone graft side of the spine (P > 0. 05). One patient showed lucency and breakage of distal pedicle screw in autologous bone graft side. The interobserver agreement (kappa) had an average of 0. 72 for graft incorporation, 0. 75 for fusion on radiographs, and 0. 88 for the CT scan findings. Conclusion: Hydroxyapatite and beta-tricalcium phosphate mixed with bone marrow aspirate seems to be a promising alternative to conventional autologous iliac bone graft for posterolateral spinal fusion...|$|R
