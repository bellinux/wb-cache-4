5000|$|The 60-year-old singing {{contest in}} which viewers phone in {{to vote for}} their {{favourite}} has always largely been political, <b>says</b> <b>Karen</b> Fricker, a professor of Dramatic Arts at Brock University who was in Vienna for the grand final. [...] "The song is extremely effective and I would argue, manipulative," [...] says Fricker, [...] "because it's one of those songs that's all about how we should all get together and link hands and be human beings together and believe in peace", and added, [...] "We have {{to bear in mind}} this song is representing Russia, a country that is very involved in aggressive foreign relations at the moment".|$|E
5000|$|Karen Bramson and {{her husband}} Louis Bramson had one son Mogens Louis Bramson [...] After 1914, she lived apart from her husband, but had a {{friendly}} relationship with him throughout her life. She adored her son Mogens, who was a pilot and aviation engineering consultant. Mogens Bramson lived {{much of his life}} in England and {{played a crucial role in}} helping Frank Whittle develop the worlds first jet engine. [...] Later in his life Mogens moved to California, USA where he invented a heart lung machine. One source <b>says</b> <b>Karen</b> Bramson's older sister Olga married the Russian Prince Vladimir Orloff. Karen's brother David Julius Adler was the father of the author and painter Vera Stanley Alder.|$|E
40|$|The UK is a {{world leader}} on foreign policy – {{but it is not}} at all clear how it can {{maintain}} that influence outside the EU, <b>says</b> <b>Karen</b> E Smith. States like Iceland and Switzerland tend to defer to the EU because they lack sufficient heft on their own. The EU itself will suffer from Brexit. But, paradoxically, Donald Trump’s election may stiffen its resolve to act on climate change and the nuclear deal with Iran. Will Britain join those efforts, or will we be left on the sidelines...|$|E

40|$|There’s {{a moment}} coming,’ <b>says</b> <b>Karen</b> Christopher in Goat Island’s final performance, The Lastmaker (2007 - 9). ‘It’s not here yet. It’s on the way. It’s {{still in the}} future. ’ She waits. ‘Here it is! Oh, it’s gone. ’ She’s caught on film, going round and round, just as she herself echoes a George Carlin routine. Before a twenty-minute silence {{that is at the}} heart of Kings of England’s Elegy for Paul Dirac (2011), Simon Bowes says, ‘We are {{gathered}} here to stage Dirac’s most notorious silence, not to close it, but to hold it open. ’ These and other theatrical moments are caught between act and re-enactment. They gesture to themselves. They are an open door in the theatre, one that lets the outside world filter in, but also one that lets the suspended frame of the theatre widen outward. Adapted for the page from a live performance-lecture, this text describes performance moments such as these at the same time as it performs its own act of originary repetition. It flutters unsteadily at the tipping point between stasis and movement, between feeling and critique, between image and recognition. Drawing on the writings of Susan Sontag and Stanley Cavell, theories of the brain from neuroscientists such as Benjamin Libet and David Eagleman, and aspects of my biography that precede my own birth, I ask: what is it that moves us to act? Like all performances, it is an attempt to hold that within which it is itself held...|$|E
40|$|With exotic {{names like}} ayote de caballo (a wild squash), friajolito (a wild bean), and teocinte (a wild {{relative}} of corn), Guatemala’s native plants seem {{very different from}} the agricultural bounty produced by farmers in the United States and other countries. But many of these native plants carry genes that may be vital to global food security. A new tool, developed by a team that includes Agricultural Research Service scientists, will make it easier to find and preserve these important plants. The tool is an interactive atlas designed to provide Guatemalan scientists and land managers with information on where these crop wild relatives grow, where they are relatively safe from habitat destruction, and which ones are rare and most at risk. The genes these wild plants contain may prove useful in addressing threats posed by emerging diseases, insect pests, and temperature and rainfall extremes arising from a changing climate, <b>says</b> <b>Karen</b> Williams, a botanist with the ARS National Germplasm Resources Laboratory in Beltsville. “Guatemala has many genetically diverse native plants closely related to some of our most important crops, including corn, beans, peppers, and potatoes. Some of these crop wild relatives are found only in Guatemala, and they have genes that equip them with survival mechanisms that may be useful to protect crops,” Williams says. Williams worked on the atlas for almost 10 years with César Azurdia Pérez from the Agronomy Faculty at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala, David E. Williams and Veerle van Damme from Bioversity International, and Andrew Jarvis and Silvia Elena Castaño from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the groups}} often {{featured}} at the Atlanta concerts was The Lefevres, who later became known as The Nelons. It would be a mild understatement to <b>say</b> that <b>Karen</b> had aspirations of singing with this talented family. In fact, that aspiration became her greatest desire, and in 1981, this dream became a reality when Karen was invited to travel with her favorite group. She remained with The Nelons for 10 years, gaining the respect of industry peers and fans alike with her exceptional vocal ability and caring personality.|$|R
5000|$|Chris Rovzar of Vanity Fair {{comments}} that [...] "the lyrics were terrible and the composition spotty", and questions {{whether this was}} because {{within the context of}} the episode, [...] "Tom and Julia supposedly did write it in just three hours", or because Shaiman and Wittman had genuine faith on the song. While he <b>says</b> that <b>Karen</b> [...] "hit song out of he park", he suggests that some lyrics were less than believable, such as [...] "help for the downtrodden”, which he argues was never [...] "one of Marilyn’s signature messages".|$|R

As he is seducing her, Gould speaks warmly toward her, offering to bring her under his wing at the studio. <b>Karen</b> <b>says</b> she wants to work on the film that this book is made into. Gould says that even if the book is good, it won't make a successful Hollywood movie. Karen admonishes him for simply perpetuating the standard Hollywood formula instead of taking a creative risk. When Gould protests, <b>Karen</b> <b>says</b> that she knows Gould invited her to his place in order to sleep with her and aggressively starts to seduce him into taking her to bed, and into pitching the book instead of the Doug Brown film.|$|R
5000|$|... "I think Karen {{was very}} {{assertive}} in that statement. I hope there's a Pollyanna {{in all of}} us and that part doesn't ever die. I still have that part in me. I think what was interesting about that speech was that we weren't used to hearing our characters that impassioned. Karen showed the frustrations we were having with our society. There are two things to consider with that speech - the issue of Karen being called a Pollyanna and whether Karen actually was a Pollyanna. Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house. Maybe apropos Knots Landing would have been Val opening the back door and <b>Karen</b> <b>saying</b> (simulates <b>Karen</b> calling from another room), 'Hi Val, come on in!' That would never happen now." ...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the legal}} cases that follow the informed-consent {{standard}} set in recent court cases have involved surgical procedures. However, issues concerning a pregnant British Columbia mother who contracted chicken pox and whose child was subsequently born with severe medical complications demonstrate the complexity of medical decision making and the inadequacy of established legal requirements, especially when consent has dimensions beyond technical considerations usually associated with medical procedures.

50|$|The band meets {{up at the}} Red Lion pub {{to discuss}} the reunion.

Their roadie, Hughie, turns up during their first rehearsal to resume his original role. Ray insists on playing guitar but is convinced to concentrate on singing. They find a replacement for Brian in young Luke Shand, a talented guitarist who remains blissfully unaware of the band's internal tensions.|$|R
5000|$|They did a skit of Karen's {{drumming}} {{talent as}} well. It begins with Richard and Karen talking about why Karen played the drums, and <b>Karen</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Why not!!" [...] Then, they reminisce {{to the high}} school days, where classmate John Denver played the drums in the high school band, and Karen was stuck with the glockenspiel.

40|$|Abstract: Pwo Karen has a {{large number}} of verb particles, some of which may {{increase}} or decrease the valence of the verb. This paper describes such valence-changing verb particles. When Pwo Karen is compared with Burmese, a neighboring Tibeto-Burman language, from the viewpoint of valence-changing, the difference between these two languages is brought into high relief. Burmese only has a few valence-changing auxiliary-like morphemes, and especially it does not have a valence-decreasing one. Many of the situations which are expressed with the valence-changing verb particles in Pwo Karen are conveyed by using particles following the nouns in Burmese, therefore we can <b>say</b> that Pwo <b>Karen</b> shows stronger head-markingness than Burmese. Pwo Karen and Burmese are largely different not only in word order but also in the details of their grammars, though they are neighboring languages of the same linguistic stock...|$|R

5000|$|Toby's {{distaste for}} Pam's {{relationship}} with Jim is again {{brought up in}} [...] "Branch Wars" [...] when Jim is allowed to join [...] "The Finer Things Club," [...] an exclusive organization built up by Pam, Toby, and Oscar, dedicated to discussing civilized culture. During the episode's final scene, after Jim contributes his ideas on the book being discussed, Toby scrutinizes him very bitterly, hinting again at his disdain for Jim's success with Pam. His irritation is attributed {{to the fact that}} Jim did not read the book, though Oscar and even Pam are also annoyed with Jim's wisecracking, uninformed behavior. Also in this episode Michael tells Karen she can have Toby instead of Stanley; when <b>Karen</b> <b>says</b> Toby is not a salesperson, Michael briefly tries to talk up Toby's ability to learn before saying he can't fake it and insulting the HR rep anew.|$|R

40|$|Hanken {{is ranked}} 5 th {{in the global}} U-Multirank as regards {{research}} and research linkages.
