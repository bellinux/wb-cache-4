5|$|These events worried Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, {{as well as}} the {{possibility}} that the unstable <b>situation</b> <b>could</b> spill over outside Albania, triggering a wider conflict. On 27 October, after receiving the approval of the Great Powers, the Greek Army's V Army Corps entered the area for a second time. The provisional government formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives.|$|E
5|$|By {{the next}} day, the state parks agency closed Refugio State Beach and El Capitán State Beach. Governor Jerry Brown {{declared}} a state of emergency. Santa Barbara County also {{declared a state}} of emergency. The Santa Barbara emergency management team eventually recommended that the Board of Supervisors keep the proclamation of local emergency intact till until May 2016.

5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} took place in 1811 to consider how the <b>situation</b> <b>could</b> be improved. Two engineers, Edward Martin and David Davies, proposed {{an extension of the}} canal {{to the top of the}} Gwendraeth valley, and another which would cross Pinged marsh and would terminate at Llanelli. This would pass through Pembrey, providing improved access to the harbour. The proposal was adopted, and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company. The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo, and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place. It listed a total of 13collieries which would be served in this way. Wharfs at the Llanelli terminus would be built next to the dock owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company. Special provision, including the construction of a lock and weir, was made for the point where the new canal would cross the existing Ashburnham Canal.|$|E
5|$|Only {{twenty minutes}} {{since the first}} contact, A Company had {{returned}} to its original position on the rainforest fringe, having suffered seven men wounded and using most of their ammunition. O'Brien subsequently briefed Townsend by radio, again reporting the Viet Cong position as a 'camp' of at least company-size, and proposing that A Company remain in location while B Company adopted {{a position on the}} right flank until the <b>situation</b> <b>could</b> be clarified, to which he agreed. Townsend subsequently arrived by helicopter as A Company's casualties were being evacuated by an Australian UH-1 Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF. Meanwhile, the APCs carrying C Company and the Mortar Platoon began to arrive, while D Company was inserted by helicopter a few minutes later and took up blocking positions in the tree-line north-east of the landing zone. Just after 14:30, B Company—under Major Ian Mackay—began receiving sniper fire in their position just south-west of A Company, and in response Mackay moved the company back before calling-in artillery fire onto the Viet Cong positions. Initially believing that he only faced a company-sized Viet Cong force, with his rifle companies now finally assembled, at 15:15 Townsend issued orders for a quick attack by two companies.|$|E

25|$|A lasting {{consequence}} of Burr's {{role in the}} election of 1800 was the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which changed {{the way in which}} vice presidents were chosen.

The A.F.B.1 therefore had no real chance of being accepted for a production order.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} was largely met with disbelief and {{laughter from the}} passengers {{and some of the}} flight attendants, as they thought it was an exercise. Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar <b>situation</b> <b>could</b> arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the many}} {{severely}} injured prisoners who {{were brought to the}} local hospitals, rumors about Kemna began to spread, although cautiously, since speaking about the <b>situation</b> <b>could</b> land one in the same predicament.On March 8, 1934, the state's attorney, Gustav Winckler, made his first report to his superior, Günther Joël, regarding Kemna. On July 16, 1934, an account from a former Kemna prisoner appeared in the Wuppertal press. After the Night of the Long Knives, when the SA was purged, its top leaders removed and its power curbed just two weeks later, Joël began an investigation and soon had a number of witnesses willing to testify.|$|E

Supported by a battalion of artillery (3rd Battalion, 12th SS Panzer Regiment), this battle group was ordered to stop the advancing Canadian infantry and tanks and drive through to the coast, a few kilometres away. They failed {{to break through the}} Canadians around Buron, a kilometer to the north. Meyer, however, countermanded the divisional commander's order on his own initiative, feeling that objective unrealistic, and hoped to merely stop the flow of Canadian units inland until the <b>situation</b> <b>could</b> be stabilized.|$|E

Following this Lord Chelmsford decided that the <b>situation</b> <b>could</b> be resolved by continuing the advance further into Afghanistan and gave the order for the brigade in Dacca to march towards Jalalabad, however, this order was unable to be carried out as fighting broke out further to the south and in the eastern Khyber.|$|E
