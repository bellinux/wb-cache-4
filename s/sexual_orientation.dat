5|$|With {{regard to}} <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a {{meaningful}} category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> identity category.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> no Supreme Court justice has {{identified}} {{himself or herself}} {{as anything other than}} heterosexual, and no incontrovertible evidence of a justice having any other <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> has ever been uncovered. However, the personal lives of several justices and nominees have attracted speculation.|$|E

5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E

5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> in a homophobic setting.|$|E
5|$|A lesbian is {{a female}} homosexual: a female who {{experiences}} romantic love or sexual attraction to other females.
