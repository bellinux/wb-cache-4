50|$|Spread-spectrum clock {{generation}} (SSCG) {{is used in}} some <b>synchronous</b> <b>digital</b> systems, {{especially those}} containing microprocessors, to reduce the spectral density of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) that these systems generate. A <b>synchronous</b> <b>digital</b> system {{is one that is}} driven by a clock signal and, because of its periodic nature, has an unavoidably narrow frequency spectrum. In fact, a perfect clock signal would have all its energy concentrated at a single frequency (the desired clock frequency) and its harmonics. Practical <b>synchronous</b> <b>digital</b> systems radiate electromagnetic energy on a number of narrow bands spread on the clock frequency and its harmonics, resulting in a frequency spectrum that, at certain frequencies, can exceed the regulatory limits for electromagnetic interference (e.g. those of the FCC in the United States, JEITA in Japan and the IEC in Europe).|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{accurate}} {{characterization of the}} timing behavior of <b>synchronous</b> <b>digital</b> systems has become increasingly evident {{in the past few}} years. The continuing drive to design faster digital systems has made the use of CAD tools for timing verification and optimal clOCking essential in most system design methodologies. TIming models of <b>synchronous</b> <b>digital</b> circuits are {{based on the premise that}} the circuits are logically (functionally) correct, and focus only on capturing their propagation, latching, and synchronization properties. While, in principle, such timing models are much simpler than full-fledged logical models, the increasing use of multi-phase clocking schemes and level-sensitive latching structures has significantly increased their complexity. In this paper we introduce a new timing model of <b>synchronous</b> <b>digital</b> circuits which is: 1) general enough to handle arbitrary multi-phase clocking; 2) complete, in the sense that it captmes signal propagation along short as well as long paths in the logic; 3) extensible to make it relatively easy to incorporate "complex " latching structures; and 4) notationally simple to make it amenable to analytic treatment in some important special cases. ...|$|R
