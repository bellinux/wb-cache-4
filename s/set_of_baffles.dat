40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} design of new {{diagnostics}} and the modifications to existing diagnostics needed to carry out radiative divertor experiments in DIII-D following installation in late 1996 <b>of</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>baffle</b> structures that will restrict the backflow to the core plasma of neutral deuterium atoms and impurity gases. The divertor slots formed by the new baffle structures will inhibit the easy view of the divertor legs and target plates that the open divertor geometry in DIII-D currently affords. We review a basic <b>set</b> <b>of</b> diagnostics that are needed to demonstrate the reduction of divertor heat loading and radiative dissipation of energy within the divertor. This will include IR cameras, bolometry, foil bolometers, and Langmuir probes. Within the limits of available funding, we will implement a supplemental <b>set</b> <b>of</b> instruments which provide a more detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes. Many existing diagnostics require only re-aiming to provide proper coverage of the initial 23 cm long divertor plasma configuration (X- point to floor distance). Other diagnostics need extensive reconfiguration using in-vessel fiber-optic bundles or high power laser mirrors. The new divertor baffle panels provide a protective shelf for diagnostic hardware mounted underneath them, but the water cooling channels in the panels limit the permissible size of through holes and, thereby, restrict the available views <b>of</b> under-the- <b>baffle</b> diagnostics. The successful resolution of the design and implementation of these diagnostic modifications is dependent on a strong coordination between GA and its many diagnostic collaborators...|$|R
40|$|Experimental nd {{numerical}} {{investigations of}} the generation of resonant sound by flow in a duct containing two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>baffles</b> and the "feedback " of the sound on the vortex shedding process are reported. The experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel and the numerical simulations are used to predict he sources of resonant sound in the flow. The resonant sound field, which is principally longitudinal, is calculated by the finite element method and a discrete-vortex model is used to predict the observed separated flow. Analysis of {{the passage of a}} single point vortex past a baffle indicates that the amount of acoustic energy generated {{is a function of the}} phase of the acoustic ycle at which the vortex passes the baffle. A more elaborate model simulates the growth of vortex clouds through the clustering of elemental vortices shed from an upstream baffle, tracks the passage of these vortex clouds past a downstream baffle, predicts the generation of acoustic energy using Howe's theory of aerodynamic sound, and accounts for the feedback of sound on the vortex shedding. Comparison is made between the predicted time-dependent structures and the observed flow structures using smoke visualization. The vortex cloud model predicts the flow conditions under which net acoustic energy is generated by the flow and therefore when resonance can be sustained; the results are consistent with the occurrence of peaks in the observed resonant sound pressure levels. 1...|$|R

A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>baffles</b> are used to restrict the optical image and separate the heating mechanisms occurring in the central bulk discharge region and near the thruster walls.

However, these baffles are not sufficient for the innermost shell P 6 H 6; at best the requirements are slightly violated {{and there is no}} margin for tolerances. The addition <b>of</b> a <b>baffle</b> interior to the P 6 space at an axial station about one third of the way forward from the aft end of the paraboloid will allow the ghost ray and vignetting requirements to be met. The minimum ghost ray angles and the vignetting angles are sensitive functions <b>of</b> the <b>baffle</b> positions and radii; tolerances of considerably better than 1 mm will be required. The sensitivities are coupled and correlated; further investigations should be undertaken in order to obtain baffle parameters which, combined with likely achievable tolerances, will minimize the risk of the vignetting/ghost ray requirements not being met. The lightweight carbon-epoxy composite used for thermal baffles has insufficient X-ray opacity to be a suitable material for construction of the controlling X-ray baffles; further study is needed to determine an appropriate material and to investigate its thermal and mechanical implications...|$|R

The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more dynamic. In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him [...] "it was Porter." [...] Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording—if someone was out of tune, he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, [...] "we got a little tuning problem ... Everybody check and see what's going on." [...] If that did not work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late-1964, Atkins said, [...] "the sound was never the same, never as great." ...|$|R

This technique provided clear visual evidence of better mixing that took place inside the gasliquid system {{and the effect of}} a different number <b>of</b> <b>baffles</b> on mixing characteristics. For optimum gas flow rate (m 3 /s) and power input (kW), the oxygen absorption rate in water was measured. Dynamic gassingout method was applied for five different gas flow rates and four different power inputs to find out mass transfer coefficient (KLa). The rest of the experiments with one up to four baffles were carried out at these optimum values of power input (2. 0 kW) and gas flow rate (8. 5 × 10 - 4 m 3 /s). The experimental results and tomography visualisations showed that the gasliquid mixing with standard baffling provided near the optimal process performance and good mechanical stability, as higher mass transfer rates were obtained using a greater number <b>of</b> <b>baffles.</b> The addition <b>of</b> single <b>baffle</b> had a striking effect on mixing efficiency and additions <b>of</b> further <b>baffles</b> significantly decrease mixing time.
