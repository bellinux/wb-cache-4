40|$|AbstractTotal skin {{electron}} irradiation (TSEI) {{for patients with}} cutaneous lymphomas is technically challenging, and numerous approaches {{have been developed to}} overcome the many field matching problems associated with such a large and complex treatment volume. Since 1981 we have delivered TSEI using a rotational total skin {{electron irradiation}} (RTSEI) technique in conjunction with patch, treat and boost fields in order to provide complete skin and dose coverage. Initially we used a 6 MeV electron beam at an extended <b>source-skin</b> <b>distance</b> (SSD) on a modified linear accelerator. More recently we began using a high dose rate electron mode on a commercially available linear accelerator. The RTSEI technique allows the delivery of a seamless surface dose to the majority of the patient's skin surface in a single treatment. In this review paper we present our three-decade experience with the technical development, dosimetry, treatment delivery and clinical outcomes of our RTSEI technique...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulator}} for X-ray {{images is}} presented {{based on a}} virtual X-ray source and a virtual human body obtained from tomographic slices. In the simulator {{it is possible to}} modify the tube potential, the anodic current, the exposure time, the filtration and some geometric parameters such as <b>source–skin</b> <b>distance,</b> orientation and field size. The virtual body consists of a three-dimensional voxel matrix in which CT numbers for each point of the body are stored. The interactions of X rays passing through the body are evaluated using the pencil beam technique. The image is obtained by computing the dose absorbed by the detector and converting it into optical density using a proper response function. The image spatial resolution is limited by the voxel size. The influence of each parameter on the image quality can be observed interactively. The dose absorbed in each point of the body is an important parameter obtained as output of the simulator...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{software}} {{tool for the}} simulation of an X-ray imaging systems. It consists of three virtual objects: the X-ray source, {{the human body and}} the detector. The X-ray source is modeled as a radiological tube for which the user can modify the tube potential, the anode material, the tube load, the filtration and some geometric parameters, such as <b>source-skin</b> <b>distance,</b> orientation and field size. The virtual body consists of a 3 D voxel matrix in which CT numbers for each point of the body are stored, obtained from tomographic slices. The interactions of X-rays passing through the body are evaluated using pencil beam technique. The image is obtained computing the dose absorbed by the detector and converting it into optical density by the use of a proper response function. The dose absorbed in each point of the body is also computed and can be visualized both in 2 D and 3 D representations. The influence of each parameter on the beam spectrum, on the image quality and on the dose to the patient can be observed interactively. (c) 2005 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An in vivo {{dosimetry}} system, using p-type diode dosimeters, {{was characterized}} for clinical applications of treatment machines ranging in megavoltage energies. This paper investigates two different models of diodes for externally wedged beams and explains a new algorithm for {{the calculation of}} the target dose at various tissue depths in external radiotherapy. The values of off-axis wedge correction factors were determined at two different positions in the wedged (toward the thick and thin edges) and in the non-wedged directions on entrance and exit surfaces of a polystyrene phantom in 60 Co and 6 MV photon beams. Depth transmission was defined on the entrance and exit surfaces to obtain the off-axis wedge correction factor at any depth. As {{the sensitivity of the}} diodes depends on physical characteristics [field size, <b>source-skin</b> <b>distance</b> (SSD), thickness, backscatter], correction factors were applied to the diode reading when measuring conditions different from calibration situations. The results indicate that needful correction factors for 60 Co wedged photons are usually larger than those for 6 MV wedged photon beams. In vivo dosimetry performed with the proposed algorithms at externally wedged beams has negligible probable errors (less than 0. 5 %) and is a reliable method for patient dose control...|$|E
40|$|Total skin {{electron}} irradiation is the commonly used procedure {{in the treatment}} of mycosis fungoides. The aim of this paper was to verify the elaborated algorithm for dose calculation during total skin {{electron irradiation}} with rotary-dual fields technique (TSEI-RD). Material and method: Authors modified the 2 -D algorithm published by Podgorsak taking account of dose distribution along the body midline and doses in the body on a larger depth than in the skin. Depth-dose function, beam profile were measured in TSEI-RD conditions (spoiler, <b>source-skin</b> <b>distance</b> SSD= 350 cm, field size: 36 × 36 cm at 100 cm). Cylindrical vax phantom was used to calculate and then to measure the doses in a depth of 0. 4 cm during exposure to the electron beam of 6 MeV (at the output of Clinac- 2300 CD accelerator). Phantom was rotating with the pre-calculated speed during constant exposure to two fields executed one by one in each fraction. Thermoluminescent detectors (TLD) were used for in-phantom dose measurements and Marcus ionization chamber was used for calibration of TLD. Dose homogeneity on the phantom surface was checked for three phantoms with different diameters of 20, 30 and 40 cm. Phantoms were irradiated at different rotating speeds. Initial results: Doses measured by TLD were on average by 4 % lower than doses pre-calculated using the modified algorithm. Mean doses normalized to those pre-calculated and their standard deviations (both in per cents) were respectively: 96. 1 % and 0. 4 % for phantom with diameter of 20; 96. 5 % and 0. 7 % for diameter of 30 cm and 96. 0 % and 0. 8 % for diameter of 40 cm. Conclusions: Measured doses proved correctness of elaborated algorithm. Very low standard deviations are resulting from regular cylindrical shape of the phantoms...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThis work {{describes}} chosen {{combinations of}} therapeutic fields during the patient's {{total body irradiation}} (TBI). The TBI technique requires as large a radiation field as one can achieve [1][2]. That is why the <b>source-skin</b> <b>distance</b> (SSD) is greater than 100 cm (SSD for standard treatment conditions). In such non-standard radiotherapy conditions all the measurements described in this paper were done. Materials/MethodsAll beam profiles were obtained by irradiating films with 20 MV (nominal energy) photon rays in non-standard conditions of radiotherapy. The method of measurement (film dosimetry) and used materials (self-developing GAFCHROMIC EBT films) are presented in the Material and Method section [3]. AimBecause in the therapy some areas must receive a greater dose than others, {{the size of the}} therapeutic fields must be adjusted. That is why the areas where two fields overlap inside the patient's body differ. The diversity of absorbed dose in these areas was measured and presented in the schemas in the Results section. ResultsThe profiles presenting dose distribution in the areas where therapeutic fields overlap in most cases show increase of the delivered dose. For the most often used therapeutic fields the increase exceeds 180 % of the planned dose in the sector about 2. 5 – 10 cm. There were also two cases where the delivered dose was lower than the planned one (about 29 – 86 % of the planned dose). Chosen measurements and combinations of the therapeutic fields are discussed in detail and all the results are collected in a table {{at the end of the}} section. ConclusionsThe profiles obtained from the scans of the irradiated GAFCHROMIC EBT films and their digital processing include 0. 05 Gy noise. This means that the described method requires a high quality scanner, dedicated to RTG films. The spectrophotometer measurements showed high film dependency on light wavelength. It seems that using a monochromatic source of light may give better results...|$|E
