5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> {{the size and}} ferocity of the offensive. The {{light at the end}} of the tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
50|$|Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) {{provides}} one way for {{an application}} to traverse a NAT.

Therefore, <b>STUN</b> <b>by</b> itself cannot provide a complete solution for NAT traversal.|$|R

5|$|As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's {{kicking and}} special teams proved {{to have more}} success than either aspect of the offense. Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, and punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts {{for a total of}} 195yards, {{averaging}} 48.8yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> a Georgia onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position {{in the first half of}} the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech side of the field, was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. In the first and second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} been likened to both Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid {{due to the}} 3D {{platforming}} and stealth gameplay respectively. Players guide the forest inhabitants through 20 levels, during which they must infiltrate a series of suburban homes in order to steal a variety of items and destroy construction materials. The items needed to lure endangered animals to the forest must be collected from houses and carried back to the forest one at a time. Each level requires several trips to be completed. Security systems must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Household members and their pets must also be avoided, distracted or <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> a thrown object.

50|$|Fuzion {{characters}} have numerous Derived Stats, which get their values {{based on the}} level of a primary Stat and performing a mathematical formula to calculate a number. For instance, a character gets Hit Points (called Hits), and Stun Points (called <b>Stun),</b> <b>by</b> taking their Body Stat and multiplying it by 5. Therefore, a character with a Body Stat of 5 would have 25 Hits and 25 Stun. Derived Stats do not cost points to purchase. Depending on the genre, the Referee can choose what Derived Stats he wants in his campaign. Some are required, like Hits, Stun, and Recovery, but others, like Luck and Humanity, are optional. Characters can also trade up to 1/2 of their Stun points for more Hits if they so desire.|$|R

Victorio's people needed water and believing that {{there were only a few}} soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. <b>Stunned</b> <b>by</b> the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm.

5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city was <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> the Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 {{people were killed in}} an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|Chinese troops counterattacked {{in force}} at 23:00, with two battalions of {{infantry}} supported by snipers and mortar fire.
