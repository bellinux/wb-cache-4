5|$|After {{learning}} of the arrest of former governor Charles S. Morehead by federal authorities, Helm fled to Bowling Green, fearing his own arrest. Through the intervention of Warner Underwood {{he was able to}} return home on the condition that he swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Nevertheless, federal soldiers repeatedly entered his home, encouraging his slaves to abandon him, and consuming or destroying his crops. Because the state's courts were closed on account of the war, he was unable to earn a living by practicing law. In <b>short</b> <b>order</b> his once-substantial fortune was expended, and he resorted to borrowing money to support his family.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{historical}} coastal Asian groups were driven to near-extinction in <b>short</b> <b>order</b> by Japanese industrial hunts. Those groups that once migrated along western Japan to the East China Sea were likely wiped out much earlier, as the last catches on Amami Oshima were between the 1910s and the 1930s, and the last known stranding records on the Japanese archipelago, excluding the Ryukyu Islands, were over a half-century ago. Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along the Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts.|$|E

In <b>short</b> <b>order,</b> Béla fell terminally ill. Before his death, he requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia, Princess Anna's son-in-law, to assist his wife, daughter and partisans in case they were forced to leave Hungary by his son. Béla died on Rabbits' Island on 3 May 1270. With his death at the age of 63, he exceeded in age most members of the House of Árpád. He was buried in the church of the Franciscans in Esztergom, but Archbishop Philip of Esztergom had his corpse transferred to the Esztergom Cathedral. The Minorites only succeeded in regaining Béla's remains after a long lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|King Henry III again invaded Hungary in 1044 {{to restore}} Peter the Venetian. The decisive battle was fought at Ménfő near Győr, where Samuel's army was routed. Samuel's fate {{following}} {{the battle is}} still uncertain. According to nearly contemporaneous German sources, he was captured in <b>short</b> <b>order</b> and executed on Peter the Venetian's command. However, 14th-century Hungarian chronicles narrate that he fled up the river Tisza where he was seized and murdered by the locals. The latter sources further state that Samuel was first buried in a nearby church, but was later transferred to his family's monastery at Abasár.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Poland's {{economy was}} in shambles. Hyperinflation fueled public unrest, and the {{government}} {{was unable to find}} a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis. Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centered around former members of the Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organization as well as some left-wing and intelligentsia parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in <b>short</b> <b>order</b> and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government, eventually issuing statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from nature, where some organisms {{can control the}} <b>short</b> range <b>order</b> of amorphous minerals, we successfully manipulated the <b>short</b> range <b>order</b> of amorphous alumina by surface and size effects. By utilizing the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) method to grow amorphous nanometrically thin films, combined with state-of-the-art electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we showed experimentally that the <b>short</b> range <b>order</b> in such films is strongly influenced by size. This phenomenon {{is equivalent to the}} well-known size effect on lattice parameters and on the relative stability of different polymorphs in crystalline materials. We also show that the <b>short</b> range <b>order</b> changes while still in the amorphous phase, before the amorphous to crystalline transformation takes place. Many organisms use crystallization through an amorphous phase as the route for biologically controlled mineralization. 1, 2 This approach has several advantages, such as lowering the activation energy for crystal formation, 3 control over the final shape of the crystal, controlled incorporation of impurities, and control over the resulting polymorph. 4 The latter is achieved by manipulation of the <b>short</b> range <b>order</b> in the amorphous phase, to resemble that of the succeeding crystalline phase. 5 This control is achieve...|$|R

5|$|Philosophically, Newall {{remained}} a close follower of Trenchard during the interwar period; {{his time in}} the Independent Bombing Force had left him convinced that strategic bombing was an exceptionally powerful weapon, and one that could not effectively be defended against. In this, he was a supporter of the standard doctrine of the day, which suggested that the destructive power of a bomber force was sufficiently great that it could cripple an industrial economy in <b>short</b> <b>order,</b> and that so merely its presence could potentially serve as an effective deterrent.

In <b>short</b> <b>order,</b> the entire body settled {{in only a few}} steps from the Tuileries at a former riding school, the Salle du Manège. However, some fifty-six monarchien deputies did not come with them, believing the mob threat in the capital to be personally dangerous. The October journées thus effectively deprived the monarchist faction of significant representation in the Assembly as most of these deputies retreated from the political scene; many, like Mounier, fled the country altogether.|$|E
5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in <b>short</b> <b>order</b> for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E

By the afternoon of October23, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned to be distributed to Kyaukphyu where at least 5,000 people were left homeless. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left homeless. By October30, the number affected and homeless had risen to 1.1million and roughly 100,000 respectively. Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 people were in need of assistance throughout Myanmar. Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in <b>short</b> <b>order,</b> the charity had received donations of 10million kyat ($10,000USD).

5|$|With {{the advent}} of siege cannons, however, the fortifications became obsolete, but their massive size still {{provided}} effective defence, as demonstrated during the Second Ottoman Siege in 1422.

Finally, on 29 May, the decisive attack was launched, and when the Genoese general Giovanni Giustiniani was wounded and withdrew, causing a panic among the defenders, the walls were taken.
