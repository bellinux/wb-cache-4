The others were: Cerro Copper Products in Sauget, Ill.; Franklin Smelting in Philadelphia; Gaston Recycling Industries in Gaston, S.C.; and the Southwire Co. plant in Carrollton, Ca.|$|E
5|$|The main {{industrial}} pollution source is Norilsk Nickel in Monchegorsk—the large <b>smelters</b> responsible for over 80% of the sulfur dioxide emissions and {{for nearly all}} nickel and copper emissions. Other polluters of note include the thermal power stations in Apatity and Murmansk.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus {{is known}} to be a bioaccumulator of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and selenium. To reduce exposure, {{authorities}} recommend avoiding mushrooms from polluted areas such as those near mines, <b>smelters,</b> roadways, incinerators and disposal sites. Furthermore, pores should be removed as they contain the highest concentrations of pollutants.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{artifacts}} from the International <b>Smelter</b> in Tooele were preserved in the Tooele Valley Railroad Museum {{to the west of}} the <b>smelter</b> site. Artifacts preserved included work tools, laboratory sampling equipment, signs used on the <b>smelter</b> site, and documents pertaining to the operation of the <b>smelter</b> and the local workers unions. The Carr Fork Reclamation and Wildlife Area has sign markers and monuments with information on the historic <b>smelter</b> site. As of June 2016, several pylons of the aerial tramway between the <b>smelter</b> and Bingham Canyon remain standing across the Oquirrh Mountains.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of refined aluminium {{is expected to}} rise by an average of about 10% per year from 2005 to 2011. The Mozal 3 <b>smelter</b> in Mozambique and the Coega <b>smelter</b> in South Africa are expected to open in mid-2009 and late 2010, respectively. In Cameroon, Alcan Inc. plans to triple production from its <b>smelter</b> by 2010. Aluminium <b>Smelter</b> Co. of Nigeria Ltd. could reopen its <b>smelter</b> at Ikot Abasi by 2009 and reach full capacity by 2011. In Ghana, Alcoa Inc. plans to increase production at the Valco <b>smelter</b> starting in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The Michigan <b>Smelter</b> was {{a copper}} <b>smelter</b> located at Cole's Creek on the Keweenaw Waterway north-west of Houghton, Michigan near the old Atlantic mill. The <b>smelter</b> {{was created in}} 1903-4 as a joint effort between the Copper Range Company and Stanton group of mines. An Atlantic dam on the site was reused by the <b>smelter</b> as a water source. [...] In 1905, the <b>smelter</b> broke a world record by casting 292,000 pounds of fine copper in seven hours with a single furnace and only ten men. [...] The <b>smelter</b> {{operated}} through World War II and stopped all operations in 1948.|$|R
5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead <b>smelters,</b> {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese <b>smelters.</b> Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{products}} of chromium ore refining are ferrochromium and metallic chromium. For those products the ore smelter process differs considerably. For {{the production of}} ferrochromium, the chromite ore (FeCr2O4) is reduced in large scale in electric arc furnace or in smaller <b>smelters</b> with either aluminium or silicon in an aluminothermic reaction.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{production}} {{with the}} ISP {{is more expensive}} than with electrolytic zinc plants, so several <b>smelters</b> operating this technology have closed in recent years. However, ISP furnaces {{have the advantage of}} being able to treat zinc concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can electrolytic zinc plants.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906, a 9 mi {{pipeline}} {{was built}} to bring water from Duck Creek to reservoirs near the <b>smelter</b> site and construction began on the <b>smelter.</b> [...] The <b>smelter</b> was completed and operations began on May 15, 1908. [...] The first copper was shipped from the <b>smelter</b> on August 7 of the same year.|$|R

5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able to {{tolerate}} and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal <b>smelters.</b> The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E
5|$|The oldest extant blast {{furnaces}} were built during the Han Dynasty of China in the 1st century AD. However, cast iron farm tools and weapons were widespread in China by the 5th century BC, while 3rd century BC iron <b>smelters</b> employed an average workforce of {{over two hundred}} men. These early furnaces had clay walls and used phosphorus-containing minerals as a flux. The effectiveness of the Chinese blast furnace was enhanced during this period by the engineer Du Shi (c.31AD), who applied the power of waterwheels to piston-bellows in forging cast iron.|$|E
5|$|Granvin is a port on the Hardangerfjord and was {{the center}} for freight {{transport}} in Hardanger. Hardanger is dominated by {{a small number of}} large industrial companies, primarily <b>smelters,</b> which were responsible for more than 80 percent of the line's cargo volume. While Hardanger in the 1980s had a population of 40,000, Granvin had a population of 1,000 {{and was the}} smallest municipality in Hardanger. Granvin served as a ferry hub for services by Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap (HSD), and in 1980 there up to two daily services with the local ferry services in Hardanger, in addition to fast ferries to both Bergen and Stavanger. Buses operated to Granvin from Norheimsund and Kvanndal.|$|E
50|$|The copper <b>smelter</b> was {{established}} in 1861. It grew and developed to eventually become the largest copper <b>smelter</b> outside of Wales. In addition to copper, the <b>smelter</b> also produced gold and lead, and included a sulphuric acid works. By the early 20th century, profits were declining. Despite measures to improve productivity, the <b>smelter</b> became financially nonviable and closed in 1923.|$|R
5000|$|The Kurri Kurri <b>smelter</b> started {{operations}} in 1969. The <b>smelter</b> was originally owned by Alcan and uses Alcan end-to-end prebake technology. The <b>smelter</b> was progressively expanded to comprise three potlines. It {{was acquired by}} Norsk Hydro in 2002.|$|R

5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria {{can be traced back}} to the Paleolithic. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation. Some of these first gold <b>smelters</b> produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.|$|E
5|$|Inexpensive {{hydropower}} {{supported the}} location of a large aluminum industry in the region, because its reduction from bauxite requires large amounts of electricity. Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17percent of the world's aluminum and 40percent of the aluminum produced in the United States. The commoditization of power in the early 21st century, coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry and by 2001, Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80percent of its production capacity. By 2003, the entire United States produced only 15percent of the world's aluminum, and many <b>smelters</b> along the Columbia had gone dormant or out of business.|$|E
5|$|Lead, one of {{the leading}} causes of {{toxicity}} in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. When hunters use lead shot, waterfowl such as ducks can ingest the spent pellets later and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related waterfowl poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as the source of waterfowl deaths. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Other threats to wildlife include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and <b>smelters,</b> and lead weights from fishing lines. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.|$|E
5000|$|Kurri Kurri was {{the first}} Australian {{aluminium}} <b>smelter</b> to shut permanently. In August 2014 the Point Henry <b>smelter</b> in Geelong, Victoria, also closed. However, the Tomago aluminium <b>smelter</b> continues to operate approximately 30 kilometres away in Tomago, west of Newcastle.|$|R
25|$|The <b>smelter</b> remains {{which were}} renovated by Kilkivan Shire Council in 1978, {{are exposed to}} ground level. The <b>smelter</b> is made of brick and stone, the walls {{standing}} to a height of 170cm at the fire-box end, and to 120cm height {{at the opposite end}} of the <b>smelter.</b> These heights seem to correlate with the spring-level of the now collapsed arched roof. The internal ovoid form of the reverberatory <b>smelter</b> can be readily seen. The fire-box is particularly well preserved and has a deep below-ground access. Iron staples are inserted into the base plinth of the <b>smelter</b> at regular intervals and seem to be the support points for the rail reinforcing bars which would have originally bound the <b>smelter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Portland Aluminium <b>smelter,</b> in {{conjunction}} with Alcoa's Point Henry <b>smelter,</b> produce about 30% of Australia's total aluminium.|$|R
5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already a copper mine and <b>smelters</b> at Kopperå, and they saw the railway as a possibility to change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A pulp mill opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the hydroelectricity sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials {{would not have been}} possible without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or <b>smelters.</b> Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded {{together and the}} gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron <b>smelters</b> and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E
25|$|The Western Federation of Miners local at Durango, Colorado, {{ordered a}} strike on 29 August 1903. Out of the 200 {{employees}} of the Durango <b>smelter,</b> 175 walked off, demanding an 8-hour day. The strike effectively stopped work at the <b>smelter</b> for several days, but the <b>smelter</b> replaced the strikers, and resumed normal operation. Extra deputies were hired, and arrangements made to house workers on the <b>smelter</b> grounds. The strike failed.|$|R
5000|$|The Fjardaál {{aluminium}} <b>smelter</b> reached full {{production capacity}} in April 2008. The facility contains a <b>smelter,</b> cast house, rod production and deep-water port. The <b>smelter</b> employs 450 people and produces 940 tons of aluminium a day, with capacity of 346,000 {{metric tons of}} aluminium per year. Fjardaál means [...] "Fjords aluminium" [...] in Icelandic.For the <b>smelter,</b> the new Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant in the neighboring municipality of Fljótsdalshérað was built.|$|R
50|$|Pilot Bay is a {{ghost town}} located in the West Kootenay region of British Columbia. The town is located west of Crawford Bay {{on the east side}} of Kootenay Lake, {{opposite}} the entrance to West Arm Provincial Park. In the early 1890s, the Hendryx interests built a <b>smelter</b> {{on the east side of}} Kootenay Lake to treat the ores from their Blue Bell lead-silver mine at Riondel. By 1895 the Pilot Bay <b>Smelter</b> was in operation with 200 men employed. A town emerged around the <b>smelter</b> called Pilot Bay. Pilot Bay had a population of 1,000 and had 4 hotels, 3 stores and some other businesses. Mines which shipped their ore to the <b>smelter</b> include the Blue Bell, Ainsworth Mines, and Slocan Mines. In 1896 the Hall Mines <b>Smelter</b> in Nelson had started and become too much competition for Pilot Bay. This resulted in the closure of Pilot Bay <b>Smelter</b> in 1896. The Pilot Bay <b>Smelter</b> reopened in 1905 but was eventually closed permanently. Today all that is left is the ruins of the <b>smelter</b> and remnants of the town.|$|R
5|$|The dam's primary goal, irrigation, was {{postponed}} as the wartime need for electricity increased. The dam's powerhouse began production {{around the time}} World WarII began, and its electricity was vital to the war effort. The dam powered aluminum <b>smelters</b> in Longview and Vancouver, Washington, Boeing factories in Seattle and Vancouver, and Portland's shipyards. In 1943, its electricity was also used for plutonium production in Richland, Washington, at the Hanford Site, {{which was part of}} the top-secret Manhattan Project. The demand for power at that project was so great that in 1943, two generators originally intended for the Shasta Dam were installed at Grand Coulee in an effort to hurry the generator installation schedule.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, {{germanium}} {{was thought to}} be a poorly conducting metal. Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized. During World War II, small amounts of germanium were used in some special electronic devices, mostly diodes. The first major use was the point-contact Schottky diodes for radar pulse detection during the War. The first silicon-germanium alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in <b>smelters</b> each year, {{but by the end of}} the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bernardii is a {{saprobic}} species. Its mushrooms fruit singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground. They grow in sandy soils, lawns, and in habitats with a high salt concentration, like along ocean coasts and salt marshes. Once primarily a maritime species, the fungus has spread inland to roadside verges where salt {{has been applied to}} de-ice the roads. Fruit bodies sometimes form underground. Mushrooms can also grow in fairy rings, especially when in grasslands or pastures. A Czech study determined that the mushrooms will strongly bioaccumulate silver from contaminated soil. Although the average concentration of silver in the soil is typically less than 1 milligram per kilogram of soil, it can be significantly elevated near industrial sites such as mines and <b>smelters.</b> The concentration of silver in the caps—which reached levels of up to 544mg per kg of mushroom tissue (dry weight)—was about twice that of the stems.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Aramoana was {{proposed}} {{as the site}} of a major aluminium <b>smelter</b> by a consortium of New Zealand-based Fletcher-Challenge, Australia's CSR Limited and Swiss firm Alusuisse. An aluminium <b>smelter</b> was already operating at Tiwai Point when the <b>smelter</b> at Aramoana was proposed.|$|R
50|$|The International Smelting and Refining Company was a {{subsidiary}} of Anaconda Copper which operated primarily out of the International <b>Smelter</b> near Tooele, Utah. The International <b>Smelter</b> began operation in 1910 as a copper producer handling ores from Bingham Canyon and was expanded into a lead smelting operation in 1912. Copper smelting finished at International in 1946, and the lead <b>smelter</b> shut down in January 1972. The closure of the <b>smelter</b> {{would lead to the}} associated Tooele Valley Railway (which had their primary railyards at the <b>smelter)</b> to be shut down ten years later in 1982. The company also handled several other Anaconda owned interests. After the shut down of the International <b>Smelter,</b> environmental reclamation was performed by Anaconda Copper's successor company ARCO and the EPA Superfund program.|$|R
