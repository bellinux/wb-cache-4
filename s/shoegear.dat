25|$|L13A/B - Created in 1974, this {{locomotive}} {{consisted of}} two 1938 Stock Driving Motor cars coupled back to back. Modifications included the addition of high level air pipes to allow coupling to other Departmental vehicles, reciprocating compressors, {{and the addition of}} power lines between the two cars. These gave the locomotive a very long <b>shoegear</b> span, since all four bogies were fitted with shoe beams, enabling it to cross gaps in the current rail at very low speeds. The locomotive was built so that L14A/B, which had proved the usefulness of a long shunting locomotive, could be scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|The more {{high-profile}} unit preserved is {{the former}} South West Trains (SWT) [...] "celebrity" [...] unit painted in BR blue livery with painted aluminium window frames, number 3417. The unit was initially used on Wimbledon depot as a shunter, but with SWT needing to get it off its books it was sold to the Bluebell Railway for the nominal sum of £1. It was moved to Eastleigh Works for storage, after having been used initially as the centrepiece for the Bluebell in a ceremony at East Grinstead railway station to mark the commencement of work at the station site {{as part of the}} line's work on the northern extension. The unit returned to East Grinstead for further use and storage in September 2010. In late April, the unit sustained minor damage to its <b>shoegear</b> as it was being towed from Clapham Junction Yard to the Swanage Railway. This resulted in the traction current being discharged in the yard overnight, whilst repairs were carried out. The unit was for some time stabled in the open at Clapham Junction, having been stored in the shed at the yard, but after a spell at Ilford depot being restored, the unit is now at Strawberry Hill, being maintained by a group of volunteers.|$|E

50|$|The rest of {{the fleet}} is being {{delivered}} with just 750 V DC <b>shoegear</b> for use on third rail electrified lines, but all will {{have the ability to}} be modified for dual-voltage use if required in future. The first reached England on 9 December 2016.|$|E
5000|$|The DMS B {{coach has}} an MA (Motor Alternator) set powered from the 750 V DC bus; the {{transformer}} and rectifier provide the supply when on 25 kV working and the <b>shoegear</b> provides traction current directly when on 3rd rail working. The MA provides {{power for the}} following: ...|$|E
50|$|Modifications led to {{renumbering}} and reclassification. All units {{originally had}} shoebeams {{on the inner}} bogie of each motor coach, which was sufficient for third-rail duties between Drayton Park and Moorgate. Some units became surplus, and in 1987 four were transferred to the -Clacton/Walton route, which has no DC sections; they had the <b>shoegear</b> removed, and were renumbered from 313061-4 to 313096-9. Following an accident involving one unit at Walton on the Naze in August 1987, they were replaced by 310s in 1988. 313s had also worked on the Colchester-Walton/Clacton route between 1981 and 1983. 313001-016 had <b>shoegear</b> fitted to the outer bogies in addition, and were transferred to the -Watford DC route where there are long gaps in the 3rd rail. They were not renumbered but reclassified 313/1, the unmodified units becoming 313/0 - prior to this the class had no sub classes.|$|E
5000|$|The inceptive part of {{the line}} in the London Borough of Lambeth was used from 1994 to 2007 by Eurostar trains running out of 'London Waterloo International' {{requiring}} trains in this period to have a <b>shoegear</b> to run off the line's third rail DC electrification, following which the Central London terminus for direct European services became [...]|$|E
50|$|The first {{electric}} {{multiple units}} ran on 1 January 1905 from Uxbridge to Baker Street, the Uxbridge branch having opened in July 1904 and worked by steam for six months. After {{problems with the}} Metropolitan <b>shoegear</b> on the District Railway were solved the inner circle began a full electric service on 24 September 1905, reducing the travel time from seventy to fifty minutes, and an electric service started on the Hammersmith and City line on 5 November 1906.|$|E
50|$|The British Rail Class 313 is a dual-voltage {{electric}} {{multiple unit}} (EMU) train built by BREL York Works between February 1976 and April 1977. They {{were the first}} second-generation EMUs to be constructed for British Rail and the first British Rail units with both a pantograph for 25 kV AC overhead lines and <b>shoegear</b> for 750 V DC third rail supply. They were the first units in Britain to have multi-function Tightlock couplers, allowing coupling and the connection of control electric and air supplies {{to be carried out}} from the cab.|$|E

50|$|These {{units were}} repainted at Wolverton works. The full {{refurbishment}} began in June 2010 at Wabtec Doncaster and included new flooring and carpet, new seating, improved disabled and cycle {{space and the}} fitting of a Passenger Information System. Additional modifications were carried out at Stewarts Lane TMD including the installation of cab air-conditioning, sanding equipment, a 750 V busline, shore supply sockets {{and the removal of}} inboard <b>shoegear.</b> Recommissioning exams began in February 2010 taking place at Stewarts Lane, which included the removal of tripcocks. The Southern 313s also had their pantographs removed as they were for use on DC-only lines which rendered the AC traction equipment redundant.|$|E
5000|$|The {{order was}} made up of 192 motor cars and 228 trailers. The motor cars had wooden bodies on steel underframes and one motored bogie {{containing}} two GE69 traction motors each rated at [...] controlled with British Thomson-Houston (BTH) equipment. Both bogies carried <b>shoegear,</b> that were connected together by a power bus line. One hundred and twenty end motor cars had one driving position, the reminder with two diving positions were intended for the centre of trains. Twenty end motor cars were built with luggage compartments but these were soon replaced with seating. The trailer cars were built entirely of wood, thirty two having driving positions. The trains were fitted with the Westinghouse air brake.|$|E
50|$|The first train entered {{service on}} 22 June 2017 {{on the current}} TfL Rail route between London Liverpool Street and Shenfield as a seven-carriage unit, since, until the {{platforms}} can be lengthened there, the 9-car sets cannot be accommodated at Liverpool Street. The new units will also replace the Class 315s presently used on TfL Rail. Units introduced from May 2018 between London Paddington and Heathrow Airport will be full nine-carriage trains, with those initially delivered in seven-car formation converted {{by the end of}} 2019. The trains will have free Wi-Fi and 4G available, as well as being fully accessible for wheelchair users. The trains will operate from 25 kV AC OHLE, but will be able to be fitted with <b>shoegear</b> allowing for use with 750 V DC third rail, allowing for a possible future extension of Crossrail to Gravesend.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{vehicles}} {{from two}} Class 310/1 units, numbers 310109 and 310113, {{were used to}} create a single four-car departmental unit, 960201 which could operate on either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) lines for test purposes.The set consisted of two driving cars, a Class 310 power car with Hitachi equipment and either a standard Class 310 25 kV power car or a modified 650 V third rail vehicle from a Class 423 (4-VEP) unit. One of these two vehicles was included in the formation depending upon where the unit was operating (on 25 kV overhead lines or third rail). To facilitate third rail running, <b>shoegear</b> was fitted to each driving car. The unit was known as the 'Hitachi Verification Train' or 'V Train' and was used by Hitachi to test and prove its traction equipment in the UK. The subsequent order for the Class 395 Javelin trains which now run on the High Speed 1 line benefitted from this exercise. The V train was scrapped at MoD Pig's Bay in Shoeburyness in 2007.Details and more pictures of the V train on AC, DC and the High Speed 1 lines can be found at Train Testing - Hitachi's V train.|$|E
