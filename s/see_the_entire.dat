During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord.

25|$|The Iraqi army {{suffered}} from poor morale, even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon {{the approach of}} invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender to. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. The leadership of the Iraqi army was incompetent – reports state that Qusay Hussein, charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted {{the positions of the}} two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times {{in the days before the}} arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units were confused, and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target points rather than seek to engage Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war without having been engaged, and fully intact, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.|$|E

2500|$|Gamma-ray burst {{emission}} {{is believed}} to be released in jets, not spherical shells. Initially the two scenarios are equivalent: the center of the jet is not [...] "aware" [...] of the jet edge, and due to relativistic beaming we only see {{a small fraction of the}} jet. However, as the jet slows down, two things eventually occur (each at about the same time): First, information from the edge of the jet that there is no pressure to the side propagates to its center, and the jet matter can spread laterally. Second, relativistic beaming effects subside, and once Earth observers <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> jet the widening of the relativistic beam is no longer compensated by the fact that we see a larger emitting region. Once these effects appear the jet fades very rapidly, an effect that is visible as a power-law [...] "break" [...] in the afterglow light curve. This is the so-called [...] "jet break" [...] that has been seen in some events and is often cited as evidence for the consensus view of GRBs as jets. Many GRB afterglows do not display jet breaks, especially in the X-ray, but they are more common in the optical light curves. Though as jet breaks generally occur at very late times (~1 day or more) when the afterglow is quite faint, and often undetectable, this is not necessarily surprising.|$|E
2500|$|In the People's Republic of China, {{the entire}} period between 1839 and 1949 is {{depicted}} as the [...] "Century of Humiliation" [...] a time when racist, greedy and evil foreigners humiliated and rapaciously exploited the Chinese people. Because {{many aspects of the}} Taiping ideology resembled Communism, the Taipings are treated sympathetically by Chinese historians who portrayed as them as prototypical Communists with Hong Xiuquan being depicted as anticipating Mao. In this context, Gordon is vilified in China today as just another foreigner oppressing the Chinese people by crushing the Taiping rebellion. Furthermore, Gordon worked for the Qing dynasty, who were Manchus, which has led many Han to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Qing period between 1644 and 1912 as a long foreign occupation of China. No monuments to Gordon exist in China today, through the British journalist Rob Stallard noted that the modest Gordon would have no doubt wanted it that way. Stallard in a 2008 article argued that Gordon deserves a better reputation in China, arguing that he was largely immune to the racist views so common to Westerners in the 19th century and he always treated the Chinese with respect, maintaining that the memory of [...] "Chinese Gordon" [...] could be a bridge to better Anglo-Chinese understanding. In Sudan, it is the Mahdi who is the hero and Gordon who is the villain. The Canadian historian C. Brad Faught wrote it was [...] "no coincidence" [...] that the Sudan, a place known as a hotbed of fundamentalist Islam produced both the Mahdi and the current regime of General Omar al-Bashir, which venerates the memory of the Mahdi and which for a time in the 1990s sheltered Osama bin Laden.|$|E
