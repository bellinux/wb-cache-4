Mathsigner tm is an interactive, 3 D animation-based game designed to increase the mathematical skills of deaf children. The program makes use of standard input devices such as mouse and keyboard. In this paper we show a significant extension of the application by proposing two new user interfaces: (1) a glove-based interface, and (2) an interface based on the use of a specialized keyboard. So far, the interfaces allow for real-time <b>input</b> and <b>recognition</b> of the ASL numbers zero to twenty. ...|$|R

40|$|Handwriting {{recognition}} {{is the ability}} of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten <b>input.</b> <b>Recognition</b> systems are divided into two categories: holistic approach and analytical approach. A holistic approach handles the whole input image, while analytical approach involves two steps namely; segmentation and combination. Handwriting recognition began long time ago mainly in Latin and Chinese characters. However, little effort has been devoted to Arabic characters. The domain of handwriting in the Arabic script presents unique technical challenges and has been given more attention recently than other domains. In respect to the above issue, this paper investigates two different feature extraction methods, Angular span method and Distance span method, which may represent the distribution of pixels in the word properly.

An open source framework, Dodona, is also provided that allows for these techniques to be easily employed and customized in the evaluation of a wide spectrum of possible keyboards and input methods. Finally, we perform an optimization procedure over permutations of the QWERTY keyboard to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and describe ways that future analyses can build upon these results.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 27, 2007. Research completed at Department of Mathematics and Statistics, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. We introduce an algorithm for the classical recognition problem of identifying elements s within a class of strings S = {s 1, s 2, [...] ., sn}. Here {{it is assumed that}} struct s = { char *a; int z; }; and that for two strings s 1, s 2 if s 1. z == s 2. z then there is J = {j 1, j 2, [...] ., jl} with l(z) < z so that s 1 [J] == s 2 [J] ⇒ s 1 == s 2. The goal is to minimize Σ = n k i l si z 1 (.) and thus distinguish elements with the smallest number of comparisons. In general, this simply means that in a language system we face a nonoptimal set of keywords (n < sizeof(*s. a) z) and so we seek to reconstruct the language with a smaller set of k recognition vertices so that k ≈ logsizeof(*s. a) n. The algorithm is applied to increasing HTTP transmission and request processing speed. The result is an increase in web server performance from 20, 000 to 35, 000 or more hits per second.
