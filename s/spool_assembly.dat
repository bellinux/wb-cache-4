40|$|A generic {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic model}} of a direct acting electrohydraulic proportional solenoid valve is presented. The valve consists of two subsystems, a <b>spool</b> <b>assembly</b> {{and one or two}} unidirectional proportional solenoids. These two subsystems are modelled separately. The solenoid is modelled as a nonlinear resistor / inductor combination, with inductance parameters that change with current. An innovative modelling method has been used to represent these components. The <b>spool</b> <b>assembly</b> is modelled as a mass / spring / damper system. The inertia and the damping effects of the solenoid armature are incorporated in the spool model. The model accurately and reliably predicts both the dynamic and steady state responses of the valve to voltage inputs. Simulated results are presented, which agree well with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the sensitivity of}} microtubule spools to transport velocity. Perhaps surprisingly, we determined that the steady-state number and size of spools remained constant over a seven-fold range of velocities. Our data on the kinetics of <b>spool</b> <b>assembly</b> further suggest that the main mechanisms underlying spool growth vary during assembly...|$|E
40|$|A {{drive system}} for a {{variable}} diameter rotor (VDR) system includes a plurality of rotor blade assemblies with inner and outer rotor blade segments. The outer blade segment being telescopically mounted to the inner blade segment. The VDR retraction/extension system includes a drive housing mounted {{at the root of}} each blade. The housing supports a <b>spool</b> <b>assembly,</b> a harmonic gear set and an electric motor. The <b>spool</b> <b>assembly</b> includes a pair of counter rotating spools each of which drive a respective cable which extends through the interior of the inboard rotor blade section and around a pulley mounted to the outboard rotor blade section. In operation, the electric motor drives the harmonic gear set which rotates the counter rotating spools. Rotation of the spools causes the cables to be wound onto or off their respective spool consequently effecting retraction/extension of the pulley and the attached outboard rotor blade section relative the inboard rotor blade section. As each blade drive system is independently driven by a separate electrical motor, each independent VDR blade assembly is independently positionable...|$|E
40|$|Several seals, {{designed}} to minimize leakage between the rotating <b>spool</b> <b>assembly’s</b> endplates and the stationary compressor housing, are introduced, constructed and tested. Some designs are deemed impractical due to either high leakage or high torque. A novel one piece hybrid design that blends {{the function of}} a face seal and piston ring is tested and shown to achieve excellent results. A test apparatus is introduced to isolate and measure the spool seal’s performance independent of the compressor. It is concluded that the hybrid design is highly effective and well suited for many applications of the spool compressor...|$|R
40|$|A {{gas turbine}} engine {{includes}} a spool, a turbine coupled to drive the spool, and a propulsor that is coupled {{to be driven by}} the turbine through the <b>spool.</b> A gear <b>assembly</b> is coupled between the propulsor and the spool such that rotation of the turbine drives the propulsor at a different speed than the spool. The propulsor includes a hub and a row of propulsor blades that extends from the hub. The row includes no more than 20 of the propulsor blades...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results for the Ascent Thrust Vector Control (ATVC) Actuator hardware are documented. The function of the Ascent Thrust Vector Control Actuators (ATVC) is to gimbal the main engines to provide for attitude and flight path control during ascent. During first stage flight, the SRB nozzles provide nearly all the steering. After SRB separation, the Orbiter is steered by gimbaling of its main engines. There are six electrohydraulic servoactuators, one pitch and one yaw {{for each of the}} three main engines. Each servoactuator is composed of four electrohydraulic servovalve assemblies, one second stage power <b>spool</b> valve <b>assembly,</b> one primary piston assembly and a switching valve. Each level of hardware was evaluated and analyzed for possible failure modes and effects. Criticality was assigned based upon the severity of the effect for each failure mode. Critical failures resulting in loss of ATVC were mainly due to loss of hydraulic fluid, fluid contamination and mechanical failures...|$|R
40|$|An energy {{absorbing}} device {{used as a}} load limiting member in a structure to control its response to applied loads is described. It functions by utilizing a <b>spool</b> <b>assembly</b> having flanged ends and an interior cavity of sufficiently large diameter to cause it to deform plastically at a prescribed load. In application, the spool is utilized as a pivot point for the legs of an airplane seat. When properly designed and integrated into the seat arrangement the spool will twist about its axis, deforming plastically when the impact load exceeds the spool yield value. Through this deformation, the spool absorbs the kinetic energy of {{the movement of the}} seat at a substantially constant rate, thereby controlling the level of loads transmitted to the seat occupant. By proper sizing and collection of materials, it is possible to control load response in a predictable manner...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{gas turbine}} engine {{internal}} air system provides cooling and sealing air {{to a series of}} critical subsystems and components such as high pressure gas turbine blades, as well as controlling the thrust load on the turbine and compressor <b>spool</b> <b>assembly.</b> Many potential variations for the internal air system are possible, depending on the requirement, expertise and command of intellectual property. Some subsystems, such as rim seals, pre-swirl systems, and rotating cavities {{have been the subject of}} extensive development and analysis leading to robust design solutions. Nevertheless there remains scope for further consideration of the overall system design, and this paper explores the use of a decision analysis tool called morphological analysis applied to the internal air system. Morphological analysis provides an effective means for tackling issues where there is uncertainty, as is the case with many design scenarios, including the internal air system, with some specific parameters and information not available until later in the design phase, after the key geometry has been defined. The problem space comprising seven principal parameters, and a cross consistency matrix which allows identification of compatible and incompatible states are presented...|$|E
40|$|Most valves {{available}} in the fluid power industry today are capable of achieving either a large flow rate or a quick response time; however, often {{they are unable to}} deliver both simultaneously. Commercially available valves that can produce {{both at the same time}} require complex geometries with multiple actuation stages and piloting pressures, making them expensive components. To establish their active usage in applications across the fluid power industry, a reduction in price for these components is paramount. The Energy Coupling Actuated Valve (ECAV) is capable of solving the large flow rates with fast actuation speeds trade-off by utilizing a new, high performance actuation system. The Energy Coupling Actuator (ECA) is an innovative actuation system that separates the kinetic energy source mass from the actuation mass. Intermittently coupling the actuator to a constantly rotating disk creates an energy transfer from the rotating disk’s kinetic energy to the normally stationary actuator. This intermittent coupling process is controlled by changing the magnetic field inside the actuator’s two coils. Magnetorheological (MR) fluid resides in a 0. 5 mm fluid gap between the spinning disk and the actuator, and when the magnetic flux builds across this gap, it causes the actuator to move rapidly in a translational movement. The MR fluid changes to a solid between the gap and frictionally binds the actuator to the disk, causing the actuator to move up or down, depending on which coil is actuated on the spinning disk. The liquid-solid conversion from the MR fluid occurs in less than one millisecond and is completely reversible. The shear strength of the fluid is proportional to the magnetic field strength inside the system. The actuator is connected to either a poppet or <b>spool</b> <b>assembly</b> for valve actuation, and the position is controlled through intermittently binding the actuator to the disk. ^ Two valve prototypes, one poppet and one spool type, were machined, and concept validation has been done in both simulation and experimentally. Experimental results show that the poppet reaches a 4 mm displacement in 19. 8 ms opening and 17 ms in closing under 33 L/min flow. The spool valve experimentally transitioned in 4. 8 ms at the same flow rate. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article, {{in order}} to improve the {{assembly}} of the high-pressure <b>spool,</b> presents an <b>assembly</b> variation identification method achieved by response surface method (RSM) -based model updating using IV-optimal designs. The method involves screening out non-relevant assembly parameters using IV-optimal designs and the preload of the joints is chosen as the input features and modal frequency is the only response feature. Emphasis is placed on the construction of response surface models including the interactions between the bolted joints by which the non-linear relationship between the assembly variation caused by the changes of preload and the output frequency variation is established. By achieving an optimal process of selected variables in the model, assembly variation can be identified. With a case study of the laboratory bolted disks as an example, the proposed method is verified and it gives enough accuracy in variation identification. It has been observed that the first-order response surface models considering the interactions between the bolted joints based on the IV-optimal criterion are adequate for assembly purposes...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} braking cable-payout mechanism {{has been}} developed. Whereas other such mechanisms operate at payout speeds that {{vary with the}} length of payout, this mechanism operates at approximately constant payout speed, regardless {{of the length of}} cord that has already been paid out. The present mechanism includes a <b>spool,</b> a capstan <b>assembly,</b> and centrifugal brakes. The spool is used to store the cord and, unlike in the prior mechanism, is not involved in the primary braking function. That is, the spool operates {{in such a way that}} the cord is unwound from the spool at low tension. The spool is connected to the rest of the mechanism through a constant- torque slip clutch. The clutch must slip in order to pay out the cord. As the cord leaves the spool, it passes into the capstan assembly, wherein its direction is changed by use of the first of three idler sheaves and it is then routed into the first of three grooves on a capstan. After completing less than a full circle in the first groove, the cord passes over the second idler sheave, which is positioned to enable the cord to make the transition to the second groove on the capstan. Similarly, a third idler sheave enables the cord to make the transition to the third groove on the capstan. After traveling less than a full circle in the third groove, the cord leaves the capstan along the payout path. The total wrap angle afforded by this capstan-and-idler arrangement is large enough to prevent slippage between the cord and the capstan. The capstan is connected to a shaft that, in turn, is connected to a centrifugal brake. Hence, the effective payout radius, for purposes of braking, is not the varying radius of the remaining cord on the spool but, rather, the constant radius of the grooves in the capstan. The payout speed is determined primarily by this radius and by the characteristics of the centrifugal brake. Therefore, the payout speed is more nearly constant in this mechanism than in the prior mechanism...|$|R
