50|$|Lapper {{began his}} {{professional}} career in 1994 with German Second Division club VfL Wolfsburg in Germany (1994-95). On a side note, he scored in his debut game with that team. He continued to start for Wolfsburg until coach Eckhard Krautzun, who had sought Lapper's services, {{was fired by}} team management. Lapper soon {{found himself in the}} position of so many American players in Europe during those years. The new manager, Gerd Roggensack, had no interest in American soccer players and Lapper found himself unable to even make the <b>substitute</b> <b>list.</b> At the time that Krautzun was fired, Wolfsburg stood {{at the top of the}} German Second Division. By the end of the season, it had slipped to fourth and failed to win promotion to the First Division. Lapper requested a transfer and in 1995, the team sent him to British Second Division club Southend United for £100,000. At the time, Southend was pushing for promotion to the Premiership, but when it actually faced demotion to the second division in 1997, Lapper left Southend to sign with Major League Soccer (MLS). However, he did have a final stint within English football, when Halifax Town signed him on a rolling contract in late 1999. His time at the club proved unsuccessful and he soon returned to the U.S.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess how}} attitudes and {{prescribing}} strategies of family physicians changed when drugs were delisted from the Ontario Drug Benefit formulary. DESIGN: Mailed, self-administered survey. SETTING: Family physicians' offices in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: All family physicians practising in the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox, and Addington Health District. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physicians {{were presented with}} six vignettes involving patients receiving a delisted drug. The choices were to recommend the patient pay for the medication, to substitute a drug still listed on the formulary, to make a special request that the medication be covered for this patient, or to offer another option. As well, the physicians were asked to indicate, on a 5 -point Likert scale, their opinions regarding the effect of delisting on themselves and their patients. RESULTS: Physicians {{were most likely to}} change to a medication that was still on the formulary. Patient sex and ability to pay were factors in physicians' decisions. Physicians believe that the delistings are not likely to have adversely affected patients' health, that noncompliance is a problem because many once-daily formulations have been removed, that suitable alternatives are not always available, and that physicians should have been consulted more before the changes were made. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians usually <b>substitute</b> <b>listed</b> medications for medications that have been delisted. This is especially true for female patients and patients who are unable to pay...|$|R

40|$|A stock listing usually {{reflects}} {{easy access}} to external equity financing. Although scant empirical evidence exists on the matter, the literature suggests that the enhanced standing towards creditors - which would result in easier access to debt financing - is an extra advantage of being publicly quoted. This paper tests whether a stock listing leads to more flexibility of debt financing, using a data set of listed and comparably large unlisted companies. The data reveals that listing mainly increases the flexible use of debt financing. The difference between listed and unlisted firms is most apparent when investment opportunities tend to arrive in low-cash-flow states. Furthermore, as the unlisted firms in the dataset are all large consolidating business groups, {{the results indicate that}} a group structure does not <b>substitute</b> for <b>listing.</b> The results are robust to different estimation methods.

5|$|Arsenal Football Club, an {{association}} football club based in Holloway, London, {{was founded in}} 1886 as Royal Arsenal. They became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893, having spent their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies. The club's name, which shortly changed to Woolwich Arsenal, was shortened to Arsenal in 1914, a year after moving to Highbury. Despite finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1914–15, Arsenal rejoined the First Division {{at the expense of}} local rivals Tottenham Hotspur when football resumed after the First World War. Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight.

Instead, they became a founder member of the Football Alliance, which was formed a year later.

Some in the community did not think {{she should have been}} allowed to return to teaching. One parent took out a full-page advertisement in a local newspaper alerting parents to what had happened. Parents expressed fear that some of her students would not understand transgenderism. After listening to parents and citizens providing public input, the school district board decided to uphold their previous 4 to 1 vote for her reinstatement. This decision was hailed and criticized by politicians, journalists, and activists around the world.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the willingness of}} saltwater anglers in Florida and Texas to substitute {{other types of fishing}} for the type of fishing they most preferred. Anglers were asked if there was a suitable substitute for their most preferred species and, if so, what species would provide them with the same satisfaction and enjoyment as their most preferred species at the same cost. Most anglers (86 %) reported that other species would provide acceptable substitutes for their preferred species and were able to identify acceptable <b>substitutes</b> from a <b>list</b> of common saltwater species in Texas and Florida. Logistic regression was used {{to determine the effects of}} demographic and fishing participation variables on willingness to substitute. Willingness to substitute was positively related to years of education and negatively related to age and the importance placed on trophy-seeking experiences. Also, females were more willing to substitute than males. Results suggest that for some species substitution behavior in response to biologically or managerially imposed constraints on fishing activity could result in increased effort for other species in the saltwater fisheries of Texas and Florida...|$|R
