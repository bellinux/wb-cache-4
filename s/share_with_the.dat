It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, to <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E

5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} {{that allow them to}} learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E

5|$|The post-Taylor {{capacity}} of Highbury {{was limited to}} 38,419, while Arsenal's success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near capacity. Restrictions, such as the East Stand's status as a listed building and the fact the stadium was surrounded on all sides by a residential area, made any future expansion of Highbury difficult and expensive, although the club's directors {{would have liked to}} have kept Arsenal at a modernized and expanded Highbury. In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home to <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> England national football team, although at the time Wembley was two years away from closure for a redevelopment which was not completed until more than six years later.|$|E
5|$|Until the Taung childthe 2.8 million-year-old {{remains of}} an Australopithecus africanuswere {{discovered}} in South Africa in 1924, Dubois's and Koenigswald's discoveries were the oldest hominid remains ever found.

This supposition has been confirmed, but the current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations {{of the same species}} exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man.|$|E

Another study that analyzed the COII gene found the nilgai and lesser kudu being sister species (although the support was low and had limited species sampling).

25|$|For 2017, the Nationals {{moved to}} a new spring {{training}} facility at The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, in West Palm Beach, Florida, which they <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Houston Astros.

The move from their former spring training home, Space Coast Stadium in Viera, Florida, placed the Nationals far closer to other teams during spring training, facilitating travel for spring training games.|$|E
25|$|One student {{did find}} some remains: a Dutchman named Eugène Dubois searched the East Indies from 1887 to 1895, {{discovering}} {{the remains of}} Java Man in 1891, consisting of a skullcap, thighbone, and a few teeth. These remains are among the oldest hominid remains ever found. Dubois classified Java Man with Haeckel's Pithecanthropus label, though they were later reclassified as Homo erectus.
