5|$|Article 33 of the BSAC {{charter of}} 1889 gave the British {{government}} {{the right to}} alter or repeal any of the administrative provisions of the charter after 25 years. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> widely anticipated by all sections of southern African political opinion after 1910 that the BSAC's administration would {{come to an end}} in 1914. Yet the BSAC remained in place.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, Parliament finally {{voted to}} {{increase}} Ernest's allowance. The Liverpool Government {{argued that the}} Duke needed an increased allowance to pay for Prince George's education; even <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> opposed by many Whigs. The bill, which passed the House of Commons 120–97, required Prince George to live in England if the Duke was to receive the money.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, IMAX Corporation, Marvel, and Paramount {{announced}} that the film would receive a limited release on digital IMAX screens. It was not shot with IMAX cameras, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> converted into the format using the IMAX DMR technology. The film underwent reshoots in February. Olivia Munn's original role was cut, but she was given a new role during the reshoots.|$|E

5|$|In the 23 February 1859 {{edition of}} the Deseret News, the editors {{announced}} their approval of the two new letters and eventual intention to use them in the newsletter. However, due to the hot metal typesetting technology in use at the time, casting the new letters for use {{would have been a}} considerable expense, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never realized.|$|E
5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population greater than that of the Northern Territory that was growing faster, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then it must also be appropriate for the ACT.|$|E
5|$|Partial capping (covering) of the site: The {{ore body}} in Iron Mountain was {{determined}} to be shallow, so this alternative was considered. However, the recurring high occurrence of fractures in the mountain made this inefficient, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> also never implemented.|$|E

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-30 was a Soviet turbojet-powered {{tactical}} bomber {{designed as}} a higher-performance, swept wing version of the Ilyushin Il-28, in the late 1940s. Its thin wing and engine nacelles necessitated the use of tandem landing gear, the first Soviet aircraft to do <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> apparently canceled before the prototype made its first flight, although sources disagree with this.|$|E
5|$|The brand {{was created}} {{around the same}} time as Japanese rivals Nissan and Honda {{developed}} their Infiniti and Acura premium brands.

5|$|The girls {{found the}} school's {{distinctive}} Beret difficult to wear, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> phased out in 1995. It {{was replaced by}} the current Panama hat, but the Beret was reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to the Pipes and Drums uniform.|$|E

5|$|There were {{periods of}} renewed prosperity. The Cambrian Mills in Newtown was {{purchased}} in 1866 by the Cambrian Flannel Company of Newtown and Llanidloes, which modernized the factory <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the most advanced}} facility in Wales and diversified into making plain and coloured flannels, shawls, whittles, hose and tweeds.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Australian touring teams, the 1884 team {{organised}} {{the project}} themselves and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a private business venture which involved {{none of the}} Australian colonial cricket associations.

5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Sarah Jane being captured by an alien, who uses her DNA to impersonate her, and frame her for stealing an important piece of alien merchandise. Sarah would have used her gadgets to fight her clone. This story however, was very similar to Sarah Jane in Prison, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> scrapped.|$|E

5|$|After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, {{joined the}} PCHA in 1914, the {{trustees}} {{issued a statement}} that the Cup was no longer for {{the best team in}} Canada, but now for {{the best team in the}} world. Ice hockey in Europe was still in its infancy at this time, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> without much controversy that winners of the Stanley Cup began styling themselves as the world champions just like in baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.|$|E
5|$|After {{the pilot}} was {{transmitted}} on 12 July 1991, the BBC were interested in a series. However, Moffat had signed on to write {{the third and fourth}} series of Press Gang as one twelve-episode block <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not until 1992 that they produced the series. After being postponed from the autumn schedules, the first series was transmitted on Thursday evenings on BBC2 from 7 January until 11 February 1993.|$|E
5|$|Another large {{building}} lies crosswise at {{the south}} end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species's southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this {{may also be the}} case for all the parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands.|$|E
5|$|By 1899, the {{sandstone}} shaft marker placed by Chandler Robbins in 1875 had been disturbed and broken, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{replaced with a}} new stone by two U.S. Surveyors, Hubert D. Page and James M. Lentz. In 1912, a simple cement pad was poured around the marker. The first modern Navajo government convened in 1923 {{in an effort to}} organize and regulate an increasing amount of oil exploration activities on Navajo lands, and they would play a big role in the monument's further development.|$|E
5|$|By 23:30 on her own, Moltke {{encountered}} four British dreadnoughts, {{from the}} rear division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. Moltkes commander Kapitän von Karpf ordered the ship to swing away, hoping {{he had not been}} detected. The British ships in fact had seen Moltke, but had decided to not open fire in order to not reveal their location to the entire German fleet. At 23:55, and again at 00:20, Kapitän von Karpf tried to find a path through the British fleet, but both times was unable to do <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not until 01:00, after having steamed far ahead of the Grand Fleet, that Moltke was able to make good her escape.|$|E
