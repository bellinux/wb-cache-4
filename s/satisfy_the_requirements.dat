The level of satisfaction (largely, reasonably or precariously) is related to the effort required to perform the actions (the more effort is necessary, the less the satisfaction level will be); and (iii) Dissatisfied, meaning that the item does not <b>satisfy</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> and there are no possible actions to adapt it for being used in SPC.|$|R

Grodno was chosen for the Commonwealth's capital, as Warsaw was deemed too unsafe for Russians (and indeed it would prove so during the Warsaw Uprising next year). Many of the deputies were Russian {{supporters}} (like marshal of the Sejm, Stanisław Kostka Bieliński), with Russian representatives bribing some deputies and Russian armies forcing the election of their favoured candidate at local sejmiks.

25|$|The {{courses that}} a student takes {{depending}} on program and orientation {{can be divided into}} four levels: core subjects, program-specific subjects, orientation subjects, and individually selected courses. Core courses are courses that everyone, regardless of program, must study to <b>satisfy</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> for a student degree. Program-specific courses are the additional courses {{that a student}} is required to take to fulfill the program requirements. If a student for some reason does not fulfill the requirements, for example, by electing to replace a program-specific course with another course, the student is considered to have attended a specially designed program, which has no bearing except for what's printed on the school leaving certificate. Orientation subjects are the courses that a student elects to take by selecting an orientation. Normally these courses take place {{in the second and third}} year, although in a few cases the courses start earlier. Finally, individually selected courses are courses that the student freely selects for herself/himself in the second and third year; specific slots have been set aside in the curriculum and the schedule for these.|$|E

Horses are classified in one of six registration categories, designated with letters A through F, depending on their parentage. Only certain crosses between the different classes are permitted. [...] In Mexico, Azteca horses must conform to a strict phenotype standard established by the Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentación (SAGARPA), the Mexican agriculture ministry, which requires inspection of foals at seven months for the issue of a [...] "birth certificate"; a foal that does not meet the breed standards may be denied registration even if both parents are registered Aztecas approved for breeding.

[...] After {{an appeal to the}} Board of Assessment Appeals to reverse their earlier decision was denied, the city appealed the Washington County Court of Common Pleas. [...] On August 5, 1994, Judge Thomas J. Terputac reversed the board's decision, ruling in Order No. 93-7033 that the college did not qualify for tax-exempt status. [...] According to the trial court, Washington & Jefferson College was not a [...] "purely public charity", failing four of five criteria in the Hospital Utilization Project case. [...] Specifically, Judge Terputac opined that the college had been founded as a purely public charity, but had morphed into an [...] "enterprise of big business." [...] The college appealed to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which overturned Judge Terputac's decision on September 15, 1995, in a decision written by Judge James R. Kelley. [...] According to that court, Washington & Jefferson College did <b>satisfy</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> to be considered a [...] "purely public charity." [...] Judges Bernard L. McGinley, Doris A. Smith-Ribner, and Dan Pellegrini dissented. [...] The City of Washington appealed that decision to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which affirmed the lower court's decision on November 20, 1997, in a decision written by Justice John P. Flaherty. [...] According to the court, the lower court was correct in concluding that the college did in fact satisfy the five requirements for an entity to be considered a [...] "purely public charity," [...] a standard that was set out in the Hospital Utilization Project case: [...] "1) advance a charitable purpose; 2) donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its services; 3) benefit a substantial and indefinite class of persons who are legitimate subjects of charity; 4) relieve the government of some of its burden; and 5) operate entirely free from private profit motive." [...] The court said that [...] "the record demonstrates that W fulfills all of these requirements." [...] Most persuasive {{was the fact that the}} college's benefits were open to all and that those served were members of a charitable class. [...] The dissent by Justice Russell M. Nigro did not state that he thought that the college should not be tax-exempt, only that the rest of the court had [...] "so broadly construed its requirements that any private college or university can satisfy the test and obtain tax-exempt status." ...|$|E
