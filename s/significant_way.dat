5|$|The {{movement}} of bog turtles between colonies facilitates genetic diversity. If this movement {{were to be}} prevented, or limited in any <b>significant</b> <b>way,</b> the species would have a higher likelihood of becoming extinct because genetic diversity would fall. Some aspects of a bog turtle's movement that remain unresolved include: phenomena that motivate bog turtles to move outside their natural habitat; the distances an individual {{can be expected to}} travel each day, week, and year; and how separation of small groups affects the genetics of the species.|$|E
5|$|Khánh had {{a meeting}} with Lodge in the morning of the coup for around an hour after {{arranging}} a meeting through Wilson. Due to concerns as to whether Washington would express support for the coup and what the official policy was, the meeting was not held at the embassy but at the home of Lodge's aide Dunn. However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any <b>significant</b> <b>way.</b> Khánh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Khánh wanted {{to give the impression that}} he seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a genuine and ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration.|$|E
5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour {{on the part of the}} editor, and that differed from the original published work in a <b>significant</b> <b>way,</b> could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In {{his early}} books, such as The System of Objects, For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, and The Consumer Society, Baudrillard's main focus is upon consumerism, and how {{different}} objects are consumed in different ways. At this time Baudrillard's political outlook was loosely associated with Marxism (and situationism), {{but in these}} books he differed from Karl Marx in one <b>significant</b> <b>way.</b> For Baudrillard, as for the situationists, it was consumption rather than production {{that was the main}} driver of capitalist society.|$|E

25|$|However, Mayer {{has written}} that it was {{precisely}} unions' opposition to NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor's ability to influence the debate on labor standards in a <b>significant</b> <b>way.</b> During Clinton's presidential campaign, labor unions wanted NAFTA to include a side deal to provide {{for a kind of}} international social charter, a set of standards that would be enforceable both in domestic courts and through international institutions. Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a strong voice in the negotiation process.|$|E
25|$|In Jan 1945, the 2nd Air Fleet was {{dissolved}} and {{merged with}} the 1st Air Fleet. With the merger of the two air fleets in the Philippines, Fukudome was transferred to Singapore to command the IJN 10th Area Fleet, {{which at the time}} consisted mainly of the 13th Air Fleet with 450 aircraft (mostly trainers) and the IJN 1st Southern Expeditionary Fleet (2 operational cruisers and other smaller ships). He arrived in Singapore and took over command on January 16, 1945, and remained in this role {{until the end of the}} war. Because of the American control of air and sea after the Philippines campaign, he was effectively stranded in Singapore without the ability to affect the outcome of the war in a <b>significant</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a <b>significant</b> <b>way</b> by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E
25|$|In Western Han Dynasty, {{elaborate}} and lavish burials were common practice. One reason was {{the notion of}} imperishability of the soul: {{it was believed that}} another world existed for the dead, and they needed food and accommodation just like the living. Therefore, the consecration for the dead should be the same as what was provided for the living, and all the necessities in life should be brought into the grave for use in the afterlife. The other was the emphasis on filial piety during that time. In Han Dynasty, filial piety had become an important approach to become an official, and {{elaborate and}} lavish burials are a <b>significant</b> <b>way</b> to show filial piety to one's deceased parents. These were among the main reasons why there were so many precious artifacts in Xin Zhui's tomb.|$|E
25|$|So-called {{semantic}} {{variants of}} 丟 (U+4E1F) and 丢 (U+4E22) are examples that Unicode gives as differing in a <b>significant</b> <b>way</b> in their abstract shapes, while Unicode lists 佛 and 仏 as z-variants, differing only in font styling. Paradoxically, Unicode considers 兩 and 両 {{to be near}} identical z-variants {{while at the same}} time classifying them as significantly different semantic variants. There are also cases of some pairs of characters being simultaneously semantic variants and specialized semantic variants and simplified variants: 個 (U+500B) and 个 (U+4E2A). There are cases of non-mutual equivalence. For example, the Unihan database entry for 亀 (U+4E80) considers 龜 (U+9F9C) to be its z-variant, but the entry for 龜 does not list 亀 as a z-variant, even though 龜 was obviously already in the database at the time that the entry for 亀 was written.|$|E

25|$|Membership of the Socialist Party of Great Britain {{has been}} {{conditional}} on {{acceptance of the}} Party's Object and Declaration of Principles. All applicants for membership are required to undertake a short written or verbal ‘test’ designed {{to enable them to}} demonstrate an understanding of – and agreement with – this Object and Principles and also of the Party's basic political positions not otherwise directly covered in the Declaration. There has been a sound reason for this as all members, once admitted, have full democratic rights and stand in basic equality to one another. This kind of political democracy can only work on the basis of agreement around fundamental principles and, according to the Party, there would be no point in a socialist organisation giving full democratic rights to those who, in any <b>significant</b> <b>way,</b> disagreed with the socialist case.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} ten years, the Foundation did not develop the {{property}} in any <b>significant</b> <b>way.</b> Its members were reluctant to place permanent markers and displays on it for fear of vandalism or theft. [...] In 1976, a decade after Du Bois' death, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] In 1983 the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, {{with the permission of}} the Foundation, began a series of archaeological excavations on the property, seeking to research the history of the [...] "Black Burghardt" [...] family. It already had amassed a collection of Du Bois papers. In 1987 the Foundation turned the property over to the state, with the university as its steward. The university paid {{for the construction of a}} parking area and the installation of interpretive signs.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet {{narrative}} {{was further}} strengthened in 1957, when Carlos Castillo Armas was overthrown {{and replaced with}} a highly reactionary government which further rolled back the reforms of the 1944 revolution; the administration of Dwight Eisenhower did not react to the coup in any <b>significant</b> <b>way.</b> When Richard Nixon, then US vice-president, visited Latin America in 1958, he encountered severe abuse wherever he went, even from {{people who were not}} communists or their sympathizers. PBHistory was also unable to change the strong resentment against the CIA that the Guatemalan coup had created. Writing in 2008 author Jeremy Gunn compared PBHistory to a similarly unsuccessful attempt by the US to justify the invasion of Iraq after it had occurred. Historian Mark Hove has written that [...] "Operation PBHistory proved ineffective because of [...] "a new, smoldering resentment" [...] that had emerged in Latin America over US intervention in Guatemala." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{paper has}} been {{questioned}} by palaeontologists such as Andrea Cau and Thomas Holtz, who point out that feathers in theropod dinosaurs can grow in the same {{parts of the body}} as scales (as seen in Juravenator), and thus the presence of scales does not actually eliminate the presence of feathers from that part of the body. Furthermore, feathers are delicate structures which can be very easily lost due to taphonomic factors. Paleontologist Mark Witton was warmer to the study, suggesting [...] "we have to concede a scalier appearance than many of us thought likely", while also highlighting that much remains to be determined about tyrannosaurid life appearance. Though acknowledging the role that taphonomy plays in interpreting dinosaur skin, Witton points out that the scale impressions are high quality, consistent in form across all patches, and show no obvious evidence of fibre impressions or spaces for filament attachment, despite the preservation of submillimeter scales. More variation and evidence of deformation might be expected if taphonomy had distorted the specimens in a <b>significant</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
