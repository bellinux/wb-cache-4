5|$|An {{investigation}} found several <b>shortcomings</b> in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed <b>shortcomings</b> in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E

40|$|The <b>shortcoming</b> {{of a test}} is the {{difference}} between the maximal attainable power {{and the power of the}} test under consideration. Vanishing <b>shortcoming,</b> when the number of observations tends to infinity, is therefore an optimality property of a test. Other familiar optimality criteria are based on the asymptotic relative efficiency of the test. The relations between these optimality criteria are investigated. It turns out that vanishing <b>shortcoming</b> is seemingly slightly stronger than first order efficiency, but in regular cases there is equivalence. The results are in particular applied on tests for goodness-of-fit...|$|R
50|$|The court {{emphasised}} that, {{according to}} Innes, the coming into {{being of the}} discretionary power of relaxing the principle of reciprocity has no connection whatever with the degree of <b>shortcoming</b> of the incomplete performance.

5|$|Interviews with random {{pilots in}} Widerøe {{showed that the}} airline had <b>shortcomings</b> in its {{training}} procedures, {{in part because it}} lacked a Dash 7 simulator. There was a culture in the airline to divert from cockpit procedures and cooperation. The flight plans often made procedures for mutual control of procedures impractical, and they were commonly skipped. The commission was of the impression that Widerøe's transition from an all-Twin Otter airline to also operate the more demanding Dash 7 was not properly carried out, which had resulted <b>shortcomings</b> in the training and operating procedures. All checklists during the flight were followed correctly. However, the pilots did not elect a method of double-control of the descent and approach, such as by using briefings and callouts.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} that fighter escort was inherently desirable, {{but no one}} could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability.

5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental <b>shortcomings</b> in the network system. The most fundamental {{is the lack of}} indoor coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other <b>shortcomings</b> are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E

5|$|From 1788 until 1870 {{the defence}} of the Australian colonies was mostly {{provided}} by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, {{known as the}} New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however <b>shortcomings</b> in the corps convinced the War Office {{of the need for}} a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these <b>shortcomings</b> was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units.|$|E

5|$|However, {{problems}} with the combat system, excessive noise, and engine breakdowns were recurring and appeared across the entire class. These and other <b>shortcomings</b> were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and {{who was responsible for}} solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often negative and exaggerated, creating poor public perception. This was aided by politicians, who used the <b>shortcomings</b> to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.|$|E
