50|$|Therefore, {{the first}} concept study got an {{immovable}} lens tube. The original movable <b>sliding</b> <b>tube</b> {{was one of}} the most expensive parts, because it had to be precisely manufactured on a lathe for a light tight fitting. The second concept study retained the <b>sliding</b> <b>tube</b> for the lens, but used a selenium light meter. A light meter for the accessory shoe was assigned to be built by Gossen in early 1968, but finally an uncoupled light meter was integrated in the camera housing.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the limited}} radius of {{available}} space around the fully insertable lens, {{the use of the}} normal central shutter was impossible. Therefore, Waaske proposed a new type of shutter, which was separated into two functional parts. The shutter controlling clockworks were mounted unmovable in the camera body, while the shutter lamellas were mounted in the movable <b>sliding</b> <b>tube.</b> The separate parts were mechanically coupled by shafts. Only when the shutter was cocked and therefore the lamellas were uncoupled, the <b>sliding</b> <b>tube</b> could be inserted into the housing.|$|E

5000|$|The camera {{received}} the designation Rollei B 35, with the [...] "B" [...] indicating the light meter (German: Belichtungsmesser), a slightly cheaper model, omitting the light meter, was called Rollei C 35 for compact camera. Naturally, the innards {{of the camera}} were simplified by using more plastic parts. The control wheels on the camera body were replaced by a more conventional aperture control at the lens tube, and the control wheel for exposure time was placed at the <b>sliding</b> <b>tube</b> base on the body. Thus, the fully inserted lens protruded a bit more from the camera body, {{than in the previous}} model. Both of these models offered a shutter timing range from 1/30 sec to 1/500 sec and an aperture range from f/3.5 to f/22. The focusing range reaches from 3 feet (0.9m) to infinity. Two pairs of dots on the lens barrel indicate the depth-of-field for f/8 and f/16. The so-called Zeiss formula was inspired by this camera.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{its large}} success, {{as early as}} the end of 1967 a luxury and a beginners variant of the Rollei 35 were planned. However, because of the {{production}} shift to Singapore, it was not until 1971 that the computation of a five-elements lens was assigned to Zeiss. This Sonnar f 2.8 / 40 mm lens was to be fitted with a front lens focusing control, like the Tessar, providing a similar mounting in the <b>sliding</b> <b>tube.</b> Only the two front lenses were to move when focusing. But, when finished, the lens did not focus sharply enough at close distances, and mass production had to be delayed by a whole year. The project was stopped and Zeiss designed a new lens with focusing control by moving the whole lens. Rollei's chief of development, Richard Weiß, concluded: [...] "We've got into a precarious loss-making situation because of this. The developers have learned that, in the future, they must examine lenses, even if made by Carl Zeiss, with more scepticism." [...] The tools for producing the new shuttermechanism were built by Prontor, a Zeiss subsidiary company in Calmbach, which had already taken over the manufacturing of the former shutter from Compur (another Zeiss subsidiary).|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel cluster-tube self-adaptive robot hand (CTSA Hand). The CTSA Hand {{consists}} of a base, a motor, a transmission mechanism, multiple elastic tendons, {{and a group of}} sliding-tube assemblies. Each sliding-tube assembly is composed of a <b>sliding</b> <b>tube,</b> a guide rod, two springs and a hinge. When the hand grasping an object, the object pushes some sliding tubes to different positions according to the surface shape of the object, the motor pulls the tendons tight to cluster tubes. The CTSA Hand can realize self-adaptive grasping of objects of different sizes and shapes. The CTSA Hand can grasp multiple objects simultaneously because the grasping of the hand acts as many grippers in different directions and heights. The grasping forces of the hand are adjusted by a closed-loop control system with potentiometer. Experimental results show that the CTSA Hand has the features of highly self-adaption and large grasping forces when grasping various objects.|$|E
30|$|Geometric {{accuracy}} and stability {{are critical for}} quantitative analysis from images. To avoid artefact, we used a brief sequence for MRI imaging, which generated images of a resolution more suitable for bony TT–TG measurement (Schoettle et al. 2006). In routine practice, the limb is often at rest, supported by the table, thus reducing artefact and potentially enabling longer sequences and better resolution. Such sequences might be conducive {{to the use of}} soft tissue landmarks, which are the true mechanical points of interest. However, most adolescents are normally hyperactive and not acquiescent to lying still in place {{for a longer period of}} time. Positioning an adolescent in a semi-enclosed <b>sliding</b> <b>tube</b> could pose a challenge to technicians. A technician must have time and patience to give clear instructions to the subject and ensure adequate positioning. Essential advice for imaging is to use the anatomic axial plane, and to thereby avoid errors caused by variances in extremity positioning along the plane of the table.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the study, design, {{manufacturing}} & testing of a particular scientific instrument, functional to investigate hydrostatic bushing behaviour under various experimental conditions. The job was conducted in concurrence {{with one of the}} leading companies in rotary transfer machines business. These machines are characterized by being turnkey solutions for the machining of parts requiring multi-sided machining processes and precision turning operations, starting from blanks or bar stock, for medium or high volume batch sizes. Typical rotary transfer architecture relies on a rotary table turret, where pieces to be machined are placed, rotating from one “station” to another. Each station has a particular process. Transfer machines are designed {{for a wide range of}} applications while production rate is as maximum up to 12. 000 pieces/hour, with complete retooling in less than 1 h. It must be understood that in a typical application, each station can comprise 2 - 3 machining “units” with their own spindle and its translating housing. For standardization purposes, there are a limited number of possible basic designs in machining “units”, subsequently each of them is accessorized to be functional to its target operation. Among them, one of the most prestigious is the hydrostatic unit, in which spindle assembly is contained in a <b>sliding</b> <b>tube</b> supported by a set of hydrostatic bushings. In this paper we will detail the design of a “research & test” bench whose aim is to help in developing new hydrostatic bushing systems and check production units, for quality issues...|$|E
50|$|A sackbut {{is a type}} of {{trombone}} {{from the}} Renaissance and Baroque eras, characterised by a telescopic slide that is used to vary the length of the tube to change pitch. Unlike the earlier slide trumpet from which it evolved, the sackbut possesses a double slide, with two parallel <b>sliding</b> <b>tubes,</b> which allows for playing scales in a lower range.|$|R
25|$|The 'slide', {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} trombone (cf. valve trombone), allows the player to extend {{the length of the}} air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the Renaissance, and these stockings were soldered onto the ends of the inner <b>slide</b> <b>tubes.</b> Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner <b>slide</b> <b>tubes</b> and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a ferrule to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.|$|R
