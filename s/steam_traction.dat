5|$|The GCR {{constructed}} {{an engine}} shed {{at the site}} in 1897, but it was short lived. A locomotive servicing area, consisting of a turntable and coaling stage remained in use {{until the end of}} <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> at the station in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The sole {{surviving}} {{member of}} the A3s and A1s is 4472 (60103) Flying Scotsman. The locomotive was withdrawn from service with British Railways in 1963 and after being saved from scrap it was sold for preservation to Alan Pegler. After overhaul, Scotsman worked a number of railtours, including a non-stop LondonEdinburgh run in 1968, {{the final year of}} <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> on British Railways.|$|E
5|$|This was a bold venture. Planning for the Saint-Etienne railway {{preceded the}} Liverpool and Manchester Railway, opened in 1830, {{which was used}} as the {{prototype}} by other pioneering railways, so many new technical problems had to be solved. In fact the steep section from Rive-de-Gier to Saint-Etienne was beyond the power of <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> engines of the day.|$|E
50|$|Trams in Spain {{go back to}} an animal-drawn Madrid tramway network, {{which opened}} in 1871. <b>Steam</b> tramway <b>traction</b> started in Spain in 1879, and {{electric}} trams first operated in 1899.|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} after petrol and diesel engined {{tractors}} became mainstream in England, Moreton retained a depot housing <b>steam</b> tractors (<b>traction</b> engines) but historical traction engines {{are no longer a}} feature of Moreton.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> for the foreseeable future.|$|E
5|$|The line {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 15 July 1933. The section from Haxey Junction to Epworth was closed on 1 February 1956, {{by which time}} most of the traffic was peat, supplemented by seasonal sugar-beet. The branch to Hatfield Moors was rarely used from 1962, when small diesel locomotives had replaced <b>steam</b> <b>traction,</b> and was closed on 30 September 1963. The rest of the system closed on 5 April 1965.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the station's twin towers, {{which had}} been Grade II listed in 1972, were {{restored}} in a project costing £242,000 (now £). The works revealed that the east tower still contained a large water tank which was used during the days of <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> to replenish locomotives and to power the station's hydraulic systems. The brickwork was repaired, cleaned and repointed, and the weather vanes gilded to complement the dome of nearby St Paul's Cathedral. This work {{was one of the}} Railway Heritage Trust's first projects and coincided with an exhibition held in the station in August of the same year to mark its 150th anniversary.|$|E
50|$|In {{stationary}} <b>steam</b> engines, <b>traction</b> {{engines and}} marine engine practice, {{the shortcomings of}} valves and valve gears were among the factors that lead to compound expansion. In stationary engines trip valves were also extensively used.|$|R

50|$|At the time, RENFE's {{dieselization}} program, {{with the}} 316 and 318 series CC locomotives, later {{followed by the}} more numerous 319 and 321, had displaced <b>steam</b> powered <b>traction</b> and were responsible {{for much of the}} work requiring higher-powered locomotives.|$|R
5|$|Pegler then {{persuaded the}} British Railways Board {{to let him}} run enthusiasts' specials; {{it was at the}} time the only steam {{locomotive}} running on the British Railways mainline. It worked a number of rail tours, including a non-stop London to Edinburgh run in 1968, the year <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> officially ended on BR. In the meantime, watering facilities for steam locomotives were disappearing, so in September 1966, Pegler purchased a second corridor tender which was adapted as an auxiliary water tank; retaining its through gangway, this was coupled behind the normal tender.|$|E
5|$|The Leader was a {{class of}} {{experimental}} 0-6-0+0-6-0 articulated steam locomotive, produced in the United Kingdom {{to the design of}} the innovative engineer Oliver Bulleid. The Leader was an attempt to extend the life of <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> by eliminating many of the operational drawbacks associated with existing steam locomotives. It was intended as a replacement for the ageing fleet of M7 class tank engines still in operation on the Southern Railway (SR). Design work began in 1946 and development continued after the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, under the auspices of British Railways (BR).|$|E
25|$|The 1955 Modernisation Plan {{called for}} the phasing out of <b>steam</b> <b>traction.</b> Major {{withdrawals}} occurred during 1962–1966, and <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> ended in August 1968, coinciding with the Beeching Axe.|$|E
50|$|Their {{products}} included model sailing {{boats and}} hulls, steam boats, boat fittings, stationary steam engines, marine engines, <b>steam</b> cranes, <b>traction</b> engines, <b>steam</b> fire engines, railway locomotives, railway rolling stock, track, lineside accessories, steam engine parts, boilers, and similar items.|$|R

50|$|In Britain, {{compounding}} {{was much}} more widely used on road locomotives (<b>steam</b> rollers, <b>traction</b> engines and <b>steam</b> lorries) than on rail. The usual arrangement was one high-pressure cylinder and one low-pressure cylinder (double crank compound), however a superposed Vauclain-style single crank compound type did exist.|$|R

25|$|District line steam-hauled {{services}} {{were replaced by}} electric services from 27 August 1905.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, New Zealand Railways {{were in the}} process of {{replacing}} <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> with diesel and modernising the railways to cope with vastly increased traffic, the after-effects of wartime stringency, and increasing competition from motor vehicles and aeroplanes.|$|E
25|$|Related to the <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> engine, {{the steam}} roller {{was used for}} road {{building}} and flattening ground. Typically designed with a single heavy roller (in practice, usually a pair of adjacent rollers) replacing the front wheels and axle, and smooth rear wheels without strakes.|$|E

25|$|The Vale of Rheidol Railway {{remained}} steam operated {{past the}} general end of <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> in 1968, and accordingly the three remaining Vale of Rheidol Railway locomotives received the Rail Blue colour scheme, being all blue with black smokebox and red bufferbeam, and no yellow warning panel.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{the first}} {{electric}} trains appeared in 1908, making {{the trip from}} Rotterdam to The Hague. The first diesels were introduced in 1934. As electric and diesel trains performed so well, the decline of steam started just after World War II, with <b>steam</b> <b>traction</b> ending in 1958.|$|E
25|$|In {{the steam}} {{locomotive}} era, trees and other lineside vegetation would be regularly {{cut back to}} reduce the risk of their being ignited by sparks from the locomotive. As the railways ceased to use <b>steam</b> <b>traction,</b> this maintenance was allowed to lapse, and the resulting extra growth increases the supply of leaves thereby exacerbating the problem.|$|E
50|$|Booleroo Centre {{is home to}} the Booleroo <b>Steam</b> & <b>Traction</b> Preservation Society. The society, {{developed}} from an annual rally first held in 1969, now maintains one of Australia's largest collections of tractors and steam engines along with farm and other steam equipment requiring over 2900 sqyd m2 of undercover storage space. The rally is held at the town oval the last Sunday in March.|$|R
