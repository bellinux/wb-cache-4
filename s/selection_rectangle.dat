The crop <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> now grays out the portions of an image to be removed during a crop process and displays the result area in color, instead of completely removing all portions of an image outside of the <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> from view as in previous versions of Office; images can now be repositioned underneath the <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> while it is active. A new Aspect Ratio option under the Crop command on the ribbon presents a drop-drop down menu with options for both landscape and portrait page orientations to customize the aspect ratio of the <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> before users crop an image, which automatically resizes the <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> when users start the crop process; users can manually resize the <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> and simultaneously preserve its aspect ratio by resizing it from its corners while pressing the [...] key. The aforementioned cropping improvements are also available in Publisher.|$|E

We present a novel group selection technique based on the Gestalt principles of proximity and good continuity.

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{graphical}} {{user interfaces}} support direct manipulation of objects and object groups. Current object group selection techniques such as lasso and <b>rectangle</b> <b>selection</b> can be time-consuming and error-prone. This paper presents {{a new approach to}} group selection that exploits the way human perception naturally groups objects, also known as Gestalt grouping. Based on known results from perception research, we present a novel method to group objects via models of the Gestalt principles of proximity and (curvi-) linearity. Then, we introduce several new mouse-based selection techniques that exploit these Gestalt groups. The results of a user study show that our new technique outperforms lasso and <b>rectangle</b> <b>selection</b> for object groups with an implicit structure, such as (curvi-) linear arrangements or clusters. ...|$|R
50|$|When a {{page was}} opened, it {{appeared}} zoomed-out and shrunk, and formatted {{as would be}} in a desktop browser. The user could zoom into the certain areas of the page by using a <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle,</b> and pan the zoomed-in page.|$|E
50|$|A new {{background}} removal feature {{based on}} Microsoft Research technology {{is included in}} Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word to remove the backgrounds of images inserted into documents. It is exposed as a Remove Background command that appears on the Picture Tools contextual tab on the ribbon when an image is selected. When activated this command displays a separate Background Removal contextual tab and places a <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> and magenta color over portions of the selected image. The <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> determines, based on an algorithm, which area of the selected image will be retained once the background removal process is complete, whereas the magenta color indicates the areas that will be removed. Users can manually adjust the position {{and size of the}} <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> and also mark individual areas of an image to keep or remove; it is also possible to delete a mark after an inadvertent selection or if it produces an undesired result. After the background has been removed, users can apply various visual effects to the result image or wrap text in a document around it; users can also crop the image since removing the background does not reduce its original size.|$|E
50|$|The Picture Shape {{command in}} {{previous}} versions of Office {{has been replaced}} with a new Crop to Shape command that allows users to resize and move the selected shape during the crop process. By default, Office 2010, like previous versions, automatically resizes images that are inserted into shapes, which can negatively affect their aspect ratio. To address this, images in shapes can now be cropped or resized after being inserted, and individual Fit and Fill options have been incorporated. The former option resizes the selected image so that the entire area of the crop <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> or shape is filled, whereas the latter option resizes the image {{so that it is}} displayed within the <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> or within a shape in its entirety; both options maintain the original aspect ratio of the selected image. Images inserted into SmartArt diagrams can also be cropped, resized, or repositioned.|$|E

In this paper, we propose an adaptation of regular decomposition to non supervised data classification.

30|$|The <b>selection</b> {{of empty}} <b>rectangle</b> is governed {{based on the}} {{following}} constraints: area of the rectangle to be placed is {{less than or equal}} to the empty rectangle area. Among the empty rectangle fulfilling the premier first constraint, the one is chosen with the lowest Y-coordinate The third governing criteria in the selection are that if the first constraint is satisfied and there exist say more than one empty rectangle space with the same minimum Y-coordinate. Among all, the approach selects the one with the least X-coordinate.|$|R
50|$|Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word allow {{users to}} {{immediately}} insert a screenshot of open app windows or {{a selection of}} content on the screen into documents without saving the image as a file. The functionality is exposed through a new Screenshot command on the Insert tab of the ribbon that, when clicked, presents individual options to capture either app windows or selections of content. The former option presents open windows as thumbnails in a gallery on the ribbon that insert a screenshot of the selected window into the active app, while the latter option minimizes the currently active app, dims the screen, and presents a <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> for users to create a screenshot by holding the main mouse button, dragging the <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> to a desired area of the screen, and then releasing the button to automatically insert the selection as an image into the document. Only windows {{that have not been}} minimized to the taskbar can be captured. After a screenshot has been inserted, various adjustments can be made.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of Windows XP, the C++ based software-only GDI+ subsystem was introduced to replace certain GDI functions. GDI+ adds anti-aliased 2D graphics, textures, floating point coordinates, gradient shading, more complex path management, bicubic filtering, intrinsic support for modern graphics-file formats like JPEG and PNG, and support for composition of affine transformations in the 2D view pipeline. GDI+ uses ARGB values to represent color. Use of these features is apparent in Windows XP's user interface (transparent desktop icon labels, drop shadows for icon labels on the desktop, shadows under menus, translucent blue <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> in Windows Explorer, sliding task panes and taskbar buttons), and several of its applications such as Microsoft Paint, Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, Photo Printing Wizard, My Pictures Slideshow screensaver, and {{their presence in the}} basic graphics layer greatly simplifies implementations of vector-graphics systems such as Flash or SVG. The GDI+ dynamic library can be shipped with an application and used under older versions of Windows. The total number of GDI handles per session is also raised in Windows XP from 16384 to 65536 (configurable through the registry).|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a model based on {{multilayer}} graphics for building interactive graphical applications. With this model, a variety of components of an interactive graphical editor (transient objects like the <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle,</b> selected objects, grids, cursors), {{as well as the}} handling of input events, acquire a clearer status. We show how an interactive graphical application can use layered graphics in a simple and effective way to describe direct manipulation, some graphic constraints and events handling using various input devices. By giving a clear status to abstract elements of an interactive application, the model helps to describe {{a significant part of the}} dynamic aspect of the interaction.

40|$|The {{subject area}} of time-frequency {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} creating meaningful representations of signals in the time-frequency domain that exhibit certain properties. Different applications require different characteristics in the representation. Some of the properties that are often desired include satisfying the time and frequency marginals, positivity, high localization, and strong finite support. Proper time-frequency distributions, which are defined as distributions that are manifestly positive and satisfy both the time and frequency marginals, are of particular interest since they {{can be viewed as}} a joint time-frequency density function and ensure strong finite support. Since an infinite number of proper time-frequency distributions exist, it is often necessary to impose additional constraints on the distribution in order to create a meaningful representation of the signal. A significant amount of research has been spent attempting to find constraints that produce meaningful representations. Recently, the idea was proposed of using the concept of minimum entropy to create time-frequency distributions that are highly localized and contain a large number of zero-points. The proposed method starts with an initial distribution that is proper and iteratively reduces the total entropy of the distribution while maintaining the positivity and marginal properties. The result of this method is a highly localized, proper TFD. This thesis will further explore and analyze the proposed minimum entropy algorithm. First, the minimum entropy algorithm and the concepts behind the algorithm will be introduced and discussed. After the introduction, a simple example of the method will be examined to help gain a basic understanding of the algorithm. Next, we will explore different <b>rectangle</b> <b>selection</b> methods which define the order in which the entropy of the distribution is minimized. We will then evaluate the effect of using different initial distributions with the minimum entropy algorithm. Afterwards, the results of the different <b>rectangle</b> <b>selection</b> methods and initial distributions will be analyzed and some more advanced concepts will be explored. Finally, we will draw conclusions and consider the overall effectiveness of the algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Cloning objects is {{a common}} {{operation}} in graphical user interfaces. One example is calendar systems, where users commonly create and modify recurring events, i. e. repeated clones of a single event. Inspired by the calendar paradigm, we introduce a new cloning technique for 2 D drawing programs. This technique allows users to clone objects by first selecting them and then dragging them to create clones along the dragged path. Moreover, it allows editing the generated sequences of clones similar to the editing of calendar events. Novel approaches for the generation of clones of clones are also presented. We compared our new clone creation technique with generic duplication via copy-and-paste, smart duplication, and a dialog driven technique on a standard desktop system. The {{results show that the}} new cloning method is always faster than dialogs and smart duplication for most conditions. We also compared our clone editing method against rectangular selection. The results show that our method is better in general. In situations where <b>rectangle</b> <b>selection</b> is effective, our method is still competitive. Participants preferred the new techniques overall, too...|$|R
40|$|Multi-point {{interaction}} tasks {{involve the}} manipulation of several mutually-dependent control points in a visual workspace – for example, adjusting a <b>selection</b> <b>rectangle</b> in a drawing application. Multi-point interactions place conflicting requirements on the interface: the system must display objects at sufficient scale for detailed manipulation, but it must also provide an efficient means of navigating from one control point to another. Current interfaces lack any explicit support for tasks that combine these two requirements, forcing users to carry out sequences of zoom and pan actions. In this paper, we describe three novel mechanisms for view control that explicitly support multipoint interactions with a single mouse, and preserve both visibility and scale for multiple regions of interest. We carried out a study to compare two of the designs against standard zoom and pan techniques, and found that task completion time was significantly reduced with the new approaches. The study shows the potential of interfaces that combine support for both scale and navigation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} various {{hitting and}} piercing {{problems for the}} family of axis-parallel rectangles induced by a point set. Selection Lemmas on induced objects are classical results in discrete geometry that have been well studied and have applications in many geometric problems like weak epsilon nets and slimming Delaunay triangulations. Selection Lemma type results typically bound {{the maximum number of}} induced objects that are hit/pierced by a single point. First, we prove an exact result on the strong and the weak variant of the First <b>Selection</b> Lemma for <b>rectangles.</b> We also show bounds for the Second Selection Lemma which improve upon previous bounds when there are near-quadratic number of induced rectangles. Next, we consider the hitting set problem for induced rectangles. This is a special case of the geometric hitting set problem which has been extensively studied. We give efficient algorithms and show exact combinatorial bounds on the hitting set problem for two special classes of induced axis-parallel rectangles. Finally, we show that the minimum hitting set problem for all induced lines is NP-Complete...|$|R
40|$|Selecting {{groups of}} objects is a {{frequent}} task in graphical user interfaces since it precedes all manipulation operations. Current selection techniques such as lasso become time-consuming and error-prone in dense configurations or when the area covered by targets is large or hard to reach. Perceptual-based selection techniques can considerably improve the selection task when the targets have a perceptual structure, driven by Gestalt principles of proximity and good continuity. However, current techniques use ad hoc grouping algorithms that often lack evidence from perception science. Moreover, they do not allow selecting arbitrary groups (i. e. without a perceptual structure) or modifying a selection. This paper presents a domain-independent perceptual-based selection technique that addresses these issues. It is built upon an established group detection model from perception research and provides intuitive interaction techniques for selecting (whole or partial) groups with curvilinear or random structures. Our user study shows that this technique not only outperforms <b>rectangle</b> <b>selection</b> and lasso techniques when targets have perceptual structure, but also it is competitive when targets have arbitrary arrangements...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the variation characteristics of rapid light-response curves of wheat leaves infected with powdery mildew. According to the heterogeneity between two selection patterns of area of interest (AOI), determination of fluorescence induction parameters and fitting of rapid light-response curves were conducted based on fluorescence imaging system in wheat powdery mildew experimental plots. The results showed that relative electron transport rate rETR was reduced {{with the increase of}} disease severity level; rETR of the <b>rectangle</b> <b>selection</b> pattern was relatively low. Specifically, the reduction in rETR is mainly influenced by the decrease of absorption coefficient Abs. Among fitting parameters of rapid light-response curves, the potential and the maximum relative electron transport rate, initial slope, light suppression parameter and semi-saturation intensity were reduced with the increase of disease severity level; the heterogeneity of fitting parameters between two selection patterns reflected the “critical state” of leaf fluorescence characteristics. Infected leaves at severe level (80  %) had relatively low light-harvesting capacity and tolerance to strong light, which easily caused light inhibition. According to the lateral heterogeneity analysis of photosynthesis of wheat leaves infected with powdery mildew, there was relatively high heterogeneity between fluorescence parameters of wheat infected leaves, especially in leaves with lesions on the surface...|$|R
