5000|$|A {{decision}} {{was taken in}} the 1960s to replace the ferry service: two bridges would be built. One crossing the Cleddau river and a smaller bridge crossing the Westfield Pill creek. Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners and Freeman Fox and Partners (now part of Hyder Consulting) were appointed as joint consulting engineers and the contract to build the bridge was awarded to A.E. Farr Limited in September 1968 for £2.1 million.The bridge {{was expected to be}} completed by March 1971, however on 2 June 1970 a 70 m cantilever being used to put one of the 150-tonne sections into position collapsed on the Pembroke Dock-side of the estuary. Four workers died and five were injured. Construction was halted until October 1972. The Merrison Committee of Inquiry into the Design and Erection of Steel Box Girder Bridges concluded that the cause of the collapse was the inadequacy of the design of a pier support diaphragm (a diaphragm of half the designed thickness was used), but considered [...] "the failure of <b>site</b> <b>organisation</b> between the parties as of more general significance". The committee believed that the only relevant Code of Practice relating to the design of steel bridges in the UK was inadequate for applications such as the Cleddau Bridge, and they implemented Interim Design and Workmanship Rules. These rules lay the groundwork for a new British Standard covering box girder bridge design. As of 2007, the collapse during construction is regarded as the last major bridge disaster in the UK.|$|E

To test our hypotheses, we developed a new 13 -item measure of perceived fear in organisations and tested it in 20 <b>sites</b> across two <b>organisations</b> (N ≡ 209). Culture variables measured were innovative leadership culture, and communication culture.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about the {{organization}} and management of a construction site. The original project is {{the construction of the}} Central Station, high-speed line Madrid- Barcelona-French border. Because of the magnitude of the work, has been determined to split the building site into two phases. In a first phase, carrying out the works relating to access to the station and car park, in a second phase, the works related to the railway station and the platform. In the following thesis it will be described all the works previous to the construction of the central station. That works include the fencing around the construction site, the implementation of all the facilities necessary for the main works, the construction of the temporary roads and dimensioning of temporary objects on the building-site. Furthermore, in the thesis there is list of measurements of the building-site organisation and a list of mechanisation, equipment and workers and safety regulations.

We build a sequential discrete choice model for web site outputs. Explanatory variables set includes a number of visited pages, seconds spent on the web site, and dummy variables for specific pages visited (a page with prices information, a portfolio page). Also we investigate an influence of search engines (Google, Yahoo, MSN), which refer a visitor to {{a corporate}} web site and keywords used for pay-per-click advertising campaigns.

40|$|This {{document}} {{relates to}} the validation procedure for the Politecnico di Torino “Progetto Raddoppio”. In Italy, following the introduction of European regulations and current national legislation, validation management of the “construction process” is acquiring strategic value and aims to reduce problems encountered at works completion stage. In most cases at present, validation is via formal documentation control by the purchaser, whereas in other cases such as this, validation is performed by an external authority and involves systematic project and contractual document monitoring. The final validation management report should cover the entire procedure, from preliminary to executive project design. In the case study, the validation procedure was applied only in the executive design stage, and therefore the problems encountered as indicated under “observations” mainly relate to typical aspects concerning this project stage, e. g. technological difficulties and those relating to works management and construction <b>site</b> <b>organisation</b> (work safety management and environmental impact management). This document aims to clarify observations recorded in the validation procedure, explaining how these influenced the technological choices and works management aspects in the executive stage, including safety management, regarding both operators and environmental impact...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{availability}} of various control techniques and project control software many construction projects still do not achieve their cost objectives. Research in this area so far has mainly been devoted to identifying causes of cost overruns. The earned value is a leading technique in monitoring and analyzing project performance and project progress. Although, it allows exact measurement of project progress, and can uncover any time and cost deviations from the plan, its capability in reporting accepted level of deviation is not well studied. There is limited research geared at studying factors inhibiting the ability of contractors to effectively control their projects. To fill this gap, a survey was conducted on 22 construction project organisations. It was noted that most project managers and contractors in Egypt find difficulty in controlling project costs due to problems which include Change order, Changes in the design, Errors in the design, current economic situation deterioration, Delay project and Rising prices of materials. The study was able to establish that the problem was actually not the techniques to use but rather the {{lack of knowledge of}} the techniques, the poor management of the cost control methodology, and the general poor <b>site</b> <b>organisation</b> and inadequate supervision. In addition, the main object {{of this study is to}} demonstrate the use o...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the attitude towards the use of social networking <b>sites</b> for trip <b>organisation</b> and its precursors. Problem investigated: Tourism organisations and destination policy makers need to understand factors that influence tourist use of social networking <b>sites</b> for trip <b>organisation</b> in order for them to be able to effectively utilise social networking sites. Methodology: The methodological approach followed was exploratory and quantitative in nature. Data was collected from a total of 340 respondents using a structured questionnaire. Structural equation modelling through the use of Partial Least Squares was for data analysis. Findings and Implications: The results show that attitude towards the use of social networking <b>sites</b> for trip <b>organisation</b> is affected by perceived benefits, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control, with perceived usefulness having the greatest influence. The implication is that managers of tourism organisations need to ensure that their sites are informative, easy to use, and able to safeguard users’ online privacy if they are to attract more and loyal users to their sites. Value of the research: Very little research in the South African context exists with specific reference to how social networking sites are being utilised for trip organisation. This article contributes by unravelling factors which influence the usage of social networking <b>sites</b> for trip <b>organisation.</b> Conclusion: Perceived usefulness measured by functional benefits and social benefits is the key factor which influences attitude towards the use social networking <b>sites</b> for trip <b>organisation.</b> It is the responsibility of destination marketers to provide all the necessary or valuable information on their social networking site accounts, in order to encourage travellers to use social networking sites...|$|R
