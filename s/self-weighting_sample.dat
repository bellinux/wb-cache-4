The sample was a <b>self-weighting</b> <b>sample</b> of households in the East Bank of Jordan, and all ever-married women 15 - 49 in these households were selected as respondents. Out of a total of 6, 068 housing units visited, 5, 049 households were interviewed and 3, 939 individual interviews were obtained, representing a completion rate of 93 percent of all potential respondents...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program (NFNAP) was {{implemented}} in 1997 as a collaborative food composition research effort between USDA and NIH. The {{goal of this}} program is to obtain nationally representative estimates of the nutritional components of important foods consumed in the US {{for inclusion in the}} USDA National Nutrient Databank System; to date, analytical food composition data generated for over 1800 foods have vastly improved overall data quality in the database. The NFNAP sampling approach was updated in 2001 using 2000 US Census data and recently updated to use 2010 Census population estimates. This design, like the 2001 design, employs a three-stage, stratified, probability-proportional-to-size (PPS) sample selection process; 1) county selection (based on population density); 2) supermarket outlets within selected counties (based on annual sales); and 3) specific brands of foods (based on market share data). In the first stage, Census regions (4), divisions and states were used to obtain a <b>self-weighting</b> <b>sample</b> of population centres, ensuring geographic dispersion across the 48 conterminous states; 48 locations were selected, with nested subsets of 24, 12 and 6 locations. Due to demographic changes in the population and congressional redistricting it was necessary to revise the sampling scheme to reflect these changes. With the increased penetration of warehouse-type retail outlets into the grocery industry, the sampling frame must be adjusted to include these purchase locations. Food samples which are collected nationally according to a statistically rigorous sampling approach are consistent with national representativeness and allow better estimates of the mean and variability than convenience sampling or less rigorous options...|$|E
40|$|The National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program (NFNAP) was {{designed}} in 1997 to develop robust and nationally representative {{estimates of the}} mean nutrient content of important foods in the food supply and significantly {{improve the quality of}} food composition data in the US Department of Agriculture’s National Nutrient Databank. The underlying aims defining the process behind the NFNAP are: (1) evaluation of existing data; (2) identification of Key Foods and nutrients for analysis; (3) development of nationally based sampling plans; (4) analysis of samples; and (5) compilation and calculation of representative food composition data. Supported by a <b>self-weighting</b> stratified <b>sampling</b> design, the NFNAP approach has been applied to other sampling programs for the analysis of specific nutrients (e. g., fluoride-containing beverages and foods) and ethnic foods (e. g., American Indian foods). For select nutrients of potential health significance, additional sampling approaches allow for the estimation of serving-to-serving variability (e. g., highly processed foods). Under NFNAP, over 500 foods of the targeted 1000 important foods in the US food supply have been analyzed. Unrivaled research on food sampling, sample handling, and analytical methodology (e. g., for study of perishable nutrients in fresh produce) is integral to this effort. The NFNAP data are current, reflective of the market and nationally representativ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{operator}} entry in Iowa farming {{reported in this}} bulletin had two primary objectives: (1) to establish a benchmark for analyzing posting, {{the conditions under which}} they achieved entry and the financial results experienced during the initial year of operation. A series of follow-up studies of the same group is planned for future years. Data for the current study were obtained by personal interview from a sample of farm operators who entered farming in 1959 and 1960. The sample of entrants was obtained from a state-wide sample survey involving nearly 7, 000 farm operators. It was based on a <b>self-weighting</b> single-stage <b>sample</b> of area segments drawn at random from a universe defined as the open-country zone of Iowa by the current Master Sample materials. Entrants were classified into two groups: beginning entrants and other entrants. The beginning-entrant group consisted of persons who had never farmed before the year of entry and persons who had farmed before the year of entry but had disposed of their farming assets with the apparent intent of permanent withdrawal. Other entrants consisted of persons who had farmed during an earlier period but had temporarily withdrawn from farming (retained their farming assets) with the apparent intent of re-entering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} three {{statistical sampling}} approaches for regional soil monitoring, a design-based, a model-based and a hybrid approach. In the model-based approach a space-time model is exploited to predict global statistical parameters of interest {{such as the}} space-time mean. In the hybrid approach this model is a time-series model of the spatial means. In the design-based approach no model is used: estimates are model-free. Full design-based inference requires that both sampling locations and times are selected by probability sampling, whereas the hybrid approach requires probability sampling of locations only. In a case study on soil eutrophication and acidification, a rotational panel design was implemented with probability sampling of locations and non-probability sampling of times. The hybrid and model-based predictions of the space-time means and trend of the mean for pH and ammonium at three depths in the soil profile were very similar. For pH the standard errors of the space-time means were about equal, but for ammonium the full model-based predictor was more precise than the hybrid predictor. For soil monitoring I advocate the selection of sampling locations by probability sampling so that the statistical inference approach is flexible. Selecting locations by a <b>self-weighting</b> probability <b>sampling</b> design ensures that the model-based predictor is not affected by selection bias...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{people of}} any age are {{susceptible}} to HIV, youths aged 15 – 24 face disproportionate risk of contracting it because of challenges that they face with regard to correct HIV and AIDS related knowledge, attitudes and practices. This study was aimed at determining whether HIV and AIDS can be fought by targeting interventions at youths aged 15 – 24 years by assessing their current knowledge, attitudes and sexual behaviours in Zambia.   Methods: The study utilised secondary data from a <b>self-weighting</b> nationally representative <b>sample</b> of the 2009 Zambia Sexual Behaviour Survey. Results: Generally correct comprehensive knowledge is very low among youths (43 percent). This is in spite having good command of general and full general knowledge and the ABCs of HIV and AIDS prevention. Attitudes towards PLHIV, Condom use and HIV counselling and testing were negative. About one third (58 percent) of youths in Zambia {{have a history of}} early sexual debut (sex before age 15) with more females (64 percent) than males (51 percent) having hard sex. Male youths {{were more likely to have}} used a condom with most recent sexual partner as compared to females (AOR= 0. 265, 95 %CI: 0. 160, 0. 438; p< 0. 001). Youths in rural areas had reduced odds of using a condom during their first sexual intercourse compared with those in urban areas (AOR= 0. 530, 95 %CI: 0. 387, 0. 726; p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Therefore, it can be seen lack of comprehensive correct knowledge, gender disparities, poor educational levels, youth’s age and place of residence are some of the contributing factors that may hinder the fight against HIV/AIDS among youths in Zambia.

40|$|A {{demand to}} use mud as fill {{material}} for land reclamations has emerged {{over the past}} years. Such reclamations start with pumping a muddy suspension into an area enclosed by dikes. The particles in suspension then settle to form a mud layer, so that the supernatant can be removed. This filling process may be repeated several times to completely fill the reclamation area. In 2016, an {{example of such a}} reclamation will be constructed in the Markermeer, the Netherlands. To make this work, it is essential to know the timescale of deposition and the properties of the formed soft mud layer. Formation of mud layers takes place in two steps. First, particles settle from a mud suspension and secondly, self-weight consolidation of a soft mud layer occurs. The goal of this thesis is to gain more understanding of factors influencing these two steps. More specifically, factors which are studied are the composition of the solid particles and the chemical composition of the water, together forming the mud mixture. Natural mud consists of different particles. Of these different particles, the clay particles are affected by the chemical composition of the water. This is because clay particles have a large specific surface area and surface charge, causing electrostatic interactions between them. The specific surface area and surface charge also mainly determine the plasticity of mud/soil. Under certain circumstances, clay particles flocculate, thereby forming flocs. Flocs settle more rapid than the individual particles, eventually forming a bed. Because these flocs contain large amounts of water, the formed beds are also very soft. The amount of water contained in the flocs is directly influenced {{by the size of the}} flocs (Winterwerp and van Kesteren, 2004) and the rate at which flocculation occurs (Mietta, 2010). The water content of the flocs also influences the settling and self-weight consolidation and thus, flocculation influences the formation of soft mud layers. From colloid chemistry, it is known that differences in the acidity of the water may influence the rate at which clay particles flocculate. To assess the impact of varying acidity on the settling and self-weight consolidation of mud, settling column experiments were set up in which the pH of the water was systematically varied. This was done for two artificial mud samples, i. e. a kaolinite and bentonite clay powder, and a natural clay sample, taken from the Markermeer. For the natural clay sample, the initial concentration was also varied. From the experiments, it can be concluded that there is an influence of pH on the settling and self-weight consolidation of mud, but mainly for samples with high to extremely high plasticities. For the kaolinite, a low plasticity mud, the effect of pH is rather limited. Hence, the influence of pH on the settling and self-weight consolidation of mud decreases with decreasing plasticity. This can be understood from a soil mechanical point of view: the factors determining the plasticity, namely the specific surface and surface charge, also directly determine the amount of electrostatic interactions between the clay particles. If the electrostatic interactions between clay particles in itself are small, their behaviour is also not noticeably altered by varying the suspension pH. For the natural sediment sample, containing large amounts of calcium carbonate, addition of hydrochloric acid is neutralized due to dissolution of calcium carbonate. However, the dissolution of calcium carbonate also leads to a release of Ca 2 + ions, which also has a profound impact on flocculation. Because of the large neutralizing capacity of both the fresh water and the natural mud sample, no large changes in acidity are expected in the Markermeer environment, in spite of the presence of pyrite in the Markermeer bed. This confirms findings by Saaltink et al. (2016). The mineralogy of the present clay minerals exerts a much larger influence on the settling and self-weight consolidation process than suspension pH, which is reflected by large differences in gelling concentration and consolidated volumes between the three different mud <b>samples.</b> <b>Self-weight</b> consolidation marks the transition between fluid and soil mechanics. In fluid mechanics it is common to use the concentration or density to characterize mud layers. However, it is the relative water content of a suspension or mud layer, rather than the absolute water content (cf. density), that determines its settling and self-weight consolidation behaviour. This relative water content is given by the Liquidity Index, that is obtained by normalizing the water content of a suspension or muddy layer by its Atterberg Limits. Using the Liquidity Index enables us to compare different types of mud. The gelling concentration, a state parameter which is often used in cohesive transport modelling, is also related to a material property of mud, namely the Plasticity Index. A power law relation is proposed relating the gelling concentration to the Plasticity Index. Hence, a first estimate of the gelling concentration for different mud samples can be computed based on the Atterberg Limits of a mud sample. The undrained shear strengths of the consolidated samples, obtained through a shear vane test, are related to the respective average Liquidity Indices of these beds. For the natural clay, the Liquidity Index of the settled beds appeared to give a good indication of the undrained shear strength, and shows a fair resemblance with results obtained by Locat and Demers (1988) and Houston and Mitchell (1969). Summarizing: The suspension pH influences the settling and self-weight consolidation of mud, in particular for mud with high to extremely high plasticities. This can be attributed to the surface charge and specific surface area of the clay particles. Furthermore, it is found that the Atterberg limits are valuable material parameters, also from a fluid mechanical point of view. These Atterberg Limits can serve as a tool to predict the settling and self-weight consolidation of soft muddy layers.
