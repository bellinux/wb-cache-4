[...] A two-thirds vote of all members of the legislative body of the local government is also generally required before a local sales tax measure may be presented to voters at an election.

Some worried that, since the quantity of suffering under penitentiary system would sure to far exceed that of the traditional system, Southern jurors would maintain their historic disposal toward acquittal.

5000|$|Pentagon Papers {{whistleblower}} Daniel Ellsberg said, [...] "the {{current state}} of whistleblowing prosecutions under the Espionage Act makes a truly fair trial wholly unavailable to an American who has exposed classified wrongdoing," [...] and that [...] "legal scholars have strongly argued that the US Supreme Court - which has never yet addressed the constitutionality of applying the Espionage Act to leaks to the American public - should find the use of it overbroad and unconstitutional {{in the absence of}} a public interest defense."

5000|$|In New York State, {{towns are}} {{organized}} with an elective legislative body {{known as the}} Town Board. Town government {{is run by the}} Town Board which acts as the executive, administrative and legislative body of the town. A Town Board, as a group, is the executive head of the town, there being no true executive in town government comparable with a mayor of a city or village, or with the governor of the state. While the Supervisor presides at Town Board meetings and may be assigned certain powers of administration and supervision, the additional duties and responsibilities of the Supervisor are only those which result from that position's statutory role as town treasurer. Prior to 1964, authority for Town Board action had to be in specific state legislation or in the Constitution. Since that date, however, towns have had constitutional home rule powers. Towns are able to enact local laws regarding subjects within the realm of [...] "property, affairs and government" [...] of the town, provided the laws are not inconsistent with the Constitution or a law of general statewide applicability enacted by the State Legislature. In addition, towns may adopt local laws concerning a number of other subjects specified in the Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law, so long as they are not inconsistent with general law applicable to all towns, and provided there is no <b>statutory</b> <b>restriction</b> against such local law. Since 1974, with certain exceptions, towns may even supersede some provisions of Town Law regardless of their general applicability. Besides the above described legislative powers, Town Law and other state statutes contain authority for Town Boards to act in a variety of specific areas. These have been amended over the years where Town Boards now have the authority to supply almost every public function or service that any other municipality may provide, subject to the functions specific rules and procedures. In Mendon, the Town Board consists of a Supervisor and four Town Board Members (often referred to in statutes as councilpersons). Town Board members, as elected officials of the Town, must be [...] "electors" [...] of the town at the time of election and throughout their terms of office. An elector is someone who could register as a voter in the Town, whether they actually have or not. Registration has three components - residency, age and citizenship. Residency equates to the legal term [...] "domicile" [...] and is defined in law. The age qualification is 18 and United States citizenship is also required. Mendon Town Board members have a term of four years. The Mendon Town Supervisor has a term of two years. Town elections are held in odd numbered years, with new terms starting the following January 1. The Town Board, as the executive body of the Town, acts as a unit and must function as a body. An individual Board member may not unilaterally act on behalf of the Town Board. No Town Board Member has more or less authority than any other Board member. Therefore, no Board member can legally act independently for the others or outside the Board. No single member of the Town Board can act for or commit the Board as a body to any particular program or policy. The Town Board may, by resolution, delegate to the Supervisor the powers and duties of administration and supervision of Town special improvement district functions to be performed on behalf of the Town Board. The purpose of this provision is to allow the Town to function between Town Board Meetings. This delegation does not allow the Town Board to abdicate to the Supervisor or surrender to him or her the Board's basic statutory responsibilities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} extent to which the {{peer-to-peer}} (p 2 p) file-sharing of music is a form of communication protected from the restrictions of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (U. K) (CDPA) by the guarantee offree expression enshrined in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and incorporated into domestic law through the Human Rights Act 1998 (UK) (HRA). The paper first examines the protection offered to freedom of expression through the existing copyright scheme. It is asserted that due to a lack of context-sensitivity, mechanisms such as the idea-expression dichotomy must not be relied upon to deny the existence of prima facie breaches of Article 10 (1) of the ECHR. Rather, such breaches must be acknowledged and justified (if possible) as being 2 ̆ 2 necessary in a democratic society 2 ̆ 2 under Article 10 (2) of the ECHR. Next, {{the extent to}} which p 2 p music file-sharing represents an infringement under the terms of the CDPA (exclusive of any effect of the ECHR) is examined. It is concluded that such sharing does amount to an infringement under the Act and is not subject to any of the enumerated defences. The final part of the paper explores {{the extent to which}} the <b>statutory</b> <b>restriction</b> on file-sharing of music may be permitted under Article 10 of the ECHR. It is suggested that, for a number of reasons, the CDPA 2 ̆ 7 s restriction on free expression may not be 2 ̆ 2 necessary in a democratic society 2 ̆ 2 under Article 10 (2) of the ECHR.

40|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{an equitable}} principle meant {{to prevent any}} occurrence of inequity or injustice caused {{by the action of}} the promisor in backing out from his promise, which initially led the promisee to act to his detriment.   This paper discusses the proposal to statutorily enact promissory estoppel into the Malaysian laws, which is based on three reasons: (i) to clearly define its parameters for the easier application by the courts because now that unconscionability is being the main focus in granting promissory estoppel, in lieu of detrimental reliance, the thin line surrounding its parameters are becoming more vague; (ii) to undo its limited interpretation and application as an equitable doctrine that is subject to numerous rules of equity, which may potentially arrest the development of equity and compromise the administration of justice; and (iii) to avoid  the <b>statutory</b> <b>restriction</b> imposed by Section 3 (1) of the Civil Law Act 1956, which necessitates the reception of this equitable doctrine to be subject to the exclusionary phrase stated in the beginning of Section 3 (1) denoting that its application of promissory estoppel in Malaysia can only be carried out only when there is a lacuna in such area of law...|$|E
40|$|United States v. Klein, decided during Reconstruction, was {{the first}} Supreme Court case to {{invalidate}} a <b>statutory</b> <b>restriction</b> on federal courts’ jurisdiction. It {{is the only one}} to do so by finding a violation of Article III of the Constitution. Klein has been cited in thirty-three United States Supreme Court opinions, and roughly five hundred times each by lower federal courts and law journal articles. Recent commentators have read Klein both too broadly and narrowly. Its central holding is that Congress may not grant federal courts jurisdiction to decide a set of cases on the merits while depriving them of jurisdiction to apply specified parts of the Constitution in reaching their decisions. Read through the proper interpretive lenses, Klein has a great deal more to say than this, indeed a great deal more than I thought or expressed in 1981 in the earliest comprehensive article on the case. By means of the law of judgments and preclusion, it is best explained by Congress’s lack of power to simultaneously court-strip the state as well as the federal courts of the power to enforce constitutional rights. Despite my earlier doubts and some new Klein scholarship that would read it more narrowly, Klein can best be read as more broadly prohibiting statutory interference with federal courts’ processes of fact-finding and their methods of both constitutional and statutory interpretation. These attractive readings of Klein call into question one federal post-conviction habeas corpus statute and, possibly, parts of the War on Terror, restricting the courts’ use of foreign and international law, including the Geneva Conventions. Some recent scholarship seems to read Klein too narrowly as placing no restrictions on Congress’s powers to control how federal courts interpret statutes. Other recent scholarship reads it too broadly. The latter takes its prohibitions far beyond protection of federal courts’ decision processes, seeing in Klein a holding that prohibits otherwise constitutional legislation on grounds that it would deceive the public. This attributed holding seems an unfortunate one. It would task courts with the job of requiring reasonable truth in legislation. That is a job that neither the Court at the time of Klein, nor the current Supreme Court, would relish or would be likely to find required of it by the Constitution. Beyond these issues, this Article explores the connections between Klein’s central holding against treating federal courts as puppets and the perennial debate about court-stripping; specifically, Congress’s power simply to exclude classes of constitutional claims from federal court enforcement...|$|E
