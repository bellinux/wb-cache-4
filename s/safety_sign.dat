40|$|Introduction: <b>Safety</b> <b>signs</b> provide {{information}} {{as well as}} instructions concerning the hazard or dangers in the workplace. The correct comprehension of these signs {{is very important for}} doing the necessary feedback in the specific situation which they are described.. Method and Materials: In this cross sectional study, the comprehension of 10 selected <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> were investigated in 53 randomly selected employees of an industrial company in Shiraz. The comprehension test was carried out by aid a standard questionnaire obtained from ISO 9186 - 1 : 2007.. Results: In this study the mean comprehension scores of the tested signs was 65. 95 percent with standard deviation if 28. 7. The highest and lowest comprehension scores were for “use hearing protectors” and “biological hazard” respectively. The comprehension of 40 percent of tested <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> was lower than the minimum acceptable values of ISO 3864 and ANSI Z 535. 3 standards [...] Conclusion: This study showed that there is a significant difference in comprehensions of tested <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> For full comprehension of <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> it is necessary to train the employees or adding supplementary text to the symbols in some cases...|$|R

50|$|Road {{construction}} sites are blocked-off and traffic is redirected. The sites and vehicles {{are protected by}} signs and barricades. However, sometimes even these signs and barricades can be a hazard to vehicle traffic. For example, improperly designed barricades can cause cars that strike them to roll over or even be thrown into the air. Even a simple <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> can penetrate the wind-shield or roof of a car if hit from certain angles.The majority of death in construction are caused by hazards relating to construction activity. However, many deaths are also caused by non construction activities, such as electrical hazards. A notable example of this occurred when Andy Roberts, a father of four, was killed while changing a light bulb at a construction site {{when he came into}} contact with a loose bare wire that was carrying two thousand volts of electricity and died. (August 1988 New York (U.S.A)). Events like this motivated the passing of further safety laws relating to non construction activities such as electrical work laws.|$|E

The <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> and symbols are split into categories of mandatory action signs, prohibition signs and warning symbols. Thirty <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> and symbols printed in colour and in Chinese were distributed to 560 construction personnel working in eight different construction sites in Hong Kong. The results drawn from 388 respondents indicate that substantial problems exist in comprehending the signs and symbols that are posted in construction sites. The percentages of construction personnel who correctly identified mandatory action signs, prohibition signs and warning symbols are 90 %, 61 % and 55 % respectively. Drinking habits, involvement in on-site safety promotion activities and their job positions play a determinant role in their ability of comprehending these construction safety symbols. These findings provide meaningful implications to the industry in the design, selection and positioning of safety symbols on site. <b>Safety,</b> <b>signs,</b> symbols, recognition, construction, personnel,...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Compliance with road <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> is im-portant in the {{reduction}} of motorcycle accidents. The {{aim of this study}} was to implement health education intervention and assess its impact on the knowledge of and compliance with road <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> among commer-cial motorcyclists in Uyo, Southern Nigeria. Method: This was an intervention study among motor-cyclists in Uyo, Southern Nigeria, with a control group from a similar town. The instrument of data collection was a semi-structured interviewer administered ques-tionnaire. Subjects were selected through multistage sampling method. Baseline data on compliance to road <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> was collected from both groups. Motorcy-clists in the intervention group were given education on the importance of compliance to road <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Data was subsequently collected from both groups 3 months post intervention and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 11. Result: A total of 200 respondents participated in the study, 100 from each group. Following intervention, respondents with good knowledge score increased from 21 % at baseline to 82 % at 3 months post intervention in the intervention group (p< 0. 05) and from 19 % to 21 % in the control group. Compliance score in the in-tervention group increased from 15 % to 70 % (p< 0. 05) and from 12 % to 18 % in the control group. Conclusion: A significant increase in compliance to road <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> was recorded among motorcyclists in the intervention group after safety education. All mo-torcyclists should therefore be given education on road <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> as this will improve compliance and lead to safer road use among them...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{whether or not}} training methods affected the effectiveness of symbol training {{and if there were}} any relationships between sign symbol characteristics and training effectiveness. Altogether, 26 Mainland China industrial <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> were used and 60 participants were randomly assigned into four equal-sized groups of control, paired-associate learning, recall training and recognition training. The result was that participants from all the training groups showed significantly greater improvement in comprehension performance than those in the control group, indicating that the training methods improved comprehension of the meaning of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Participants from the recall training group performed better in the post-training test than those from other training groups. It seems that the recall task elicited a deeper level of learning than the recognition task and that questioning and feedback had a positive effect on training effectiveness. The results also showed that sign characteristics had no significant influence on training effectiveness. It was concluded that recall training is more effective in enhancing comprehension of industrial <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> than paired-associate learning or recognition training. The findings of this study provide a basis for useful guidelines for designing symbol-training programmes and for designing more user-friendly <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Statement of Relevance: The present study shows that recall training was more effective in improving comprehension of industrial <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> than paired-associate learning or recognition training and cognitive sign features did not influence training effectiveness.

40|$|Department of Human and Systems EngineeringAccidents are multi-causal and can {{be caused}} by one or more factors such as human errors, machine failures, {{inadequate}} safety information, etc. Despite the fact that human errors cannot be completely prevented, various attempts had been made to minimize the likeliness of human errors, one of which is the utilization of safety signs. Consequently, it is important for safety signs to be well designed and comprehended correctly for {{them to be able to}} convey warning messages to their prospective users. Faulty <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> design could lead to increased potential risks in public places. This thesis was aimed to propose a comprehensive approach in <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluation by integrating physiological measures and nontraditional subjective measures that have not been used in previous <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluation studies, in addition to the existing subjective evaluation methods such as guessability score and cognitive sign features. The secondary objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect of cultural differences in <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> comprehension. In addition, this study also investigated the utilization of users’ feedback and ergonomic design principles in <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> redesign attempt. In total, 100 participants (forty Westerners and sixty Koreans) participated in the first major experiment which was focused on investigating cultural difference effects during <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> comprehension. A set of newly introduced water-sport safety signs was used in this study. In addition, a redesign attempt was done on the poorly comprehended signs by utilizing participants’ feedback from both groups, while taking into account ergonomic principles of good design. The second major experiment was aimed to fill the existing gaps in traditional <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluating methods, by investigating physiological measures (heart rate, eye tracking measures, EEG signal) and nontraditional subjective measurements (perceived cognitive load and compliance to ergonomic design principles) which were hypothesized to reflect cognitive load elicited by a <b>safety</b> <b>sign.</b> A total of forty two Koreans participated in this study, and two sets of frequently used safety signs (traffic signs and healthcare symbols) were used as stimuli. The first experiment results suggested that people who come from different cultural origins may have different perception and understanding regarding a set of safety signs. Therefore, findings from our first study justified the importance of designing multi-culturally compatible safety signs. Considering ergonomic design principles as well as participants’ feedback was also proven to be noteworthy in <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> redesign attempt. The second experiment provided evidences that several physiological measures such as eye tracking measures and EEG spectral power in several brain regions were able to reflect a <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> comprehensibility level in the form of cognitive load. Some nontraditional subjective measures investigated in the second experiment such as perceived cognitive load and compliance to ergonomic design principles were also able to reflect sign comprehensibility. Among the physiological measures and the nontraditional subjective measures investigated in the second major experiment, several measures such as: blinking rates, maximum and average pupil diameter, time to first fixation, EEG spectral power in prefrontal and visual cortex, perceived cognitive load, as well as compliance to ergonomic design principles were found to be consistent when applied to different types of safety signs. Consequently, we assumed that these measures could be applied across different types of safety signs. As a follow on to our study’s findings, we proposed a framework of a comprehensive <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluation utilizing the consistent measures investigated in the second major experiment, in addition to using the traditional subjective evaluation methods. We also included other factors (e. g., cultural difference, cognitive features, and ergonomic design principles) which were proven to play an important role in a <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> redesign attempt, in our proposed framework. By this, we hope to provide adequate amount of evidences concerning a particular sign’s comprehensibility level and fill the existing gaps in the traditional <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> evaluation and redesign approach. clos...|$|E

A questionnaire was used to collect data from 169 respondents, 63 of whom specifically included a swim as part of their visit to ‘The Cougal’s’. Data interpretation suggests the sign is having a positive effect on visitor awareness about the dangers of diving or jumping into natural watercourses and on some swimmers ’ risk-taking behaviour. However, data interpretation also suggests that the use of signs to promote awareness and appropriate behaviour is still imperfect. While this finding may be more to do with the risk takin...|$|E

Color conveys messages and is {{an important element in}} <b>safety</b> <b>signs,</b> as it provides extra information to users. However, very limited recent research has focused on children and their color association in the context of <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> This study thus examined how children use colors in drawing different <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> and how they associate colors with different concepts and objects that appear in <b>safety</b> <b>signs.</b> Drawing was used to extract children's use of color and the associations they made between signs and colors. The child participants were given 12 referents of different <b>safety</b> <b>signs</b> and were asked to design and draw the signs using different colored felt-tip pens. They were also asked to give reasons for their choices of colors. Significant associations were found between red and ‘don't’, orange and ‘hands’, and blue and ‘water’. The child participants were only able to attribute the reasons for the use of yellow, green, blue and black through concrete identification and concrete association, and red through abstract association. The children's use of color quite differs from that shown in the ISO registered signs. There is a need to consider the use of colors carefully when designing signs specifically for children. Sign designers should take children's color associations in consideration and be aware if there are any misunderstandings. School of Desig...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} Virtual Environments (VEs) as feasible tools for conducting <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> research. Conversely, guidelines {{on how to}} conduct such studies with workplace safety signs and older workers, is scarce. The nature {{of this study is}} justified by the fact that, as workers grow older, their ability to comply with such signs is adversely affected by age-related deficits. Therefore, the present pilot study sought to assess the quality of a VE prototype that was specifically designed to conduct <b>safety</b> <b>sign</b> research with middle-aged working adults (50 - 65 yrs). Using a work-related context, and a sample of twelve workers, the study consisted of two key moments: 1) to examine the workers’ interaction, by evaluating their behavioral compliance; and 2) to analyze their overall user experience, by assessing their subjective perceptions. In order to undergo such an evaluation, the following VE interaction issues were addressed: simulator sickness, sense of presence, level of engagement and hazard perception. Both behavioral and subjective data were gathered from three sources: observation, post-hoc questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. Results reveal that: 1) the VE's workplace safety signs were ineffective in promoting behavioral compliance; and 2) despite the occurrence of some simulator sickness, overall, participants had high levels of presence and engagement, as well as correctly perceived the VE's hazard. In conclusion, the VE prototype proved to be adequate for the study's purpose...|$|E
