50|$|With an aim to {{integrate}} our elders better in our society, Erwin {{served as the}} project convener and developed Personal Emergency Link Service in 2008. Mobile Link is effectively the outdoor version of <b>Safety</b> <b>Bell,</b> allowing senior citizens to call emergency service with one click when an accident occurs. In 2010, Personal Emergency Link Service received the Grand Prize of the Digital Opportunity Award from World Information Technology and Services Alliance.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Erwin, then Vice-president of Senior Citizen Home Safety Association, {{served as}} the Convener of “Mobile Link” and cooperated with CSL to develop Personal Emergency Link Service, also known as <b>Safety</b> <b>Bell</b> for the elderly. In the {{following}} year, Erwin was invited to join RTHK’s reality TV show “Rich Mate Poor Mate Series” to experience {{the lives of the}} underprivileged, which became the turning point of his life. [...] During the reality show, he took some freelance cleaning jobs in Tsz Wan Shan in Hong Kong, earning 50 HKD (around 6.4 USD) per day and living in a rental of 700HKD (90USD) per month subdivided apartment in Sham Shui Po for 5 days. The only thing he could bring with him was his iPhone during the 5-day experience.|$|E

5000|$|Vale were {{bottom of}} the table on 28 December 1987, and Bell sacked coach Alan Oakes, and {{promoted}} 'hard taskmaster' Mike Pejic in his stead. As the team improved to reach <b>safety,</b> <b>Bell</b> then focused his work on improving Vale Park, and announced {{the start of a}} 'five-year plan' for the stadium after decades of neglect. He purchased an electronic scoreboard for £20,000 at the Hamil Road end of the ground, and installed executive boxes bought cheaply from Newcastle United. On 20 October 1989, he sold the club's training ground for £164,800; the ground had been bought for only £13,500 eight years previously. In December, the club announced plans for a 48-seater £80,000 disabled stand, the first such construction in the Football League. In February 1989, the new family enclosure was opened, with 600 seats. On the pitch, Rudge led the [...] "Valiants" [...] into the Second Division in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 2015 Art Bell {{announced}} that his program will return to production on July 20, 2015 reborn as Midnight in the Desert. But {{it will not be}} broadcast by Sirius XM Radio; instead it will be [...] streamed live from midnight to 3:00 a.m. Eastern Time Zone, Monday through Friday, via a link on his website to the Dark Matter Digital Network or via the TuneIn app on a smartphone or tablet. The program will also be broadcast live by AM, FM, and shortwave terrestrial radio stations agreeing to his terms for relaying the Internet stream.On December 11, 2015, Bell announced that he had permanently stepped down as host of Midnight in the Desert due to concerns about his familys <b>safety</b> (<b>Bell</b> had reported multiple instances of someone shooting firearms at and near his property in the Fall of 2015).

40|$|An {{information}} appliance called PERMEX (PERsonal Medical EXpert) {{is developed}} in this project. Personal medical profile and history that {{are stored in}} a Java Card are read by PERMEX, and it uses this information to provide a carefree health care service to the user. PERMEX acts essentially like {{the combination of a}} medical expert and a personal nurse that is ready and stays with the user all the time. It provides customizable automatic medical news retrieval, drug and disease inquiry, notification of medical appointments and when medication is due, and <b>safety</b> <b>bell</b> features. A specially designed input technology is also developed to help the elderly and disabled to type effectively and efficiently...|$|E
50|$|The {{irony of}} the defense's success was {{that two of the}} Bears top {{defensive}} players, linebacker Al Harris and strong <b>safety</b> Todd <b>Bell,</b> missed the entire season due to contract disputes. Additionally, the team possessed several talented offensive players to back up their defense.|$|R
50|$|The Dolphins also {{released}} {{veteran and}} team captain strong <b>safety</b> Yeremiah <b>Bell</b> on March 19, 2012. The transaction saved the Dolphins $4.3 million in cap space, and allowed two-year safety Reshad Jones {{to move to}} the position. Bell eventually signed a one-year deal with the division-rival New York Jets on May 18, 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Jackson was a 6'6" [...] (198 cm), 220 pound (100 kg) {{shooting}} guard. Jackson {{started all}} {{four years at}} Macomber High School in Toledo, Ohio. The former McDonald's All American led Macomber to the 1989 Division I state championship over Cleveland St. Joseph. He was high school teammates with former NFL <b>safety</b> Myron <b>Bell.</b>|$|R
50|$|Llandow Halt was a {{very basic}} affair. It had two wooden {{platform}}s, each 130 feet in length. Each platform had an open-fronted wooden shelter. The crossing was at ground level and was provided with an electric <b>bell</b> for <b>safety.</b> The <b>bell</b> was operated by treadles placed on both lines 250 feet along from the crossing. Additional signals in the existing signal box had been added. The inspection of the new facilities (which did not occur until 15 October 1915) was entirely satisfied with these arrangements.|$|R
50|$|The Giants defense set {{the tone}} for the third quarter as backup <b>safety</b> Jason <b>Bell</b> intercepted Jason Campbell. Eli Manning, despite a mediocre performance, tossed a perfect six-yard play action pass to wide {{receiver}} Tim Carter extending New York's lead to 20. However, the Giants defense, which has been susceptible to giving up leads this season allowed Washington to get back into the game. After Osi Umenyiora missed a sack on Campbell, the Redskins quarterback hit Betts on fourth down for a touchdown. After a Giants punt, T. J. Duckett closed the lead to six with a one yard plunge.|$|R
50|$|During the Dolphins' Week 1 {{loss to the}} Redskins, {{starting}} strong <b>safety</b> Yeremiah <b>Bell</b> {{suffered a}} torn Achilles' tendon. As a result, he was placed on season-ending Injured Reserve on September 11. The team also waived backup defensive end Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, who did not play in the season opener. With two open spots on the 53-man roster, the team signed contracts with veteran safeties and Donovin Darius and Lamont Thompson. They were waived by the Oakland Raiders and Tennessee Titans, respectively, {{at the end of}} the preseason. The same day, rookie linebacker Kelvin Smith, who was waived four days earlier, was re-signed to the team's practice squad.|$|R
5000|$|Bobby Driscoll as Peter Pan: The boy {{who never}} grows up. Like Tinker Bell, Peter {{can be very}} hot-headed. He is also commanding, but very brave. Peter can be quite mean at times (for instance, {{laughing}} at Wendy as the mermaids nastily tease her). Despite this, he is caring, {{especially when it comes}} to Tinker <b>Bell's</b> <b>safety.</b> He finds enjoyment in fighting Captain Hook, and was responsible for the loss of his left hand. He was modeled by Roland Dupree.|$|R
50|$|Another famous heist saw DePauw {{students}} {{stealing the}} bell from themselves. In 1967, {{concerned about the}} <b>safety</b> of the <b>Bell</b> from Wabash kidnappers, a group of DePauw students stole the bell from its resting place and buried it in the north end zone of DePauw's Blackstock Stadium. Very few students knew of its location, and many mistakenly believed it had been kidnapped by Wabash students. The Bell was unearthed on game day and Wabash wound up leaving with the trophy after a 7-0 victory on the muddy turf.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief summary}} of the work carried out by SSRC and Brookes <b>Bell</b> <b>Safety</b> at Sea within the EC-funded project GOALDS {{on the development of}} a new formulation for assessing the survivability of damaged ships in waves. The proposed formula is meant to be an alternative or replacement to the s-factor in use within the current SOLAS regulations for probabilistic damage stability.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} some {{intervention}} methodologies for tower structures {{belonging to the}} architectural Italian heritage, aimed to {{the reduction of the}} collapse risk under normal and exceptional loads. Then the special investigation for evaluation of the structural <b>safety</b> of the <b>bell</b> tower of Palermo Cathedral and the following collapse risk mitigation are described. First through the paper the history of the tower is presented then in situ and laboratory tests are described. The interventions adopted after the investigation are discussed and finally the dynamic tests for the validation of the analytical model used in the assessment of the seismic vulnerability are showed...|$|R
5|$|The Buccaneers almost {{exceeded}} their worst-ever loss, a 42–0 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers, on its 10th anniversary. They {{were shut}} out until the fourth quarter, and only scored when Chicago Bears <b>safety</b> Todd <b>Bell</b> intercepted a Steve Young pass and lateraled it to Mike Richardson, who attempted to lateral it to Shaun Gayle, only to have Tampa Bay receiver Vince Heflin intercept the lateral and run it in for a score. Mike Tomczak ran for the Bears' first score. Later, a Walter Payton touchdown was called back on a holding penalty. The Buccaneers stopped the Bears on fourth-and-1, but an offside penalty on Craig Swoope gave the Bears another chance. Tomczak fumbled, however, causing him to be benched in favor of Doug Flutie. Flutie scored two touchdowns, one passing and one running, before Tomczak returned in the second half. Tampa Bay scored a second time on Young's 14-yard pass to Calvin Magee, but Lew Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. Magee's 143 receiving yards remain (as of 2009) the Buccaneers' single-game record for a tight end.|$|R
50|$|On November 30, 2014, Bell had a season-high eight receptions for 159 {{receiving}} yards while also accounting for 21 carries, 95 rushing yards, and a rushing touchdown in a 35-32 {{loss to the}} New Orleans Saints. The next game, he carried the ball 26 times for 185 yards and made six catches for 50 yards while also scoring three total touchdowns in a 42-21 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Bell tied Walter Payton for most consecutive games with 200 or more yards from scrimmage with three after his performance against the Bengals. On December 29, Bell was injured against the Cincinnati Bengals as he hyperextended his knee when being tackled by <b>safety</b> Reggie Nelson. <b>Bell</b> didn’t play against the Ravens in the Wild Card round of the 2014 playoffs, so the Steelers signed veteran and former Cleveland Browns' running back Ben Tate.|$|R
25|$|Four {{plays into}} the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide {{receiver}} Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain {{to put the}} Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31–28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38–28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, <b>safety</b> Yeremiah <b>Bell</b> sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 {{to set up a}} 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41–28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48–28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7–4.|$|R
40|$|Changes in bird {{populations have}} been {{recognised}} as affecting {{the risk to}} aircraft of a bird strike. However, in terms of bird strike prevention, changes are generally only considered {{at the local level}} i. e. reducing the number of birds on the airfield. At a national level, concern has been expressed about recent increases in waterfowl, particularly geese, and the implications that this may have for flight safety, and management of the risk. However, although work is currently being undertaken to investigate if higher numbers of large waterfowl are causing an increased risk to <b>safety</b> (Allan, <b>Bell</b> 2 ̆ 6 Jackson in press), the work is being hampered by incomplete reporting, and lack of information on world-wide population trends. There has been little discussion of the implications of declining populations to the bird strike risk. This is in part because it is not perceived as a problem. However, {{it could be argued that}} if the risk is not recognised to have changed, then resources will continue to be allocated to try and deter a species from using airfields, which no longer warrants a high priority because of its declining numbers. Through this, it has been assumed that an increase in population will lead to an increase in risk and that a decrease in population will lead to a reduction of risk. However, birds are not randomly distributed across the countryside, and there may be behavioural factors which mean that this is not the case. The Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) is a wader species commonly found on UK airfields. Because of its size, and its habit of forming large flocks, it is usually considered as a particularly hazardous species. It is also frequently involved in bird strikes and for the years 1976 - 1995 was the most commonly struck species in the UK. Between these years 1704 strikes were reported in the UK, comprising 17. 4...|$|R
2500|$|The {{reality in}} the bell-chamber {{is a very small}} and roughly-finished room, only {{partially}} protected from gales by louvred, unglazed windows on all sides. A massive and braced hardwood frame fills the room completely from west to east. The frame is over [...] high and is smooth and polished to the touch. On the south and north sides there are narrow squeeze spaces of about [...] between the frame and the wall. There is no aid to access {{to the top of the}} frame. The wheels of the top tier of bells project above the frame. The frame exactly fits the room, and the bells exactly fit the frame, but only because their wheels are arranged in different directions to allow fit. Access to the roof would require a slim and agile climber who would then climb a ladder, and from the ladder lift and slide with one hand a very heavy insulated trapdoor. The trapdoor is weatherproofed by being shaped to overhang the lips on which it is seated. The survival of the frame and consequently the <b>safety</b> of the <b>bells</b> depends on the condition of this trapdoor and the roof. It is likely that the tower's floors were installed after hanging the bells: the frame could then be built in place, the bells winched from the floor of the tower, and the floors would then be put in. Winching the bells up through the tower would require a massive beam across the tower roof to support the pulley; no such beam exists now.|$|R
