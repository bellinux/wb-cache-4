25|$|Max Weber {{and some}} schools of {{modernization}} theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence {{that suggest that}} values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement {{into and out of}} poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who live in it. The Great Smoky Mountains <b>Study</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> ten-year study that was unexpectedly able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Swiss {{pharmacologist}} Peter N. Witt {{started his}} research {{on the effect of}} drugs on spiders. The initial motivation for the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> request from his colleague, zoologist H. M. Peters, to shift the time when garden spiders build their webs from 2am–5am, which apparently annoyed Peters, to earlier hours. Witt tested spiders with a range of psychoactive drugs, including amphetamine, mescaline, strychnine, LSD, and caffeine, and found that the drugs affect {{the size and shape of}} the web rather than the time when it is built. At small doses of caffeine (10µg/spider), the webs were smaller; the radii were uneven, but the regularity of the circles was unaffected. At higher doses (100µg/spider), the shape changed more, and the web design became irregular. All the drugs tested reduced web regularity except for small doses (0.1–0.3µg) of LSD, which increased web regularity.|$|E
25|$|Artistic ability {{was defined}} as a {{combination}} of shitsuga (質画) and gakuga (学画): innate and learned painting skill. Pupils entered workshops as children, based not primarily on talent, but on status. Some studios strictly policed students’ leisure activities, such as drinking and socializing, which was facilitated by the fact that pupils traditionally lived-in as uchi deshi. <b>Study</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> serious, time-consuming endeavor: “the successful student spent years in training, a time during which he developed physical stamina, self-discipline, perseverance, the ability to earn for himself, facility in technical skills, and a good understanding of the aesthetics and spiritual considerations required of a dedicated painter.” Most studied for over ten years before being allowed to graduate, if they were allowed to graduate. Apprenticeship began with menial tasks and “unobtrusive observation.” As pupils worked their way up to the rank of head students (deshi gashira), their relationship to their mentors was comparable to that of retainer to lord. Though seniors were usually referred to as sensei (teacher), some pupils addressed their instructors as tonosama, an honorific title for a feudal lord.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), {{the federal}} agency {{responsible}} for funding health research, recommended in 2010 against funding a pan-Canadian trial of liberation therapy {{because there was a}} lack of evidence on the safety or efficacy of the procedure. It suggested a scientific expert working group made up of the principal investigators for the seven MS Society-sponsored studies. The health minister accepted the CIHR recommendation and said that Canada was not going to fund clinical trials. The expert panel was created by the end of 2010 together between the CIHR and the MS Society of Canada. It has been proposed that the creation of this expert panel was partly directed to cope with the high levels of social pressure the CCSVI theory had raised and at the same time try to maintain a scientific perspective in the funding and investigation of CCSVI. The main task of the panel was to monitor the results of the ongoing studies in the relationship between CCSVI and MS and recommend the funding of a clinical trial in case that there was evidence of a true relationship between the two. In 2011, the Canadian federal government announced that they would fund clinical trials of the procedure to widen the veins since CIHR considered that evidence of venous abnormalities in MS was enough for small treatment trials. It has been proposed that the recommendation to fund phase I and II trials instead of a big <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> compromise between the high levels of social and political pressure and the low level of evidence on the theory.|$|E

2500|$|Placebos used in {{clinical}} trials have sometimes had unintended consequences. A report in the Annals of Internal Medicine that looked at details from 150 clinical trials found that certain placebos used in the trials affected the results. For example, one study on cholesterol-lowering drugs used olive oil and corn oil in the placebo pills. However, according to the report, this [...] "may lead to an understatement of drug benefit: The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids of these 'placebos,' and their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, can reduce lipid levels and heart disease."
