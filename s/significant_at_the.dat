5|$|All NHLs {{are also}} {{included}} on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a list of historic properties that the National Park Service deems to be worthy of preservation. The NHLs in Michigan comprise approximately 2% of the 1,757 properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan as of January 2012. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP properties are deemed <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local or state level.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E
25|$|Suppose a {{researcher}} flips a coin some arbitrary {{number of times}} (n) and assumes a null hypothesis that the coin is fair. The test statistic is {{the total number of}} heads and is a two-tailed test. Suppose the researcher observes heads for each flip, yielding a test statistic of n and a p-value of 2/2n. If the coin was flipped only 5 times, the p-value would be 2/32 = 0.0625, which is not <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 0.05 level. But if the coin was flipped 10 times, the p-value would be 2/1024 ≈ 0.002, which is <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 0.05 level.|$|E

25|$|D. T. Potts, {{argue that}} the {{influence}} from the highland Iranian Khuzestan area in Susa was more <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> early period, and also continued later on. Thus, Susa combined the influence of two cultures, from the highland area and from the alluvial plains. Also, Potts stresses {{the fact that the}} writing and numerical systems of Uruk were not simply borrowed in Susa wholesale. Rather, only partial and selective borrowing took place, that was adapted to Susa's needs. Despite the fact that Uruk was far larger than Susa at the time, Susa was not its colony, but still maintained some independence for a long time, according to Potts.|$|E
25|$|Returning to the United Kingdom in 1845, Simmons {{became an}} {{instructor}} at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich with promotion to second captain on 9 November 1846.

In 1971, the United Kingdom and the United States signed a treaty, leasing the island of Diego Garcia to the US military for the purposes of building a large air and naval base on the island. The deal was important to the UK government, as the United States granted it a substantial discount on the purchase of Polaris nuclear missiles in return {{for the use of the}} islands as a base.

500|$|The {{nature of}} {{the result of the}} Battle of Gettysburg {{has been the subject of}} {{controversy}} for years. Although not seen as overwhelmingly <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, particularly since the war continued for almost two years, in retrospect it has often been cited as the [...] "turning point", usually in combination with the fall of Vicksburg the following day. This is based on the observation that after Gettysburg Lee's army conducted no more strategic offensives—his army merely reacted to the initiative of Ulysses S. Grant in 1864 and 1865—and by the speculative viewpoint of the Lost Cause writers that a Confederate victory at Gettysburg might have resulted in the end of the war.|$|E

500|$|<b>Significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 6th Congress was the generational shift {{within the}} WPK, with Kim Il-sung {{planning}} to formalize {{the position of}} Kim Jong-il. 248 members were elected to the 6th Central Committee: 145 full members and 103 candidate members. This was an increase of 76 members from the 5th Central Committee, which had 172 members. The expansion of the Central Committee {{is a sign of}} an expanding party, since one Central Committee member represents 10,000 party members. Of the 248 members, [...] "139 (60 full members and 79 candidate members)" [...] were new to the Central Committee. However, compared to previous Central Committees the replacement rate was relatively low (41.4%, compared with 72.2% at the 5th Congress). Only two members have sat on the Central Committee since the 1st Central Committee: Kim il-sung and Kim Il. The cause of the high Central Committee replacement rate had been intra-party conflict, and the Yanan, South Korean, domestic and Soviet-Korean factions (as well as ideological opponents of hereditary succession) had been purged from the Central Committee at previous congresses. Amendments to Party rules changed the name of the Political Committee back to its original name (the Politburo), and created a Presidium within the Politburo to further centralize the power of the ruling elite.|$|E

2500|$|Black {{critics in}} the 1930s wrote about the play and film The Green Pastures, but they were silent on its {{animated}} parody. Weisenfeld speculates that this is because animated cartoons were not seen as <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Modern critics of Clean Pastures fault the film for its stereotypical depictions of black culture. Cultural studies scholar William Anthony Nericcio sees the film as representative of a pattern {{in the works of}} Friz Freleng, who also produced such stereotype-ridden films as Jungle Jitters, Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears, and the Speedy Gonzales cartoons. Lindvall and Fraser are more forgiving and call the cartoon [...] "playful", [...] "light", and [...] "mischievous".|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, David Neumark and William Wascher reexamined Card and Krueger's result using {{administrative}} {{payroll records}} from {{a sample of}} large fast food restaurant chains, and reported that minimum wage increases were followed by decreases in employment. An assessment of data collected and analyzed by Neumark and Wascher did not initially contradict the Card and Krueger results, but in a later edited version they found a four percent decrease in employment, and reported that [...] "the estimated disemployment effects in the payroll data are often statistically <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 5- or 10-percent level {{although there are some}} estimators and subsamples that yield insignificant—although almost always negative" [...] employment effects. Neumark and Wascher's conclusions were subsequently rebutted in a 2000 paper by Card and Krueger. A 2011 paper has reconciled the difference between Card and Krueger's survey data and Neumark and Wascher's payroll-based data. The paper shows that both datasets evidence conditional employment effects that are positive for small restaurants, but are negative for large fast-food restaurants. A 2014 analysis based on panel data found that the minimum wage reduces employment among teenagers.|$|E
2500|$|Suppose a {{researcher}} flips a coin {{five times in}} a row and assumes a null hypothesis that the coin is fair. The test statistic of [...] "total number of heads" [...] can be one-tailed or two-tailed: a one-tailed test corresponds to seeing if the coin is biased towards heads, but a two-tailed test corresponds to seeing if the coin is biased either way. The researcher flips the coin five times and observes heads each time (HHHHH), yielding a test statistic of 5. In a one-tailed test, this is the upper extreme of all possible outcomes, and yields a p-value of (1/2)5 = 1/32 ≈ 0.03. If the researcher assumed a significance level of 0.05, this result would be deemed significant and the hypothesis that the coin is fair would be rejected. In a two-tailed test, a test statistic of zero heads (TTTTT) is just as extreme and thus the data of HHHHH would yield a p-value of 2×(1/2)5 = 1/16 ≈ 0.06, which is not <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 0.05 level.|$|E
2500|$|The 2004 tsunami helped {{trigger a}} peace {{agreement}} between the GAM and the Indonesian government. The mood in post-Suharto Indonesia in the liberal-democratic reform period, as well as changes in the Indonesian military, helped create an environment more favorable to peace talks. The roles of newly elected president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and vice president Jusuf Kalla were highly <b>significant.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the GAM leadership was undergoing changes, and the Indonesian military had inflicted so much damage on the rebel movement that it {{had little choice but}} to negotiate with the central government. The peace talks were first initiated Juha Christensen, a Finnish peace activist, and then formally facilitated by a Finland-based NGO, the Crisis Management Initiative led by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. The resulting peace agreement, generally known as the , [...] was signed on 15 August 2005. Under the agreement Aceh would receive special autonomy and government troops would be withdrawn from the province in exchange for GAM's disarmament.
