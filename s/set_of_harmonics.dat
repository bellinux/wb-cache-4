5000|$|The 01/W {{introduced}} a feature called [...] "Waveshaping". Basically {{it was a}} crude variation of Additive Synthesis. One could select a sample from the ROM Wavetable, and process it with one of 59 waveshapes. The feature would add a specific <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonics</b> to the sound depending on which type of waveshape one would select, from for instance, names like [...] "Rezzy", [...] "Parabola" [...] & [...] "Comb". The waveshaping feature could make some very interesting sonic textures as it would literally reshape the sound to fit that specific waveshape. However, the feature was discontinued on subsequent models. Original sounds were achievable but required significant experimentation, as using waveshaping on stock samples often only seemed to add distortion.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} pitch {{detection}} {{was invented by}} Martin Piszczalski in conjunction with Bernard Galler in the 1970s and has since been widely followed. It targets monophonic music. Central to this method is how pitch {{is determined by the}} human ear. The process attempts to roughly mimic the biology of the human inner ear by finding only {{but a few of the}} loudest harmonics at a given instant. That small set of found harmonics are in turn compared against all the possible resultant pitches' harmonic-sets, to hypothesize what the most probable pitch could be given that particular <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonics.</b> To date, the complete note detection of polyphonic recordings remains a mystery to audio engineers, although they continue to make progress by inventing algorithms which can partially detect some of the notes of a polyphonic recording, such as a melody or bass line.|$|E
5000|$|This tiple is {{associated}} with Colombia, and is considered the national instrument. Tiple virtuoso David Pelham has {{this to say about}} the Colombian tiple: [...] "The tiple is a Colombian adaptation of the Renaissance Spanish vihuela brought to the New World in the 16th century by the Spanish conquistadors. At the end of the 19th century, it evolved to its present shape. Its twelve strings are arranged in four groups of three: the first group consists of three steel strings tuned to E, the second, third and fourth groups have a copper string in the middle of two steel strings. The central ones are tuned one octave lower than the surrounding strings of the group. This arrangement produces the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonics</b> that gives the instrument its unique voice." [...] Outside of Colombia the [...] "copper" [...] strings {{are more likely to be}} standard brass or bronze wound steel guitar strings.|$|E

50|$|Interindividual {{differences}} {{have also been}} researched for the Tritone paradox illusion. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a half octave. Each tone is made of a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonics</b> which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to Diana Deutsch, {{the perception of the}} tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the pitch of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the pitch class with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch found that for people from California, the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern England it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups.|$|E
30|$|Qiu et al. {{improved}} on {{the idea}} of weighted mixed-tone models. However, they modeled each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonics</b> in the tone model instead of modeling each harmonic individually. They believe that although the amplitude of the notes in the signal will change, the harmonic structure of each note is unique and stable. The harmonic structure here refers to the relative relationship between the harmonics. Based on the relationship between harmonic frequencies, Qiu et al. chose to model a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonics</b> using a constrained mixed Gaussian model. It {{can be seen in the}} experiment that the constraint to be used in the system reduces the parameters to be estimated in the system. In this modeling mode, the signal model is established and finally the parameter estimation result is given based on the expectation maximization [6].|$|E

Using a representation of the wave coefficients due to Wilton, a perturbation analysis shows that the Stokes wave may become unbounded due to interactions between the $N^{th}$ harmonic of the primary wave train and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonics</b> of a disturbance. If the frequency of the $n^{th}$ harmonic is denoted $ \omega _{n} =\omega \left({ 1 \pm \delta } \right) $ then instability will occur if $$ 0 <\delta <\frac{\sqrt 2 \ k\,n^ns_n }{\left({n- 1 } \right) !} $$ subject to the disturbance initially having sufficiently large amplitude. We show that, subject to initial conditions, all lower harmonics will contribute to instability as well, and we identify the frequency of the disturbance corresponding to maximum growth rate.
