40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{research}} project at BAM various drop tests and material as well as component in-vestigations have to be performed with respect to steel <b>sheet</b> <b>container</b> drop test analysis. Both, ex-perimental and computational methods (Finite Element Analysis) are involved. Among electrical sen-sor techniques optical measurement methods capable of dynamic and static 3 D deformation analysis are applied. On the one hand this includes the Projected Fringes Method which provides a virtual digi-tal round-about model of the actual package surface shape. On the other hand there is the Stereo Photogrammetry used for high speed imaging of points rich in contrast and permanently fixed to the container while dropping. Technical features of both methods are discussed. Diverse measurement results are compared with those of alternative experimental techniques as well as numerical simula-tions...|$|R
50|$|Automated Truck Loading Systems - ATLS {{has been}} {{commonly}} used in the material handling industry {{to refer to the}} automation of loading or unloading trucks and trailers with product either on or without pallets, slip <b>sheets,</b> racks, <b>containers,</b> using several different types of automated guided vehicle systems (AGV) or engineered conveyor belt systems that are integrated into vehicles, automating the shipping / receiving and logistics operations.|$|R
50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is fed {{from the}} left side by either NATO {{standard}} disintegrating M13 (U.S.) or continuous link German DM1 belt, but only after swapping several parts in the feed block. When used in a light machine gun role, the ammunition belt is stored in a <b>sheet</b> metal <b>container</b> that has a 50-round capacity and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver. The feeding mechanism resembles the one used in the MAG machine gun (a simplified version of the MG 42's feed system) operated with a feed arm driven by the motion of the striker sleeve. The belt is fed in two stages during both the forward and rear movement of the bolt assembly.|$|R
50|$|When {{issued the}} Karabiner 98k came {{accompanied}} with assorted accessory items including a sling, a protective muzzle cover, and for field maintenance a Reinigungsgerät 34 ("Cleaning Kit 34") or RG34 kit. Introduced in 1934, the Reinigungsgerät 34 {{consisted of a}} flat 85 mm wide by 135 mm long <b>sheet</b> metal <b>container</b> with two hinged lids carried on the person, which held an oiler, a take down tool for removing the floorplate and cleaning the receiver of the rifle, an aluminum barrel pull-through chain, a cleaning and an oiling brush, and short lengths of tow used as cleaning patches. From 1905 until 1945 the German military used Ballistol intended for cleaning, lubricating, and protecting metallic, wooden and leather firearms parts.|$|R
40|$|AutoCAD to Mass Properties was {{developed}} to facilitate quick mass properties calculations of structures having many simple elements in a complex configuration such as trusses or metal <b>sheet</b> <b>containers.</b> Calculating the mass properties of structures of this type can be a tedious and repetitive process, but ACTOMP helps automate the calculations. The structure can be modelled in AutoCAD or a compatible CAD system {{in a matter of}} minutes using the 3 -Dimensional elements. This model provides all the geometric data necessary to make a mass properties calculation of the structure. ACTOMP reads the geometric data of a drawing from the Drawing Interchange File (DXF) used in AutoCAD. The geometric entities recognized by ACTOMP include POINTs, 3 DLINEs, and 3 DFACEs. ACTOMP requests mass, linear density, or area density of the elements for each layer, sums all the elements and calculates the total mass, center of mass (CM) and the mass moments of inertia (MOI). AutoCAD utilizes layers to define separate drawing planes. ACTOMP uses layers to differentiate between multiple types of similar elements. For example if a structure is made of various types of beams, modeled as 3 DLINEs, each with a different linear density, the beams can be grouped by linear density and each group placed on a separate layer. The program will request the linear density of 3 DLINEs for each new layer it finds as it processes the drawing information. The same is true with POINTs and 3 DFACEs. By using layers this way a very complex model can be created. POINTs are used for point masses such as bolts, small machine parts, or small electronic boxes. 3 DLINEs are used for beams, bars, rods, cables, and other similarly slender elements. 3 DFACEs are used for planar elements. 3 DFACEs may be created as 3 or 4 Point faces. Some examples of elements that might be modelled using 3 DFACEs are plates, sheet metal, fabric, boxes, large diameter hollow cylinders and evenly distributed masses. ACTOMP was written in Microsoft QuickBasic (Version 2. 0). It {{was developed}} for the IBM PC microcomputer and has been implemented on an IBM PC compatible under DOS 3. 21. ACTOMP was developed in 1988 and requires approximately 5 K bytes to operate...|$|R
50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one belt type to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the feed tray's cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The feed channel rail, feed link, both feed slides and the feed tray are chrome plated. The top cover body is an anodized aluminum casting. In the infantry assault role, the weapon can be fitted with a <b>sheet</b> metal <b>container</b> that houses a 50-round belt and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to {{the older}} HK21A1 and HK11A1, the modernized [...] "Export" [...] weapons feature a longer barrel shroud, {{extended}} by 94 mm towards the front, which also resulted in a longer sight radius; the barrel trunnion was modified (the HK21E also received a longer barrel); a burst fire mode was incorporated into the trigger group as the fourth selector setting (3-round burst); a polymer barrel handle was added; the rear sight was modified with an adjustable drum; a bipod with a 3-position height adjustment mechanism replaced the simple folding bipod; the feed mechanism was modified to provide continuous feeding (by moving the belt in two stages, during both forward and rear movement of the bolt), a forward assist for silent loading was provided and the machine guns were adapted to use NATO-standard optical sight mounts. When employed in the infantry assault role, the HK21E stores its ammunition belt in a 100-round <b>sheet</b> metal <b>container,</b> fastened {{to the bottom of}} the feed mechanism (as in the HK21A1). The ability to use G3 or STANAG (for HK23E) box or drum magazines is available with an optional feed module kit that consists of the bolt, recoil spring and belt feed module or magazine well. The shock-absorbing tripod weighs 10.5 kg.|$|R

40|$|An {{anisotropic}} {{constitutive model}} based on Non-Associated Flow Rule (Non-AFR), which incorporates plane stress yield functions (Hill's quadratic function [1] and Yld 2000 - 2 d by Barlat et al. [2]), was implemented to finite element codes (ABAQUS, LS-DYNA 3 D) by using User Material options. By using Non-AFR, Yld 2000 - 2 d {{is capable of}} predicting more than four ears which is possible only with Yld 2004 by Barlat et al. [3] when used with an Associated Flow Rule. A short review of the Non-Associated Flow Rule was provided. Simulation of the cup drawing process for a rigid <b>container</b> <b>sheet</b> alloy using mini-die geometry was performed to show the cup height profile (earing profile) obtained from Non-AFR. The simulation results were compared with experimental earing profile data and it was shown that the simulations using Yld 2000 - 2 d and the Non-AFR led to the excellent prediction of the earing profile...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is new building solution of a multifunctional house {{founded on the}} corner of the streets Táborská and Letní in the district Židenice of city Brno. The design is based on using a vacant lot, urban regulations, the needs for creation of student housing and the needs of residents of the particular district. The form of the object is designed in a way which abides the mass structure of the territory and also the spatial plan of city of Brno. The main aim was to use the vacant lot in the best way possible. The suggested object is divided in two functional units which this particular locality lacked and are based on structural possibilities. The public unit situated on the outer part of the object has the form of fully glazed facade, whereas the part intended for housing can be identified for the use of company Intecon galvanized copper plated trapezodial steel <b>sheet</b> residential <b>containers.</b> The area of the first floor parterre is lowered by one meter below the ground level because of a sports center with a bouldering wall. Other overground storeys consisting of residential containers operate as a place for sudent housing. Individual apartments are formed by the combination of two student rooms. The kitchen and dining room are located in the common areas on each floor of the building. The idea of materially spatial resolution is based on rotation of the cuboid residential containers by ninety degrees which allows them to fit together in a way that creates an atrium in the middle. The atrium and the sports areas are therefore lit by the accomodation areas...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} angular deficit scheme [V. Borrelli, F. Cazals, and J. -M. Morvan, Computer Aided Geometric Design 20, 319 (2003) ] to {{determine}} the distribution of Gaussian curvature in developable cones (d-cones) [E. Cerda, S. Chaieb, F. Melo, and L. Mahadevan, Nature 401, 46 (1999) ] numerically. These d-cones are formed by pushing a thin elastic sheet into a circular container. Negative Gaussian curvatures are identified at the rim where the <b>sheet</b> touches the <b>container.</b> Around the rim there are two narrow bands with positive Gaussian curvatures. The integral of the (negative) Gaussian curvature near the rim is almost completely compensated by that of the two adjacent bands. This suggests that the Gauss-Bonnet theorem which constrains the integral of Gaussian curvature globally does not explain the spontaneous curvature cancellation phenomenon [T. Liang and T. A. Witten, Phys. Rev. E 73, 046604 (2006) ]. The locality of the compensation seems to increase for decreasing d-cone thickness. The angular deficit scheme also provides {{a new way to}} confirm the curvature cancellation phenomenon. Comment: 12 pages; 5 figure...|$|R
