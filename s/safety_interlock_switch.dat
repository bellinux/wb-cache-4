40|$|The {{radiation}} <b>safety</b> <b>interlock</b> {{systems of}} the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) have been operated {{for more than a}} decade. Some modification actions have been implemented in the past to perfect the safe operation. The overall performance of this interlock system is reliable and satisfactory. The machine and its interlock system were originally designed to operate at decay mode. During decay mode injection, the safety shutters of beamlines are closed and the radiation loss is contained inside accelerator tunnel. Recently, some modification programs to change operation mode from original decay mode to top-up mode at NSRRC have initiated. For users at experimental area, the radiation dose resulted from top-up refilled injections when safety shutters of beamlines are opened will dominate. To ensure personnel radiation safety for top-up operation, the <b>safety</b> <b>interlock</b> upgrade and other action plans will be implemented. This paper will summarize the original design logic of the <b>Safety</b> <b>Interlock</b> System (SIS), its historical modifications and the new design logic to ensure radiation safety for top-up operation...|$|R

40|$|Florida International University's (FIU) Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) {{evaluated}} five saws {{for their}} effectiveness in cutting up specially prepared fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactive contaminated glove boxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Adamant circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Adamant was only used during a limited ''test'' on a regular plywood crate due to safety considerations of the tool for this application. The Adamant circular saw, a counter-rotating twin-cutter, constructed with blades that work differently than conventional cutting wheels with twin blades, each rotating in opposite directions. It is used to cut wood and metals. Each blade is approximately 8 3 / 4 inches in diameter with a maximum cutting depth of 2 1 / 2 inches. The machine has two rotation speeds: 1, 900 and 2, 900 rotations per minute (rpm). The saw is operated with an <b>interlocked,</b> guarded trigger <b>switch</b> located at the end of the saw opposite the cutting blades. To operate the saw, the <b>safety</b> <b>interlock</b> must be depressed prior to powering the saw with the trigger control. The saw is supported by a handle at the front of the saw near the cutting blades. The top part of the blades is guarded near the handle, with approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades exposed. The Adamant circular saw is an innovative technology used to cut metals and wood. Its <b>safety</b> features include: <b>interlocking</b> <b>switch</b> for powering the saw, overload indicator and shutoff, and an electronic brake that stops the engine immediately when the start button is released. The top part of the blades is guarded near the motor. With approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades open, the operator is exposed to the potential risk of serious and minor cuts and abrasions when using and handling the saw. There is also potential for damage to the blades if the saw is not stored properly. Without guarding on the lower part of the blades, these can be damaged if the saw is dropped or rested on the cutting blades. Based upon the industrial hygiene sampling conducted for the other four saws demonstrated at FIU, noise levels, nuisance dust, and airborne fiberglass may be a problem when using this technology for the cutting of fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. No industrial hygiene sampling was conducted while the Adamant saw was in use. Engineering controls should be used to eliminate these problems whenever possible. Where this is not possible, administrative controls, training, and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used. Respirators should be used if engineering controls do not sufficiently control the dust or fiberglass generated. Respirators should be equipped with an organic vapor and acid gas cartridge with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, since during the demonstration, the workers complained of an odd smell, which may have been the breakdown of the fiberglass...|$|R
