5|$|B of the Bang {{was located}} {{next to the}} City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity, in Beswick, {{at the corner of}} Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road;. It took its name from a {{quotation}} of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the 'bang' of the <b>starting</b> <b>pistol,</b> but at 'The B of the Bang'. The artwork had been nicknamed KerPlunk by the locals after the popular children's game from the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Ruske and Tiede then {{concluded}} that they were trapped, with arrest awaiting them when returning to East Germany. So they developed the plan to hijack a plane, flying to East Berlin's Schönefeld Airport, to the U.S. Air Force base at Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin. They bought a toy <b>starting</b> <b>pistol</b> in a Polish fleamarket, and then booked three tickets on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 165 from Gdańsk, Poland, to East Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Ant {{was poised}} to join the 1980s-focused Here & Now tour in January 2002, {{but was unable to}} do so after he was charged with {{throwing}} a car alternator through a pub window and then threatening patrons with an imitation firearm. The previous evening, Adam has since claimed, he had received telephone threats to himself and his young daughter from the jealous husband of a female Camden Market stallholder who had agreed to make some clothing for him. The following morning, advised by people around Camden that he would find the man in question at the Prince of Wales pub in Camden, Ant arrived there to confront his persecutor. Some of the pub patrons made fun of his appearance and told him in mocking terms that the man he was looking for was not present. Staff then asked him to leave as the premises were a private members' club. Before storming off, Ant angrily told them all that he would return. Some hours later, finding a discarded car alternator in the street, Ant threw it through the pub window. The broken glass injured a local musician. Chased through the backstreets of Camden by pub security and others, he drove them away by pulling out an old World War II-era <b>starting</b> <b>pistol,</b> once the property of his father. Returning afterwards to the main street, he was spotted by a police patrol, gun still in hand, and arrested as he tried to leave the scene {{in the back of a}} minicab.|$|E

50|$|Shooting is {{also used}} in warfare, self-defense, crime, and law enforcement. Duels were {{sometimes}} held using guns. Shooting without a target has applications such as celebratory gunfire, 21-gun salute, or firing <b>starting</b> <b>pistols,</b> incapable of releasing bullets.|$|R

When it came time to pass through the metal-detector, he pinched the top of the hat and placed both it and the hidden pistol on a table. He retrieved both prior to boarding the plane.|$|E
500|$|B of the Bang was a {{sculpture}} by Thomas Heatherwick {{next to the}} City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England, which was commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games; {{it was one of}} the tallest structures in [...] Manchester and the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of Aspire in 2008. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie, in which he said that he started his races not merely at the [...] "bang" [...] of the <b>starting</b> <b>pistol,</b> but at [...] "the B of the Bang".|$|E

5000|$|With {{security}} {{after the}} September 11 {{attacks on the}} US becoming prevalent, causing issues with <b>starting</b> <b>pistols,</b> a trend developed to use electronic starting systems that do not use pistols, but use a [...] "dummy" [...] prop pistol which cannot function as a firearm that is wired to the timing system. When the starter presses the button, they emit a signal to play a simulated gunshot that is broadcast to loudspeakers behind each lane, show a flash, emit simulated smoke, and start the timing clock. Many venues have switched to the new format. Beyond the security concerns, {{it has also been}} observed that even with the use of loudspeakers, some competitors still wait for the actual sound of the gun to reach them, and since the new all-electronic <b>starting</b> <b>pistols</b> have no such problems, they became the official way of starting games at the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|R

5000|$|In 1950, Herbert Schmidt got {{the license}} to produce <b>starting</b> <b>pistols</b> and blank-firers, {{which were then}} made in a rented location. The first model was a single-shot alarm gun (for {{yachting}} purposes). In 1951, the production hall was completed, and the model range had been increased, to include a double-action revolver in [...]22 caliber. The production of own cartridges began at the same time. In 1959, a single-action revolver in the Western style, the 120, 121, 121 a and the 121 S, were born; they were first made in [...]22 magnum.|$|R

50|$|An {{issue with}} the use of <b>starting</b> <b>pistols</b> is that, since the report of the pistol is carried to the {{competitors}} at the speed of sound, which takes about 3 milliseconds to travel one metre, positions nearest the starter hear the report a few milliseconds before further positions. This issue is exaggerated in races where the runners begin in a stagger, putting a significant distance between the nearest and furthest runners. To avoid this problem, the pistol is in all major competitions wired with a microphone that transmits the sound virtually instantaneously to loudspeakers directly behind each competitor.|$|R
50|$|Through {{its history}} it always {{fulfilled}} {{a crucial role}} in supplying the Honvédség with small arms, this company also manufactured and exported a variety of semi-automatic pistols and rifles, including the P9M and the PJK-9HP models (copies of the famous Browning Hi-Power) and the FÉG PA-63 (a Walther PP/PPK clone in 9×18mm Makarov), but currently only self-loading pistols (P9L, P9M, P9R, etc.) and break-barrel air rifles (LG 427, LG 527).

50|$|A gas pistol is a {{non-lethal}} weapon used for self-defense and other purposes. It is typically a close-to-exact replica or conversion {{of a real}} handgun made {{to be able to}} fire tear gas cartridges only. Effective range is up to 4.5 metres depending on caliber. For legal purposes various techniques are used during manufacture/conversion to prevent the use of live ammunition, such as using calibers exclusive to gas cartridges, welding obstacles into a non-removable barrel and using malleable metal alloys. Gas pistols are prevalent in European countries with strict gun control laws. Gas pistols are also used in weapons training, and as <b>starting</b> <b>pistols,</b> flare guns, and movie props.|$|R
