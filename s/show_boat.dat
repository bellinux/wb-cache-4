5000|$|<b>Show</b> <b>boats</b> were {{floating}} theaters that traveled along {{rivers of}} the United States from the 1870s to the 1930s. The performers lived aboard the vessels. With song, dance, and dramatic productions, <b>show</b> <b>boats</b> provided entertainment for small riverside towns that were otherwise quite isolated. Ferber, {{who had never}} heard of <b>show</b> <b>boats,</b> was immediately intrigued:"Here, I thought, {{was one of the most}} melodramatic and gorgeous bits of Americana that had ever come my way. It was not only the theater — it was the theater plus the glamour of the wandering drifting life, the drama of the river towns, the mystery and terror of the Mississippi itself... I spent a year hunting down every available scrap of show-boat material; reading, interviewing, taking notes and making outlines." ...|$|R

5|$|Oscar Hammerstein's {{commitment}} to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to <b>Show</b> <b>Boat.</b> It {{can be seen}} in his later works, many of which were set to music by Richard Rodgers. Carmen Jones is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic French opera through the experiences of African Americans during wartime, and South Pacific explores interracial marriage and prejudice. Finally, The King andI deals with different cultures' preconceived notions regarding each other and the possibility for cultural inclusiveness in societies.|$|E

5|$|Though Ziegfeld {{anticipated}} {{opening his}} new theatre on Sixth Avenue with <b>Show</b> <b>Boat,</b> the epic {{nature of the}} work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts.

When Rio Rita proved to be a success, Show Boats Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre.|$|E
