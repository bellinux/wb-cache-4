5|$|Throughout 1282, the Mongol command made {{preparations}} for the upcoming invasions of Champa and northern Burma. The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further; the emperor did not sanction an attack on Pagan itself. At least one army consisted of 14,000 men of the erstwhile Persian Khwarezmid Empire {{under the command of}} Yalu Beg was sent to Yunnan to reinforce the Burma invasion force, which again was made up of Turks and other central Asians. On the Burmese side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> vassals, he probably could not have raised a large one. By mid-1283, a Burmese army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan.|$|E

500|$|On 17 January, a {{group of}} senior pilots {{took part in a}} [...] "Fighter Pilots Revolt". Galland's high <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fighter pilot peers led to {{a group of}} the most {{decorated}} Luftwaffe combat leaders loyal to Galland (including Johannes Steinhoff and Günther Lützow) confronting Göring with a list of demands for the survival of their service. Göring initially suspected Galland had instigated the unrest. Heinrich Himmler had wanted to put Galland on trial for treason himself; the SS and Gestapo had already begun investigations into who he associated with. [...] The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL) appointed the more politically acceptable Gollob, a National Socialist supporter, to succeed him as General der Jagdflieger on 23 January. Although professional contemporaries, Gollob and Galland had a mutual dislike, and after Galland had removed the Austrian from his personal staff in September 1944, Gollob started to gather evidence to use against Galland, detailing false accusations of his gambling, womanising, and alleged private use of Luftwaffe transport aircraft. The official reason for his being relieved of command was his ill health.|$|E
500|$|Röhm {{was held}} briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler {{considered}} his future. In the end, Hitler decided that Röhm had to die. On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michel Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm's cell, they {{handed him a}} Browning pistol loaded with a single bullet {{and told him he}} had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. Röhm demurred, telling them, [...] "If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself." [...] Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him <b>standing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert {{had been one of the}} few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|E

2500|$|After her uncle's death, Hepburn, Ella and Miesje left Arnhem to {{live with}} her grandfather, Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, in nearby Velp.
