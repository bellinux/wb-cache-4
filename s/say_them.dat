25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d <b>say</b> <b>them,</b> so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E
25|$|Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. These {{prayers are}} said by the sacred ministers {{standing}} {{on the floor at}} the bottom of the steps leading up to the High Altar. They are also said to each other, kneeling, by the acolytes and those servers sitting in the liturgical choir. If the acolytes are close enough, they may <b>say</b> <b>them</b> with the sacred ministers. These prayers consist primarily of Psalm 42 with the verses said alternately between the celebrant and the other sacred ministers. While these prayers are being said, the musical choir is singing the text of the Introit. After the prayers are finished, all rise. The sacred ministers ascend the steps to the altar to cense it.|$|E
500|$|Bright {{commented that}} Shields' {{performance}} was [...] "a little into silly land" [...] at first, but it [...] "eventually {{turned in a}} very funny performance." [...] Shields commented {{that when she was}} asked to appear on the show, she [...] "said yes basically sight unseen. I don't know where I was on the list. Maybe everybody else said no." [...] The writers had difficulty devising jokes that would be funny when Van Damme said them. In order to create [...] "Van Damme-proof" [...] jokes, one writer [...] "would <b>say</b> <b>them</b> in a really horrible French accent, putting the emphasis on the wrong word". If people laughed, Van Damme was given the joke to perform. One line created in this way was Van Damme's [...] "I can crack a walnut with my butt." ...|$|E

[...] "But it's {{occurred to me that}} you're on the wrong end of the stick. That's why I'm here. You're saying the right things, and you've got the knack of <b>saying</b> <b>them</b> so that people have just got to listen, but you're <b>saying</b> <b>them</b> to the wrong crowd." ...|$|R

500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to <b>say</b> <b>them</b> while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blender once {{described}} his songwriting process: [...] "Well we just meditate, and a vibe {{just come to}} us, or we just sit in and bring tune from scratch without melodies or anything, and melodies come to you later". Blender has rejected the slack lyrics that have become common in reggae, stating [...] "If the people tell you that them want rubbish, you know <b>say</b> <b>them</b> nuff fi get rubbish. [...] Them fi get good things fi keep them internal and external clean. Never to fail, always righteousness. That's what we're working for".|$|E
2500|$|While {{recording}} the song, Bono devised a persona he called [...] "The Fly," [...] {{and it is}} from this character's perspective that Bono wrote the lyrics. He recalls that during the recording sessions, Fintan Fitzgerald, {{in charge of the}} band's wardrobe, found a 1970s pair of wraparound blaxploitation sunglasses. Bono would put them on and make everyone laugh whenever they faced a problem or disagreement. He recalls, [...] "I became very interested in these single-line aphorisms. I had been writing them, so I got this character who could <b>say</b> <b>them</b> all, from 'A liar won't believe anybody else' to 'A friend is someone who lets you down,' and that's where 'The Fly' was coming from." ...|$|E
500|$|In Rhinehart's fictional {{account of}} the training, the est course leader begins with the instruction: [...] "Let me make one thing clear. I don't want any of you to believe a thing I'm saying. Get that. Don't believe me. Just listen." [...] The est trainer {{explains}} that the course techniques are used because [...] "Werner {{has found that the}}y work." [...] When one of the est participants asks why the instructor says certain statements during the course, the instructor responds: [...] "I'm <b>saying</b> <b>them</b> because Werner has found that the trainer's <b>saying</b> <b>them</b> works." ...|$|R

2500|$|Masters {{attempted}} to keep Nova Studios afloat by finally producing sound films. [...] Masters {{had refused to}} make films with synchronous sound until 1983—long after most other gay pornographic studios had not only begun using dialogue synched to the actor's lip movements but also had moved from film to video. Masters' friend, William Higgins, had been recording sound for his films (but not using it) since 1978, and Falcon Studios released their first sound film in 1979. [...] "I hated sound at this time. [...] Because of my experience with Greek Lightning, partially, and I said, 'What will sound do for these films except make them ludicrous?' Because {{the kind of people}} we use in these films can't talk, can't act, have no background—they can't do any of these things, and it's just going to be absurd to make them say things when they aren't going to <b>say</b> <b>them</b> well." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the band's most {{striking}} aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals. In the book Check the Technique, B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is [...] "high and annoying... the nasal style I have {{was just something}} that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's ears" [...] {{and talking about the}} nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, [...] "you want to stand out from the others and just be distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage." [...] In the film Art of Rap, B-Real credits the Beastie Boys as an influence when developing his rapping style. Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding another background/choir voice to <b>say</b> <b>them.</b> Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, [...] "Sen's voice is so strong," [...] and [...] "it all blends together" [...] when they are both on the same track.|$|E
2500|$|As Debussy's {{popularity}} increased, he {{was often}} engaged as a conductor throughout Europe during this period, most often performing Pelléas, La Mer, and Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. He was also an occasional music critic, to supplement his conducting fees and piano lessons, writing under the pseudonym [...] "Monsieur Croche". He avoided analytical dissection and attempts to force images from music, saying [...] "Let us at all costs preserve this magic peculiar to music, since of all the arts it is most susceptible to magic." [...] He could be caustic and witty, sometimes sloppy and ill-informed. He was {{for the most part}} enthusiastic about Richard Strauss and Stravinsky, and worshipful of Chopin and Bach, the latter being acknowledged as [...] "the one great master." [...] His relationship to Beethoven was a complex one; he was said to refer to him as [...] "le vieux sourd" [...] (the old deaf one) and adjured one young pupil never to play Beethoven's music for [...] "it is like somebody dancing on my grave." [...] It was said that [...] "Debussy liked Mozart, and he believed that Beethoven had terrifically profound things to say, but {{that he did not know}} how to <b>say</b> <b>them,</b> because he was imprisoned in a web of incessant restatement and of German aggressiveness." [...] He also admired the works of Charles-Valentin Alkan. Schubert and Mendelssohn fared much worse, the latter being described as a [...] "facile and elegant notary".|$|E

60|$|I do not {{say these}} ugly words for myself. St. Paul did not say these ugly words for himself. But men have said them; too many men, and too often. The Jews, who sought after a sign, said them in St. Paul's time. The Corinthian Greeks, who sought after wisdom, said them also. There are men who <b>say</b> <b>them</b> now. We all are tempted at times to <b>say</b> <b>them</b> in our hearts. As often as we forget Good Friday, and what Good Friday means, and what Good Friday brought to all mankind, we do <b>say</b> <b>them</b> in our hearts; and charge God--though we should not like to confess it even to ourselves--with {{weakness}} and with folly.|$|E
