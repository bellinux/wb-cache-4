The paper {{treats the}} results {{obtained}} in simultaneous measurements of acoustic emission with PZT AE sensors and of strain with resistance measuring rosettes carried out during and immediately after laser cutting-out of a deep-drawn <b>sheet</b> <b>product,</b> i. e. mud-guard. The presence of a field of residual stresses produced by deep-drawing is characteristic of deep-drawn products. In the course of laser trimming and cutting-out the residual stresses get released, which affects the deformation of the deep-drawn mud-guard concerned. The strain was measured at two measuring points chosen with the resistance measuring rosettes. To describe {{the changes in the}} material, acoustic emission was measured at the same points. The two phenomena were then analyzed. A goal of the study presented in this paper was primarily to analyze the sources of acoustic emission present during and immediately after laser cutting.

In general, tensile modulus and strength are 90 % or better of continous fiber composites at the same FVF. Fatigue and creep properties are also comparable.

The two challenges were {{to identify the}} energy associated with crack propagation and to measure actual crack lengths.

40|$|Abstract. During the thermo-mechanical {{processing}} of aluminium <b>sheet</b> <b>products</b> in commercial production lines the material experiences a complex history of temperature, time and strain paths, which result in alternating cycles of deformation and recrystallization {{with the associated}} changes in microstructure and, especially, crystallographic texture. Thus, computer-based alloy and process development requires integration of models for simulating the evolution of microstructure, microchemistry and crystallographic texture into process models of the thermo-mechanical production of Al sheet. In the present paper the influence of texture on the anisotropic properties is explored for various industrially processed aluminium alloy sheets for packaging applications. Besides the use of experimentally measured sheet textures as an input for the anisotropy calculations, particular attention {{is given to the}} use of modelled textures. Here, results from a comprehensive through-process modelling of the texture evolution during the thermo-mechanical production of aluminium sheet are utilized. Eventually, this will enable us to predict the evolution of texture and the resulting properties along the entire process chain and hence to improve product quality of aluminium <b>sheet</b> <b>products</b> avoiding laborious and expensive plant trials...|$|R

40|$|Many {{technologies}} {{presented in}} literature for the forming of self-reinforced or all-polymer composites {{are based on}} manufacturing processes involving thermoforming of pre-consolidated sheets. This paper describes novel direct forming routes to manufacture simple geometries of self-reinforced, all-polypropylene (all-PP) composites, by moulding fabrics of woven co-extruded polypropylene tapes directly into composite products, {{without the need for}} pre-consolidated sheet. High strength co-extruded PP tapes have potential processing advantages over mono-extruded fibres or tapes as they allow for a larger temperature processing window for consolidation. This enlarged temperature processing window makes direct forming routes feasible, without the need for an intermediate pre-consolidated <b>sheet</b> <b>product.</b> Thermoforming studies show that direct forming is an interesting alternative to stamping of pre-consolidated sheets, as it eliminates an expensive belt-pressing step which is normally needed for the manufacturing of semi-finished sheets products. Moreover, results from forming studies shows that only half the energy was required to directly form a simple dome geometry from a stack of fabrics compared to stamping the same shape from a pre-consolidated sheet. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.
