5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} pelvic fin bases and the second behind the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the pelvic fins are small and low, with angular margins. The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the pelvic and anal fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} anal fin very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is very thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling <b>saw</b> <b>teeth,</b> along the upper edge of the caudal fin. The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or spots that run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E

2500|$|The {{invention}} of a hedge-breaching device is generally credited to Curtis G. Culin, a sergeant in the 2nd Armored Division's 102nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron. However, military historian Max Hastings notes that Culin {{was inspired by}} [...] "a Tennessee hillbilly named Roberts", who during a discussion about how to overcome the bocage, said [...] "Why don't we get some <b>saw</b> <b>teeth</b> {{and put them on}} the front of the tank and cut through these hedges?" [...] Rather than joining in the laughter that greeted this remark, Culin recognized the idea's potential. A prototype tusk-like assembly was created by welding steel scrap (from destroyed [...] "Czech hedgehogs") to the front of a tank to create a hedge cutter. The teeth helped prevent the vulnerable underside of the tank from being exposed while it knocked a hole in the hedgerow wall. On 14 July, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley inspected the tank and [...] "watched in awe as a hedgerow exploded... to make way for the Sherman bursting through". According to Hastings, Culin, [...] "an honest man", attempted to give credit to Roberts, but this was forgotten in the publicity surrounding the invention. Hastings concludes: [...] " [...] became a very American kind of national hero".|$|E

6000|$|And at {{that hour}} Cyril Morland, under the parapet of his trench, {{tightening}} his belt, was looking at his wrist-watch for the hundredth time, calculating exactly where he meant to put foot and hand for the going over: 'I absolutely mustn't let those chaps {{get in front of}} me,' he thought. So many yards before the first line of trenches, so many yards to the second line, and there stop. So his rehearsals had gone; it was the performance now! Another minute before the terrific racket of the drum-fire should become the curtain-fire, which would advance before them. He ran his eye down the trench. The man next him was licking his two first fingers, as if he might be going to bowl at cricket. Further down, a man was feeling his puttees. A voice said: [...] "Wot price the orchestra nah!" [...] He <b>saw</b> <b>teeth</b> gleam in faces burnt almost black. Then he looked up; the sky was blue beyond the brownish film of dust raised by the striking shells. Noel! Noel! Noel!...

Out of the corner of his eye he caught the flash of a man's [...] "briquet" [...] lighting a cigarette. All right for those chaps, but not for him; he wanted all his breath--this rifle, and kit were handicap enough! Two days ago he had been reading in some paper how men felt just before an attack. And now he knew. He just felt nervous. If only the moment would come, and get itself over! For all the thought he gave to the enemy there might have been none--nothing but shells and bullets, with lives of their own. He heard the whistle; his foot was on the spot he had marked down; his hand where he had seen it; he called out: [...] "Now, boys!" [...] His head was over the top, his body over; he was conscious of someone falling, and two men neck and neck beside him. Not to try and run, not to break out of a walk; to go steady, and yet keep ahead! D--n these holes! A bullet tore through his sleeve, grazing his arm--a red-hot sensation, like the touch of an iron. A British shell from close over his head burst sixty yards ahead; he stumbled, fell flat, picked himself up. Three ahead of him now! He walked faster, and drew alongside. Two of them fell. 'What luck!' he thought; and gripping his rifle harder, pitched headlong into a declivity. Dead bodies lay there! The first German trench line, and nothing alive in it, nothing to clean up, nothing of it left! He stopped, getting his wind; watching the men panting and stumbling in. The roar of the guns was louder than ever again, barraging the second line. So far, good! And here was his captain! ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to measure the cutting force and the {{resultant}} machined surface quality for tension wood and normal wood of Rubberwood using a single <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> experimental set-up. Three different <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> geometries {{were used in the}} experiment, to establish the optimum <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> design for the sawing of tension wood. The results showed that the specific principal cutting force was lower for tension wood compared to normal wood, due to the less lignified cell walls of the tension wood. It appears that the lignin component in the cell wall provides the stiffness to the cell wall, which was lacking in the cell walls of tension wood, hence reducing the cutting forces significantly. Nevertheless, the overall power consumption during the machining of tension wood was markedly higher due to the presence of fuzzy grains on the machined surface of tension wood, which increased the frictional force acting on the cutting edges during the machining process. Further, it was found that <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> design No. 2 produced the optimal result, both from the economic and quality perspectives for the sawing of tension wood. Therefore, in order to optimize the sawing of tension wood, <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> with the highest rake and clearance angles is recommended as it required the least cutting force, while producing the best surface quality. This study has far reaching industrial implications on the sawing and machining of Rubberwood in the South East Asian region...|$|R

50|$|Very early {{chainsaws}} used tooth configurations {{very similar}} to conventional hand saws. These were very simple <b>saw</b> <b>teeth</b> following a wave pattern (left, centre, right, centre) with no depth gauges as such, relying purely on bar pressure to limit the cutting rate.

50|$|Wooden {{frame joints}} are often double doweled, {{which means that}} round wooden pegs are fitted into holes in two {{adjacent}} frame sections and glued.

50|$|Sometimes {{cultures}} developed {{two main}} types of saw teeth: the 'cross cut' <b>saw</b> <b>teeth</b> and the 'rip' <b>saw</b> <b>teeth.</b> These {{cut into the}} wood using different mechanisms. Wood is composed of many long cells running length-ways. Thus, crosscut saws have sawteeth that are usually shaped, often with a metal file, {{in such a way}} that they form a series of tiny knifelike edges.The wood cells are contacted by the knife-edge of the tooth and cut. Rip saws, on the other hand, are usually shaped so that they form a series of tiny chisel-like edges. The wood cells are contacted by the chisel and 'ripped' apart from the bundle of other cells. It is common that people do not recognize the difference and use saws both ways. However, a rip saw is much faster than a cross-cut saw when cutting with the grain but leaves a very rough cut, often with splinters on the surface, and has more difficulty maintaining a straight cut when cutting across the grain. The cross-cut saw can cut in any direction but is much slower than needs be when cutting with the grain.|$|E
