5000|$|In 1879, while Mayer {{held the}} {{position}} of the director of the Agricultural Experiment Station at Wageningen in the Netherlands, he was asked by Dutch farmers to study a peculiar disease affecting the tobacco plant. Mayer published a paper in 1886 on the disease which he named as [...] "mosaic disease of tobacco" [...] and described its symptoms in detail. He demonstrated that the disease can be transmitted by using the sap from the affected tobacco plants as the inoculum to infect healthy plants. At the time, this disease was thought to be spread by very small bacteria or toxins, yet some years later the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was shown to be the culprit. Mayer employed optical microscopy to seek for <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> or bacteria in the infected sap, yet he did not find any, since the TMV is too small to be detected in optical microscope. Mayer still concluded that the infectious agent was some sort of bacteria and erroneously claimed {{that he was able to}} obtain [...] "clear filtrate" [...] from the infected sap using filter paper in several repetitions. Filtration experiments with paper and finest porcelain Chamberland filters were replicated by Dmitry Ivanovsky in 1892 and Martinus Beijerinck in 1898 who showed that the infectious agent of the tobacco mosaic disease was in fact infilterable. It was Martinus Beijerinck who first coined the term of [...] "virus" [...] to indicate a non-bacterial nature of the tobacco mosaic disease. In 1935, the tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be crystallized. Regardless of the erroneous conclusion, Mayer's pioneer work on the tobacco mosaic disease served as an important step in the discovery of viruses and led to the foundation of the field of virology.|$|E
40|$|Introduction The study {{aimed at}} {{determination}} of {{the usefulness of the}} subjective assessment of selected <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> growth in flats and microclimate parameters to indicate the actual air contamination with culturable fungi, (1 → 3) -β-D-glucans and fungal spores. Material and methods This analysis covered 22 flats, the inhabitants of which declared in a questionnaire interview the presence of the developed mycelium on solid surfaces in the flat. Air samples for {{determination of the}} culturable fungi, (1 → 3) -β-D-glucans and (viable and non-viable) fungal spores concentrations indoor and outdoor the flats during the heating period were collected. During bioaerosol sampling microclimate parameters were measured. Predictive models for concentrations of the tested biological agents with regard to various ways to assess fungal contamination of air in a flat (on the basis of a questionnaire or a questionnaire and microclimate measurements) were built. Results The arithmetic means of temperature, relative humidity, CO 2 concentration and air flow velocity in the flats were respectively: 20. 5 °C, 53 %, 1431. 6 ppm and 0 m/s. The geometric mean concentrations of airborne fungi, (1 → 3) -β-D-glucans and fungal spores in these premises amounted to 2. 9 × 102 cfu/m 3, 1. 6 ng/m 3 and 5. 7 × 103 spores/m 3, respectively. The subjective assessment of fungi growth signs and microclimate characteristics were moderately useful for evaluation of the actual airborne fungi and (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan concentrations (maximum percent of explained variance (VE) = 61 % and 67 %, respectively), and less useful in evaluation of the actual fungal spore concentrations (VE < 29 %). In the case of fungi, higher usefulness was indicated of the questionnaire evaluation supported by microclimate measurements (VE = 61. 2 %), as compared to the evaluation only by means of a questionnaire (VE = 46. 9 %). Conclusions Subjective evaluation of fungi growth signs in flats, separately or combined with microclimate measurements, appeared to be moderately useful for quantitative evaluation of the actual air contamination with fungi and their derivatives, but more extensive studies are needed to strengthen those findings...|$|E
50|$|II-Urediniospores-repeating dikaryotic {{vegetative}} spores. These spores {{are referred}} to as the repeating stage because they can cause auto-infection (re-infect the same host from which the spores were borne).

50|$|Symptoms and <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungus</b> {{disease are}} often found underground. The H. annosum infections cause an {{abnormal}} change in {{structure in the}} roots that climbs up to {{the butt of the}} tree. More than half the tree may be killed before any symptoms appear to the human eye. Basidiocarps can take up to one and a half or even three years to be visible. This infections causes the trees to have abnormal needle growth, pale yellow barks, and the trees to wither and die. This root disease typically causes the tree to have a thin crown from bottom up and inside out. Trees will eventually die. A landscape scale symptom is the rings of dead trees in various stages of decay and death, with the oldest at the center and progressively younger moving outward. The white rot fungus found in the roots is the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> telling whether the tree has been affected by H. annosum. The bark changes colors as the stages progress, they go from pale yellow, to a crusty light brown, and finally in its advanced stage it turns white with the signature of Fomes annosus ― a sprinkled streak of black spots. Another sign is the leaking part of the root that causes a compact mass to form between it and the sand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Laccase(s) are {{enzyme that}} capable to degrade lignin in biomass. This {{capability}} can be utilized as a biological agent on lignin removal. Laccase has been produced by white rot fungus Marasmius sp in Solid State Fermentation (SSF) using rice straw as the solid support media. The {{objective of this}} paper was to investigate the influence of temperature on laccase production in SSF by using Marasmius sp. and rice straw as solid substrate. The temperatures of 25 ºC, 28 ºC, 31 ºC and 34 ºC were employed to study its influence. The results showed that the first well visible <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>fungus</b> were seen on day 2 - 3 and the total colonization on solid support occurred within day 7 - 9. The enzyme activity appeared after 2 - 5 days of cultivation and gradually increased achieving a maximum values on days 6 - 10 and then decreased probably due to specific degradation of laccase by extracellular protease present in the culture. The highest laccase activity was achieved at temperature of 31 ºC (1564. 17 U/L on day 10) ...|$|R
5000|$|Phellinus pini (current name: Porodaedalea pini (Brot.) Murrill 1905) is a fungal plant {{pathogen}} that causes tree disease {{commonly known as}} [...] "red ring rot" [...] or [...] "white speck."

40|$|White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) is an {{epizootic}} disease in hibernating bats {{caused by the}} fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Surveillance for P. destructans at bat hibernacula consists primarily of visual surveys of bats, collection of potentially infected bats, and submission of these bats for laboratory testing. Cryptic infections (bats that are infected but display no visual <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungus)</b> {{could lead to the}} mischaracterization of the infection status of a site and the inadvertent spread of P. destructans. We determined the efficacy of visual detection of P. destructans by examining visual signs and molecular detection of P. destructans on 928 bats of six species at 27 sites during surveys conducted from January through March in 2012 - 2014 in the southeastern USA on {{the leading edge of the}} disease invasion. Cryptic infections were widespread with 77 % of bats that tested positive by qPCR showing no visible <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> infection. The probability <b>of</b> exhibiting visual <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> infection increased with sampling date and pathogen load, the latter of which was substantially higher in three species (Myotis lucifugus, M. septentrionalis, and Perimyotis subflavus). In addition, M. lucifugus was more likely to show visual <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> infection than other species given the same pathogen load. Nearly all infections were cryptic in three species (Eptesicus fuscus, M. grisescens, and M. sodalis), which had much lower fungal loads. The presence of M. lucifugus or M. septentrionalis at a site increased the probability that P. destructans was visually detected on bats. Our results suggest that cryptic infections of P. destructans are common in all bat species, and visible infections rarely occur in some species. However, due to very high infection prevalence and loads in some species, we estimate that visual surveys examining at least 17 individuals of M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis, or 29 individuals of P. subflavus are still effective to determine whether a site has bats infected with P. destructans. In addition, because the probability of visually detecting the fungus was higher later in winter, surveys should be done as close to the end of the hibernation period as possible...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{are similar}} to all species of maple and include a canker forming most {{commonly}} 2 - 12 ft from the ground. The formation of the canker begins with a small pronounced necrosis of the bark and requires several years to expand. The canker enlarges as the tree ages by increasing its width and forming ringed callus around it. It is then capable of surrounding over half the trunk with a typical diameter of 0.3 - 2.5 m. Although the canker can become quite large, it normally does not kill the tree but does {{increase the risk of}} the trunk failing and being blown over by the wind. As for visible <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fungus,</b> if the bark is peeled back {{at the center of the}} canker, a mat of white mycelium (fungal tissue) will be revealed.|$|R

40|$|All {{garlic cloves}} {{infected}} at harvest {{with the white}} rot fungus (Scierotium cepivorum) decayed while in storage. The white rot fungus was not recovered from any decayed trashy material in this seedlot other than scierotia. Nevertheless some sclerotia of the white rot fungus survived traditional hot water-formaldehyde seed treatment processes. Those sur-viving were aggregated within decayed cloves, which might pass through the mechanical processors associated withcracking and seed treatment. Reduction in time and/or tem-perature of the treatment solutions allowed partial survival even of unaggregated scierotia. It remains unclear if scle-rotia surviving hot water treatments are fully competent. Hypothetical Question: May the garlic industry feel secure that the standard Lear-Johnson seed treatment, and possibly milder variations of it, will eradicate the white rot fungus from a seed lot. METHODS In the summer of 1987, a bag of garlic infected with the white rot fungus (Sclerotium cepivorum) was collected in Monterey County CA, and shipped to the University of Cali-fornia Tulelake Field Station in Tulelake, CA. It was held as per normal seed storage until January, 1988. In January, 1988, the stored garlic was separated into several compo-nents: 1) loose sclerotia and 2) fully-decayed cloves in which abundant scierotia were aggregated together with clove tissue and mycelium ("aggregates"), these varied from 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm in various irregular cross sections and were cal-culated to contain from 4, 000 - 25, 000 sclerotia each and 3) cloves which appeared normally developed and uninfected (no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fungus</b> on either stem plates or covering leaf sheaths) ...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} {{interaction}} between Candida albicans blastoconidia and human phagocytes, we incubated peripheral leukocytes with fungi for 1 h at 37 degrees C and stained the cells with fluorescent vital stains ethidium bromide (EB) and fluorescein diacetate. Fungi that had been phagocytosed showed little staining; however, some leukocytes containing blastoconidia exhibited nuclear staining with EB, even though their cell membranes showed no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> penetration by <b>fungi.</b> The number <b>of</b> EB-positive leukocytes was related to viability of the yeast cells and the temperature at which they were maintained before use. Because efforts to quantitate EB-positive leukocytes microscopically were frustrated by cell aggregation, we labeled the leukocytes with 51 Cr and measured isotope release. We determined that leukocytes incubated with viable fungi released significantly more isotope than cells incubated alone or with killed blastoconidia. Furthermore, 51 Cr release correlated directly with concentration <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> in the assay, time of incubation, and temperature at which fungi were maintained before use. Using a number of isolates of C. albicans and several other species of Candida, we found that all exhibited cytotoxic activity against leukocytes, but the level of activity varied among organisms. Finally, we depleted or enriched peripheral leukocytes for specific cell populations and determined that only monocytes released more 51 Cr after incubation with viable blastoconidia. Blastoconidia can lyse phagocytic cells through germination and penetration of cell membranes within 1 to 2 h, but the cytotoxic phenomenon we describe occurs within 15 to 30 min after yeast cells have been phagocytosed. Therefore, this capacity may represent a more immediate response by blastoconidia against phagocytosis and killing by monocytes...|$|R
40|$|The fungus Colletotrichum cereale incites {{anthracnose}} disease on Poa annua (annual bluegrass) turfgrass. Anthracnose {{disease is}} geographically widespread {{throughout the world}} and highly destructive to cool-season turfgrasses, with infections by C. cereale resulting in extensive turf loss. Comprehensive research aimed at controlling turfgrass anthracnose has been performed in the field, but knowledge of the causal organism and its basic biology is still needed. In particular, {{the lack of a}} reliable greenhouse-based inoculation protocol performed under controlled environmental conditions is an obstacle to the study of C. cereale and anthracnose disease. Our objective was to develop a consistent and reproducible inoculation protocol for the two major genetic lineages of C. cereale. By adapting previously successful field-based protocols and combining with components of existing inoculation procedures, the method we developed consistently produced C. cereale infection on two susceptible P. annua biotypes. Approximately 7 to 10 days post-inoculation, plants exhibited chlorosis and thinning consistent with anthracnose disease symptomology. Morphological inspection of inoculated plants revealed visual <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fungus</b> (appressoria and acervuli), although acervuli were not always present. After stringent surface sterilization of inoculated host tissue, C. cereale was consistently re-isolated from symptomatic tissue. Real-time PCR detection analysis based on the Apn 2 marker confirmed the presence of the pathogen in host tissue, with both lineages of C. cereale detected from all inoculated plants. When a humidifier was not used, no infection developed for any biotypes or fungal isolates tested. The inoculation protocol described here marks significant progress for in planta studies of C. cereale, and will enable scientifically reproducible investigations of the biology, infectivity and lifestyle of this important grass pathogen...|$|R

5000|$|Researchers {{from the}} Harvard School of Public Health write that new {{research}} provides [...] "convincing evidence" [...] {{of the link}} between imidacloprid and the phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder. Lead author of the study, Chensheng (Alex) Lu, stated that experiments showed a dose of 20 parts per billion of imidacloprid (less than the concentrations bees would encounter while foraging in sprayed crops), was enough to lead to Colony Collapse Disorder in 94% of colonies within 23 weeks. The hives were nearly empty and the researchers did not find <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the Nosema <b>fungus</b> or Varroa mites. The researchers proposed two possible sources of bees' exposure to imidacloprid. The first is through the nectar of plants sprayed with the pesticide itself, which is predicted by researchers at the University of Stirling, U.K., to have widespread impacts as imidacloprid is registered for use on over 140 crops in at least 120 countries. The second is through the high-fructose corn-syrup that most bee-keepers in the United States use to feed their bees. Since application of imidacloprid to corn in the United States began in 2005 cases of Colony Collapse Disorder have grown significantly: from losses of 17% to 20% throughout the 1990s to somewhere between 30% and 90% of colonies in the United States since 2006.|$|R
