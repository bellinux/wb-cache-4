25|$|Singletary Lake {{is one of}} {{a series}} of Carolina bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Exactly how the lakes were formed remains a mystery. What is known is that Singletary Lake is not fed by any stream but relies entirely upon rain. The land beneath and {{surrounding}} the lake is mica-rich <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> and sand that is from the Upper Cretaceous era with a thin layer of Pleistocene deposits covering it. This land is lower than the surrounding land and drains very poorly, creating Singletary Lake.|$|E
25|$|The {{central area}} principally {{consists}} of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture. This {{is recommended for}} diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to rootcrops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown {{in this type of}} soil.

2500|$|Further {{description}} of a San Joaquin soil profile was given in the Soil Manual as follows: [...] "The surface soil reported as a reddish brown, gritty sandy loam about 14inches thick. [...] The subsoil reported as a sticky and very plastic, brownish red <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> loam about 10inches thick resting abruptly on a red or brownish red, indurated hardpan.The oldest official {{description of}} the San Joaquin Valley series, filed with the Soil Conservation Service, was dated January 1941, and revised August 1952. [...] The concept {{was similar to that}} used by the Eleventh Farm Credit District except that the subsoil was described as a <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> with an abrupt upper and lower boundary. [...] This was the first official description that approached the modern concept of the San Joaquin series. [...] Subsequent field and laboratory studies have led to further revisions and to the present concept given in the 1996 series description.In 1983, the type location for the San Joaquin soil was relocated to a site north of Lodi, California, in San Joaquin county. [...] At that time, a monolith (a preserved 5 foot profile section) of the San Joaquin soil was prepared for this site and sent to the Netherlands World Soil Museum in Wageningen, the Netherlands. [...] Previously, the San Joaquin soil had been selected by the Soil Conservation Service as one of California's Benchmark Soils. [...] "Benchmark Soils" [...] is a nationwide listing of soil series considered representative of soils in Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) in the United States.Modern soil survey maps now show the distribution of San Joaquin Soil of California in Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tulare, and Yuba Counties.
