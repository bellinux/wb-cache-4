40|$|The {{competition}} in the car industry forces the tool and die shops into a continual optimisation process. In their machining departments, both automated NC-programming and continual optimisation processes for cutting strategies promise the possibility for improvement in efficiency. The dissertation shows that the two approaches actually contradict {{each other in their}} implementation. Whilst state of the art automatisation of NC-programming is founded upon consequent standardisation, it removes {{at the same time the}} possibility of modifications performed by employees with the aim of improving the cutting strategies. The dissertation explores a concept to combine the potential of both approaches for <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>production</b> with similarities in the machining process. This concept is implemented through a prototype software which is based on CATIA V 5 as a CAM-System and successfully validated with the manufacturing of trim elements...|$|E
50|$|Digital textile {{printing}} {{is often referred}} to as direct-to-garment printing, DTG printing, or digital garment printing. It is a process of printing on textiles and garments using specialized or modified inkjet technology. Inkjet printing on fabric is also possible with an inkjet printer by using fabric sheets with a removable paper backing. Today, major inkjet technology manufacturers can offer specialized products designed for direct printing on textiles, not only for sampling but also for bulk production. Since the early 1990s, inkjet technology and specially developed water-based ink (known as dye-sublimation or disperse direct ink) have made it possible to print directly onto polyester fabric. This is mainly related to visual communication in retail and brand promotion (flags, banners and other point of sales applications). Printing onto nylon and silk can be done by using an acid ink. Reactive ink is used for cellulose based fibers such as cotton and linen. Inkjet technology in digital {{textile printing}} allows for <b>single</b> <b>pieces,</b> mid-run <b>production</b> and even long-run alternatives to screen printed fabric.|$|R

50|$|A beam coupling, {{also known}} as helical coupling, is a {{flexible}} coupling for transmitting torque between two shafts while allowing for angular misalignment, parallel offset and even axial motion, of one shaft relative to the other. This design utilizes a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of material and becomes flexible by removal of material along a spiral path resulting in a curved flexible beam of helical shape. Since it is made from a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of material, the Beam Style coupling does not exhibit the backlash found in some multi-piece couplings. Another advantage of being an all machined coupling is the possibility to incorporate features into the final product while still keep the <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> integrity.|$|R
