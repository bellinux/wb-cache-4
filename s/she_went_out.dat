5|$|She was {{not fully}} {{repaired}} {{and returned to}} service until 1807, when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to the Caribbean. In 1809 she participated in the successful invasion of Martinique, and the subsequent battle with Troude's squadron. Returning to Britain {{towards the end of}} the wars, she was laid up in ordinary, and in 1813 became a temporary prison ship. She was finally broken up in 1818.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{was one of}} a three-ship {{class of}} Concorde-class frigates built for the French Navy to a design by Henri Chevillard. She was built at Rochefort between April 1777 and January 1778, being {{launched}} on 3 September 1777. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to the West Indies after the French entry to the American War of Independence, and reached Martinique on 17 August 1778. On 28 August 1778 she came up on the 32-gun , under Captain John Stott, and after {{two and a half hours}} of fighting, captured her. Minerva was towed to Cap Français on Saint-Domingue, where she was joined shortly afterwards by the captured , which a hurricane had dismasted in late August and which the French frigates Charmante and Dédaigneuse had captured on 1 September.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 {{was off the}} Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case {{is a waste of time}} and they should return to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to London in April 1795, seeking Imlay, but he rejected her; {{the next month}} she attempted to commit suicide, but he saved her life (it is unclear how). In a last attempt to win him back, she embarked upon a hazardous trip to Scandinavia from June to September 1795, with only her one-year-old daughter and a maid, in order to conduct some business for him. Wollstonecraft's journey was daunting not only because she was travelling to what some considered a nearly uncivilized region {{during a time of}} war, but also because she was travelling without a male escort. When she {{returned to}} England and realized that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide a second time. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> on a rainy night, walked around to soak her clothes, and then jumped into the River Thames, where a stranger rescued her.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the year, Cabrini had {{declined}} to renew Philip's contract, citing repeated tardiness and alcohol-related issues, effectively firing her. Shortly after she had been informed of that decision, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to a bar with other Cabrini employees. The outing led to her spending the night in jail. She complained to police that a fellow intern touched her inappropriately during that time. The prosecutor who investigated the case dropped the sexual abuse charge and instead charged Philip with third-degree falsely reporting an incident, a misdemeanor under New York law. He offered to drop the charge if she recanted the original complaint, but she refused and was held overnight pending release.|$|E
25|$|After Sheila's birth, Theresa began {{drinking}} heavily. She regularly drank at {{the local}} American Legion Hall where she met Estelle Lee Thornsberry, a disabled United States Army veteran. The two began a relationship and eventually moved in together. During the relationship, Theresa would routinely leave her children with Thornsberry while <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> drinking. Thornsberry began to question Theresa when she stayed out {{for days at a}} time and ended the relationship a few months later after he discovered that she was having an affair with his best friend. Shortly after the relationship with Thornsberry ended, Theresa met and began a relationship with a United States Marine private named Robert Knorr. She soon became pregnant and the couple married on July 9, 1966.|$|E

She stated she was unable to leave the house to inform Purvis or Martin about Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph, but as they were going to have fried chicken for the evening meal, she told Polly she had nothing in which to fry the chicken, and was going to the store to get some butter; that while at the store she called Mr. Purvis and {{informed}} him of Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph that evening, at the same time obtaining the butter. She then returned to the house so Polly would not be suspicious that <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to call anyone.|$|E

25|$|Camel {{returned}} to England in August 1800, with Commander Matthew Buckle becoming her new captain in December that year. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to the West Indies in April 1801, returning to England in February the following year. She was {{paid off in}} September 1802 and spent the Peace of Amiens laid up. With {{the outbreak of the}} Napoleonic Wars, Camel was recommissioned under Commander John Ayscough in June 1803 and {{returned to}} the West Indies later that year. She was back in England in April 1804, with Ayscough superseded by Commander Thomas Garth in May. Camel was initially based in the North Sea until November 1804, when she sailed to the Mediterranean. She returned in June 1805, and was under Commander John Joyce from October that year. Camel recommissioned in May 1808 under sailing master Duncan Weir, and returned to the Cape of Good Hope. She was back supporting military efforts on land at the Battle of Corunna in 1809. She was removed from service shortly afterwards and was broken up at Deptford in December 1810, after 28 years of service.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{was pleasantly}} {{surprised}} {{when he got a}} call from Beyoncé, who was working {{on one of the most}} anticipated albums of the year. However, things did not turn up according to his plans the following day, as he was late and was still suffering the effects of a hangover. When Harrison played the sample to Beyoncé in the studio, the singer initially had doubts about the [...] "sound so full of blaring fanfare;" [...] it seemed too retro and according to her, no one used horn riffs in the 21st century. Nevertheless, Beyoncé became friendlier to the sample, much to Harrison's delight, and gave him two hours to write and compose the song while <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I really think they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the realm}} of the internet, the scene during which Jasmine kisses Jafar in order to {{distract}} him from Aladdin is oftentimes viewed as a point of contention among feminist writers and bloggers; Meredith Ancret of The Snark Who Hunts Back argued that both the Sultan and Genie are similarly enslaved by Jafar. Ancret continued to defend Jasmine for being of her own mind, bravely defying Jafar on numerous occasions, and praised her distraction of the villain for being instrumental to Aladdin's success. Also defending Jasmine's decision to kiss Jafar, feminist critic Mari Rogers explained to The Daily Dot that [...] "Jasmine was a strong character and I think in many ways the story's focus on Aladdin sort of makes us forget this", concluding, [...] "Even in her own movie, she was always the force behind her decisions. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> seeking things". Awarding Aladdin a [...] "neutral" [...] grade in terms of feminism, Fanny Pack wrote that [...] "What stops Aladdin from being wholly negative ... is the sheer strength of Jasmine as a character" [...] who [...] "seems to take the best parts of Ariel and Belle and build them into an even better, stronger, and sassier princess".|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} to European waters with {{the resumption of}} the wars with France, joining a fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood blockading Cadiz. The reinforced fleet, by then commanded by Horatio Nelson, engaged the combined Franco-Spanish fleet when it emerged from port. At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October Bellerophon fought a bitter engagement against Spanish and French ships, sustaining heavy casualties including {{the death of her}} captain, John Cooke. After repairs Bellerophon was employed blockading the enemy fleets in the Channel and the North Sea. She plied the waters of the Baltic Sea in 1809, making attacks on Russian shipping, and by 1810 was off the French coast again, blockading their ports. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to North America as a convoy escort between 1813 and 1814, and in 1815 was assigned to blockade the French Atlantic port of Rochefort. In July 1815, defeated at Waterloo and finding escape to America barred by the blockading Bellerophon, Napoleon came aboard [...] "the ship that had dogged his steps for twenty years" [...] (according to maritime historian David Cordingly) to finally surrender to the British. It was Bellerophons last seagoing service. She was paid off and converted to a prison ship in 1815, and was renamed Captivity in 1824 to free the name for another ship. Moved to Plymouth in 1826, she continued in service until 1834, when the last convicts left. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1836, and she was broken up.|$|E
500|$|While Cox {{was working}} with Deerhunter to produce Cryptograms, it was {{considered}} Kranky policy to not print the lyrics of an album in its liner notes. [...] This was a rule enforced by label owner Joel Leoschke, who believed the practice [...] "demystifi {{the experience of a}} rock record." [...] Despite largely agreeing with this sentiment, Cox chose to print the lyrics of Let the Blind Lead, in part because he wanted to [...] "see what they looked like," [...] having ad-libbed the words of every song on their first take. [...] In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Cox described the lyrical origins of each song on Let the Blind Lead; they are largely autobiographical in nature, reflecting life experiences of his. The song [...] "Recent Bedroom" [...] conveys an experience Cox had when his aunt died: [...] "She was in her bedroom, and everybody knew she was about to pass away, and <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> she faded out, and everybody just started crying." [...] Although he was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] by her death, it did not bring him to tears like the rest of his family. This event is expressed in the song by the lines [...] "I walked outside, I could not cry / I don’t know, I don’t know why". [...] Cox’s inability to cry stemmed from his having been [...] "very involved in drugs" [...] at the time, which he believes eliminated his [...] "childhood instinct…to cry." [...] The song attempts to communicate an emotional vacancy and sense of detachment characterized by [...] "moving from childhood to adolescence".|$|E
