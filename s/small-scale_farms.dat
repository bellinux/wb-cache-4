Norway feared competition from Swedish industry and Danish agriculture and chose to not join any free trade organizations until 1960, when it joined the European Free Trade Association. Throughout the post-war period both fishing and agriculture became more mechanized, the agricultural subsidies rose to the third-highest {{in the world and the}} number of <b>small-scale</b> <b>farms</b> and fishermen fell dramatically. The Socialist People's Party was created in 1961 by former Labor politicians who disagreed with the Labor Party's NATO, nuclear and European policies. Following the Kings Bay Affair the right-winged Lyng's Cabinet ruled for a month. The right-wing coalition Borten's Cabinet won the 1965 election, sat for six years and started a trend of shifting Labor and right-winged governments. Norwegianization of Samis halted after the war and Sami rights became an increasing issue, with a council being established in 1964.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{assessed}} {{the extent and}} trend of landuse/cover change in Soroti District, Uganda. A series of systematically corrected Orthorectified Landsat imageries of 1973, 1986 and 2001 were downloaded from the Landsat website. The images were analysed using unsupervised classification approach and the land-use/cover were validated and/or reconstructed by ground truthing, use of secondary data, and key informants. The study establishes that; <b>small-scale</b> <b>farming</b> was the major landuse type (24. 2 %) and grasslands were the dominant landcover unit (26. 1 %) in 1973. <b>Small-scale</b> <b>farming</b> however declined by 5. 3 % in 1986 due to prevailing insurgence at the time while grasslands gained by 2. 9 %. In 2001, <b>small-scale</b> <b>farming</b> had increased by 13. 6 % {{at the expense of}} woodlands (- 2. 3 %), Bushlands(- 5. 5 %), Forest stock (- 2. 2 %) and wetlands (- 0. 44) that experienced declines. This drastic gain in <b>small-scale</b> <b>farming</b> is likely to treat negative environmental effects such as intensity of floods and droughts, soil nutrient and biodiversity loss due habitat conversion...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of farming which exist in Bardera area: Irrigated farming and {{seasonal}} farming. Many medium- and <b>small-scale</b> <b>farms</b> near the river use water pumping machines. These motors irrigate the land with canals, and farmers plant crops. The majority of farmers use a low-tech farming method of farming during the two rainy seasons of gu and deyr. Small operation farms are found throughout Gedo region, far away from the river banks where families plant sorghum, maize, and beans on any land that is suitable for farming. These farming plots are located on sandy soft earth often with muddy combinations. The locals call this type of earth adable.|$|E

50|$|In Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce {{economic}} benefits beyond their families. Because street food vendors purchase local fresh foods, urban gardens and <b>small-scale</b> <b>farms</b> {{in the area}} have expanded. In the United States, street food vendors are credited with supporting New York City's rapid growth by supplying meals for the city's merchants and workers. Proprietors of street food in the United States have had a goal of upward mobility, moving from selling {{on the street to}} their own shops. However, in Mexico, an increase in street vendors has been seen as a sign of deteriorating economic conditions in which food vending is the only employment opportunity that unskilled labor who have migrated from rural areas to urban areas are able to find.|$|E
5000|$|The {{growth of}} {{corporate}} contracting has {{also contributed to}} a transition from a system of many <b>small-scale</b> <b>farms</b> to one of relatively few large industrial-scale farms. This has dramatically changed the animal agricultural sector in the United States. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, [...] "In the 1930s, there were close to 7 million farms in the United States and as of the 2002 census, just over 2 million farms remain." [...] From 1969 to 2002, the number of family farms dropped by 39%, yet the percentage of family farms has remained high. As of 2004, 98% of all U.S. farms were family-owned and -operated.

5000|$|A large {{percentage}} of child laborers, about 70.9% are employed in the agricultural sector, working in activities such as planting and harvesting corn, working on cattle ranches, and planting and harvesting chestnuts and sugarcane. In rural areas children begin working at a young age, and participate in activities on <b>small-scale</b> <b>farms</b> and on medium and large plantations doing activities such as sowing, harvesting, weeding {{and taking care of}} cattle. Children who work in subsistence agriculture are exposed to harmful chemicals and are obligated to work for long hours, which reduces their ability to receive an education [...] Work on plantations is more difficult than work on <b>small-scale</b> <b>farms,</b> and children are exposed to more pesticides and hazardous working conditions which may result in infections and physical injuries from use of farm equipment. Mining in Bolivia is a common activity carried out by child laborers in rural areas, and the ILO has estimated that around 13,500 children are involved in mining. Work in mines is divided along age and gender lines, with girls and younger children involved in less dangerous work such as washing clothes and searching for minerals outside of mining sites while only boys work in actual mines in more dangerous work involving use of explosives and the grinding of minerals In urban areas, children are involved in agriculture but are mainly involved in jobs in industry and service which include domestic labor, woodwork, vending and prostitution. Work in urban areas is divided along gender lines with girls mostly carrying out jobs in markets or in domestic labor while boys do more physically strenuous labor in construction sites or working in garages, and children who work in domestic labor and on the streets are more susceptible to physical, verbal and sexual abuse as there is little protection for these children. Children involved in the worst forms of child labor such as mining, child prostitution and strenuous plantation work live in deplorable living conditions and have limited access to sanitary water, and good healthcare [...]|$|E
