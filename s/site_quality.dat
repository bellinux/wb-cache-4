The Journal of Geophysical Research â€“ Atmospheres subsequently published a study by Menne et al. which examined the record of stations picked out by Watts' Surfacestations.org and found that, if anything, the poorly sited stations showed a slight cool bias rather than the warm bias which Watts had anticipated.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the site-specific effects of projected future climate {{conditions on the}} productivity of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) plantations over the next 50 years (2011 - 2061). Climatic parameters as predicted by the Canadian Global Climate Model in association with a regional spatial climatic model, under 3 emissions scenarios (no change (NC), B 1 and A 2), were used as input values to a biophysical-based site-specific height-age model that was integrated into the CROPLANNER model and associated algorithm. Plantations managed under a basic silvicultural intensity on two <b>site</b> <b>qualities</b> at each of two geographically separated sites (northeastern and northwestern Ontario, Canada) were assessed. The {{results indicated that the}} stands situated on low-to-medium <b>quality</b> <b>sites</b> at both locations were largely unaffected by the predicted increase in temperature and precipitation rates. Conversely, however, stands situated on good-to-excellent <b>quality</b> <b>sites</b> grown under the B 1 and A 2 scenarios experienced consequential declines in stand development rates resulting in decreases in rotational mean sizes, biomass yields, recoverable end-product volumes, and economic worth. In addition to providing a plausible range of site-specific climate change outcomes on jack pine productivity within the central portion of the species range, these results suggest that future predictions that do not account for potential climate changes effects may overes- timate merchantable productivity on the higher <b>site</b> <b>qualities</b> by approximately 15 %. As demonstrated, in- corporating biophysical-based site index functions within existing forest productivity models may repre- sent a feasible approach when accounting for climate change effects on yield outcomes of boreal species...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} factors determining <b>site</b> <b>quality</b> for black oak are the thickness and texture of the A horizon, texture of the B horizon, aspect, and slope position. Other factors may be important in localized areas. For example, in northwestern West Virginia increasing precipitation to 1120 mm resulted in increased site quality; more than 1120 mm had no further effect. In southern Indiana, decreasing <b>site</b> <b>quality</b> was associated with increasing slope steepness.|$|E

40|$|A timber {{plantation}} carbon modelling procedure {{consistent with}} the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Australian greenhouse gas accounting methodologies is described with an application to hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) on the southern Atherton Tablelands of north Queensland, Australia. We also compare the private financial performance (timber value only) and economic performance (timber plus carbon values) of hoop pine plantations. The carbon sequestration value of hoop pine on high <b>quality</b> <b>sites</b> is found to increase social returns to plantation investment substantially above private returns, but it only marginally expands the range of <b>site</b> <b>qualities</b> over which plantations are socio-economically justified. Despite the long rotation of hoop pine (45 years), economic performance {{is found to be}} sensitive to carbon modelling parameters, including the decay rate of long-life wood products.

50|$|Three major {{unexpected}} findings {{resulted from}} this work. The first {{finding is that}} gradient responses in general do not evolve by changes in transcription factor (TF) binding <b>site</b> <b>quality</b> or quantity (site density) as expected, but rather by changes in the precise spacing between binding sites for morphogenic TFs and their partner TFs. The second finding is that homotypic site clustering at such enhancers was largely {{the result of a}} complex evolutionary history of selection for different threshold responses in the evolving insect egg. A third-related finding is that frequent selection for different responses also enriches for microsatellite repeat tracts, which are inherently unstable and most responsible for the production of novel indel alleles.|$|E
