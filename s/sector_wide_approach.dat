However donors has been the main financier of health, despite the decrease in their share of health expenditure from 44 percent in 2005/2006 to 40 percent in 2009/2010. (Table 1). Overall, the government allocation to health spending has remained almost constant at about 7 percent since 2002/2003, far away from reaching the Abuja declaration target of 15% of total government expenditure. The increase in donor funding is attributed to the commencement of financing for HIV and AIDS by the Global Fund in 2001 and the commencement of health financing through <b>Sector</b> <b>wide</b> <b>Approach</b> (SWAp) in early 2000.|$|E

These sustained efforts over the last 7 years have had substantial impact on health indicators in the country. In the area of HIV prevention, for example, the number of USAID-assisted counseling and testing centers increased from 3 in 2000 to 276 in 2007, while the number of clients assisted at these sites per year increased from about 22,000 in 2000 to more than 192,000 in 2007. In addition, according to a national Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) completed in 2005 with support from USAID, USAID's Presidential Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief activities reached 1,351,404 people through ABC messages (abstinence from sexual activity, being faithful to a single partner, and correct and consistent condom use) and provided care to 57,356 HIV/AIDS orphans and vulnerable children. Under-five mortality rates declined from a high of 189 per thousand live births in 2000 to 133 per thousand live births in 2004; the total fertility rate (TFR) declined to 6 children per woman; and the proportion of Malawian children sleeping under an insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) (26% in 2004) was {{more than three times the}} proportion (8%) sleeping under an ITN in 2000.

This article addresses this lacuna in sport-for-development by drawing on international development literature as well as interview data from representatives of international agencies, domestic governments and in-country non-governmental organisations involved with sport-for-development in Ghana and Tanzania. As previously recognised in other development sectors, the commonality of narrow, project-based approaches in sport-for-development contributes to excessive donor influence, fragmentation, competition and limits both impact and sustainability. It was in response to similar problems that, from the mid- 1990 s, <b>Sector</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Approaches</b> were instigated within specific sectors in particular countries as a more systematic model of development governance based on leadership by the domestic government and co-ordination among donors and other stakeholders. Although interviewees’ perspectives and some exemplar sport-for-development initiatives aligned with key features of <b>Sector</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Approaches,</b> significant challenges to their effective instigation in sport-for-development can be identified. Nevertheless, examining the applicability of <b>Sector</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Approaches</b> to sport-for-development raises important issues that require further consideration and demonstrates the necessity that sport-for-development, more generally, learns from the longer-established field of international development...|$|R

40|$|Improving {{maternal}} health is a Millennium Development Goal adopted at the 2000 Millennium Summit of the United Nations. As {{part of the}} improving {{maternal health}} in Tanzania, it has been recommended that skilled birth attendants be present at all births to help reduce the high maternal mortality ratio. However, utilization of these attendants varies across socio-economic groups. The government of Tanzania has repeatedly attempted to carry out health sector reforms (HSRs) to alleviate disparities in health service utilization. In particular, around 1999, HSRs were incorporated into two approaches, including Decentralization by Devolution and <b>Sector</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Approach.</b> This study aims to clarify the unresolved questions with little published evidence {{on the effect of}} HSRs on reducing disparities in utilization of skilled birth attendants across socio-economic groups over time. We used four cross-sectional datasets from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey: 1992, 1996, 1999, and 2004 / 05. Subjects included 14, 752 women of reproductive age (15 - 49 years) and data on the most recent birth in the 5 years before each survey. Logistic regression analysis was performed with the dependent variable of whether respondents utilized skilled birth attendants or not, and with the main independent variables of time and socio-economic group. Results showed that the disparity in utilization of skilled birth attendants was significantly decreased from 1999 to 2004 / 05. These findings suggest that the two strategies, Decentralization by Devolution and <b>Sector</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Approach,</b> in the process of HSRs are effective in reducing the disparities in utilization of skilled birth attendants among socio-economic groups...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The ICPD {{agenda of}} {{reproductive}} health was declared {{as the most}} comprehensive one, which had actually broadened the spectrum of reproductive health and drove the states to embark upon initiatives to improve reproductive health status of their populations. However, like all other countries, Pakistan also seems to have shifted focus of its policies and programs towards achieving MDGs. As a result, concepts highlighted in the ICPD got dropped eventually. In spite of specific goals on maternal and child mortalities in MDGs and all the investment and policy shift, Pakistan has {{still one of the}} highest maternal mortality ratios among developing countries. Lack of synchronized efforts, <b>sector</b> <b>wide</b> <b>approaches,</b> inter-sectoral collaboration, and moreover, the unmet need for family planning, unsafe abortions, low literacy rate and dearth of women empowerment are the main reasons. Being a signatory of both of the international agendas (ICPD and MDGs), Pakistan needed to articulate its policies to keep the balance between the two agendas. There are, however, certainly some common grounds which have been experimented by various countries and we can learn lessons from those best practices. An inter-sectoral cooperation and <b>sector</b> <b>wide</b> <b>approaches</b> would be required to achieve such ambitious goals set out in ICPD-Program of Action while working towards MDGs. There is a need of increasing resource allocation, strengthening primary health care services and emergency obstetric care and motivating the human resource employed in health sector by good governance. These endeavors should lead to formulate evidence based national policies, reproductive health services which are affordable, accessible and culturally acceptable and finally a responsive health system. </p...|$|R

Ownership has become a central indicator of global aid effectiveness since the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Simultaneously, donors have shifted towards a reliance on sectoral programme assistance which channels programme aid throughout whole sectors rather than using piecemeal projects.

40|$|MM - P&DMBeginning in {{the late}} 1990 ’s, the <b>Sector</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Approach</b> or SWAp has become an {{important}} part of development cooperation in the social sectors, particularly in health, education, and agriculture. Over the years, although the approach largely focused on government-donor collaboration there are indications that the approach could support the participation of civil society organisations. However, there is limited research regarding {{the extent to which the}} SWAp can support the participation of civil society organisations. Therefore, the primary purpose of this exploratory study is to gain a better understanding of the health sector government-donor platform (SWAp) as a mechanism for facilitating effective civil society participation in policy processes. Although no universally accepted definition of SWAp exists, the term refers to an approach in development cooperation largely representing a shift from a project-based approach to a programmatic focus in policy implementation. The study finds that the level of participation in the SWAp is limited to service-delivery issues whereas the advocacy and policy influence roles are marginal. Another important finding is that the SWAp structure and processes provide opportunities for civil society participation. However, these are underutilised by civil society organisations. Further, the report argues that the SWAp typifies a policy network. There appears to be limited recognition in literature and practice that the SWAp is a political structure with inherent challenges akin to policy networks. Given this scenario, it appears that this will remain the trend given the lack of coherence and intracoordination among civil society organisations in the policy network – the SWAp...|$|E

The human resources are the most important resources for delivering Millennium Development Goals. This fact was recognised by policy makers in the Uganda water and sanitation sector, who, with the support of their development partners commissioned the ‘Training For Real’ (TFR) action research project. The TFR project aimed at motivating human resource development managers in the sector and training providers to be responsive to the demands of employers and make professional development of water and sanitation sector staff more relevant. The activities of the TFR project comprised of setting up a sector HRD thematic group and enhancing their professional capacities; research into current practices of capacity development; survey of perceived impact of past training activities; organising forums that brought together key stakeholders in the sector with academics in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); piloting innovative methods of delivering capacity development; and support stakeholder institutions in information and knowledge management. These activities have paved way for a sector-wide framework for human resource development and capacity building, and this fits well with the trend existing in the Uganda water/sanitation sector of adopting <b>Sector</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Approaches</b> (SWAps) in management of the programmes...|$|R
40|$|Using {{research}} from country case studies, this paper offers {{insights into the}} range of institutional and structural changes in development assistance between 2005 and 2011, {{and their impact on}} the inclusion of a sexual and reproductive health and rights agenda in national planning environments. At a global level during this period, donors supported more integrative modalities of aid - <b>sector</b> <b>wide</b> <b>approaches,</b> poverty reduction strategy papers, direct budgetary support - with greater use of economic frameworks in decision-making. The Millennium Development Goals brought heightened attention to maternal mortality, but at the expense of a broader sexual and reproductive health and rights agenda. Advocacy at the national planning level was not well linked to programme implementation; health officials were disadvantaged in economic arguments, and lacked financial and budgetary controls to ensure a connection between advocacy and action. With increasing competency in higher level planning processes, health officials are now refocusing the post- 2015 development goals. If sexual and reproductive health and rights is to claim engagement across all its multiple elements, advocates need to link them to the key themes of sustainable development: inequalities in gender, education, growth and population, but also to urbanisation, migration, women in employment and climate change...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reflects}} on {{the potential of the}} OECD-DAC creditor reporting system to systematically capture flows of official development assistance (ODA) in support of realizing children 2 ̆ 019 s rights. The growth in modalities for delivering aid, including <b>sector</b> programmes, <b>sector</b> <b>wide</b> <b>approaches</b> (SWAPs), dedicated funds which encompass publicprivate partnerships such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as the OECD-DAC commitment to promote harmonization and simplification in the provision of ODA and promote government ownership through general budget support raises challenges to assessing ODA for children. The question also needs asking whether singling out and measuring direct assistance to children is meaningful. The paper goes on to analyse ODA trends for basic social services. It shows that ODA to basic social services as a proportion of total ODA has been on an upward trend during the 1995 - 2004 period, particularly since 2000, the year in which the Millennium Summit set out the Millennium Agenda including the Millennium Development Goals. It shows that ODA to combat HIV and address AIDS infections has increased rapidly since 2000, but does not alone explain the overall increased aid share for basic social services. The analysis further confirms that social sector programmes and SWAPs are on the rise but still account only for a small portion of total ODA to basic social services although a number of such programmes are targeted specifically to basic services. 2 ̆ 013 ODA; basic social services; sector programmes; SWAP...|$|R
