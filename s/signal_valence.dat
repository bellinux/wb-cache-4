40|$|Existing {{research}} suggests that voters tend to respond positively to legislator independence due to two types of mechanism. First, dissent has an indirect effect, increasing a legislator’s media coverage and personal recognition among constituents (profile effects). Second, constituents react positively to dissent when this signals that the legislator has matching political or representational preferences (conditional evaluation). We argue for a third effect: dissent acts as a <b>valence</b> <b>signal</b> of integrity and trustworthiness. Consistent with the <b>valence</b> <b>signalling</b> mechanism, we use new observational and experimental {{evidence to show that}} British voters have a strong and largely unconditional preference for legislators who dissent.

Learning theory predicts {{that this may be}} due to a failure in the processing of external feedback. Method. We examined the performance of 29 OCD patients and 28 healthy volunteers on an associative learning task, in which initial learning is based solely on external feedback <b>signals.</b> Feedback <b>valence</b> was manipulated with monetary gains and losses. Results. As predicted, OCD patients were impaired during initial, external feedback-driven learning but not during later learning stages. The emotional salience of the feedback modulated learning during the initial stage in patients and controls alike. During later learning stages, however, patients approached near-normal performance with rewarding feedback but continued to produce deficient learning with punishing feedback. Conclusion. OCD patients have a fundamental impairment in updating behavior based on the external outcome of their actions, possibly mediated by faulty error signals in response selection processes...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{decision-making}} {{is guided}} by evaluating the outcomes of previous decisions. Prediction errors are theoretical teaching signals which integrate two features of an outcome: its inherent value and prior expectation of its occurrence. To uncover the magnetic signature of prediction errors in the human brain we acquired magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data while participants performed a gambling task. Our primary objective was to use formal criteria, based upon an axiomatic model (Caplin and Dean, 2008 a), to determine the presence and timing profile of MEG signals that express prediction errors. We report analyses at the sensor level, implemented in SPM 8, time locked to outcome onset. We identified, for the first time, a MEG signature of prediction error, which emerged approximately 320  ms after an outcome and expressed as an interaction between outcome valence and probability. This signal followed earlier, separate <b>signals</b> for outcome <b>valence</b> and probability, which emerged approximately 200  ms after an outcome. Strikingly, {{the time course of}} the prediction error signal, as well as the early <b>valence</b> <b>signal,</b> resembled the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN). In simultaneously acquired EEG data we obtained a robust FRN, but the win and loss signals that comprised this difference wave did not comply with the axiomatic model. Our findings motivate an explicit examination of the critical issue of timing embodied in computational models of prediction errors as seen in human electrophysiological data...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 25 October 2017 Examining Board: Professor Andrea Mattozzi, EUI, Supervisor; Professor David K. Levine, EUI; Professor Ronny Razin, London School of Economics; Professor Alessandro Riboni, Ecole Polytechnique. My {{thesis is}} centred on the {{question}} of how information asymmetries affect elections. In particular, I am interested in how electoral concerns shape policy choices and in the consequences of institutional arrangements aimed to providing voters with information on politicians. In the first chapter I model a primary election, i. e. an election to choose a candidate. I show that if party members do not know the quality of candidates, high quality candidates distinguish themselves by proposing more extreme policies. As a result, introducing primary elections increases the quality of candidates but it might lead to policy polarization. The second chapter, which is my job market paper, develops a model in which a politician takes a repeated action over an issue and is evaluated by a voter through an election. I show that politicians who flip-flop, i. e. change their decision on the issue, are penalized by voters, because flip-flopping signals incompetence. As a result, politicians have an incentive to protect their reputation by inefficiently sticking to their initial policy choice. This decreases the quality of both policy and electoral choices. The paper also discusses how changes in transparency and term limits can discipline the behaviour of politicians. My third and final chapter describes a media market in which a set of news outlets compete to break a news concerning a politician in office; after receiving a signal of whether the politician is corrupt, media outlets can either fact-check and learn the truth, or publish the news immediately. We show that increasing the number of outlets competing in the market results in less fact-checking and more fake corruption scandals being published. By making the re-election of honest incumbents more difficult, the increase in competition might therefore be detrimental to social welfare.

Evidence indicates that mindfulness-based approaches reduce reward anticipation signal in the striatum to negative and positive incentives suggesting the hypothesis that such training influence basic reward processing. Using a passive conditioning task and fMRI {{in a group of}} experienced mindfulness meditators and age-matched controls, we tested the hypothesis that mindfulness meditation influence reward and reward prediction error signals. We found diminished positive and negative prediction error-related blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the putamen in meditators compared with controls. In the meditators, this decrease in striatal BOLD responses to reward prediction was paralleled by increased activity in posterior insula, a primary interoceptive region. Critically, responses in the putamen during early trials of the conditioning procedure (run 1) were elevated in both meditators and controls. These results provide evidence that experienced mindfulness meditators show attenuated reward prediction <b>signals</b> to <b>valenced</b> stimuli, which may be related to interoceptive processes encoded in the posterior insula...|$|R

An argument with your boss or a disrespectful employee may lower your internal coping adaptability, and negative valence emerges.

40|$|PURPOSE: Communication about {{feelings}} is a core {{element of}} human interaction. Aided augmentative and alternative communication systems must therefore include symbols representing these concepts. The symbols must be readily distinguishable {{in order for}} users to communicate effectively. However, emotions are represented within most systems by schematic faces in which subtle distinctions are difficult to represent. We examined whether background color cuing and spatial arrangement might help children identify symbols for different emotions. METHOD: Thirty nondisabled children searched for symbols representing emotions within an 8 -choice array. On some trials, a color cue <b>signaled</b> the <b>valence</b> of the emotion (positive vs. negative). Additionally, the symbols were either (a) organized with the negatively valenced symbols {{at the top and}} the positive symbols {{on the bottom of the}} display or (b) distributed randomly throughout. Dependent variables were accuracy and speed of responses. RESULTS: The speed with which children could locate a target was significantly faster for displays in which symbols were clustered by valence, but only when the symbols had white backgrounds. Addition of a background color cue did not facilitate responses. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid search was facilitated by a spatial organization cue, but not by the addition of background color. Further examination of the situations in which color cues may be useful is warranted...|$|R

In the present study we explore the nature of the underlying decay mechanism of 2 p core excited Co 2 in water by probing the nonradiative Auger type electron emission channel using photoelectron spectroscopy from a liquid microjet. Our measurements demonstrate unequivocally that metal to water charge transfer quenches fluorescence and will inevitably lead to a dip in the total fluorescence yield X ray absorption spectrum.

40|$|Judging sex from faces {{relies on}} cues related to facial {{morphology}} and spatial relations between features, whereas judging trustworthiness relies on both structural and expressive cues that <b>signal</b> affective <b>valence.</b> I will present evidence of both asymmetric and symmetric dependence between {{the processing of}} a face's sex and trustworthiness. In one study, we used event-related, fMRI-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to test whether 2 face-selective regions–right occipital face area (rOFA) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) –have functionally dissociable, critical roles in sex and trustworthiness judgments. Sex judgments were disrupted when rTMS was delivered over right OFA (relative to sham stimulation) but not when it was delivered over right or left pSTS, whereas trustworthiness judgments were disrupted when rTMS was delivered over right or left pSTS but not rOFA. Nonetheless, analysis of the reaction time distributions revealed a possible critical role also for rOFA in trustworthiness judgments, limited to faces with longer RTs, perhaps reflecting the later, ancillary use of structural cues related to {{the sex of the}} face. New evidence from an individual (DF) with lesions encompassing bilateral occipital cortex indicates that significantly above-chance discrimination of the sex and trustworthiness of faces is possible in the absence of OFA–but only for untrustworthy males and trustworthy females, consistent with the RT data of healthy participants in the TMS study. Further evidence of restricted dependence between perceptions of trustworthiness and sex is provided by a RT-interference experiment with neurologically healthy volunteers using the Garner paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Judging the sex {{of faces}} relies on cues related to facial {{morphology}} and spatial relations between features, whereas judging the trustworthiness of faces relies on both structural and expressive cues that <b>signal</b> affective <b>valence.</b> Right occipital face area (OFA) processes structural cues and {{has been associated with}} sex judgments, whereas posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) processes changeable facial cues related to muscle movements and is activated when observers judge trustworthiness. It is commonly supposed that STS receives inputs from OFA, yet it is unknown whether these regions have functionally dissociable, critical roles in sex and trustworthiness judgments. We addressed this issue using event-related, fMRI-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Twelve healthy volunteers judged {{the sex of}} individually presented faces and, in a separate session, whether those same faces were trustworthy or not. Relative to sham stimulation, reaction times (RTs) were significantly longer for sex judgments when rTMS was delivered over right OFA but not right or left STS, and for trustworthiness judgments on male but not female faces when rTMS was delivered over right STS or left STS but not right OFA. Nonetheless, an analysis of the RT distributions revealed a possible critical role also for right OFA in trustworthiness judgments, limited to faces with longer RTs, perhaps reflecting the later, ancillary use of structural cues related to the sex of the face.

40|$|In 1890, William James {{hypothesized}} that emotions are {{our perception of}} physiological changes. Many different theories of emotion have emerged since then, {{but it has been}} demonstrated that a specifically induced physiological state can influence an individual’s emotional responses to stimuli. In the present study, auditory and/or vibrotactile heartbeat stimuli were presented to participants (N = 24), and the stimuli’s effect on participants’ physiological state and subsequent emotional attitude to affective pictures was measured. In particular, we aimed to investigate the effect of the perceived distance to stimuli on emotional experience. Distant versus close sound reproduction conditions (loudspeakers vs. headphones) were used to identify whether an “embodied” experience can occur in which participants would associate the external heartbeat sound with their own. Vibrotactile stimulation of an experimental chair and footrest was added to magnify the experience. Participants’ peripheral heartbeat <b>signals,</b> selfreported <b>valence</b> (pleasantness) and arousal (activation) ratings for the pictures, and memory performance scores were collected. Heartbeat sounds significantly affected participants’ heartbeat, the emotional judgments of pictures, and their recall. The effect of distance to stimuli was observed in the significant interaction between the spatial location of the heartbeat sound and the vibrotactile stimulation, which was mainly caused by the auditory-vibrotactile interaction in the loudspeakers condition. This interaction might suggest that vibrations transform the far sound condition (sound via loudspeakers) in a close-stimulation condition and support the hypothesis that close sounds are more affective than distant ones. These findings have implications for the design and evaluation of mediated environments...|$|R

Wavelet decomposition was employed to extract EEG features from the time-frequency domain.

40|$|The {{amygdala}} codes the visual-gustatory/somatosensory valence {{for feeding}} behavior.

This implies that object <b>valence</b> <b>signals</b> derived from the amygdala may be crucial for feeding-related motor actions exerted by PMv. However, since no direct connectivity between the amygdala and PMv has been reported, the structural basis of their functional interactions still remains elusive. In the present study, we employed retrograde transneuronal labeling with rabies virus to identify the amygdalar origin and possible route of multisynaptic projections to PMv in macaque monkeys. Histological analysis of the distribution pattern of labeled neurons has found that PMv receives disynaptic input primarily from the basal nucleus, especially from its intermediate subdivision. It has also been revealed that the medial (e. g., the cingulate motor areas, CMA) and lateral (e. g., the insular cortices) cortical areas, and the cholinergic cell group 4 in the basal forebrain probably mediate the projections from the amygdala to PMv. Such multisynaptic pathways might represent amygdalar influences on PMv functions for feeding behavior...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{depression}} show an enhanced preoccupation with negative expectations {{and are often}} unable {{to look forward to}} positive events. Here we studied anticipatory emotional processes in unmedicated depressed patients using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Consistent with a negative processing bias, we hypothesized enhanced responses to negative and attenuated responses to positive expectancy cues in brain areas associated with emotional expectancy. Participants comprised 19 drug-free depressed patients and 19 matched healthy control subjects who viewed affective photographs. Pictures were preceded by an expectancy cue which <b>signaled</b> the emotional <b>valence</b> of the upcoming picture in half of the trials. Depressed patients showed attenuated blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses in the left lateral prefrontal cortex (inferior frontal gyrus, Brodmann area 44) during positive expectancy and—contrary to our hypothesis—in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (middle frontal gyrus, Brodmann area 47) during negative expectancy. This attenuation was specific for the anticipation (as opposed to the perception) of emotional pictures and correlated with a clinical measure of depressive symptoms. The observed attenuation suggests emotion-context insensitivity rather than a negative processing bias during anticipatory emotional processes in depression. This hyporeactivity may contribute to clinical features like anergia, apathy, and loss of motivation in the context of both positive and negative incentives...|$|R

Individual expressions of personality traits were measured using the NEO-PI-R questionnaire. Conscientiousness correlated positively with error signaling in the left inferior frontal gyrus and adjacent anterior insula (IFG/aI). A second strong positive correlation was observed in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC). Neuroticism was negatively correlated with error signaling in the inferior frontal cortex possibly reflecting the negative inter-correlation between both scales observed on the behavioral level. Under present statistical thresholds no significant results were obtained for remaining scales. Aligning the personality trait of Conscientiousness with task accomplishment striving behavior the correlation in the left IFG/aI possibly reflects an inter-individually different involvement whenever task-set related memory representations are violated by the occurrence of errors. The strong correlations in the ACC may indicate that more conscientious subjects were stronger affected by these violations of a given task-set expressed by individually different, negatively <b>valenced</b> <b>signals</b> conveyed by the ACC upon occurrence of an error.

40|$|This study investigates neural {{correlates}} of music-evoked fear and joy with fMRI. Studies on neural {{correlates of}} music-evoked fear are scant, {{and there are}} only a few studies on neural correlates of joy in general. Eighteen individuals listened to excerpts of fear-evoking, joy-evoking, as well as neutral music and rated their own emotional state in terms of valence, arousal, fear, and joy. Results show that BOLD signal intensity increased during joy, and decreased during fear (compared to the neutral condition) in bilateral auditory cortex (AC) and bilateral superficial amygdala (SF). In the right primary somatosensory cortex (area 3 b) BOLD signals increased during exposure to fear-evoking music. While emotion-specific activity in AC increased with increasing duration of each trial, SF responded phasically in the beginning of the stimulus, and then SF activity declined. Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI) analysis revealed extensive emotion-specific functional connectivity of AC with insula, cingulate cortex, as well as with visual, and parietal attentional structures. These findings show that the auditory cortex functions as a central hub of an affective-attentional network that is more extensive than previously believed. PPI analyses also showed functional connectivity of SF with AC during the joy condition, taken to reflect that SF is sensitive to social <b>signals</b> with positive <b>valence.</b> During fear music, SF showed functional connectivity with visual cortex and area 7 of the superior parietal lobule, taken to reflect increased visual alertness and an involuntary shift of attention during the perception of auditory signals of danger...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{the results of}} the photoemission {{spectroscopy}} for some rare earth compounds and thin film systems of 3 d transition metal have been described. Photoemission spectroscopy is very useful and direct method for studying both the electronic and magnetic structures of the systems. Synchrotron radiation {{plays an important role in}} the photoemission study where the higher photon flux, light polarization and selection of particular photon energy are advantageous. In order to perform the present experiments, the VGESCALAB 220 i-XL spectromicroscopy system was mainly used. During the present study, the improvement of the system has been performed as follows. First, a chamber for sample preparation and epitaxial growth of thin film was developed. The LEED optics, water-cooled evaporators, thickness monitor and magnetic coil were installed in that preparation chamber. The manipulator was also improved by constructing a He-cryostat for performing temperature dependent photoemission experiments. Several experiments were thus successfully carried out after finishing all those improvements. The performance of the cryostat was checked by measuring the core level photoemission in Eu-compound. The result will be shown in appendix part of the thesis. Core level photoemission studies of TmX compounds: One of the main parts of this thesis is to describe the study of the core level photoemission for rare earth TmX (X=S, Se and Te) compounds. Rare earth compounds are known to show their remarkably different physical, magnetic and electronic properties. Among these mixed-valent systems, TmS is known to be mostly trivalent, TmTe is mostly divalent and TmSe is intermediate valent. In the rare earth system, the well localized 4 f electrons are strongly interacted with the core hole in the final state of photoemission. The effect of this interaction shows multiplet splitting, lifetime broadening effect, exchange splitting and configuration interaction in the final state of photoemission. Interpretation of the core level photoemission through those final state effects gives the information of interaction between core hole and 4 f electrons. This interaction also depends on the nature of the wave function of core level and the valence shell. For TmX system, no systematic experiment of different core levels (Tm 4 d, 4 p, 5 p, 3 d) has been performed so far. In the present study, photoemission experiments including resonant effects were performed for these core levels in all TmX compounds. A rich information about the final state effects (mentioned above) and valence fluctuation in core level photoemission was obtained. Comparison with the calculation is also given to get better understanding of the experimental results. The results are summarized below. 　　 1. Tm 4 d shows multiplet structures and each multiplet shows different resonance enhancement depending on the excitation conditions around the Tm 3 d- 4 f absorption edges (hν= 1450 - 1550 eV). The lifetime broadening effect depending on the binding energy is present in both the on- and off-resonant photoemission. Through this experiment, the divalent and trivalent components in Tm 4 d were successfully separated and identified. 　　 2. In case of 5 p level, the values of spin-orbit splitting of two valences were estimated by the help of resonant effect and calculation. The values obtained from the present experiment are considered more reasonable than those of the previous reports. 　　 3. In case of 4 p XPS, the complex spectral features are explained by the configuration interaction phenomenon. 　　 4. Tm 3 d level was also measured for studying the effect of 3 d- 4 f interaction. It was found that the spin-orbit peaks are locally broadened due to the existence of multiplet structures. Photoemission study of magnetic thin films: It is now well known that the ultrathin films in nanometer range of 3 d-materials often show very interesting and striking magnetic properties different from the bulk. Magnetic dichroism in photoemission, where two spectra are taken for two different magnetized states or light polarization states, is considered to be one of the most powerful methods to study thin film magnetism. 1. Ni/Co system: The reasons why the Ni/Co system was studied are as the followings. At first, in order to get the information of pure Ni 3 d states without any interaction with the substrate, Co substrate was suitable rather than Cu. In the previous result of thinner Ni film on Cu(001), the Ni 6 eV satellite structures are overlapped with the tail of the broad Cu 3 d emission. Secondly, it is interesting to know whether the resonant effect (around the Ni 3 p- 3 d excitation region) on the magnetic dichroism <b>signal</b> for the <b>valence</b> band of Ni-thin film system occurs or not. Finally, it is very curious to study the capability of epitaxial growth and corresponding magnetic phases of Ni on ferromagnetic Co. The dichroism measurements of the Ni valence band photoemission conclude that the resonance effect is present on magnetic linear dichroism (MLD) for " 6 eV satellite". The present result is comparable with the previous MCDAD (Magnetic circular dichroism in angular distribution) results for bulk Ni (110) sample, but not MLDAD (L, linear) result. The MLD result of core level further shows that the Ni and Co are ferromagnetically coupled. The present result indicates that it is possible to magnetize the Ni film of 2. 3, 8 and 11 ML with in the surface plane (in-plane magnetization). 2. Oxidized Co film: The effect of oxidization for magnetic surface is very important in magnetism study. In order to study the modification of electronic and magnetic structures of oxidized Co film, the Co 2 p core level photoemission spectra were measured. It was found that the behavior of the early oxidization followed by saturated CoO formation was different depending on the Co-thickness. Thinner films are more reactive and show an earlier formation of Co 0 than that of thicker films. The present result is different from the previous one where thickness independent oxidization in the early stage was reported. In the present study, two types of CoO phase depending on the thickness were found. The CoO phases are two-dimensional (2 D) and three- dimensional (3 D). It is predicted that the generally accepted CoO 6 model for 3 D CoO phase might not be suitable for describing the core level spectra in case of 2 D CoO phase. Magnetic state of the oxidized Co film was studied by the MUDAD (U, unpolarized) measurement for Co 2 p level. MUDAD signal of Co 2 p level was found from the oxidized film even with higher exposure (40 L). The result is different from the previous one. The present result concludes that the MD signal for O(4 OL) /Co(5 ML) system probably is coming from the deeper and unaffected Co-site...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts of original experimental work, its evaluation, and in- terpretation. Its final goal is to investigate dynamical charge transfer (CT) at a hetero- molecular interface with resonant photoelectron spectroscopy (RPES). In order {{to achieve this goal}} preliminary studies have been necessary. First two hetero-molecular inter- faces that exhibit adequate structural properties as well as an appropriate photoelec- tron spectroscopy (PES) spectrum of the valence regime have been identified. The de- sired CT analysis with RPES of these hetero-molecular systems is then conducted {{on the basis of the}} knowledge gained by previous RPES studies of homo-molecular sys- tems. The characterization of hetero-molecular films on single crystal Ag surfaces in the first part of this thesis is performed with high resolution core level PES and valence PES. The reproduction of the core level PES data with reference spectra of homo-molecular films allows me to determine which molecule is in direct contact to the Ag surface and which one is situated in higher layers (not the first one). Due to the direct correspon- dence of core level and valence PES the assignment of features in the spectra of the latter technique can be achieved with the identification of the contributions extracted from the evaluation of the data of the former technique. It is found that the systems PTCDA on one monolayer (ML) of SnPc on Ag(111) and CuPc/ 1 ML PTCDA/Ag(111) are stable at 300 K which means that no significant layer exchange occurs for these systems. In contrast a vertical exchange of CuPc and PTCDA molecules is observed for PTCDA de- posited on top of 1 ML CuPc/Ag(111). Up to a coverage of approximately 0. 5 ML of PTCDA molecules these diffuse into the first layer, replace CuPc molecules, and con- sequently force them into higher layers. Above a coverage of approximately 0. 5 ML of PTCDA molecules these are also found in higher layers. The search for a promising system for the intended RPES study then leads to an investigation of hetero-molecular films with a combination of F 4 TCNQ and PTCDA molecules on Ag(110) within the same approach. Depositing F 4 TCNQ molecules onto a 1 ML PTCDA/Ag(110) film in the herringbone phase at 300 K results in an instable hetero-organic system which un- dergoes a layer exchange. Hereby PTCDA molecules in the first layer are replaced by F 4 TCNQ molecules similar to the behavior of the system PTCDA/ 1 ML CuPc/Ag(111). Switching the order of the preparation steps leads to a stable film of PTCDA/ 1. 0 ML F 4 TCNQ/Ag(110) at 300 K. Among the stable hetero-molecular films only the system CuPc/ 1 ML PTCDA/Ag(111) exhibits the required wetting growth of the first two layers at 300 K and a valence PES spectrum with energetically separable molecular orbital signals in the same intensity range. Thus this system is identified to be appropriate for a detailed analysis with RPES. The unexpected findings of vertical exchanges in the hetero-molecular films at 300 K motivate a study of the behavior at elevated temperatures for all systems investigated before. Therein it is revealed that annealing 1. 5 ML SnPc/ 1 ML PTCDA/Ag(111) and 1. 0 ML PTCDA/ 1 ML SnPc/Ag(111) to a temperature above the desorption temperature of molecules not in direct contact to the Ag(111) surface results in a 1 ML SnPc/Ag(111) film in both cases. Hence at elevated temperatures (approximately above 420 K) SnPc molecules replace PTCDA molecules in the first layer on Ag(111). At higher temper- atures (approximately above 470 K) PTCDA molecules and SnPc molecules situated above the first layer then desorb from the 1 ML SnPc/Ag(111) sample. Annealing all hetero-molecular films with CuPc and PTCDA molecules on Ag(111) to 570 K leads to a sample with CuPc and PTCDA molecules in the first and only layer. Depending on the initial CuPc coverage different ratios of both molecules are obtained. With a CuPc coverage of exactly 1 ML, or above, films with PTCDA coverages of approxi- mately 0. 1 – 0. 2 ML are produced. So at elevated temperatures CuPc molecules replace PTCDA molecules in the first layer of the system CuPc/ 1 ML PTCDA/Ag(111). Anal- ogously the layer exchange at 300 K for the system PTCDA/ 1 ML CuPc/Ag(111) is reversed at elevated temperatures. In the case of SnPc and CuPc coverages below 1 ML annealing vertical hetero-molecular systems with PTCDA on Ag(111) up to 570 K re- sults in a single layer of mixed hetero-molecular films with lateral long range order. In this way the system CuPc + PTCDA/Ag(111) is prepared and then characterized as a proper system for a detailed analysis with RPES. Additional annealing experiments of hetero-organic films consisting of F 4 TCNQ and PTCDA molecules on Ag(110) with an F 4 TCNQ coverage of 1. 0 ML (and above) end in a submonolayer (sub-ML) film of F 4 TCNQ/Ag(110) that exhibits a contribution of amorphous carbon. Consequently, it can be concluded that at elevated temperatures part of the F 4 TCNQ molecules decom- pose. In the second part of this thesis homo-molecular multilayer samples and (sub-) ML films on single crystalline metal surfaces are investigated with RPES in order to enable the final RPES study of vertical and lateral hetero-molecular interface systems. First a pho- ton energy (hν) dependent intensity variation of (groups of) molecular orbital signals of exemplary multilayer films (NTCDA and coronene) is studied and explained on the basis of the local character of the electronic transitions in near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy in combination with the real space probability den- sity of the contributing molecular orbitals. This simple approach is found to be able to correctly describe relative intensity variations by orders of magnitude while it fails for hν dependent relative intensity changes in the same order of magnitude. After that the hν dependent line-shape evolution of an energetically separated molecular orbital signal of a CuPc multilayer is discussed in relation to small molecules in the gas phase and explained with an effect of electron vibration coupling. Through a comparison of the hν dependent line-shape evolution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a CuPc with a SnPc multilayer the molecule specific character of this effect is identified. Then the same effect with either two (or more) electronic transitions or multiple coupling vibrational modes is observed for a coronene multilayer. Thereafter the influence of the adsorption on metal surfaces on this effect is studied and discussed with special emphasis on a possible contribution by features which are related to dynamical interface CT. For a sub-ML of SnPc/Au(111) no variation with respect to a SnPc multilayer film is detected while for a sub-ML of CuPc/Au(111) less intensity is distributed into the high binding energy (EB) part of the HOMO signal with respect to the corresponding multilayer film. In the RPES data of a sub-ML of coronene/Ag(111) a resonance specific variation of the hν dependent line-shape evolution of the HOMO signal is found by the revelation of a change of this effect with respect to the coronene multilayer data in only one of the two NEXAFS resonances. All these findings are consistently explained within one effect and a common set of parameters, namely all quantities that characterize the potential energy surfaces involved in the RPES process. Through that an alternative explanation that re- lies on dynamical CT can be excluded which influences the following CT analysis with RPES. Three criteria for such an analysis of dynamical interface CT with RPES are identified. In the system coronene on Ag(111) a low EB feature is related to metal-molecule inter- face CT through the assignment of a particular final state and hence named CT state. In the EB region of the frontier molecular orbital signals of the molecule-metal inter- face systems with a signal from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in direct valence PES a broad line-shape is measured in RPES. This finding is related to interface CT by a possible explanation that emerges through the comparison to the line- shape of the CT state. The constant kinetic energy (EK) features detected for several molecule-metal interfaces constitute the third criterion for a CT analysis with RPES. For the molecule-metal interface systems without a LUMO <b>signal</b> in direct <b>valence</b> PES the energy of these features can be calculated with the assignment of the responsible decay channel in combination with explicitly given simplifying assumptions. Through that the involvement of metal-molecule interface CT in the generation of these constant EK fea- tures is demonstrated. The RPES data of the lateral and the vertical hetero-molecular interface, identified in the first part, is then scanned for these three CT criteria. Thereby neither for the lateral hetero-molecular system CuPc + PTCDA/Ag(111) nor for the verti- cal hetero-molecular system CuPc/ 1 ML PTCDA/Ag(111) dynamical hetero-molecular interface CT can be confirmed. In the former system the molecule-metal interface in- teraction is found to dominate the physics of the system in RPES while in the latter system no hints for a significant hybridization at the CuPc-PTCDA interface can be revealedDiese Dissertation besteht aus zwei Hauptteilen, in denen neue experimentelle Ergeb- nisse präsentiert, ausgewertet und interpretiert werden. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, dynamischen Ladungstransfer an einer Heteroorganikgrenzfläche mit resonanter Pho- toelektronenspektroskopie (RPES) zu untersuchen. Um dies zu ermöglichen, musste erst eine solche Heteroorganikgrenzfläche, mit den geforderten strukturellen Eigenschaften, gefunden werden, die außerdem noch ein geeignetes Spektrum des Valenzbereichs in direkter Photoelektronenspektroskopie (PES) aufweist. Zusätzlich erforderte die ange- strebte Ladungstransferanalyse mit RPES vorausgehende RPES Messungen an homo-|$|R
