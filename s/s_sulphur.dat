By reactive sputtering with H 2 <b>S,</b> <b>sulphur</b> goes into the carbide to form a TiC x S y phase in an amorphous carbon matrix. The addition of sulphur lowers the friction against steel. Significantly lower friction is obtained against a tungsten counter-surface, as WS 2 is generated in the contact.

An extensive new dataset of S-isotope analyses from the Tyndrum area, together with correlation {{of the global}} Neoproterozoic sedimentary S-isotope dataset to the Dalradian stratigraphy, demonstrates a mixed sedimentary and magmatic sulphur source for the mineralization. δ 34 S values for early molybdenite- and later gold-bearing mineralization range from − 2 to + 12 ‰, but show distinct populations related to mineralization type. Modelling of the relative input of magmatic and sedimentary sulphur into gold-bearing quartz veins with δ 34 S values of + 12 ‰ indicates a maximum of 68 % magmatic sulphur, and that S-rich, SEDEX-bearing, Easdale Subgroup metasedimentary rocks lying stratigraphically above the host rocks represent the only viable source of sedimentary sulphur in the Dalradian Supergroup.

With polarisation modulation infrared spectroscopy we were able to monitor significant changes in the fingerprint region (900 - 1800 cm - 1) of the absorption modes of the SAMs, starting after a few days of exposure to natural light. We observed an exponential intensity decrease of modes indicating helical conformation of the SAM, as well as an exponential increase of modes indicating esters and formates suggesting a degradation of the SAM. X-ray photoelectron spectra of carbon C 1 <b>s</b> and <b>sulphur</b> <b>S</b> 2 p confirm the chemical nature of those changes. SAMs stored without light exposure show a drastically decreased change in the infrared spectra.

Since the XPS data do not show changes in the chemical structure, we assume disordering effects and dissolution of molecules in solution.

After the last extraction step (organic/sulphide fraction) a secondary Fe phase was formed. The change in chemical speciation of S and Fe occurring during sequential extraction procedure suggests indirect effects on trace metals associated to the FeS fraction that may lead to incorrect results.

The Pito Deep sheeted dyke complex has a similar composition to the sheeted dykes drilled at ODP Hole 504 B suggesting that the measured compositions are representative of sheeted dyke complexes at intermediate- to fast-spreading ridges. The dykes show only small increases in ? 34 S which, combined with the rock dominated d 34 S of vent fluids, requires the majority of seawater sulphate to be precipitated as anhydrite before the fluid reacts with the sheeted dyke complex. This loss of sulphate from the fluid means that a much higher Fe 2 O 3 in the sheeted dyke complex than in fresh MORB glasses cannot be explained by oxidation due to seawater sulphate reduction during fluid-rock reaction. Instead, oxidation probably occurs due to degassing of reduced species, largely H 2, during dyke emplacement and solidification. A mass balance model that accounts for anhydrite precipitation and Sr partitioning into the anhydrite, as well as fitting the concentration and isotopic ratios of S and Sr in the sheeted dykes and vent fluids, suggests water/rock ratios of ? 1.

Two lysimeter experiments were conducted in central Italy in two subsequent seasons on two commercial durum wheat cultivars to investigate the effects on yield, S and N uptake and leaching of different rates of N and S fertilisers, soil type and split applications of <b>S.</b> <b>Sulphur</b> fertiliser increased grain yield and N and S uptake of both varieties. Grain yield increase was mainly due to an increase {{of the number of}} kernels per spike, which was interpreted as a stimulation of the initiation of spikelets and/or florets, or to a reduction the floret mortality. As an average of the two seasons, S leaching during wheat cycle was 35 kg S ha− 1. Sulphur fertiliser rate increased S concentration in drainage water and consequently S leached during wheat cycle. Compared to unfertilised control, S leached was by 13 kg ha− 1 higher at 60 kg S ha− 1 and by 19 kg ha− 1 higher at 120 kg S ha− 1. The splitting of sulphur fertiliser during crop cycle modified both grain yield and S leaching. The highest grain yield and S plant uptake was obtained with the splitting of S rate into 60 kg S ha− 1 before seeding and 60 kg S ha− 1 at stem elongation and the lowest amount of S lost by leaching occurred with the application of 36 kg S ha− 1 before seeding and 84 kg S ha− 1 at stem elongation. Sulphur output was equally accounted for by leaching and plant uptake. The input–output balance of S was positive in both experiments only when the higher S rate was applied, as more S was imported than removed.

Sulphate leaching decreased significantly during the 3 years, and the concentration of drainage water was lowered 1. 8  5. 5 times in the third year.

40|$|Ganglion {{cell death}} in {{glaucoma}} {{is caused by}} a variety of insults that include ischemia, insufficient neurotrophic support and oxidative stress. Experimental studies were therefore conducted on cell cultures to determine how serum deprivation (to mimic insufficient neurotrophic support) or oxidative glutamate toxicity (GB), cause oxidative stress and induce retinal cell death. Moreover, studies were carried out to deduce whether selected sulphur containing compounds can blunt any negative influences to cells in culture and/or a defined ischaemic insult to the rat retina in situ, as this might suggest their use for the treatment of glaucoma. Serum deprivation and GB caused generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis-like death to transformed retinal ganglion cells (RGC- 5 cells). RGC- 5 cells were more susceptible to the detrimental effects of GB than serum deprivation. RGC- 5 cells subjected to serum deprivation appear to die by mechanisms that resemble classical apoptosis more closely than that caused by GB and the phase between the maximal generation of ROS and cell death were different. Cell death caused by serum deprivation was caspase-dependent but {{this was not the case}} for GB. Moreover, of the two sulphur compounds sulbutiamine and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), sulbutiamine blunts the effect of serum deprivation more effectively. In addition, the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk attenuated the negative effect of serum deprivation to RGC- 5 cells while the necroptosis inhibitor (necrostsatin- 1) counteracted solely the insult of GB. The sulphur containing compounds, ACS 1 and ACS 67 which release hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) slowly and NAC (a pro-cysteine GSH precursor) attenuated GB-induced cell death of RGC- 5 cells. In contrast, sulbutiamine (a lipophilic thiolic thiamine derivative) was particularly effective in protecting RGC- 5 cells from an insult of serum deprivation. Moreover, all of the sulphur compounds directly sequestered different types of ROS but with varying efficiency. Common features by which all tested sulphur containing agents seem to elicit a mode of action include the stimulation of GSH and the antioxidant enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as well as to scavenge excess free radicals. Moreover, the slow release of H 2 S from the ACS compounds appears to protect cells from oxidative stress through increasing the level of GSH, modulation of the cystine uptake transporter xCT, stimulation of the oxidative stress related transcription factor Nrf 2 and the stimulation of pro-survival signalling pathways. The slow releasing H 2 <b>S</b> <b>sulphur</b> compound ACS 67 also counteracts a number of detrimental influences to the rat retina in situ because of ischemia/reperfusion that includes damage to their ganglion cells.

A survey of 20 hotels was carried out to collect three years' energy consumption data. Regression analysis indicated that gross floor area was a major and statistically accepted factor in explaining diesel oil consumption. Diesel oil consumption had reduced from the early 1990 s and stabilised by the late 1990 <b>s.</b> The <b>sulphur</b> dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide and particulate pollution created by the hotel industry's diesel oil usage from 1990 to 1999 is estimated. The findings indicate that existing green measures and devices are passive and depend on the assimilation of the atmosphere. Environmental costs have stabilised at about HK$ 54, 000 per annum. More proactive approaches to reduce usage and environmental impacts are proposed. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R
40|$|H 2 S is a {{by-product}} of processing natural gas and refining high sulphur crude oils. Sulphur recovery is the conversion of hydrogen sulphide (H 2 <b>S)</b> to elemental <b>sulphur.</b> The Claus process {{is the most common}} sulphur recovery process used. Sulphur recovery plants {{may or may not be}} located at the processing or refining sites. If this method is used to estimate emissions from sulphur recovery plants associated with natural gas processing, they should be coded under SNAP code 050301 (chapter B 531) ...|$|R
40|$|Finnish-lake and fish-status surveys {{indicated}} that 4900 small headwater lakes suffered from acidic deposition and 1600 – 3200 roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) populations were affected or extinct {{by the end}} of 1980 s. Since the late 1980 <b>s,</b> successful <b>sulphur</b> emission reductions in Europe have induced a chemical recovery of acidified lakes. This resulted in decreases in sulphate and labile aluminium concentrations and increases in pH and alkalinity during the 1990 s. The first signs of recovery in affected perch populations were observed in the early 1990 s. New strong year-classes appeared and the population structure returned to normal. Little if any recovery of the affected populations of the more acid-sensitive species, roach, was recorded. This may have been due to still critical water quality conditions for successful reproduction of sensitive roach and/or organic acid episodes in the 2000 s, suppressing the recovery of buffering capacity...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{structural}} and electronic properties of Se- and S-passivated GaAs(I 0 0) surface reconstructions are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) based methods. We have performed total energy minimization of several model geometries of the reconstructed surfaces at different stoichiometry. The common {{feature is the}} appearance of a chalcogen layer on top of the Ga terminated surface, forming a Ga-chalcogenid like monolayer. In the case of selenium (Se), monomeric first layer formation is predicted, while in extrem chemically circumstances the <b>sulphur</b> (<b>S)</b> passivated surface can also reconstruct forming S-dimers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract - The herbage <b>sulphur</b> (<b>S)</b> {{content on}} 28 organic farms was {{monitored}} {{in order to}} evaluate the S supply for plants and ruminants in organic livestock production. The S content and the protein content were generally low. S fertilisation improved the yield and protein content of red clover only when the initial S supply was very low. Increasing S application rates did not increase the S content of red clover above a certain level that depended on other soil and environmental factors. Instead {{of an increase in}} the shoots with increasing S supply, there was an accumulation of S in the roots...|$|R
