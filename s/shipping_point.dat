5|$|Located on {{the banks}} of the Mississippi River on the second Chickasaw Bluff, the {{topology}} of Randolph provided for an ideal harbor for steamboats and flatboats at all stages of the river. Randolph became the center of steamboat commerce in Tennessee and an important cotton <b>shipping</b> <b>point</b> in the 1830s. The town was an early rival of Memphis over commercial superiority on the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|George Tennant, born in 1765 {{and the son}} of a {{solicitor}} in Lancashire, {{moved to}} the area in 1816, after he had bought the Rhydings estate. The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's distraint, but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of , which would gain access to the river Neath through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across Crymlyn Bog, he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would provide a better <b>shipping</b> <b>point</b> than Neath or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him.|$|E

50|$|On April 4, 1863 Colonel William Averill and his 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry {{were sent}} to reconnoiter <b>Ship</b> <b>Point’s</b> {{garrison}} and defenses. When he returned that evening he reported that the place was abandoned and there were enough barracks for 3000 soldiers. General McClellan had particular interest in <b>Ship</b> <b>Point.</b> It is apparent from his reports {{that he was going}} to attempt to take <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> by force had it not already been abandoned by the Confederates. In his April 5 report he mentioned that <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> had been turned and was in control of his cavalry. <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> was to serve the Union army in three ways. They used it as a supply depot, a point of debarkation, and as a hospital. <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> figured highly in the General McClellan's plan to seize Yorktown. Troops would travel by ship from Alexandria to Fort Monroe then on to <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> where they would be marched to the Union lines in Yorktown.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> {{hospital}} {{has been described}} as a large log building. The <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> hospital was mainly used as a Civil War version of an evac hospital. Patients were taken from the battlefield to the hospital and then embarked on ships to Alexandria. War records reveal that many soldiers died while at the <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> hospital. Steamers that had been converted to hospital ships were anchored in Chisman's Creek and the Poquoson River. After Yorktown fell <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> was no longer needed as a supply depot or embarkation site. The hospital continued operation until late May. The area remained behind Union lines for the remainder of the Civil War.|$|R

25|$|However the {{economic}} situation at the time did not permit Qasim to nationalize the IPC – western nations had boycotted Iranian oil when Mossadeq nationalized its oil company and {{could be expected to}} do the same in this case. (It is likely that nationalization would have been Qasim's favored route had he had the necessary capabilities). Further, Iraqis lacked the technical and managerial capabilities to run the IPC. Qasim needed the oil revenues to run his government and to keep the military satisfied. Therefore, Qasim resorted to many other tactics including increasing transit rates at Basra by 1,200%. In response, the IPC stopped producing oil that used Basra as a <b>shipping</b> <b>point.</b> The ensuing confrontation was the lowest point in relations between the two up to this point.|$|E
25|$|Established by cattlemen as a stock <b>shipping</b> <b>point</b> on the Texas and Pacific Railway in 1881, {{the city}} was named after Abilene, Kansas, the {{original}} endpoint for the Chisholm Trail. The T had bypassed the town of Buffalo Gap, the county seat at the time. Eventually, a landowner north of Buffalo Gap, Clabe Merchant, known {{as the father of}} Abilene, chose the name for the new town. According to a Dallas newspaper, about 800 people had already begun camping at the townsite, before the lots were sold. The town was laid out by Colonel J. Stoddard Johnson, and the auction of lots began early on March 15, 1881. By {{the end of the first}} day, 139 lots were sold for a total of $23,810, and another 178 lots were sold the next day for $27,550.|$|E

25|$|Other {{agricultural}} products cultivated in the Coachella Valley include fruits and vegetables, especially table grapes, citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit; onions and leeks; and peppers. The valley floor served to grow bounties of alfalfa, artichokes, avocados, beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, corn, cotton, cucumbers, dandelions (salad greens), eggplant, figs, grains (i.e. barley, oats, rye and wheat; plus rice fields kept wet or moist in the Salton Sea area), hops, kohlrabi, lettuce, mangoes, nectarines and peaches, persimmons, plums and prunes, pomegranate, potatoes, radishes, spinach, strawberries, sugar cane, tomatoes, {{a variety of}} herbs and spices, and other vegetable crops. The Coachella grapefruit originated in the region. The city of Coachella is the primary <b>shipping</b> <b>point</b> for agricultural goods. Domesticated grasses, flowers and trees are widely grown for warm-weather or desert climates, and sold for use in golf courses and landscape.|$|E
25|$|High Point was {{an early}} center for the {{development}} of the furniture industry in the South. Functional furniture had been produced on a small scale since the 17th century by artisans of English ancestry who had settled in North Carolina. As the farming landscape of the South began to change with the end of the Civil War and slavery, cheap labor became available during the Reconstruction Era. The North Carolina furniture industry gained momentum in the late 19th century, and developers were attracted to High Point for its location, transportation, and cheap labor. The city was situated ideally in the center of the Piedmont region with access to vast hardwood forests in the central and western parts of the state. High Point, located at the junction of the railroad and a main state road, was an ideal centralized <b>shipping</b> <b>point</b> for the southern market. An agricultural depression of the 1890s drove farm workers from the countryside to developing towns like High Point looking for industrial jobs.|$|E
25|$|After {{shakedown}} training out of New London, Greenling departed 7 March 1942 for the Pacific. She arrived Pearl Harbor 3 April {{and sailed}} 20 April {{for her first}} war patrol, in the Marshall Islands and Caroline Islands. The submarine attacked the cargo ship Seia Maru four times 30 April – 1 May off Eniwetok, but due to faulty torpedoes {{was not able to}} sink her. The tenacious submarine even closed for a night gunfire attack in an attempt to cripple her adversary. Finally forced by Japanese aircraft to break off the attack, Greenling turned her attention to the huge Japanese base at Truk. As the Japanese converged on the Solomon Islands, Truk became a busy <b>shipping</b> <b>point</b> and a fertile ground for submarine operations. The submarine recorded her first kill 4 May when she hit cargo ship Kinjosan Maru amidships, breaking her in two. As the Japanese were turned back in the important Battle of the Coral Sea (history's first carrier air battle), Greenling attempted to intercept the retiring enemy units, but her speed was no match for the fast Japanese heavy units. The submarine departed the Truk area 4 June, the day of Japan's first great naval defeat at the Battle of Midway, and arrived at Pearl Harbor 16 June.|$|E

25|$|In 1866, Nelson Story {{traveled}} to Texas and spent $10,000 for 1000 (some accounts indicate possibly {{as many as}} 3000) head of Longhorn cattle. 1866 was {{the first year after}} the end of the American Civil War and the economy of Texas, as in the rest of the former Confederacy, was devastated. However there were significant numbers of cattle roaming Texas which could be had for very little money. Also, there was great demand for beef in the northern states along with money to pay for it. So many returning Confederate soldiers begged or borrowed a stake to get a herd together. Many others signed on as trail drive cowboys. Give or take, about 260,000 cattle were driven north from Texas that summer toward the nearest rail <b>shipping</b> <b>point</b> at Sedalia, Missouri in hopes of selling them there for a quick profit. To reach Sedalia, the cattle first had to be driven through the territory which was to become Oklahoma, but which at the time was the Indian Territory. This was the domain of the remnants of the Five Civilized Nations who had survived the Trail of Tears. While the tribes previously had tolerated the passage of a few herds, an exodus of this magnitude threatened their ability to support their own grazing cattle. Rather than blocking the herds entirely, they decided to charge 10 cents a head for passage. The drovers mostly paid the fee.|$|E

5000|$|The Poquoson River {{became a}} {{strategic}} location {{for both sides}} during the Peninsula Campaign early in the Civil War. A Confederate garrison that became known as [...] "Camp Misery" [...] due to its swampy location was established at <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> where Chisman Creek meets the Poquoson River near its mouth. In the spring of 1862, Union General George B. McClellan put together a plan {{to end the war}} early by marching up the peninsula from Union held Fort Monroe and taking Richmond. General John Bankhead Magruder and the Army of the Peninsula were charged with attempting to stop McClellan. Magruder's plan was to establish three lines of defense stretched across the Peninsula. The first line extended from <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> on the Poquoson River to Young's Mill in Warwick County and was anchored in the center by earthworks in the Howard's Mill area. This line was not intended to completely stop the Union soldiers, but to stall them long enough for other fortifications to be built and additional reinforcements to arrive. The second line of defense extended from Yorktown to Mulberry Island. The third consisted of a series of redoubts in the Williamsburg area. <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> was of strategic importance due to its location. <b>Ship</b> <b>Point</b> also had a landing where supplies could be brought in by water from the Chesapeake Bay. The Confederates were also worried about the Union Army going around the first defense line and attacking from the rear or flank so three cannons were positioned where they could fire on any the Union vessels attempting to sail into the mouth of the Poquoson River. The camp was evacuated as the Union forces began their siege of Yorktown and the Confederate forces fell back to the second line of defense.|$|R
