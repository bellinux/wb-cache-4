The competitive season {{started with a}} 90–83 victory away to the previous season's play-off winners, the Newcastle Eagles on 21 September. The two sides had collected nine of the last ten pieces of BBL silverware between them, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the start the Guildford Heat needed in their bid to retain the League title.|$|E
500|$|When {{deciding}} on musicians {{to perform on}} the album, Moore said that he [...] "picked people who were around". His girlfriend, Bige Akdeniz, performed vocals, Theron Patterson did programming and Patterson's drum teacher, Utku Ünal, performed the drums. The only musician Moore actively sought out was guitarist Erdem Helvacıoğlu, who performed on one track. Moore noted {{that none of the}} music was technically demanding, [...] "it's just more of a feel that we’re going for <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a matter of getting comfortable and getting in the mood and playing stuff together." ...|$|E
500|$|During filming, Roth held {{a grudge}} against Heston {{due to his}} work with the National Rifle Association: [...] "It was very {{difficult}} for me. On one level, there's the man and he's my dad. But on the other level, the whole NRA thing is what it is now. I'm so against it, very vocally so. But it was inappropriate for the workplace. If I'm going to talk to him, I'll talk to him outside the workplace. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> two guys in makeup doing a scene." [...] Roth later claimed he would not have appeared in the film had he known he would be sharing a scene with Heston.|$|E

500|$|On {{her social}} media website Littlemonsters.com, Gaga later {{corrected}} the song title, {{saying that it}} is actually [...] "G.U.Y.", an acronym for [...] "Girl Under You". She also revealed that the song was written and produced with musician Zedd, who had been touring with Gaga for her Born This Way Ball. Zedd had previously done a remix of her single [...] "Marry the Night" [...] for her remix album, , and Gaga had contributed vocals on an alternate version of Zedd's track, [...] "Stache". The musician told MTV News that they [...] "both love nothing more than making music, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> kind of natural for us to just work on music". He also confirmed that around ten songs were composed with Gaga and was almost finished, although he was not sure which would be available on the final track list for Artpop.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|The King of Limbs artwork {{was created}} by Yorke and Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Radiohead since their second album, The Bends (1995). Donwood [...] {{intended}} to paint oil portraits of the Radiohead members in the style of Gerhard Richter, but abandoned the idea as [...] "I'd never painted with oils before and I'm not Gerhard Richter <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a series of painted disasters." [...] As with previous Radiohead albums, Donwood worked on the artwork as the band recorded nearby; the music made Donwood think of [...] "immense multicoloured cathedrals of trees, with music echoing from the branches whilst strange fauna lurked in the fog." [...] The final artwork was influenced by Northern European fairy tales and their association with nature and woods. He and Yorke drew trees with eyes, limbs, mouths and familiars, creating [...] "strange, multi-limbed creatures that are neither malevolent or benevolent, they're simply there, part of the living spirit of the forest." ...|$|E

500|$|From 2004 to 2007, Higgins' sexual {{orientation}} {{was the subject}} of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews. In an October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine Cherrie, she was asked if she fell under the moniker of [...] "not-so-straight" [...] girls. She replied [...] "Um, yeah, definitely. ... I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." [...] In November her Myspace page reported, [...] "I've been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'". She {{went on to say that}} she wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality. In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Higgins said that her song [...] "Secret" [...] was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable, at first, about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

They say 'You either believe it or not, {{this is the way it}} is' and that's not the way the world works. <b>So,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> an easy target to use, to be anti-establishment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{decided to}} try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After {{recording}} some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including [...] "Something In The Way She Moves," [...] to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: [...] "I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great [...] and he came and played live, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> like, 'Wow, he's great.'" [...] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for [...] "opening the door" [...] to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, [...] "I knew {{from the first time}} that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor in}} the change of the band's sound was due to Wilson's meeting of Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. The two met when Geffen, a fan of Wilson's music, invited Porcupine Tree on a tour in 2000 {{in support of the}} band's {{previous}} album, Lightbulb Sun. Touring together lead to a separate musical collaboration named Blackfield. Geffen, not being a fan of metal music, kept that project in more of a pop rock genre, sounding more like prior Porcupine Tree albums Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. This gave Wilson an outlet for that side of his music, allowing him to concentrate on more metal sounds with Porcupine Tree without abandoning the prior genre altogether either. Rounding out the changes was the departure of drummer Chris Maitland, with the replacement being Gavin Harrison, who joined in early 2002. Maitland was unable to make a larger commitment with being signed to a major record label, and the band found Harrison's style more fitting to a more metal-sounding album. Wilson summarized the band's changes at the time as: In Absentia was all written before Gavin came on; even the drum parts were kind of programmed. But it’s one of those times sometimes in life when everything comes together. I’d written these songs and I was very much more interested at that time—having worked with Opeth—in the idea of combining a more kind of brutal or metal aspect back again into the fabric of the music. At the same time Gavin came along and Gavin was a very different drummer to our previous drummer, Chris Maitland. He was much more of a powerhouse and he was much more technical. He had more of a contemporary edge to his sound <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one of those really lucky things that he just came in and he played those songs and just blew everyone away and everything just kind of came together. And of course it was the first record we made for our new label and we got signed to a big American label for the first time [...] Gavin was the final piece of that equation in a way—he just totally raised the bar in terms of not just the drumming but just the musicianship right throughout the band. Everyone was listening to Gavin and saying, “Fuck, wow. We really need to step up our game.” ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{would have}} thought it much more like a little girl in a book to have done no lessons, but have sat thinking, and perhaps reading the Bible all day; but on the whole Elizabeth had hardly {{thoughts}} enough to last her so long; nor was she deep or serious enough to have done herself much good by keeping the Bible open before her. In fact she did lose her verse in merely reading the chapter for the day! <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as well that she had something to do that was not play, and that was a duty, and thus might give the desire to be good something to bear upon.|$|E

"We are to go {{on board}} at Gravesend," [...] he said, [...] "for they are searching all ships bound for foreign ports. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not for you especially, but there are {{supposed}} to be many Jacobites going to and fro, and they will lay hands on anyone who cannot give a satisfactory account of himself. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as well for us to avoid questioning." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2017, Calm Air {{cancelled}} flights due to [...] "wet and soupy" [...] {{conditions on}} the gravel runway.

60|$|On {{the upper}} plane, the lungs and heart are {{controlled}} from the cardiac plane and the thoracic ganglion.

6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} do," [...] said Lady Ongar. [...] "He has {{told me that you}} do, and what he says is always true. It was here, on this spot, that I gave him back his troth to me, and told him that I would have none of his love, because he was poor. That is barely two years ago. Now he is poor no longer. Now, had I been true to him, a {{marriage}} with him would have been, in a prudential point of view, all that any woman could desire. I gave up the dearest heart, the sweetest temper, ay, and the truest man that, that-- Well, you have won him instead, and he has been the gainer.

6000|$|Now, I {{deny that}} the public ever demanded any such thing--ever repudiated the Missouri Compromise, ever {{commanded}} its repeal. I deny it, and call for the proof. It is not contended, I believe, that any such command has ever been given in express terms. It is only {{said that it was}} done in principle. The support of the Wilmot Proviso is the first fact mentioned to prove that the Missouri restriction was repudiated in principle, and the second is the refusal to extend the Missouri line over the country acquired from Mexico. These are near enough alike to be treated together. The one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump, and the other was to reject a division of it, by which one half was to be given up to those chances. Now, whether this was a repudiation of the Missouri line in principle depends upon whether the Missouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended over the country acquired from Mexico. I contend it did not. I insist that it contained no general principle, but that it was, in every sense, specific. That its terms limit it to the country purchased from France is undenied and undeniable. It could have no principle beyond the intention of those who made it. They did not intend to extend the line to country which they did not own. If they intended to extend it in the event of acquiring additional territory, why did they not say <b>so?</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as easy to say that [...] "in all the country west of the Mississippi which we now own, or may hereafter acquire, there shall never be slavery," [...] as to say what they did say; and they would have said it if they had meant it. An intention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law, but is not mentioned in any contemporaneous history. Both the law itself, and the history of the times, are a blank as to any principle of extension; and by neither the known rules of construing statutes and contracts, nor by common sense, can any such principle be inferred.|$|E
