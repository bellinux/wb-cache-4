40|$|To {{comprehend}} the special relativity genesis, one should unfold Einstein’s activities in quantum theory first. His victory upon Lorentz’s approach {{can only be}} understood in the wider context of a general programme of unification of classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics, with relativity and quantum theory being merely its <b>subprogrammes.</b> Because {{of the lack of}} quantum facets in Lorentz’s theory, Einstein’s programme, which seems to surpass the Lorentz’s one, was widely accepted as soon as quantum theory became a recognized part of physics. 	A new approach to special relativity genesis enables to broaden the bothering “Trinity” group of its creators to include Gilbert N. Lewis. Notwithstanding that the links necessarily existing between all the 1905 papers were obscured by Einstein himself due to the reasons discussed below, Lewis revealed from the very beginning the connections between special relativity and quasi-corpuscular theory of light, as he punctuated: “The consequences which one of us obtained from a simple assumption as to the mass of a beam of light, and the fundamental conservation of mass, energy and momentum, Einstein has derived from the principle of relativity and the electromagnetic theory”	(Lewis G.

The DSP in rural and urban areas reduces time children spent on paid and unpaid work, and increases the highest grade completed by boys in urban areas. On the other hand, AEP in rural areas was effective in reducing child work for pay and total work, increasing time girls spent on schooling and the highest grade completed by girls...|$|R

Motivations to adopt bioenergy include: energy security, {{economic development and}} international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These opportunities also raise concerns including the influence that expanding biofuel production may have on deforestation rates. Well-guided policies may help address this concern. This country report includes {{an analysis of the}} legal and institutional frameworks that underpin Mexico’s bioenergy sector, including provisions of policies, laws and regulations. The Mexican legal framework is well defined. The policy framework is a top-down structure with national plans at the top, linked to several sector and ministerial plans, which are finally linked to specific programmes. These programmes include strategies and <b>subprogrammes</b> that need to be developed in order to target feedstock, production, trade and sustainability objectives. Only a few sets of laws specifically address biofuels, and these focus on activities in the energy sector and disregard the implications for potential deforestation. Mexico has already documented priority tasks and goals, but documentation on programme details or in-depth analysis of plans, beyond simple statements, are still not fully available. Further efforts are required in the effects in agriculture and to the environment if we seek to avoid deforestation while promoting large-scale development of biofuels in Mexico.

While some areas show evidence of a clear deficit in mass balance, for instance the Antarctic Peninsula, the difference between accumulation and ablation in other areas seems to be small and even the sign is not evident. While ice thickness and surface velocities can be determined by means of remote sensing, radio-echo sounding and satellite picture interferometry, accumulation and ablation have to be measured in-situ using snow pits, firn/ice cores, and depth sounders under ice shelves or in ice sheets. Remote sensing techniques can be easily applied for large areas while in-situ measurements will always be restricted to isolated point measurements and therefore are of limited areal density. In our contibution we will focus on the mass flux of Shirasebreen determined from recent data analysis of our radio-echo sounding flight and satellite picture interferometry.

In the real research the attention to consideration of the program documents directed on improvement of quality of life of the population on the example of the Voronezh region is paid. The program documents of a social orientation existing in the region are for this purpose studied. It is revealed that in the region a number of the programs and <b>subprogrammes</b> aimed at improvement of a demographic situation, improvement of a regional budgetary and tax policy, social support of citizens in general works. As tools which use regional authorities, are noted: social standards, address social help, social contracts. It is established that introduction of system of social contracts allows to save budget funds and, at the same time, to motivate the persons which are in a difficult life situation on change of the situation to the best, joint efforts with social security authorities. It is noted that as the leading principles of rendering the social help paramount value has detailed definition of degree of need of the help and a condition of granting.

40|$|The International Cooperative Programme on Integrated Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems (ICP-IM) is an {{extensive}} monitoring programme {{with a large}} number of chemical, physical and biological variables. In this report the results of the last three years of monitoring in the Lheebroekerzand, Drenthe, carried out in the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) are presented. With the data collected in the field and the measurements in the laboratoria, a database is build up containing environmental information in relation to possible effects of air pollution on ecosystems for Europe and Canada. The objectives of this report are to collect and present the 1997, 1998 and 1999 monitoring data of the Netherlands, to inform participating organizations and volunteers and to close the period of monitoring by RIVM in the Lheebroekerzand. In the period from 1997 to 1999, the biological part of the integrated monitoring programme consisted of a regular inventory of vegetation, birds, epiphytes, leafminers and butterflies in the monitoring area, as well as inventories of the aquatic macrofauna present in the moorland pool Kliplo and observations on the performance of pine trees. The chemical-physical part included meteorological variables like temperature, humidity, the amount of precipitation and irradiation, together with chemical analysis of organic and inorganic compounds in air, precipitation, leaves, needles, mosses, soil, soilwater, groundwater and pool water. Comparing the data of chemical variables of different <b>subprogrammes</b> of 1997, 1998 and 1999 no clear trends can be recognized. However the monitored concentrations for SO 4 S in air, throughfall, stemflow and lake water seem to diminish in time. For concentrations of NO 3 N and NH 4 N in air and lake water the same conclusion can be drawn. This decrease in concentration can not be confirmed in rainwater. Concerning biological variables (Inventory of birds, Inventory of plants, Hydrobiology of lakes, Forest damage, Trunk epiphytes, Leafminers and Butterflies) nothing can be said about possible trends so far. However, it seems that the number of individuals for birds, macrofauna, leafminers and butterflies is decreasing in time.

The aggravating factor with this new avian influenza disease was that it was asymp-tomatic in poultry (i. e. poultry showed no clinical disease), but symptomatic in hu-mans (i. e. humans showed flu like symptoms) causing about 30 % mortality in infect-ed humans. This epidemiological character of the disease made it very difficult to trace and search for its origin in poultry, towards protecting human lives. The Chi-nese authorities, in particular the Beijing Genetics Institute, reacted appropriately to the outbreaks and characterized the virus, isolated from human patients, as an avian influenza H 7 N 9 subtype.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{activities}} of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean/Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee (ECLAC/CDCC) secretariat during the 2006 - 2007 biennium continued to be on assistance to member governments of the subregion with policy-making and development strategies, especially on issues relevant to the promotion of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of development in the Caribbean. The Subregional Headquarters for the Caribbean worked closely with member countries of the CDCC in an effort to ensure the relevance of outputs which would inform policy options. This involved the strengthening of partnerships with both regional and subregional institutions and relevant agencies of the United Nations system working in the Caribbean. A major decision was taken to refocus the operational aspects of the secretariat to ensure that they were relevant to the development goals of its members. This involved the introduction of a thematic approach to the work of the office. One of the changes resulting from this was the restructuring and renaming of the Caribbean Documentation Centre. The Caribbean Knowledge Management Centre (CKMC), as it is now known, has changed its emphasis from organizing and disseminating documents, and is now a more proactive partner in the research undertaken by staff and other users of the service. The CKMC manages the ECLAC website, the public face of the organization. Newsletters and all other documents, including Information and Communications Technology (ICT) profiles of selected countries, prepared by the secretariat, are now available online at the ECLAC/CDCC website www. eclacpos. org. The Caribbean Knowledge Management Portal was launched at a meeting of information specialists in St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2007. In addition to reaching a wider public, this measure was introduced as a means of reducing the cost of printing or disseminating publications. In spite of the unusually high vacancy rate, at both the international and local levels, during the biennium, the subregional headquarters accomplished 98 per cent of the 119 outputs earmarked for the period. Using vacant positions to carry out the assignments was not an easy task, given the complexity in recruiting qualified and experienced persons for short periods. Nevertheless, consultancy services and short-term replacement staff greatly aided the delivery of these outputs. All the same, 35 work months remained unused during the biennium, leaving 301 work months to complete the outputs. In addition to the unoccupied positions, the work of the <b>subprogramme</b> was severely affected by the rising cost of regional and subregional travel which limited the ability of staff to network and interact with colleagues of member countries. This also hampered the outreach programme carried out mainly through ad hoc expert group meetings. In spite of these shortcomings, the period proved to be successful for the <b>subprogramme</b> as it engaged the attention of member countries in its work either through direct or indirect participation. Staff members completed 36 technical papers plus the reports of the meetings and workshops. A total of 523 persons, representing member countries, participated in the 18 intergovernmental and expert meetings convened by the secretariat in the 24 -month period. In its effort to build technical capacity, the <b>subprogramme</b> convened 15 workshops/seminars which offered training for 446 persons...|$|E

This {{is the time of}} the year to look at things accomplished and to face challenges that lie ahead of us. The Plant Breeding and Genetics Section (PBGS) in IAEA Headquarters, Vienna and the Plant Breeding and Genetics Laboratory (PBGL) in Seibersdorf are very grateful for the input and support of experts, consultants and lecturers from all the Member States that helped us implement our programmatic activities. We had the honour and the privilege to host 46 trainees, fellows, interns and scientific visitors for a total of 51 training months. Every single one has enriched this programme and we fondly remember our fruitful dis-cussions. The Plant Breeding and Genetics <b>Subprogramme</b> provides technical support to Member States through the development and the promotion of technology packages based on mutation induction and efficiency enhancing molecular and biotechnologie...|$|E
40|$|In {{models for}} thermal baryogenesis from {{particle}} decays, {{the mass of}} the decaying particle is typically many orders of magnitude above the TeV scale. We will discuss different ways to lower the energy scale of baryogenesis and present the corresponding lower bounds on the particle's mass. This is done specifically for the inert doublet model with heavy Majorana neutrinos and then we indicate how to extrapolate the results to other scenarios. We also revisit {{the question of whether or}} not dark matter, neutrino masses, and the cosmic baryon asymmetry can be explained simultaneously at low energies in the inert doublet model.
