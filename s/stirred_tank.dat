50|$|With {{conventional}} tubular reactors, mixing {{is accomplished}} through stirring mechanisms or turbulent flow conditions, which {{is difficult to}} control. By changing variable values such as baffle spacing or thickness, COBRs can operate with much better mixing control. For instance, {{it has been found}} that a spacing of 1.5 times tube diameter size is the most effective mixing condition; furthermore, vortex deformation increases with increase in baffle thickness greater than 3mm. There are also significant advantages relative to using <b>stir</b> <b>tank</b> reators in terms of size operation time, and yield; a 16000L <b>stir</b> <b>tank</b> reactor at James Robinson was recently replaced by a 270L COBR.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work solids {{suspension}} is investigated in an unbaffled <b>tank</b> <b>stirred</b> by a Rushton turbine and {{provided with a}} top-cover {{in order to avoid}} the formation of the well known central vortex. The data obtained are compared with those pertaining baffled <b>stirred</b> <b>tanks</b> via comparison with the well known Zwietering’s correlation. The dependence of Njs on particle concentration is found to be similar to that well established for baffled vessels, while, as a difference from the latter, Njs is found to decrease when liquid viscosity increases. Results also show that Njs is substantially independent of particle size, a feature that may advice the adoption of unbaffled tanks when large heavy particles are to be dealt with. On the other hand, a smaller exponent for the scale-up rule is found with respect to baffled tanks, which implies the need for larger specific power consumptions the larger the vessel size and may limit useful applications to small to medium plant sizes. Finally, a correlation akin to Zwietering’s correlation is proposed for top-covered unbaffled <b>stirred</b> <b>tanks...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{starting}} materials {{can sometimes be}} cooled before the reaction {{to such an extent}} that the reaction heat is absorbed without further cooling of the mixture. In the case of gaseous or low-boiling {{starting materials}}, work under overpressure is necessary. Due to the large number of possible raw materials, a large number of processes have been described. Photochlorination is usually carried out in a <b>stirred</b> <b>tank</b> reactor, a bubble column reactor or a tube reactor, followed by further processing depending on the target product. In case of a <b>stirred</b> <b>tank</b> reactor, the lamp (generally shaped as an elongated cylinder) is provided with a cooling jacket and placed in the reaction solution. Tube reactors are made from quartz or glass tubes, which are irradiated from the outside. Using a <b>stirred</b> <b>tank</b> reactor has the advantage that no light is lost to the environment. However, the intensity of light drops rapidly with the distance to the light source due to adsorption by the reactants.|$|E

40|$|Three-phase {{processes}} in which particle suspension {{has to be}} achieved in conjunction with gas dispersion are traditionally carried out in sparged, baffled <b>stirred</b> <b>tanks.</b> The operation of such tanks can suffer, however, from particles tending to block the sparger holes.

In this work, the particle suspension and liquid aeration performances in three-phase UUSTs were experimentally investigated and compared with relevant literature correlations concerning baffled systems. The results show that, {{at least at the}} investigated scale, UUSTs are more efficient for suspending particles than relevant baffled systems. Impeller clearance scarcely affects power requirements. Finally, a down-pumping PBT with D/T = 1 / 3 was found to be the best choice for attaining complete suspension under self-aeration conditions...|$|R

In designing and optimizing such processes, suspension quality Of Slurry is an important parameter. Suspension quality depends upon complex interactions of impeller generated flow, turbulence, and solid loading. Most of the earlier work on solid suspension focuses Oil identifying critical impeller speed for just suspension of solids (N(js)). In this study, apart from N(js) aspects like cloud height and liquid phase mixing in solid-liquid suspensions were also studied A new way of characterizing solid-liquid suspensions and liquid phase mixing using nonintrusive wall pressure fluctuation measurements has been developed.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in using unbaffled <b>stirred</b> <b>tanks</b> for addressing a number of processing needs such as low shear damage (sensitive biocultures), low attrition (solid–liquid applications), deep-cleaning/ sterilization (pharmaceutical applications). The main feature of uncovered, unbaffled <b>stirred</b> <b>tanks</b> is highly swirling motion of the fluid that results in a deformation of the free liquid surface. At sufficiently high agitation speeds the resulting whirlpool reaches the impeller and {{gives rise to a}} gas–liquid dispersion, so leading to the formation of a dispersion without the use of gas-sparger; the so-called self-inducing operation of the vessel. In this work, digital image analysis coupled with a suitable shadowgraphy-based technique is used to investigate the shape of the free-surface that forms in uncovered unbaffled <b>stirred</b> <b>tanks,</b> when different stirrer geometries are considered. The technique is based on back-lighting the vessel and suitably averaging over time the recorded free surface shape. For each investigated geometry, the deformed free-surface was analyzed at different impeller speeds. Different geometries of the vessel were analyzed, by varying impeller distance from vessel bottom as well as agitator type (Rushton turbine, Lightnin A 310, Pitched Blade Turbine). It is shown that impeller design strongly affects the free surface profile, and in turn the impeller speed at which the free surface reaches the impeller. A model was developed to fully describe free-surface profile at all agitation speeds and for all investigated geometries, suitable for being adapted to experiments by means of physically consistent parameters adjustment...|$|R

40|$|The {{main feature}} of unbaffled <b>stirred</b> <b>tanks</b> is the highly {{swirling}} liquid motion, {{which leads to}} the formation of a central vortex on the liquid free surface, when the vessel is operated without top-cover (Uncovered Unbaffled <b>Stirred</b> <b>Tanks,</b> UUST). One of the main drawbacks of such vessels, that limits their industrial applicability, is the possible onset of low-frequency sloshing of the free surface. In this work, original data on oscillation dynamics in UUST are presented. In particular, data focus on the oscillation amplitude as well as on their frequency. Data were obtained by means of a novel experimental technique based on digital image analysis. The effect of impeller geometry (Rushton turbine, pitched blade turbine, Lightnin A 310 propeller) and that of scale-up were finally investigated. It was found that the natural oscillation frequencies only depend on vessel scale and geometry, while impeller type plays a role in the way the free surface oscillation frequencies change with impeller speed...|$|R
