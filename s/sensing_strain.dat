The cost function of an optimal LQG controller with Kalman lter is proposed as an objective function for determining the optimal location and orientation of displacement sensors on a exible structure, such as strain gages on a disk drive suspension. Analytical bounds are derived for the Kalman lter Riccati equation in a modal system with large sensor noise. These bounds produce analytical approximations that reduce the computational complexity of the LQG optimization approach with cheap control. Results are applied to a prototype disk drive suspension to identify sensor positions and sensor requirements. Piezoresistive and piezoelectric thin lms are discussed as materials for meeting these requirements in an instrumented suspension. The performance of prototype sensors installed using MEMS-style processing techniques on stainless steel wafers is examined. ...|$|E

Then, the sensing mechanisms are thoroughly analyzed, based on the experimental observation on deformation characteristics of knitted fabric. The deformation process of knitted fabric is identified as four stages, i. e., yarn slippage, change of contacted fibers, bending of yarns, as well as elongation of yarns. It is found that the electrical resistance varies differently in the four stages, and the micro-cracks of the coating surface during fiber extension contributes most to the resistance variation of the fabric among the four deformation stages.

The use of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) in biosensing applications allows for a direct electronic output that can be more easily incorporated into devices for remote environmental monitoring. Herein, we describe the first BES-based biosensor with genetically encoded specificity for a toxic metal. By placing an essential element of the metal reduction (Mtr) pathway of Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 under the control of an arsenic-sensitive promoter, we have engineered a strain that produces increased current in response to arsenic when inoculated into an BES. When operated as a chemostat with a hydraulic retention time of 7 h, our BES-based biosensor has a response time of 24 h and a lower detection limit on the order of 100 μM arsenite.
