5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to the area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired {{over the heads of}} the crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E

50|$|<b>Setting</b> <b>Fires</b> - <b>Setting</b> <b>Fires</b> was a {{collaboration}} between Whyte and Mat Devine.

They enlisted Dean Butterworth (Good Charlotte) to play the drums, Davey Julson-Rieley to produce, and Joe McGrath (AFI, Green Day) to mix the songs for the EP.|$|R

5|$|Burnham and Armstrong leapt {{over the}} dead Mlimo {{and ran down}} a trail toward their horses.

The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and made peace with the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E

5|$|During their {{retreat from}} Quebec, the Americans {{carefully}} took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove {{useful to the}} British. When Arnold and his troops, making up the rear guard of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to the sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill {{on the west bank}} of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut up the side of the motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to York Minster and, some argue, the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} they had returned, the attack began. Indian warriors <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to several houses and stables, but a {{favorable}} wind kept the fires from spreading. Children used the water drawn by the women {{to put out the}} fires. A flaming arrow landed in baby Richard Johnson's crib, but it was doused by his sister Betsy. Help arrived from Lexington and Boone Station, and the Indians retreated.|$|E

5|$|Alien {{opened in}} American theaters on May 25, 1979.

Religious zealots <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to {{the model of the}} space jockey, believing it to be the work of the devil. In the United Kingdom, Alien premiered at a gala performance at the Edinburgh Film Festival on September 1, 1979, before starting an exclusive run at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on September 6, 1979, but it did not open widely in Britain until January 13, 1980.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink was not {{a trained}} scientist, and his {{incompetence}} with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern {{to some of the}} party. However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings. During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as they slept.|$|E

5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring hay to Boston. When the Continentals on the {{mainland}} noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the militia. The militia <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of hay, and prevented the British from taking more than 3 tons.|$|E
5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under way. A {{group of women}} in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to the camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E
5|$|Collier's fleet {{arrived at}} the mouth of the river early on August 13. He boarded 123 marines onto the Hope, and ordered her and the Blonde up the river. Word of this reached the militia, and thrty-five men mustered to oppose them. The ships reached the log boom, and a firefight began between the two forces. The militia {{resistance}} was sufficient to keep the British from attempting a landing that day. Early the next morning, under the cover of fog, the marines were landed. They cut the log boom, seized a sloop carrying lumber, and <b>set</b> <b>fire</b> to a storehouse, seizing stores of flour, rice, corn, shoes, and ammunition before returning to the ships.|$|E
