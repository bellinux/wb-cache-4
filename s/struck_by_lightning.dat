40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{different}} triggering factors are related to landslides occurrence. However, in many cases, {{it is not possible to}} identify main factors that may contribute to start a landslide. Following that, lightning phenomena is herein considered as a possible factor that may promote changes in the structure, and eventually, in the strength of soils. The current study aims to analyse the influence of laboratory simulated lightning in the structure of undisturbed granite-gneiss residual soil samples. The main focus is to compare the peak strength of unsaturated samples that were not <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> replicated <b>lightning</b> with the peak strength of soil samples <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> replicated <b>lightning.</b> The methods used are: Soil sampling and physical characterization; unconfined compression strength tests on unsaturated undisturbed samples; submission of soil samples to replicated lightning; unconfined compression strength tests on samples <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> replicated <b>lightning</b> and micro tomography of samples submitted to lightning. As results, it is seem that lightning may cause a hole with irregular geometry inside the soil. Analysing the tests of the samples <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> laboratory simulated <b>lightning,</b> a peak strength reduction with the charge incidence was observed. Comparing the variation of soil matric suction on the peak strength of the soil that was not <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> replicated <b>lightning</b> with that of the soil <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the higher charge of the replicated lightning, it is observed that the samples <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> high-voltage presents lower values of peak strength...|$|R

5|$|The {{materials}} used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity.

In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the membrane. Mulberry trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of François les bas-bleus, Messager received, and accepted, {{simultaneous}} invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an operetta for the Folies-Dramatiques.

It ran well into the following year in Paris, {{and he was able}} to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891. The ballet, Les deux pigeons, which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage.
