40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{thought that the}} Uniform Commercial Code adopts a negligence principle {{as the basis of}} loss allocation for the <b>check</b> <b>system.</b> This article argues that this common assumption is wrong. Instead, the fundamental principle of the <b>check</b> <b>system</b> and all other payment systems is that the burden of unpreventable losses should rest with the providers of the payment system rather than with the users of the payment system. The article shows that the old English case of Price v. Neal is not, as {{is commonly}} thought, an anomaly but is instead entirely consistent with the basic principle of loss allocation for the <b>check</b> <b>system.</b> The article suggests that a correct understanding of the basic principle of loss allocation has significant implications for the enforceability of agreements between customers and banks concerning checking accounts. Specifically, an approach that appears to be emerging in recent cases concerning forged facsimile <b>signatures</b> on <b>checks</b> can be seen to be fundamentally misguided. <b>checks,</b> forgery, facsimile <b>signature,...</b>|$|R

40|$|The authors analyse off-chip and on-chip <b>signature</b> <b>checking</b> schemes {{suitable}} for boundary scan (BS) testing. The {{aim is to}} improve the on-board checking of chip build-in self-tests (BIST). It is shown that an efficient off-chip approach can reduce the memory requirements to store chip signatures into a test controller. However, only a built-in <b>signature</b> <b>checking</b> scheme (BISC) can further improve the required memory and the signature scanning time for locating faulty circuits on a board. Based on previous works and on existing self-checking approaches, the properties required for a BISC of general application are determined. It is shown that the association of self-testing BISC with an appropriate <b>checking</b> of <b>signature</b> registers makes less costly the integration of maximal diagnosis into a BS test controller chip...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Mobile {{agents are}} {{well suited for}} {{accessing}} contents of distributed web based applications including internet business. Such kinds of access must be secure enough enabling only authorized mobile agents to retrieve the contents from the distributed servers. This kind of security is provided by several algorithms including RSA based digital signature and elliptic curve digital signature cryptography. The main differences among the algorithms of the past literatures lie in the computational time of encryption and decryption of the keys used for encrypting and decrypting the content. In this {{paper we propose a}} modified hierarchical date constrained key management scheme which potentially reduces the overall computation time needed for key derivation and key <b>signature</b> <b>check</b> operations. Different algorithms are compared with our proposed mechanism and the experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the overall key derivation and key <b>signature</b> <b>check</b> computational time...|$|R
