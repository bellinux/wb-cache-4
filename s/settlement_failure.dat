40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{potential}} impact on securities settlement systems (SSSs) of a major market disruption, caused by the default of the largest player. A multi-period, multi-security model with intraday credit is used to simulate direct and second round <b>settlement</b> <b>failures</b> triggered by the default, {{as well as the}} dynamics of <b>settlement</b> <b>failures,</b> arising from a lag in settlement relative to the date of trades. The effects of the defaulter's net trade position, the numbers of securities and participants in the market, and participants' trading behaviour are also analysed. We show that in SSSs – contrary to payment systems – large and persistent <b>settlement</b> <b>failures</b> are possible even when ample liquidity is provided. Central bank liquidity support to SSSs thus cannot eliminate <b>settlement</b> <b>failures</b> due to major market disruptions. This {{is due to the fact}} that securities transactions involve a cash leg and a securities leg, and liquidity can affect only the cash side of a transaction. Whereas a broad program of securities borrowing and lending might help, it is precisely during periods of market disruption that participants will be least willing to lend securities. Interestingly, <b>settlement</b> <b>failures</b> continue to occur beyond the period corresponding to the lag in settlement. This is due to the fact that, upon observation of a default, market participants must form expectations about the impact of the default, and these expectations affect current trading behaviour. If, ex post, fewer of the previous trades settle than expected, new <b>settlement</b> <b>failures</b> will occur. This result has interesting implications for financial stability. On the one hand, conservative reactions by market participants to a default - for example by limiting the volume of trades – can result in a more rapid return of the settlement system to a normal level of efficiency. On the other hand, limitation of trading by market participants can reduce market liquidity, which may have a negative impact on financial stability. contagion; liquidity risk; securities clearing and settlement; systemic risk...|$|R

40|$|Much {{of the law}} and {{economics}} literature, including Bebchuk (1984) and Reinganum and Wilde (1986), explains <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> in bargaining as a consequence of asymmetric information. An alternative, non-strategic explanation found in Shavell (1982) suggests that <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> stems from excessive optimism. Final offer arbitration (FOA) in major league baseball provides an ideal setting for analyzing these theories since final offers, salaries and player statistics, which provide the fundamental facts for the case, are all readily available. If the informational theory is correct, final offer bidding behavior that appears aggressive should be associated with a better outcome at arbitration for the party making the offer. If the optimism theory is correct, an aggressive offer reflects undue optimism and should lead to an inferior arbitration outcome for the party making the offer. Using data from 1990 - 93, we find strong evidence that arbitration stems from excessive optimism by players, and weaker evidence that clubs also exhibit excessive optimism.

40|$|Large-value payment {{systems have}} evolved {{rapidly in the}} last 20 years, {{continually}} striking a balance between providing liquidity and keeping settlement risk under control. Changes to the design or to the risk management policies of such systems were needed, in part, due to {{the growth in the}} value of transactions on these systems. For example, in the United States the value of transactions on Fedwire, the Federal Reserve’s large-value payment system, increased from about 50 times GDP in 1989 to over 62 times GDP in 2003. This value exceeded $ 704 trillion in 2003. This growth raised concerns that the <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> of a large institution could pose severe economic consequences. The disruption in settlements after September 11, 2001, brought new focus to questions such as: How reliable are the payment systems? How should liquidity be provided to system participants? And how can central banks protect themselves from excessive risk? Martin considers the evolution of large-value payment systems in light of the trade-off between providing liquidity and limiting settlement risk. First, he provides some background on large-value payment systems and discusses the trade-off between providing liquidity and controlling settlement risk. Second, he describes the recent evolution of payment systems and explains how this evolution was spurred by increasing concerns about <b>settlement</b> <b>failure,</b> particularly in the EU, the United States, and Canada. Third, he explains some of the differences between three of the major large-value payment systems. Finally, he describes how technological progress and faster computers are allowing new systems to combine the best features of delayed net settlement and real-time gross settlement systems.

The Commission should address the enormous <b>settlement</b> <b>failures</b> in the ETF Market. When a seller fails to deliver a security on the normal settlement date, an owner of the security is effectively forced into making an involuntary stock loan to the seller. This violates one of the basic property rights of an owner, the ability to exclude others from the use of the property. In addition, it may deprive the buyer of the ability to earn stock lending revenue, as well as voting rights.

40|$|Foundation {{systems are}} some of the most widely used {{structures}} in civil engineering. The design thereof is governed by two failure mechanisms, either bearing capacity failure or <b>settlement</b> <b>failure.</b> Generally, the governing mechanism is <b>settlement</b> <b>failure.</b> In order to accurately predict the settlement of a foundation system, the exact material properties of all the various constituents of the system are required. However, due to the complexity of the interaction problem, assumptions have been introduced in the design of foundations to simplify the process. To govern against shear failure of a footing, structural engineers increase the thickness thereof. However, there is no limit to the extent with which this increase can be made. In order to obtain an economic design, the optimum thickness of a footing for a certain set of soil parameters should be obtained. The main objectives of this study is to determine whether the settlement, deflection and contact stress distribution of a footing on cohesionless sand can be predicted as a function of the stiffness’s of the footing and sand. Centrifuge model tests were conducted on seven aluminium footings and one reinforced concrete footing, all with an equivalent 4. 5 m × 4. 5 m plan area. The tests were conducted on dense, cohesionless sand. The settlement and deflection data were captured with the use of particle image velocimetry, whereas the stress distribution was captured with the use of TekscanTM pressure sensors. The main conclusions drawn from the study are as follows. The relative stiffness of the foundation system affects the deflection and contact stress distribution beneath the footing. The contact stress distribution beneath stiff footings are uniform. A decrease in the flexibility of a footing results in curvature of the footing during loading, which reduces the contact stress at the footing edges. The behaviour of the initially stiff concrete footings change to flexible at the onset of cracking, with the load distribution changing from uniform to a distribution reducing linearly towards the edge. Finally it was concluded that the results obtained from the aluminium footings could be used to predict the settlement, deflection and contact stress distribution beneath a footing.

However, many disputes do not settle: the presence of cognitive biases, such as those observed through framing manipulations, {{is thought to be}} one of the many reasons for <b>settlement</b> <b>failure.</b> The present study used quantitative and qualitative data to compare the impact of a gain- or loss-framed hypothetical civil litigation scenario on settlement decisions made by lawyers and other nonlawyer professionals. A significant effect of framing was found for both groups. As predicted, both nonlawyers and lawyers were much more likely to settle their claim in the gain scenario than in the loss scenario. This finding was supported by the qualitative data: risk-averse comments were more frequent in the gain frame whereas risk-seeking statements were more common in the loss frame. There was also evidence that lawyers may be less affected by framing than nonlawyers, although a smaller difference was observed than in previous studies. In addition, lawyers were more likely than nonlawyers to consider the expected financial value of the litigation in making their decision.

The processes {{at the individual level}} were simulated following the dynamic energy budget theory, whereas initial egg mortality, background mortality, food competition, and predation (including cannibalism) were additional population processes. Model properties were studied through the analysis of theoretical scenarios and by simulation of different mortality parameter combinations in a realistic setup, imposing environmental measurements. Realistic criteria were applied to narrow down the possible combination of parameter values. Field observations obtained in the long-term and multi-station monitoring program were compared with the model scenarios. The realistically selected modeling scenarios were able to reproduce reasonably the timing of some peaks in the individual abundances in the mussel bed and its size distribution but the number of individuals was not well predicted. The results suggest that the mortality in the early life stages (egg and larvae) {{plays an important role in}} population dynamics, either by initial egg mortality, larvae dispersion, <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> or shrimp predation. Future steps include the coupling of the population model with a hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model to improve the simulation of egg/larvae dispersion, settlement probability, food transport and also to simulate the feedback of the organisms' activity on the water column properties, which will result in an improvement of the food quantity and quality characterization. © 2014...|$|E

In April 2010 the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon (DWH) offshore oil rig exploded, releasing an estimated 760 million liters of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This study examines the potential effects of oil spill exposure on coral larvae of the Florida Keys. Larvae of the brooding coral, Porites astreoides, and the broadcast spawning coral, Montastraea faveolata, were exposed to multiple concentrations of BP Horizon source oil (crude, weathered and WAF), oil in combination with the dispersant Corexit® 9500 (CEWAF), and dispersant alone, and analyzed for behavior, settlement, and survival. Settlement and survival of P. astreoides and M. faveolata larvae decreased with increasing concentrations of WAF, CEWAF and Corexit® 9500, however the degree of the response varied by species and solution. P. astreoides larvae experienced decreased settlement and survival following exposure to 0. 62 ppm source oil, while M. faveolata larvae were negatively impacted by 0. 65, 1. 34 and 1. 5 ppm, suggesting that P. astreoides larvae may be more tolerant to WAF exposure than M. faveolata larvae. Exposure to medium and high concentrations of CEWAF (4. 28 / 18. 56 and 30. 99 / 35. 76 ppm) and dispersant Corexit® 9500 (50 and 100 ppm), significantly decreased larval settlement and survival for both species. Furthermore, exposure to Corexit® 9500 resulted in <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> and complete larval mortality after exposure to 50 and 100 ppm for M. faveolata and 100 ppm for P. astreoides.

To measure quality, I use Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s Better Beginnings Quality Rating and Improvement System, a tier-structured voluntary certification program which can be viewed as a voluntary increase in regulations for licensed child care centers which allows them to send an observable signal of quality to consumers. Using an hedonic pricing estimation with controls for varying geographic markets, results indicate firms with Better Beginnings classification charge higher prices once the highest levels of certification are obtained. The results provide support for policy in favor of greater reporting or release of information regarding child care characteristics, especially those associated with higher quality care, which allow child care facilities to make their quality known in a way that is easily observable. My second essay seeks to answer the question: Why do some divorcing couples use the courts to settle child custody disputes? Settlement literature predicts that cases should settle efficiently and avoid court costs under symmetric information. Shavell (1993) proposes that <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> occurs when the resource under dispute is indivisible and the value placed on it is so high that wealth constraints are binding. These characteristics are present in child custody disputes. In these cases, sharing children through joint custody may be impractical because parents are not able or willing to share. The paper uses the Stanford Child Custody data set to empirically analyze how indivisibility may lead to <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> in child custody disputes using variables such as distance between the divorced parents 2 ̆ 7 households, levels of hostility, and differences in custody type filed. Other variables included in the analysis are income, home ownership, involvement levels of each parent with the children, number of children, each parent 2 ̆ 7 s desire to settle the divorce case outside of the courts, and the use of lawyers. Results show that parents who file for different types of physical custody and couples that display high levels of hostility are more likely to end up in court. My final essay examines the hypothesis that divorcing couples make trade-offs between child custody and child support in order to secure their preferred custody outcome. Mnookin and Kornhauser (1979) introduce the concept of 2 ̆ 2 bargaining in the shadow of the law 2 ̆ 2 which describes negotiations made between parents in the framework of their existing legal setting. Using data from the Stanford Child Custody Study, I test to see if parents, specifically mothers, accept lower amounts of child support in order to receive sole physical custody of their children. Using a two-stage estimation approach to account for the joint determination of child custody and child support, I find that the legal environment surrounding divorce proceedings, including aspects such as mandatory mediation along with a preference of the courts for joint custody, significantly increases the likelihood of joint physical custody. Results from the estimation of the child support equation suggest that along with the typical guideline variables such as income of the parents, number of children, and visitation, the time between separation and filing for divorce and the mother filing for divorce significantly decrease the support award while lawyer representation of the mother significantly increases the amount of child support issued. Using a selection model, I find that the significant negative relationship between the custody and support equations, accounted for in the selection term, signifies that mothers who 2 ̆ 2 win 2 ̆ 2 their preferred custody are accepting lower amounts of child support...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Factors {{affecting}} coral recruitment {{are critical}} in influencing {{the scope and}} rate of reef recovery after disturbance. In December 2012, super-typhoon Bopha caused immense damage to the eastern reefs of Palau, resulting in near complete loss of coral cover. Within weeks following the typhoon, an ephemeral monospecific bloom of the foliose red macroalga Liagora (up to 40 % cover in February 2013) was recorded at impacted reefs with moderate wave exposure. Conversely, impacted and un-impacted reefs in areas of low wave exposure remained Liagora free. To quantify {{the effect of this}} ephemeral macroalgal bloom on coral recruitment, we installed set-tlement tiles during the major spawning period (March– April 2013) at forereefs with and without Liagora. Reefs (n = 3) with Liagora (13 – 24 % cover in April) experi-enced an almost complete failure of settlement, with only two individual corals recorded on settlement tiles (n = 90). This <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> was unexpected, as tiles were situ-ated adjacent to, and not within Liagora canopies. In contrast, settlement was significantly higher on reefs that lacked macroalgae (n = 3), ranging from an average of 0. 5 – 2. 5 and 2. 7 – 18. 9 individuals 25 cm- 2 per top- and under-sided tile, respectively. Reefs with and without Liagora were in close proximity (B 8 km), and hydrody-namic models predicted that larval supply did not limit coral settlement among sites. While some differences in the community composition on the tiles were observed among sites, settlement substrate availability also did not limit coral settlement. Generalised linear mixed effects models indicated that while no settlement substrate explained more than 10 % of the variability in coral settlement, coral cover positively accounted for 26 %, and the cover of Liagora on reefs negatively accounted for more than 50 % of the observed variation. Combined, our results indicate that the typhoon induced ephemeral macroalgal bloom resulted in a reef-scale failure of coral settlement...|$|E

40|$|At every moment, a {{tropical}} reef coral interacts {{with millions of}} microbial organisms from {{tens of thousands of}} different species. Among these viruses, bacteria, archaea, dinoflagellates, and protists are cooperative symbionts as well as pathogens and parasites. Each interaction between a coral and a microscopic organism has ecological consequences for the coral community. In this dissertation, I show that juveniles of the Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata suffer distance-dependent mortality in the presence of adult corals of the same species which is caused by microbial communities near these adults. This previously undiscovered structuring force will affect the spatial patterning of reefs and appears strong enough to drive the evolution of habitat selection behavior by coral larvae. The behavior of pre-settlement larvae differs based on both the microbial environment {{and the manner in which}} that environment is altered, indicating that water column microbes may be used as navigational information by dispersing corals. Sterilized seawater and penicillin both increase larval swimming rates, perhaps because larvae cannot detect the microbial "smell" of a suitable reef habitat, however only penicillin inhibits settlement and metamorphosis. Five antibiotics each induce a different pattern of abnormal behavior, indicating that the behavior of coral larvae could form the foundation of a new model system in toxicology. Furthermore, <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> on reefs may have a large behavioral component that has been underappreciated until now. The coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis is the best-known coral-microbe interaction however coral bleaching remains enigmatic. Based on observations made after {{a tropical}} storm, I propose that corals evolved bleaching as an adaptive mechanism to readjust symbiont communities after storm damage moves corallites into new light regimes. In a survey of viral diversity in the coral Diploria strigosa, I demonstrate that coral-associated viruses likely infect all other cells in the coral holobiont, including symbionts and potential pathogens. I propose that interactions among these viral groups could help to stabilize mutualistic coral-microbe interactions. Four additional natural history observations demonstrate the diversity of behaviors and interactions corals exhibit at the micron to millimeter scales and reveal that we have many more coral- microbe interactions left to discove...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{of roads}} over soft soils {{can lead to}} design and {{construction}} related problems linked to the soil's compressibility characteristics and low strength. Failure, in terms of bearing capacity can occur when pavements are constructed over such soft soils. When road pavements, which are constructed over soft soils, are subjected to cyclic traffic loading (dynamic in nature), rapid deterioration of the base layer material and progressive permanent deformation of the surface will occur. This not only reduces the serviceability of the pavement structure but also its design life. In this study, reinforcement geosynthetics (geogrids and geotextiles) were used as reinforcement inclusions within a granular base overlying a soft subgrade of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) less than 2 % in a 1. 0 m 3 steel test box. Firstly, a geotextile/geogrid was placed at the interface between the base layer and subgrade. Thereafter, {{a combination of the}} geotextile at the interface (of the base and subgrade) and geogrid within the base layer. Bench scale plate load tests (static and cyclic) were conducted on a 305 mm diameter circular steel plate on the two layer system using a Universal Compression Machine. Static loading was applied at a rate of 1. 2 mm/min. Dynamic sinusoidal load wave was applied with a 4 kN seating load that was linearly increased with an incremental load of 4 kN for every 8 cycles at a frequency of 0. 2 Hz on a 305 mm circular plate. For both tests, <b>settlement</b> <b>failure</b> of the composite system was considered at a deformation of 75 mm as defined for unpaved roads. The results obtained from the pavement model showed that there was a significant improvement in bearing capacity and reduction in settlement accruing from geosynthetic inclusion as shown by the Bearing Capacity Ratio (BCR) of 1. 21, 1. 29 and 1. 63 for geogrid, geotextile and geogrid-geotextile combinations respectively. Additionally, a Settlement Reduction Factor (SRF) of 18 % for geogrid, 23 % for geotextile and 31 % for the geogrid-geotextile combination resulted. There was also an improvement in extended pavement life as depicted by the Traffic Benefit Ratio (TBR) greater than 1 for all reinforced base layers. An improved performance was realised with the double combination of geotextile at the interface, geogrid at the base...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of the kaolin clay increases when being reinforced with a material that are stronger than itself. The reason for conducting {{this study is to}} solve certain problem that related to the bearing capacity of the soft clay on the ground. Besides of throwing out an excessive amount of uncycled material, this study proposed to save an environment by re-use the excessive material to strengthen up the soft clay. There is two objective of this study that need to be completed {{by the end of the}} research. The first one is to determine the physical characteristics of kaolin clay and PP and morphological characteristic of PP. The second objective is to determine the undrained shear {{strength of}} soft clay reinforced with various dimensions of single PP column. Generally, soft clays can be defined as a disturbed cohesive soil that its water content is higher than its liquid limit. Soft clay also is one of the fine grained soils types that experiences the change in volume when it is different from elastic deformation, consolidation and secondary compression. Rock that rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin or china clay. Kaolin or china clay is a hydrated aluminium silicate crystalline mineral (kaolinite) formed over many millions of years by the hydrothermal decomposition of granite rocks. Kaolin clay is a versatile industrial mineral and generally used as fillers or raw material in ceramic, paints, plastics, paper, rubber, ink, catalyst, insecticide, pharmaceutical formulation and etc. Kaolin clay was familiarly experience with a various type of soil failure because of its characteristics due to the weak in strength. The failure that frequently happened to this kind of soil was the <b>settlement</b> <b>failure.</b> It is because the soil can’t resist the large amount of loads through the member of the structure. Many improvement of soft clay has been discovered in order to make the {{strength of the}} kaolin clay rise. Meanwhile, Polypropylene (PP) are the general class of thermoplastics produced from propylene gas. Propylene gas is derived from the cracking of natural gas or petroleum by-products. The symbol for this polymer was (C 3 H 6) n. Production of PP takes place by slurry, solution or gas phase process, in which the propylene monomer is subjected to heat and pressure in the presence of a catalyst system. Polymerisation is achieved at relatively low temperature and pressure and the product yielded is translucent, but readily coloured. Differences in catalyst and production conditions can be used to alter the properties of the plastic. As for the testing, there is six (6) basic tests that need to be conducted towards the kaolin clay and two (2) basic tests for PP. The UCT will be proceed after all the basics test of the material has been done. A total of 28 sample need to be tested using the UCT. Four of the 28 sample was taken out to be the controlled sample. The other 24 samples with the PP column are tested and the results was compared to the controlled sample. If the results of the 24 samples showing an improvement of soil strength, the experiment was considered successful...|$|E
40|$|Foundations {{are built}} to {{transfer}} structural loads {{to the ground}} without load-bearing-capacity and <b>settlement</b> <b>failures.</b> If the soil conditions are favorable, shallow foundations are usually recommended but in case of weak ground conditions, deep foundations are essentially required. Use of geosynthetic reinforcement within the foundation soils {{is one of the}} cost-effective options to avoid construction of expensive deep foundations. The presence of geosynthetic layers reduces the settlement and enhances the load-bearing capacity of the soil mass. The simplicity of the basic principles and the economic benefits over the conventional approaches make geosynthetic-reinforced foundation soils very attractive to designers. In view of these advantages, researchers have carried out many analytical, numerical and experimental studies of the load-bearing capacity behaviour of geosynthetic-reinforced foundation soils. However, there is still a research scope for further development of this subject in order to consider some practical aspects which have not been given due attention. Therefore, this paper presents a critical review of the past developments aiming at clearly defining the key field requirements and performance factors for further consideration by the researchers...|$|R

25|$|Early {{attempts}} at establishing permanent <b>settlements</b> were <b>failures.</b> In 1598, a French trading post was established on Sable Island, {{off the coast}} of Acadia, but was unsuccessful. In 1600, a trading post was established at Tadoussac, but only five settlers survived the winter. In 1604, a settlement was founded at Île-Saint-Croix on Baie François (Bay of Fundy), which was moved to Port-Royal in 1605. It was abandoned in 1607, re-established in 1610, and destroyed in 1613, after which settlers moved to other nearby locations, creating settlements that were collectively known as Acadia, and the settlers as Acadians.|$|R
