The effects of potassium fertilization and <b>successive</b> <b>cropping</b> on changes in K pools in different soils of Paraná, Brazil, were investigated in this study. Twelve soil samples, collected from the upper layer 0 – 0. 20 m, were fertilized or not with K and subjected to six <b>successive</b> <b>cropping</b> (i. e., soybean, pearl millet, wheat, common beans, soybean and maize). All the crops were grown for 45 days, {{and at the end}} of the second, fourth and sixth cropping, the soil from each pot was sampled to determination of the total K, non-exchangeable K, exchangeable K and solution K. The result showed that the soil potassium pools varied widely. Total K concentration ranged from 547 to 15, 563 mg kg– 1 (4, 714 mg kg– 1, on average). On the average, structural K, non-exchangeable K, exchangeable K and solution K of the soils constituted 84. 0, 11. 3, 4. 6 and 0. 1 % of the total K, respectively. Soils differ in the ability to supply potassium to the plants in the short to medium term, due to the wide range of parent material and the degree of soil weathering. When the soils were not fertilized with K, the <b>successive</b> <b>cropping</b> of plants resulted in a continuous process of depletion of non-exchangeable K and exchangeable K pools; however, this depletion was less pronounced in soils with higher potential buffer capacity of K. The concentrations of K non-exchangeable and exchangeable K were increased with the addition of potassium fertilizers, indicating the occurrence of K fixation in soil. After the second cropping, the soil exchangeable K levels remained constant with values of 141 and 36 mg kg– 1, respectively, with and without the addition of K fertilizer, reflecting in establishing of a new dynamic equilibrium of K in the soil. </p...|$|E

A soil slightly polluted with metals (S 1) was mixed with highly polluted soil (S 4) to give two intermediate pollution levels (S 2, S 3). The four resulting soils were repeatedly phyto-extracted using nine successive crops of Cd/Zn-hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola {{over a period of}} 4 years. Shoot Cd concentration decreased with harvest time in all soils but shoot Zn declined in S 1 only. Similar shoot Zn concentrations were found in S 2, S 3 and S 4 although these soils differed markedly in metal availability, and their available metals decreased during phytoextraction. A possible explanation is that plant active acquisition ability served to maintain plant metal uptake. Plant uptake resulted in the largest decrease in the acid-soluble metal fraction followed by reducible metals. Oxidisable and residual fractions were less available to plants. The coarse soil particle fractions made the major contribution to metal decline overall than the fine fractions. Sedum plumbizincicola maintained long term metal uptake and the coarse soil particles played the most important role in phytoextraction.

A simple and cheap option for small-scale shrimp farmers is to use settlement ponds to store and remediate discharge water before being re-used. We undertook a detailed study of the settlement ponds in a small-scale commercial black tiger shrimp farm typical of rural Thailand. We found that over a 9 -week period, following the harvest of one of the two farm production ponds, total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in the water column were reduced by 30 %, with the greatest removal (56 %) occurring during the fifth week. There was a 10 % increase in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations during the trial. Sediments were a source of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and the re-mineralisation rate was the highest in the first two settlement ponds. Coconut fronds added to two of the four settlement ponds to increase the surface area available for microbial activity were found to provide a site for microbial re-mineralisation of TAN, the photosynthetic uptake of TAN and oxidised nitrogen (NO (x)) and nitrification. The water column was a net assimilator of TAN through autotrophic uptake.

In both treatments, the root system was determined at four phenological stages by the trench-profile method and using a model that calculates root length density from counts of numbers of living roots. The results showed that PS had a positive effect on maize aboveground biomass until harvest. Its effect on root development was very positive during the first third of the cycle (+ 130 % for the root length density), but this beneficial impact quickly vanished. At the grain maturation stage, the root length was 18 % lower on the PS plot as compared to the C plot, despite the much higher shoot biomass (+ 50 %). It was concluded that one factor began having an adverse effect on root growth in the surface soil layer during the maize growth cycle.

In order to study this problem, a greenhouse experiment consisting of three consecutive corn crops was conducted in samples of a Red-Yellow Latosol (Typical Hapludox) in a completely randomized design (6 x 2 x 2), with four replicates. Six commercial fertilizers were added to 2 kg of soil {{at a rate of}} 70 mg kg- 1 P, based on the content of soluble P in neutral ammonium citrate plus water (NAC + H 2 O) of the fertilizers.

The corn plants were harvested 40 days after emergence to determine the shoot dry matter and accumulated P. For the first crop and localized application, the elimination of water-soluble P from the original fertilizers resulted in less bioavailable P for the plants.

Drought at flowering, early podding and grain-filling stages reduced both grain and straw yields. Moreover, yield reductions were associated with increasing soil salinity levels, confirming an interaction between the salinity and drought effects on faba bean productivity. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation, as evaluated by the nitrogen balance, was more affected by drought than by salinity, and it may explain the absence of any observed effects of salinity under drought conditions.

40|$|A {{digital camera}} {{fitted with a}} {{hemispherical}} lens was used to generate canopy leaf area index (LAI) values for a banana (Musa spp.) field trial {{with the aim of}} establishing a method for monitoring stresses on tall crop plants. The trial in Uganda consisted of two cultivars susceptible to nematodes, a plantain, Gonja manjaya and an East African Highland banana, Mbwazirume, plus a nematode resistant dessert banana, Yangambi km 5. A comparative approach included adding a mixed population of Radopholus similis, Helicotylenchus multicinctus and Meloidogyne spp. to the soil around half the plants of each cultivar prior to field planting. Measurements of LAI were made fortnightly from 106 days post-planting over two <b>successive</b> <b>cropping</b> cycles. The highest mean LAI during the first cycle for Gonja manjaya was suppressed to 74. 8 ± 3. 5 % by the addition of nematodes, while for Mbwazirume the values were reduced to 71. 1 ± 1. 9 %. During the second cycle these values were 69. 2 ± 2. 2 % and 72. 2 ± 2. 7 %, respectively. Reductions in LAI values were validated as due to the biotic stress by assessing nematode numbers in roots and the necrosis they caused at each of two harvests and the relationship is described. Yield losses, including a component due to toppled plants, were 35. 3 % and 55. 3 % for Gonja manjaya and 31. 4 % and 55. 8 % for Mbwazirume, at first and second harvests respectively. Yangambi km 5 showed no decrease in LAI and yield in the presence of nematodes at both harvests. LAI estimated by hemispherical photography provided a rapid basis for detecting biotic growth checks by nematodes on bananas, and demonstrated the potential of the approach for studies of growth checks to other tall crop plants caused by biotic or abiotic stresses...|$|E
40|$|Zeolites are {{hydrated}} crystalline aluminosilicate minerals {{of natural}} occurrence, structured in rigid third dimension net {{that can be}} used as slow release plant-nutrient source. The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of plant growth substrate under zeolite application, enriched with N, P and K, on dry matter yield and on nutrient contents in consecutive crops of lettuce, tomato, rice, and andropogon grass. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, with 3 kg pots with an inert substrate, evaluated in a randomized block design with three replications. Treatments consisted of four types of enrichment of concentrated natural zeolite: concentrated zeolite (Z) only, zeolite + KNO 3 (ZNK), zeolite + K 2 HPO 4 (ZPK) and zeolite + H 3 PO 4 + apatite (ZP), and a control grown in substrate fertilized with a zeolite-free nutrient solution. Four levels of enriched zeolite were tested: 20, 40, 80, and 160 g/pot. Four <b>successive</b> <b>crops</b> were grown on the same substrate in each pot: lettuce, tomato, rice, and andropogon grass. Results indicated that N, P and K enriched zeolite was an adequate slow-release nutrient source for plants. The total dry matter production of above-ground biomass of four <b>successive</b> <b>crops</b> followed a descending order: ZP > ZPK > ZNK > Z...|$|R

25|$|Though {{only about}} 17% of Spain's {{cultivated}} land was irrigated, {{it was estimated}} to be the source of between 40–45% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn, fruit trees, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, legumes, olive trees, mangos, strawberries, tomatoes, and fodder grasses. Depending {{on the nature of the}} crop, it was possible to harvest two <b>successive</b> <b>crops</b> in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.|$|R
