60|$|Very friendly, and all that. It {{made the}} {{situation}} darned {{difficult for a}} fellow, if you <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E

60|$|If {{you look}} at the various accounts, in the four gospels, of the Lord's last words on earth, you will <b>see,</b> surely, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> Let us take them one by one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, that {{we shall}} be so {{infatuated}} with you {{that we shall}} make your life a burden to you. You'll <b>see</b> soon enough <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> by it." ...|$|R
60|$|Then fancy to {{yourself}} a bush like that hawthorn bush, with numberless blossoms, and every blossom on that bush a separate living thing, {{with its own}} mouth, and arms, and stomach, budding and growing fresh live branches and fresh live flowers, {{as fast as the}} old ones die: and then you will <b>see</b> better <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|R
60|$|But to each {{of these}} puzzles St. Paul gives an answer in the text. Let us take them each in its order, and you will <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've read it {{over and}} over again, and I can't understand. When Bobbie says it's conclusive, I tell him it means nothing--but--don't you <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> The {{uncertainty}} is more than I can bear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> if you'd ever watched {{your own}} face {{when you were}} {{listening}} to music, talking earnestly, or much moved, then your soul gets into your eyes and you are like Psyche." ...|$|E

6000|$|... --Yes, Mr Bloom said, {{and another}} thing I often thought, is to have {{municipal}} funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don't you <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; but, Frank, don't you <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> This {{thing has}} come to you, and you can't help it, and you are descended from these people really; {{but it would be}} choice for me, and I could not bear to feel that you were ashamed of me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But Maggie for {{a minute}} only stared back at her. [...] "Help me to find out WHAT I imagine. I don't know--I've nothing but my {{perpetual}} anxiety.

6000|$|... "I've got it now," [...] cried Bull, [...] "it {{was because}} he was so fat and so light. Just like a balloon. We always think of fat people as heavy, but he could have danced against a sylph. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> now <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> Moderate {{strength}} is shown in violence, supreme strength is shown in levity. It was like the old speculations--what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 7, 2012, Katy Perry {{announced}} via Twitter {{that she}} and Paramount Pictures would release a part-biopic, part-concert film entitled Katy Perry: Part of Me in mid-2012.

6000|$|... 'You haven't the {{pleasure}} of Mr Ira Nutcombe's acquaintance, Claire, or you wouldn't talk like that. He wasn't {{the sort of man}} you could get things out of.

6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} realize that," [...] Guy said earnestly. [...] "Now look here, Virginia. You saw the line my aunt took. There's {{no doubt that}} from a certain point of view she's right.

6000|$|... "You <b>see</b> now <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> {{about the}} ladder," [...] {{went on the}} detective; [...] "it's the only old piece of {{furniture}} here {{and the first thing}} that caught that cockney eye of mine. But there is something else. That loft up there is a sort of lumber room without any lumber. So far as I can see, it's as empty as everything else; and, as things are, I don't see the use of the ladder leading to it. It seems to me, as I can't find anything unusual down here, that it might pay us to look up there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing whatever. Don't you <b>see</b> that's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> On the {{character}} of every one else you may find some little black speck; if I were to take {{half an hour to}} it, some day, I've no doubt I should be able to find one on yours. For my own, of course, I'm spotted like a leopard. But on Madame Merle's nothing, nothing, nothing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll back myself {{against any}} Englishman, Frenchman, German, or Italian, {{for a large}} sum of money. I can't come quite up to the Poles. The fact is, the honester the man is the worse he always dances. Yes; <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> you <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> must be a rogue. Perhaps I am;--perhaps I'm only an exception.

6000|$|... "It's not Gibbon exactly," [...] Helen pondered. [...] "It's {{the facts}} of life, I think--d'you <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> What really goes on, what people feel, {{although}} they generally try to hide it? There's nothing to be frightened of. It's so much more beautiful than the pretences--always more interesting--always better, I should say, than that kind of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think it}} MIGHT be awfully jolly, as you say,' she replied. 'But don't {{you think it}} was an unpardonable liberty to take--to talk of such things to Rupert--who after all--you <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> Ursula--they might have been two men {{arranging}} an outing with some little TYPE they'd picked up.

6000|$|... 'You're acting all {{fair and}} above-board by me,' he said: 'and, before I take your money, I'll {{do the same}} by you. Look here, {{this is how it}} stands.

Of course, I know nothing about it, but I fancy he got into trouble in the town. That is merely a straw which shows how the wind is blowing, but if you lived on the spot you would <b>see</b> more <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> There is trouble in the air. And now that this election is coming on, I should not wonder if things came to a head. I can't remember a single election in Wrykyn when there was not disorder in the town. And if the school is going to join in, as it probably will, I shall not be sorry when the holidays come. I know the headmaster is only waiting for an excuse to put the town out of bounds.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{the more}} that girl gets, the more she'll have, Lee. As Ben says, she's the kind that {{if she were a}} boy would turn out a big self-made man. That's a little twisted as to grammar, but you <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> Sex is one of the {{ultimate}} mysteries, isn't it? Now, why didn't I inherit my father's ability?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you did, old top, so you did. I'd quite forgotten. I {{ought to}} have thanked you before. Well, so long.

'Not that I mean that I wish--he has never given me any trouble--but just look at James Frost, and you would <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean!</b> There's energy in him--fire--independence; you feel there is substance in him, and like him the better for having a will and way of his own.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Pike {{described}} it as consistent with the armed struggle (dau trinh) theory espoused by Võ Nguyên Giáp but opposed by the politically oriented Trường Chinh. Pike said he could almost hear Trường Chinh saying, [...] "You <b>see,</b> it's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> You're {{not going to win}} militarily {{on the ground in the}} South.

Invasion of [...] "a member country of the Socialist camp" [...] would enlarge the war, which Giap said would cause the [...] "U. S. imperialists...incalculable serious consequences." [...] As for reinforcements, [...] "Even if they increase their troops by another 50,000, 100,000 or more, they cannot extricate themselves from their comprehensive stalemate in the southern part of our country." ...|$|R
