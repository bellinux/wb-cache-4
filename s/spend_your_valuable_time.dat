60|$|THE LADY. Ah! [Great sigh of relief]. And now, Lord Augustus, I {{have taken}} up too much of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> Goodbye.|$|R
6000|$|... "As you please. It {{really matters}} little. Indeed, I suppose I was rather foolish in coming at all, and wasting <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> for nothing." ...|$|R

5000|$|Kaada´s {{debut in}} a {{recorded}} format came with his 2001 solo album Thank You for Giving Me <b>Your</b> <b>Valuable</b> <b>Time.</b> A musical blend of woo-wop, show tunes and jungle rhythms {{into a coherent}} mix of live instrumentation and electronic elements, fusing elements of five decades of popular music. Thank You for Giving Me <b>Your</b> <b>Valuable</b> <b>Time</b> firmly established Kaada as a key voice on Norway´s blossoming music scene.

6000|$|... "Gently, sir! You {{suspected}} me {{just now}} of wasting <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> Don't rashly conclude that I am the lady, {{until you find}} that I am acquainted with the circumstances." ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily. It {{seems to}} me, Miss Fairfax, that I am {{trespassing}} on <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> No doubt you have many other calls {{of a similar}} character {{to make in the}} neighbourhood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} so," [...] said Holmes, imperturbably. [...] "And now, Lord Holdhurst, we {{have already}} taken up too much of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> and we shall wish you good-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I enclose a dollar, because I do {{not think}} it right to ask you to give all <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> and <b>your</b> best thought without giving you back what it is worth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon us," [...] said Psmith courteously, [...] "for {{breaking}} in upon your reverie; but, {{if you could}} spare us a moment of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> there are one or two things which we should like to know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will be so good," [...] she said, looking back, [...] "as to spare me {{half an hour of}} <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> this evening. This is a subject which I must discuss with you further at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} that my {{behavior}} is not sufficiently good for you. You never found any cause to complain of it when our surroundings were less aristocratic. I am quite ashamed of taking so much of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> GOOD-morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That circumstance, indeed, Doctor Blimber,' pursued Mr Dombey, {{glancing at}} his little son, 'and the {{interview}} I {{have already had}} the pleasure of holding with you, renders any further explanation, and consequently, any further intrusion on <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> so unnecessary, that--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{said the}} Old Lady, cutting him short again. [...] "I am much obliged to you--and I ask {{you not to}} let Miss Gray know {{anything}} of my interference. And I shall not take up any more of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> Good afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{agree to}} all that. Nevertheless, I {{should like to}} save him," [...] said Kenneth. [...] "His trial has not yet taken place, and instead of your devoting {{considerable}} of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> appearing against him {{it would be much}} simpler to settle the matter right here and now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I trust, Mr. Holmes, {{that you}} can spare me {{a few hours of}} <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> We have had a very painful {{incident}} at St. Luke's, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in town, I should have been at a loss what to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said my patient, [...] "but I {{have felt}} another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I {{think that your}} breakfast has {{completed}} the cure.

6000|$|... "'I {{must ask}} your pardon, sir, for thus {{trespassing}} upon <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> and I certainly {{should not have}} done so but for the certainty that our interests in a certain matter which I have in hand are practically identical, in so far that we both should wish to outwit a clever rogue.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, hang it, man, {{you want}} to think. What do you suppose we pay you a salary for? And just let me tell you, Wrenn, right here and now, that if you can't condescend to spare us some of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> now and then, we can good and plenty get along without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you," [...] he said. [...] "If you can spare {{me a few}} moments of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> I will put the facts before you.

6000|$|... "It {{is entirely}} correct," [...] {{answered}} the magistrate, affably. [...] "To prevent waste of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> gentlemen, I may say, once for all, {{that it is}} my unalterable determination that no fight shall, under any circumstances, be brought off in the county over which I have control, and I am prepared to follow you all day {{in order to prevent}} it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm sorry I {{should have}} brought you {{so far out of}} your way," [...] she said, in a studied cold voice--though that was quite untrue, for, as a matter of fact, she had enjoyed their talk {{together}} immensely. [...] "And besides, you've been wasting <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> when you ought to have been painting. You'll hardly get any work done now at all this morning. I must ask you to get out at the very next station." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is business," [...] Tyrrel answered, promptly, {{taking his}} cue with Celtic quickness. [...] "Business {{that may be}} worth {{a good deal of}} money." [...] Erasmus Walker pricked up his ears at that welcome sound, and let the pen drop quietly into the rack by his side. [...] "Only I'm afraid I must ask for {{a quarter of an hour}} or so of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> You will not find it thrown away. You can name your own price for it." ...|$|R

I am a man of deeds' ('Ay, damn you, that you are, and you charge well for 'em too,' said {{a voice from the}} crowd, probably that of a gentleman who was immediately afterwards observed with his hat crushed over his head.)

60|$|I {{should like}} you, {{if you can}} spare me a moment of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> to throw <b>your</b> mind back to that {{conversation}} he and I had had in the garden on the previous evening. Not the glimmering landscape bit, I don't mean that, but the concluding passages of it. Having done so, you will recall that when he informed me that he never touched alcoholic liquor, I shook the head a bit, feeling that this must inevitably weaken him as a force where proposing to girls was concerned.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} {{otherwise}} {{if the case}} were defended, sir," [...] returned his dragoman; [...] "then, too, {{you would have had}} an opportunity of understanding the capacity of the human mind for seeing the same incident to be both black and white; but it would take much of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> and the Court would be so crowded that you would have a lady sitting on your right wing also, and possibly on your knee. For, as you observe, ladies are particularly attached to these dramas of real life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have become}} acquainted with some facts in this case which may not {{interest}} you as a lawyer, Don Arturo, but which affect me as a woman. When I have told you them, you will tell me--who knows?--that they do not alter the legal aspect of my--my father's claim. You will perhaps laugh at me for my resolution. But I have given you so much trouble, {{that it is only}} fair you should know it is not merely caprice that governs me--that you should know why your visit here is a barren one; why you--the great advocate--have been obliged to waste <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> with my poor friend, Donna Maria, for nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All and everything! did I say all and everything? Really, my Lord, you scan my {{expressions}} so critically! but I {{see your}} Lordship is smiling at my boyish nonsense! and really I feel that I have already wasted {{too much of}} <b>your</b> Lordship's <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> and displayed too much of my own ignorance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gibbon! Gibbon was an infidel, and I {{would not}} give {{the end of this}} cigar for such a man's opinion. If Mr. Fielding was a gentleman by birth, he ought to have known better; and so much the worse for him that he did not. But what am I talking of, wasting <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time?</b> No more smoke, thank you. I must away into the City, but would not pass the Temple without calling on you, and thanking my boy's old protector. You will have the {{kindness}} to come and dine with us--to-morrow, the next day, your own day? Your friend is going out of town?

Thank you both for giving me some of <b>your</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> Finally, dedicate this work to my family, friends and all those who have supported me in some way or another during the project. 1 Nowadays, there is an active field of research in neuroscience trying to find relations between neurofunctional abnormalities of brain structures and neu-rological disorders.
