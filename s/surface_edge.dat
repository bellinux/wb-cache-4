40|$|Topological {{insulators}} (TIs) are {{a unique}} class of materials {{characterized by a}} <b>surface</b> (<b>edge)</b> Dirac cone state of helical Dirac fermions {{in the middle of}} bulk (surface) gap. When the thickness (width) of TIs is reduced, however, interaction between the <b>surface</b> (<b>edge)</b> states will open a gap removing the Dirac cone. Using density function theory calculation, we demonstrate the creation of helical Dirac fermions from interfacing two gapped TI films, a single bilayer Bi grown on a single quintuple layer Bi 2 Se 3 or Bi 2 Te 3. The theoretical prediction is directly confirmed by experiment. We further show that the extrinsic helical Dirac fermions consists of predominantly Bi bilayer states, which are created by a giant Rashba effect due to interfacial charge transfer. Our findings provide a promising new method to create novel TI materials by interface engineering. Comment: 18 pages and 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Using a nonmodal {{decomposition}} technique {{based on}} the potential vorticity (PV) perspective, the optimal perturbation or singular vector (SV) of the Eady model without upper rigid lid is studied for a kinetic energy norm. Special emphasis is put {{on the role of}} the continuum modes (CM) in the structure of the SV and on the importance of resonance to the SV evolution. The basis for the SV is formed by a number of nonmodal structures, each consisting of a superposition of one CM and one edge wave, such that the initial surface potential temperature (PT) is zero. These nonmodal structures are used as PV building blocks to construct the SV. The motivation for using a nonmodal approach is that no attempt has been made sofar to include the CM residing at the steering level of the <b>surface</b> <b>edge</b> wave in the perturbation, although it is known that this CM is in linear resonance with the <b>surface</b> <b>edge</b> wave...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGlass shaping, which {{corresponds}} to {{the removal of the}} edges of a specimen, is the last finishing operation in glass manufacturing. This process has several functions on the final shaped glass including removing sharp edges, improving mechanical resistance, decreasing surface damage and giving it an aesthetical aspect. This article addresses the effects of working parameters, including grinding forces and consumed power, on <b>surface</b> <b>edge</b> finishing and damage mechanism induced during glass grinding. Microscopic observations and multi-scale analysis have also been conducted to investigate the <b>surface</b> <b>edge</b> characteristics. Experimental results show three damage regimes. The first (regime I) is a partial ductile regime with cutting action accompanied by chip formation. The second (regime II) is a crushing (or fragmentation) regime. The last (regime III) is also a partial ductile regime but by ploughing action with displaced material. The shaped surface obtained in the regime II has a better roughness than that obtained in regime I and III. However, regimes I and III include streaks and form defects which are not present in regime II. Similar to metallic materials, the evolution of force components show a linear relationship between normal and tangential forces. This implicates a constant average contact pressure and friction coefficient (l) between the flat grains and the workpiece...|$|E
