40|$|This paper quantifies the {{short-term}} and long-term impact of bank <b>supervision</b> (<b>measured</b> using CAMEL composite and component ratings) on different categories of loan growth: (a) {{commercial and industrial}} loans, (b) consumer loans, and (c) real estate loans. For each of these categories, we perform dynamic loan growth equations at the state-level augmented by the inclusion of CAMEL ratings for all banks in the state, after controlling for banking and economic conditions. We perform these regressions for two distinct sub-periods: (1) 1985 - 1993 (which covers the credit crunch period) and (2) 1994 - 2004 (which covers the sustained recovery period). For the first period, 1985 - 1993, we find {{that out of the}} three loan categories considered, business lending is the most sensitive to changes in CAMEL ratings (both the composite and the components), although the other loan categories also show some sensitivity. Overall, however, we find little evidence suggesting that the effects of changes in any of the components of CAMEL ratings differ systematically from the effects of changes in the composite CAMEL. For the second period, we find little evidence that changes in CAMEL ratings (the composite or its components) had any systematic effect on loan growth for any of the loan categories considered. ...|$|R
40|$|The Supervisory Relationship Questionnaire (SRQ) {{is one of}} the few {{theoretically}} {{sound and}} psychometrically valid questionnaires for measuring the SR within clinical supervision. However, its length can make it difficult to use in clinical practice and research. This study aimed to produce a shorter version of the SRQ (the Short Supervisory Relationship Questionnaire: S-SRQ) that retained its reliability and psychometric validity. The SRQ's 67 items were initially reduced using the criteria of external, internal and face validity. Two hundred and three UK trainee clinical psychologists then completed a series of online questionnaires including the S-SRQ and other clinical <b>supervision</b> <b>measures.</b> A Principal Component Analysis identified three components of the S-SRQ: 'safe base', 'reflective education' and 'structure', and an 18 -item version was produced. Analyses revealed that the S-SRQ has high internal reliability, adequate test-retest reliability and good convergent, divergent and predictive validity. Participants also rated the S-SRQ as easy to use and potentially helpful for providing feedback on the SR in supervision. The S-SRQ (three subscales, 18 items) is a valid and reliable measure of the SR from the supervisee perspective. The current findings also support aspects of existing models of the SR. The S-SRQ is a promising measure for use in clinical, training and research settings...|$|R

40|$|Background Clinical {{supervision}} lies at {{the core}} of the professional development of clinicians providing services within a range of service settings. The supervisory alliance is regarded as the most important construct in effective supervision which underlies the importance of metrics to assess this construct. Aims materials and Method A cross-sectional self-report questionnaire design was used to examine clinical supervision constructs. The study used two scales measuring the supervisory alliance (SRQ and SWAI-T), a scale <b>measuring</b> <b>supervision</b> satisfaction (SSQ) and a scale measuring disclosure (TDS). The questionnaires were administered to 127 clinical psychology trainees who were undertaking a practicum placement. Results Both scales measuring the alliance were positively correlated with satisfaction with supervision and disclosure, with similar sizes of correlation for each alliance scale. There was also a large, positive correlation between the two scales of measuring the alliance. Discussion Both scales were designed for use in supervision and are related to <b>supervision</b> outcome <b>measures</b> in the expected directions. Conclusion The SRQ has some distinct advantages over the SWAI-T that lend the SRQ to be potentially more useful in clinical and research settings...|$|R
40|$|As {{economic}} reforms are mutually interdependent, a liberal policy package needs internal coherence. How can a coherent reform strategy be achieved for a well-balanced and functional economic system? In this paper, we analyze {{the relationship between}} financial reforms coherence and international capital inflows (foreign direct investments (FDI) and portfolio investments). We consider a package of eight financial reforms, comprising interest rate deregulation, credit ceiling and directed-credit programs liberalization, elimination of banking sector entry barriers, privatization of state owed banks, development of security markets and banking sector <b>supervision</b> <b>measures.</b> Complementarity is measured through the reciprocal of the Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration index. The {{results suggest that the}} manner with which financial reforms are implemented matters. Particularly, complementarity increases FDI inflows by 0. 10 %. Moreover, this effect depends on the location of the countries on the distribution of financial reforms level. Indeed, the countries located above the median value of financial reform level experience larger FDI and portfolio investment inflows than others. Finally, when privatization of state owned banks and the adoption of a capital adequacy ratio based on the Basle I standard occur after other preliminary financial reforms, the returns to complementarity are higher. In others words, a developed and relatively safe domestic financial system attracts more FDI and portfolio investments than a developed but unsafe financial system. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the real reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions from {{coal-fired power plants}} in China, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) remote sensing SO 2 columns were used to inversely model the SO 2 emission burdens surrounding 26 isolated power plants {{before and after the}} effective operation of their flue gas desulfurization (FGD) facilities. An improved two-dimensional Gaussian fitting method was developed to estimate SO 2 burdens under complex background conditions, by using the accurate local background columns and the customized fitting domains for each target source. The OMI-derived SO 2 burdens before effective FGD operation were correlated well with the bottom-up emission estimates (R = 0. 92), showing the reliability of the OMI-derived SO 2 burdens as a linear indicator of the associated source strength. OMI observations indicated that the average lag time period between installation and effective operation of FGD facilities at these 26 power plants was around 2 years, and no FGD facilities have actually operated before the year 2008. The OMI estimated average SO 2 removal equivalence (56. 0 %) was substantially lower than the official report (74. 6 %) for these 26 power plants. Therefore, it has been concluded that the real reductions of SO 2 emissions in China associated with the FGD facilities at coal-fired power plants were considerably diminished {{in the context of the}} current weak <b>supervision</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

Methods: Data were collected in a two-wave panel study amongst 616 adolescents.

Self-control, morality, peer deviance, unsupervised peer activity, and parental <b>supervision</b> were <b>measured</b> using a self-report questionnaire. Delinquency was measured using self-report questions in the second wave. Results: The findings demonstrated that setting diversity is positively related to delinquency.
