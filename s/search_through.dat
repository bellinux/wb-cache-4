5|$|The {{circulation}} {{version of}} the Eisenhower dollar, the largest clad coin ever attempted by the Mint, was released through banks on November 1, 1971. Many were obtained by collectors; there was sufficient demand that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to <b>search</b> <b>through</b> rolls in search of better specimens. An oil film was found on {{a large number of}} specimens; this was removed by collectors.|$|E
5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} found with 17 clues, {{although}} finding them is not a trivial task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer search that the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a <b>search</b> <b>through</b> equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 clues {{have been found}} with 180° rotational symmetry, and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if this number of clues is minimal in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 clues have been found with two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if this number of clues is minimal for this case.|$|E

25|$|Because {{numbers were}} {{different}} for every exchange, callers either had to dial the operator or {{look up the}} telephone number. An example of this was Auckland, New Zealand before the introduction of 111 in the 1960s – the city had 40 exchanges, all with different emergency numbers, and finding the telephone number for the local exchange would require having to <b>search</b> <b>through</b> the city's 500-page telephone directory.|$|E

25|$|The LZW {{algorithm}} {{requires a}} search of the table for each pixel. A linear <b>search</b> <b>through</b> up to 4096 addresses would make the coding slow. In practice the codes can be stored in order of numerical value; this allows each search to be done by a SAR (Successive Approximation Register, as used in some ADCs), with only 12 magnitude comparisons. For this efficiency an extra table is needed to convert between codes and actual memory addresses; the extra table upkeeping is needed only when a new code is stored which happens at much less than pixel rate.|$|E
25|$|Many {{problems}} in AI {{can be solved}} in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions: Reasoning {{can be reduced to}} performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule. Planning algorithms <b>search</b> <b>through</b> trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis. Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space. Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.|$|E

25|$|The {{search for}} Flight 370 {{is the most}} {{expensive}} search operation in aviation history. In June 2014 Time estimated that the total search effort to that point had cost approximately US$70million. Malaysia's Ministry of Transport revealed that it had spent RM280.5million (US$70million) on the <b>search</b> <b>through</b> February 2016. The tender for the underwater search was AU$52million (US$43million or €35million)—shared by Australia and Malaysia—for 12 months. On 17 January 2017, the official search for Flight 370 was suspended after yielding no evidence of the aircraft apart from some marine debris on the coast of Africa. Reported costs of the search varied between US$135–160million. In February 2017, Malaysia's Transport Minister stated the cost as RM500million (US$112.47million).|$|E
25|$|In July 2010 a UK music {{magazine}} {{printed a}} letter from the pressure group Friends of Radio 3 that criticised BBC Three for having 'comedies, game shows, films and documentaries, but no arts programming at all'. In a later issue another correspondent endorsed this assessment {{on the basis of a}} <b>search</b> <b>through</b> issues of the Radio Times, and cast doubt on the BBC's claim (in the document Performance Against Public Commitments 2009/10) that the channel broadcast '54 hours of new music and arts programming' in that year. Two months later the same correspondent wrote in to inform readers that the BBC had refused his 'Freedom of Information' request concerning the titles of the programmes used in calculating the '54 hours' total.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} {{the stars and stripes}} design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the {{descendants}} of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870. By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776. Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own <b>search</b> <b>through</b> the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.|$|E
