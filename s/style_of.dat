40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to examine}} the {{matching}} between the learning <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> instructors and teacher candidates and between the teaching <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> instructors and learning <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> teacher candidates.

5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian <b>style</b> <b>of</b> painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} <b>style</b> <b>of</b> Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
