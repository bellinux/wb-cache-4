25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E
60|$|Oliver {{stirred the}} fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little time, without speaking; but at length {{she raised her}} head, and looked round.|$|E
60|$|If he only <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour, {{reading the}} papers, and nodding to his many friends, {{it would take}} him out of himself.|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour by my watch, {{though it}} seemed {{only a few}} minutes, and all that time my lion lay {{crouched}} on his crag and never moved.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{hour and}} then 'e sent {{the boy in}} agin. This time the cabman lost 'is temper, and, arter chasing the boy up the road, gave a young feller twopence to take 'is place and promised 'im another twopence when he came out. Sam {{tried to get a}} word with 'im as 'e passed, but he wouldn't listen, and it was pretty near 'arf an hour later afore they all came out, talking and laughing.|$|R
60|$|She {{tried to}} smile but her {{strength}} was almost gone. They drove to a restaurant and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> some little time. Lenora soon recovered her colour. She even had courage {{to speak of the}} events of the afternoon when they re-entered the automobile.|$|E
60|$|The {{other girls}} went on, leaving Rachel {{sitting on the}} skids, {{in the shadow of}} the big white boat. She <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time dreaming happily, with her blue eyes on the far, pearly horizon, and her golden head leaning against the boat.|$|E
60|$|About {{eleven o'clock}} Riley and Cutcheon moved {{off to the}} edge of a cane-brake near the water, and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, talking in low tones. The horses were belled and spancelled near by, feeding on the cane and wild grass, and Polly Ann was cooking journey-cakes on a stone.|$|E
6000|$|Fan <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> half <b>an</b> hour {{longer in}} the {{grateful}} twilight and warmth of that luxurious room, and then Rosie's voice startled her crying at the door: ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{after he}} had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour {{he got up and}} walked home; and as he went he tried to resolve that he would reject the {{philosophy}} of Mrs Baggett and accept the other. [...] "If I only knew!" [...] he said as he entered his own gate. [...] "If one could only see clearly!" [...] Then he found Mary still seated in the garden. [...] "Nothing is to be got," [...] he said, [...] "by asking you <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer." ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly {{the beer}} was ordered, {{and the three}} <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> talking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of hours in {{reference}} to a long, long voyage to the southern seas.|$|R
60|$|Far {{from being}} terrified by {{this state of}} things the valiant Raja {{increased}} in boldness, seeing a prospect of an end to his adventure. Approaching the tree {{he felt that the}} fire did not burn him, and so he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while to observe the body, which hung, head downwards, from a branch a little above him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, leaning forward, {{his head}} upon his hands. The wind {{that had been}} striving with the canvas roof all at once lifted its edges, and a moonbeam slipped {{suddenly}} in, and lay for a moment like a shining blade upon his shoulder; and, knighted by its touch, straightway plain Henry York arose, sustained, high-purposed and self-reliant.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{continued}} {{to sit on}} the large stone, meditating upon what was best to be done, and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the doors within five miles of Bristol, taking them at a hundred and fifty or two hundred a day, and endeavouring to find Miss Arabella by that expedient, when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might have <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> twelvemonth and yet not found without it.|$|E
6000|$|Thereupon {{she gave}} a shrill whistle, {{and a moment later}} a great Maltese pussycat sprang upon the shelf of the doorway at number 1 and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant crouched, with its ears {{pointing}} into the air and its big yellow eyes gazing steadily at the visitors. Then the pussy leaped lightly to the ground, and standing upon its rear legs before the Queen, he bobbed his head solemnly up and down and said, [...] "Welcome, Queen of Merryland, to the Valley of Pussycats!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you are going," [...] {{she said}} to her lover, one evening, as he rose from the chair on which he had been {{swinging}} himself {{at the door of the}} cottage which looks down over the creek of the sea. He had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour talking to her as she worked, or watching her as she moved about the place. It was a beautiful evening, and the sun had been falling to rest with almost tropical glory before his feet. The bright oleanders were red with their blossoms all around him, and he had thoroughly enjoyed his hour of easy rest. [...] "So you are going," [...] {{she said to}} him, not putting her work out of her hand as he rose to depart.|$|R
60|$|Sam lost 'is {{presence}} o' mind, and afore he knew wot 'e {{was doing}} 'im and Ginger 'ad {{walked in and}} sat down. They <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> over <b>an</b> hour and a 'arf talking, and then Sam, {{with a look at}} Ginger, said they must be going, because he 'ad got to call <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pair o' boots he 'ad left to be mended.|$|R
60|$|He {{slammed the}} front door behind 'im and they 'eard 'im go off down the road as if 'e was going for fire-engines. Charlie <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment struck all of a heap, and then 'e jumped up and dashed arter 'im. He just saw 'im disappearing round a corner, and he didn't see 'im agin for a couple o' year arterwards, by which time the Sydney gal had 'ad three or four young men arter 'im, and Emma, who 'ad changed her name to Smith, was doing one o' the best {{businesses}} in the chandlery line in Poplar.|$|E
60|$|Her hand {{suddenly}} gripped his. They <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment in}} a strange, disturbing silence. Then the orchestra ceased, the curtain was rung up, the performance, {{which was in the}} nature of a music-hall show, with frequent turns and changes, commenced. Popular favourites from every department of the theatrical world, each in turn claimed attention and applause. Katharine watched it all with an interest always strained, a gaiety somewhat hysterical; Jocelyn Thew with the measured pleasure of a critic; Richard with uproarious, if sometimes a little unreal merriment. The time slipped by apparently unnoticed. Suddenly Richard glanced at his wrist-watch and stood up.|$|E
60|$|Outside {{the wind}} was {{thrashing}} the broad, leafy top of the maple whose tallest twigs reached to the funny grey eaves of our old house. One roly-poly little sparrow blew or flew to the sill and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, {{looking at me with}} knowing eyes. Down below I could see Murray {{in a corner of the}} yard, pottering over a sick duck. He had set its broken leg and was nursing it back to health. Anyone except Uncle Abimelech could see that Murray was simply born to be a doctor and that it was flying in the face of Providence to think of making him anything else.|$|E
60|$|The girl <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> almost {{motionless}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, exhibiting in {{her face}} and figure at once the keen watchfulness of the savage and the endurance of the pale-face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot help feeling, mother," [...] he said, {{after she}} had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time, [...] "that <b>for</b> the present <b>there</b> is a {{division}} between you and me." ...|$|R
60|$|I haunted the abbey, and {{the more}} I saw of it the more I loved it. The {{impression}} it had made on me during my former visits had faded, or else I had never properly seen it, or had not seen it in the right emotional mood. Now I began to think it {{the best of all}} the great abbey churches of England and the equal of the cathedrals in its effect on the mind. How rich the interior is in its atmosphere of tempered light or tender gloom! How tall and graceful the columns holding up the high roof of white stone with its marvellous palm-leaf sculpture! What a vast expanse of beautifully stained glass! I certainly gave myself plenty of time to appreciate it on this occasion, as I visited it every day, sometimes two or three times, and not infrequently I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour at a stretch.|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} and knew that every second the scene changed, yet I could not tell how. I knew I sat high over a hole of broken, splintered, barren mountains; I knew I could see a hundred miles {{of the length of}} it, and {{eighteen}} miles of the width of it, and a mile of the depth of it, and the shafts and rays of rose light on a million glancing, many-hued surfaces at once; but that knowledge was no help to me. I repeated a lot of meaningless superlatives to myself, and I found words inadequate and superfluous. The spectacle was too elusive and too great. It was life and death, heaven and hell.|$|E
60|$|And at {{last they}} came out to their little seat on the flying stage, and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time in silence. The little seat was in shadow, but the zenith was pale blue with the effulgence of the stage overhead, and all the city spread below them, squares and circles and patches of {{brilliance}} caught in a mesh-work of light. The little stars seemed very faint and small: near {{as they had been}} to the old-world watcher, they had become now infinitely remote. Yet one could see them in the darkened patches amidst the glare, and especially in the northward sky, the ancient constellations gliding steadfast and patient about the pole.|$|E
60|$|She {{was lying}} {{down with her}} face buried in her hands, tormenting herself with such thoughts, when Biddy came {{to tell her that}} dinner was on the table. Feemy did not dare to refuse to go in lest {{something}} should be suspected; so she rubbed her red eyes till they were still redder, and went into the parlour, where she alleged that she had a racking headache, which would give her no peace; and having <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> miserable half hour till her father and Thady had finished their dinner, she went up stairs to her bed-room, and after laying awake half the night, at last succeeded in crying herself to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{was like}} this, Sir Knight: I had Hudson and Jeffreys posted upon the wall, and I thought I would take a turn down on the rocks, <b>for</b> it was <b>a</b> dark night, {{and you can see}} much farther when you are by {{the edge of the water}} than you can when you are at the masthead. I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour, and was {{thinking}} that it was about time to go up and turn out the other watch, when I saw something dark upon the water. It wasn't a ship, that was certain, and if it was a boat there wasn't any one in it; but it was too dark to make quite sure what it was. I watched it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, though I did not think much of the thing, taking it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> boat that had got adrift, or maybe a barrel from one of the Turkish ships. Presently I made out that it was a good bit nearer than when I first saw it.|$|R
60|$|They <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{in silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments. A promenading couple put their heads behind the screen, and withdrew {{with the sound}} of {{feminine}} giggling. Outside, the piano was being thumped to the tune of a popular polka.|$|R
60|$|I {{have said}} that she would sit there resolving, or trying to resolve. There is nothing in the world so {{difficult}} as that task of making up one's mind. Who is there that has not longed that the power and privilege of selection among alternatives should be taken away from him in some important crisis of his life, and that his conduct should be arranged for him, either this way or that, by some divine power if it were possible,--by some patriarchal power in the absence of divinity,--or by chance even, if nothing better than chance could be found to do it? But no one dares to cast the die, and to go honestly by the hazard. There must be the actual necessity of obeying the die, before even the die can be of any use. As it was, when Madame Goesler had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour, till her legs were tired beneath her, she had not resolved. It must be as her impulse should direct her when the important moment came. There was not a soul on earth to whom she could go for counsel, and when she asked herself for counsel, the counsel would not come.|$|R
60|$|Frank did not reply. He {{had already}} thought the matter {{over and over}} again, and had reached the opinion {{that he could not}} interfere. If he had not himself {{proposed}} to her, and been refused, he might have moved. Up to that time he had stood in the position of an old friend of the family, and as such could well have spoken to Lady Greendale on a matter that so vitally concerned Bertha's happiness. Now his taking that step would have the appearance of being the interference of a disappointed rival, rather than of a disinterested friend. He went up on deck, <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, and at last arrived at a conclusion.|$|E
60|$|They <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{long while}} in silence; the beer had got to Liza's head, {{and the warm}} night air filled her with a double intoxication. She felt the arm round her waist, and the big, heavy form {{pressing}} against her side; she experienced again the curious sensation as if her heart were about to burst, and it choked her--a feeling so oppressive and painful it almost made her feel sick. Her hands began to tremble, and her breathing grew rapid, {{as though she were}} suffocating. Almost fainting, she swayed over towards the man, and a cold shiver ran through her from top to toe. Jim bent over her, and, taking her in both arms, he pressed his lips to hers in a long, passionate kiss. At last, panting for breath, she turned her head away and groaned.|$|E
60|$|And {{the next}} evening he told himself the same. He dared not whisper to himself {{anything}} else. And each succeeding evening again. He never remembered how many. For a time he would sit watching the path by which she had always come; and when the hour was long past he would rise and walk towards the gate, look east and west, and then return. One evening he stopped one of the park-keepers and questioned him. Yes, the man remembered her quite well: the young lady with the fawn gloves. She had come once or twice--maybe oftener, the park-keeper could not be sure--and had waited. No, there had been nothing to show {{that she was in}} any way upset. She had just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, now and then walking a little way and then coming back again, until the closing hour, and then she had gone. He left his address with the park-keeper. The man promised to let him know if he ever saw her there again.|$|E
60|$|But Reddy <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute. He was {{too eager}} {{to find out if}} it would prove to be {{possible}} to get inside that henhouse. Running swiftly but cautiously past the henhouse and along one side of the henyard, he peeped around the corner to see if by any chance the yard gate had been left open. His heart gave a leap of joy as he saw that the gate was not quite closed. All he would have to do would be to push it and enter.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{hour after}} their tea, and Mrs. Ray had in truth become fond of him. When {{he spoke to}} Rachel he did so with the utmost respect, {{and he seemed to}} be much more {{intimate}} with the mother than with the daughter. Mrs. Ray's mind was laden with the burden of what he had said in Rachel's absence, and with the knowledge {{that she would have to}} discuss it when Rowan was gone; but she felt herself to be happy while he remained, and had begun to hope that he would not go quite yet. Rachel also was perfectly happy. She said very little, but thought much of her different meetings with him,--of the arm in the clouds, of the promise of his friendship, of her first dance, of the little fraud by which he had secured her company at supper, and then of those words he had spoken when he detained her after supper in the hall. She knew that she liked him well, but had feared that such liking might not be encouraged. But what could be nicer than this,--to sit and listen to him in her mother's presence? Now she was not afraid of him. Now she feared no one's eyes. Now she was disturbed by no dread lest she might be sinning against rules of propriety. There was no Mrs. Tappitt by, to rebuke her with an angry look.|$|R
60|$|He would peek {{out of his}} {{doorway and}} watch for chance {{visitors}} in the daytime. Twice he saw Butcher the Shrike alight {{a short distance from}} the tree in which Timmy lived. He knew Butcher had not forgotten that he had chased a badly frightened Mouse into a hole in that tree. Once he saw Whitey the Snowy Owl and so knew that Whitey had not yet returned to the Far North. Once Reddy Fox trotted along right past the foot of the old stub in which Whitefoot lived, and didn't even suspect that he was anywhere near. Twice he saw Old Man Coyote trotting past, and once Terror the Goshawk alighted on that very stub, and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> half <b>an</b> hour.|$|R
