5|$|Eleven goaltenders {{have scored}} {{a total of}} {{fourteen}} goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal scored by <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; {{in the case of}} own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> puck and seven were the result of own goals.|$|E

5|$|The first goaltender {{to score}} a goal by {{intentionally}} <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> puck into the opponent's net was the Philadelphia Flyers' Ron Hextall, who on December 8, 1987, scored on an empty net after Boston pulled their goaltender, Rejean Lemelin, for a sixth attacker late in the third period. The most recent goaltender to have scored a goal by deliberately <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> puck into his opponents' net was Mike Smith, in 2013.|$|E
5|$|After {{a week of}} <b>shooting,</b> <b>the</b> {{film was}} shelved due {{to the view that}} such a story might not succeed in Telugu; the {{production}} company instead produced Shanti, which became a failure. D.L. Narayana then decided to revive Devadasu as an independent producer. Janaki, who was originally chosen for the character of Parvati, was replaced by Savitri.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the site}} {{was used as a}} {{shooting}} location for the sci-fi horror film Alien 3. Various locations in the North East of England were used in <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> film, and the power station provided the location for some shots of the planet surface.|$|E

5|$|Mythology and {{folklore}} often {{exaggerate the}} skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known {{to be capable of}} trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E
5|$|Singer {{spent an}} 18-hour day <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> {{underground}} parking garage robbery.

5|$|The {{day after}} the <b>shooting,</b> <b>the</b> Hawkins family {{released}} a statement expressing their condolences for the victims. On December 13, 2007, Hawkins' mother issued a formal apology for Hawkins' actions {{in an interview on}} Good Morning America.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Shoot</b> <b>the</b> Chute {{concept has}} evolved over time in the {{amusement}} park industry. All modern <b>Shoot</b> <b>the</b> Chute rides today feature a guide track after the descent down the chute into the pool of water that allows the boats {{to return to the}} loading platform—completing a closed circuit track. Most modern <b>Shoot</b> <b>the</b> Chute rides usually consist of (though not limited to) an oval shaped layout or a figure-eight layout. Many <b>Shoot</b> <b>the</b> Chute installations also have an observation platform or bridge so that spectators, in addition to riders, can get wet from the splash created by the boats.|$|R

When the guys miss the video, they get either Gracie or Pete Smith to <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> video down with various guns ranging from an AK-47 to the Iraqi supergun.|$|R

5|$|The {{division}} of labor for <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount of}} work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles had {{received}} a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, {{there was no time}} to have it filed before <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to being a standalone game, <b>Shoot</b> <b>the</b> Bullet became something of a game engine on which ZUNs future games base. Mountain of Faith and Uwabami Breakers (Drinking Party, 2007) are two games which use <b>Shoot</b> <b>the</b> Bullet as their prototype.|$|R

5|$|Approximately 2,000 {{gathered}} on campus {{on the evening}} of Friday, February 15, for a candlelight vigil to commemorate the victims; among other public figures, Jesse Jackson and Robert W.

5|$|As a goaltender, Lehman was {{a strong}} skater and good puckhandler. He chased down loose pucks, {{and was able to}} pass the puck to his forwards, {{surprising}} the other team's defenders. Playing in the OPHL, Lehman scored a goal by <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> puck in the opponent's net. The first NHL goaltender to duplicate such a feat was Ron Hextall, who did it in 1987.|$|E
