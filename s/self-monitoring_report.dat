EIM {{was the first}} subscription-based application to organize, manage, and report sampling, analytical and subsurface data in the cloud. EIM offers analytical data management capabilities for chemicals, radionuclides, geology and hydrogeology (subsurface information). It is currently used to manage and report on the data associated with nuclear, mining, water quality, remediation, and upstream oil and gas activities. EIM has been expanded to include city-specific reporting requirements, which automates the generation of <b>self-monitoring</b> <b>report</b> forms (SMRFs) and discharge monitoring reports(DMR), [...] as well as supports the imports and exports for the Environmental Resources Program Information Management System (ERPIMS), which {{is used by the}} U.S. Air Force for validation and management of the environmental projects at its bases.|$|E

Perceptions of others 2 ̆ 7 betrayals should follow sex-role stereotypes (i. e., males {{are more likely to}} betray than females). Sex-role stereotyping might be attenuated when counter-stereotypical norms are made salient. One-hundred seventy five undergraduates completed the Interpersonal Behavior Survey (Roscoe et aI., 1988) and the Self-Monitoring Scale (Snyder 2 ̆ 6 Gangestad, 1986). Before doing so, participants read one of two instructional sets: females are more likely than males to betray their romantic partners; people in general are likely to betray their romantic partners. Participants responded to statements about romantic betrayals by a) themselves, b) typical males, and c) typical females. Compared to low <b>self-monitors,</b> high <b>self-monitors</b> <b>reported</b> more betrayals. Participants saw typical males as more likely than typical females to betray partners. This effect was attenuated by the counter-stereotypical instructional set. Three findings are noteworthy. First, likelihood to engage in romantic betrayals may be accounted for by individual differences in self-monitoring orientation. Second, sex-role stereotypes involving betrayals can apparently be counteracted to some degree simply through education. Third, self-monitoring and normative effects were largely independent...|$|R

Eventually, through politicizing and lobbying, CAN influenced the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) to monitor PM2.5 levels every hour and to release the data to the public. Data is now gathered from 14 different monitoring stations, although the organization still finds the government’s actions inadequate as a majority of monitors are placed above ground level and do not accurately measure the pollutants the average person would be exposed to.

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the Environemental User Fee System (EUFS) in the Laguna de Bay Region in 1997, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of its impacts particularly at the regulated firm level. This study, therefore, is an attempt to generate empirical evidence that could explain the differential behavior of regulated firms toward the EUFS. The emphasis of analysis is at the firm level, since firms are crucial stakeholders whose cooperation spells the difference between pollution or non-pollution, or between acceptable levels of pollution and excessive levels. The sources of information for this study include: a) a survey of 89 firms regularly monitored by the Laguna Lake Development Auhtority (LLDA) from 1999 - 2004; b) 170 firms with <b>self-monitoring</b> <b>reports</b> (SMRs) for 2002 and environmental performance indicators for 1999 - 2004; and c) dissemination seminars for firms and the regulator.

40|$|Self-monitoring {{research}} has {{developed into a}} significant literature that spans across disciplines. However, little {{research has}} examined the influence of self-monitoring {{on the development of}} the self-concept, which sets the stage for the current research endeavor. In the first study, it was hypothesized that directional questions “Are you extraverted?” would influence a self-concept of self-monitors to a greater extent, as they would be more likely to generate supporting thoughts which would mediate this effect. Findings generally supported the end effect of the hypothesis, but not the mediating process with high <b>self-monitors</b> <b>reported</b> a greater change in self-ratings after receiving a directional question. While low self-monitors were influenced more by thoughts that they retrieved in response to directional. The second study tested the assumptions of a proposed model of self-concept development that implicated self-monitoring as playing a central role. Self-monitoring correlated significantly and positively with similar magnitude with both communication and psychological measures.

Habit reversal (Azrin 2 ̆ 6 Nunn, 1973) has been effective in treating other habits (e. g., stuttering, tics, bruxism). In the present study, habit reversal was adapted for the treatment of bulimia. In response to newspaper advertisements, ten females (aged 21 - 26) with a minimum of two binges/week were included in the study. Bingeing and vomiting ranged from. 5 /day to 3. 57 /day during baseline; duration of the disorder ranged from one to eight years.

40|$|Self-monitoring is the {{centerpiece}} of behavioral weight loss intervention programs. This article presents a systematic review of the literature on three components of self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss studies: diet, exercise, and self-weighing. This review included articles that were published between 1993 and 2009 that reported on the relationship between weight loss and these self-monitoring strategies. Of the 22 studies identified, 15 focused on dietary self-monitoring, one on self-monitoring exercise, and six on self-weighing. A wide array of methods was used to perform self-monitoring; the paper diary was used most often. Adherence to <b>self-monitoring</b> was <b>reported</b> most frequently as the number of diaries completed or the frequency of log-ins or reported weights. The use of technology, which included the Internet, personal digital assistants, and electronic digital scales were reported in five studies. Descriptive designs were used in the earlier studies whereas more recent reports involved prospective studies and randomized trials that examined the effect of self-monitoring on weight loss. A significant association between self-monitoring and weight loss was consistently found; however, the level of evidence was weak because of methodologic limitations. The most significant limitations of the reviewed studies were the homogenous samples and reliance on self-report. In all but two studies, the samples were predominantly white and women. This review highlights the need for studies in more diverse populations, for objective measures of adherence to self-monitoring, and for studies that establish the required dose of self-monitoring for successful outcomes. © 2011 American Dietetic Association...|$|R

Patients in the intervention group received a wrist self-monitoring device and were educated to measure and document their BP daily {{during the study period}} (24 weeks). Patients in the control group received usual care. Three follow-up visits with the physician were scheduled for all patients (weeks 4, 12, and 24), and the investigator assessed adherence to medications after each visit (pill counting). The primary outcome (BP) was compared between groups using repeated-measure analysis of variance. RESULTS One hundred ninety patients completed the study.

40|$|Abstract—Detecting {{impending}} {{failure of}} hard disks {{is an important}} prediction task which might help computer systems to prevent loss of data and performance degradation. Currently most of the hard drive vendors support <b>self-monitoring,</b> analysis and <b>reporting</b> technology (SMART) which are often considered unreliable for such tasks.

In this paper, we consider events recorded from live disks and show {{that it is possible to}} construct decision support systems which can detect such failures. It is desired that any such prediction methodology should have high accuracy and ease of interpretability. Black box models can deliver highly accurate solutions but do not provide an understanding of events which explains the decision given by it. To this end we explore rule based classifiers for predicting hard disk failures from various disk events.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by evaluating it on disks that were returned to NetApp from the field. Our evaluation shows that our system can be tuned either to have a high failure detection rate (i. e., classify a bad disk as bad) or to have a low false alarm rate (i. e., not classify a good disk as bad). Further, our rule-based classifier generates rules that are intuitive and easy to understand, unlike black box techniques. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTasmania's forest {{practices}} system, one of {{the most}} prescriptive globally and the most comprehensive in Australia, has evolved over the last 25 years in response to public demands for high standards of governance, accountability and transparency of forest regulation on both public and private lands. The system was developed in the context of strong contestation, in Tasmanian and Australian civil society and politics, about appropriate forest policies and practices in Tasmania. The system is governed by a Forest Practices Act, which provides for a co-regulatory approach administered by an independent statutory body, the Forest Practices Authority. All forest operations must be undertaken in accordance with a certified forest practices plan, prepared and certified by accredited Forest Practices Officers employed by forest managers. These co-regulatory components of the system are supported by independent monitoring and enforcement by the Forest Practices Authority. This paper describes the genesis and evolution of the Tasmanian forest practices system, and summarises the range of measures employed to foster high levels of compliance, with an emphasis on training and education, <b>self-monitoring</b> and <b>reporting</b> by the industry, independent monitoring by the Forest Practices Authority, and corrective actions, backed by enforcement provisions. Compliance monitoring over 27 years demonstrates rapid improvement in the decade following establishment of the system, with consistently high levels of achievement subsequently. However, larger corporate forest managers consistently achieve higher rates of compliance than do small-scale forest owners, and redressing this imbalance has been a recurrent theme in Tasmania's forest practices system. Experience of implementation of Tasmania's forest practices system suggests that well-designed and implemented co-regulatory approaches, with high levels of transparency, can be effective in delivery of good technical standards of forest practices and high levels of compliance. However, these will not in themselves mitigate public concern about forest management practices unless the policies governing those practices have broad support in civil society...|$|R

Methods: Data from 798 individuals with type 1 diabetes participating in the FinnDiane Study were included. Self-reported questionnaires {{were used to assess}} FoH and self-management practices (e. g. dietary intake, insulin administration, physical activity). For glycaemic control, we used both the latest HbA 1 c measurements and the serial HbA 1 c measurements from the medical files. Factor analysis was used to reveal underlying constructs within the food frequency section of the diet questionnaire. Results: In all, 44 % and 63 % of men and women reported FoH, respectively. In men, FoH was associated with higher mean serial HbA 1 c levels, higher number of <b>reported</b> <b>self-monitoring</b> of blood glucose (SMBG), higher carbohydrate intake, and lower scores in the “high-fat” factor.

Boeing 787, Airbus 350, Bombardier C-Series), such as the fuselage, the wings and the fin. An interesting aspect on the technological {{point of view of}} sensing is that airplane manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing are looking at incorporating health-monitoring systems (such as optical fibre sensors, especially fibre Bragg gratings) that will allow the airplane to <b>self-monitor</b> and <b>report</b> maintenance requirements to ground-based computer systems. However, one has to realize that the mechanical behaviour of anisotropic FRPs is significantly different compared to conventional isotropic construction materials. In this dissertation, the author focuses on monitoring the strain and (permanent) deformation in carbon reinforced plastic laminates with embedded fibre Bragg gratings. The research is divided in two main parts. In {{the first part of this}} research, the existing fibre draw tower technology is utilized, to manufacture an improved version of the existing in-line high quality, draw tower fibre Bragg gratings (DTG®s). With respect to accurate measurements and structural integrity, the research focuses on reducing the total diameter of the optical fibre, so the incorporation in the reinforcement fibres is enhanced and the distortion in the composite is reduced. The author elaborates in detail the methods of strain and temperature calibrations and the different setups which are applied. Additionally, with respect to the high temperatures during the composite manufacturing process, the thermal stability of the DTG®s is studied at elevated temperatures (> 300 °C). In the second part, the author embeds the DTG®s in specific types of thermoset and thermoplastic carbon reinforced plastic laminates. The author applies the embedded DTG®s in several stages of the composite lifetime. Starting with the monitoring of the composite manufacturing process and ending with fatigue testing until failure of the composite laminates. During the different experiments, the sensors are subjected to high temperatures, high pressures, extreme longitudinal strains and transverse strains and in the mean time, they are employed to very accurately measure (multi-axial) strains inside composites at microstrain level (~ 10 6) ...|$|R
