2500|$|Fantômas began {{just before}} the {{collapse}} of Faith No More, {{as a series of}} spasmic, avant-garde metal/grindcore songs composed by vocalist and bandleader Mike Patton. Patton then sent the demos to guitarist Buzz Osborne (of Melvins), bass guitarist Trevor Dunn (of Mr. Bungle) and drummer Igor Cavalera (of Sepultura), with the intention of forming a supergroup. Cavalera declined the offer, but recommended who he thought would be perfect for the project: Dave Lombardo of Slayer, who accepted. The band have released all of their albums through Patton's independent label Ipecac, however there was initially interest from several prominent record labels, primarily due to Patton's commercial success with Faith No More. He recalled [...] "There was a whole lot of interest, at first. People from Geffen and <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> came out to the shows. But after the show, they disappeared into the woodwork. There were [...] indies that were interested, but none that I was interested in." ...|$|E
2500|$|After media {{outrage at}} the 1976 Look Out for Lefty strip about {{football}} hooliganism in the IPC comic Action, Gifford controversially drew parallels with the Wertham censorship of the US comics industry in the 1950s, remarking that [...] "Perhaps its time we had another outcry against products like Action. Action is {{a new kind of}} comic geared to the lowest form of behaviour in children. Just as pornography caters for a mass market for adults, <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> provides violence for a mass market of children. As far as the people who produce Action are concerned, the children are simply a market and moral considerations do not apply." [...] Despite 2000 AD (#1 published in 1977) producing iconic characters and innovative and critically acclaimed stortelling and art, Gifford had similar reservations about its violent content: [...] "Whether children would actually enjoy living in ... is another matter, for as depicted... the future is a world of unrelieved violence." [...] Gifford was clear that his preferences in comics writing and art were informed by his nostalgia for UK comics of the 1930s, reflecting that [...] "I look {{back to the days of}} my youth... when comics were things of joy and pleasure, rather than blood and guts." ...|$|E

60|$|Marston {{picked up}} the jar, which held a {{quantity}} of thick yellow grease. It was palm oil and its strong but rather pleasant smell awoke vivid memories. He saw the whitewashed factory shine beside the muddy river and a gang of naked negroes filling big barrels in a compound tunneled by land-crabs' holes. The compound glowed with light {{against a background of}} forest wrapped in unchanging gloom, from which the palm oil came. For all that, the oil was a well-known article of commerce. There was nothing mysterious about its production and Marston would have been satisfied had Wyndhams' confined its trade to <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Then he saw the broker was waiting.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{probable}} that remorse would have tortured him even further, had he not chanced to turn absently to page forty-six and read a poem entitled [...] "Love's Funeral." [...] It was not a long poem, and he had finished it inside of two minutes; {{but by that time}} a change had come upon his mood of self-loathing. He no longer felt like a particularly mean murderer. [...] "Love's Funeral" [...] was like a tonic. It braced and invigourated him. It was so unspeakably absurd, so poor in every respect. All things, he now perceived, had worked together for good. Ann had admitted on the boat that it was his satire that had crushed out of her the fondness for this sort of thing. If that was so, then the part he had played in her life had been that of a rescuer. He thought of her as she was now and as she must have been then to have written <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and he rejoiced at what he had done. In a manner of speaking the Ann of to-day, the glorious creature who went about the place kidnapping Ogdens, was his handiwork. It was he who had destroyed the minor poetry virus in her.|$|E
5000|$|... 2012 {{began with}} his aptly named EP Overture debuting in the New Zealand Top 40 at No. 29. During February two of Massad's singles [...] "Tear My Heart Out" [...] and [...] "Forget About Me" [...] were {{together}} in the IMNZ top 10 airplay. In March Massad was announced as one of 15 global finalists in the teen section of the prestigious ISC (International Songwriting Competition) and in August {{he was one of}} the guest artists on the Flight of the Conchords number 1 hit [...] "Feel Inside (and <b>Stuff</b> <b>Like</b> That)". <b>This</b> charity single became the fastest selling single in New Zealand history.|$|R
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Eyez on Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Robinson and primarily filmed in Hollywood, California between July 14, and 15 2002. [...] "The theme of the video is me just getting up, going about a normal day," [...] Monica said. [...] "I {{got a chance to}} just go shopping and <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that, but <b>this</b> scene is more of me dancing and having a good time, like the song says, in the club. So that's basically the whole theme of it. Just to have a good time." ...|$|R
30|$|One {{respondent}} said he avoids {{wearing black}} and looking gothic because his friends do not wear those styles, suggesting {{a fear of}} ostracism when wearing alternative clothing. In a similar vein, one respondent included that he “doesn’t want to lead people to believe he is dark.” A 23 -year-old Caucasian respondent, {{when asked if he}} avoided any styles of clothing, said: “Gothic stuff for sure, dark clothing or Hot Topic stuff. I don’t want to be associated with them and I hate the people that wear that <b>stuff,</b> <b>like</b> spiked belts.” <b>This</b> type of sentiment occurred almost exclusively among Caucasian respondents from middle- and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The fear of social scrutiny and ostracism, along with a general stigma regarding alternative and counter-culture, appears to be the most common motivation for avoiding alternative styles.|$|R

But none of us give our minds to <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> arter the glorious Christmas dinner that we'd quarried out of the Mary Auguster. Every man that wasn't on duty went below and turned in fur a snooze--all 'cept me, an' I didn't feel just {{altogether}} satisfied. To be sure, I'd had an A1 dinner, an', though a little mixed, I'd never eat a jollier one on any Christmas that I kin look back at. But, fur all that, there was a hanker inside o' me. I hadn't got all I'd laid out to git when we teched off the Mary Auguster. The day was blazin' hot, an' {{a lot of the things}} I'd eat was pretty peppery. `Now,' thinks I, `if there had been just one can o' peaches sech as I seen shinin' in the stars last night!' An' just then, as I was walkin' aft, all by myself, I seed lodged on the stump of the mizzenmast a box with one corner druv down among the splinters. It was half split open, an' I could see the tin cans shinin' through the crack. I give one jump at it, an' wrenched the side off. On the top of the first can I seed was a picture of a big white peach with green leaves. That box had been blowed up so high that if it had come down anywhere 'cept among them splinters it would 'a' smashed itself to flinders, or killed somebody. So fur as I know, it was the only thing that fell nigh us, an' by George, sir, I got it! When I had finished a can of 'em I hunted up Andy, an' then we went aft an' eat some more. `Well,' says Andy, as we was a-eatin', `how d'ye feel now about blowin' up your wife, an' your house, an' that little schooner you was goin' to own?' ...|$|E

500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that. <b>This</b> is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. Somebody told me I should listen to [...] This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that." ...|$|R

5000|$|Monotrona {{shows and}} music are {{notoriously}} difficult to categorize {{but have been}} described as “a perfect balance between silliness and creepiness, not to mention … the best thing to happen to the sputtering corpse of electro since asymmetrical haircuts.” [...] In a 1996 interview with local Portland ‘zine Snipehunt, Monotrona mused: “When you do <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> where you’re being kind of goofy anyway--if you don’t spread that goofiness, then you’ve failed.” [...] She was even voted “Scariest Musical Performer” in Portland in 1996.

It's like with The Beatles - they were trying to play the black music of the day, and by doing so, they sort of changed it, it became a different thing. We thought about... trying to get Timbaland in, or something. But we decided against it, because it's a fine line between filtering that music, or just trying to ape it by going to the source of it...
