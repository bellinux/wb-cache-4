50|$|Hirudin {{derivatives}} are all bivalent DTIs, they block {{both the}} active site and exosite 1 in an irreversible 1:1 stoichiometric complex. The active site is the binding {{site for the}} globular amino-terminal domain and exosite 1 is the binding site for the acidic carboxy-terminal domain of hirudin. Native hirudin, a 65-amino-acid polypeptide, is produced in the parapharyngeal glands of medicinal leeches. Hirudins today are produced by recombinant biotechnology using yeast. These recombinant hirudins lack a sulfate group at Tyr-63 and are therefore called desulfatohirudins. They have a 10-fold lower binding affinity to thrombin compared to native hirudin, but remain a highly specific inhibitor of thrombin and have an inhibition constant for thrombin in the picomolar range. Renal clearance and degradation account {{for the most part}} for the <b>systemic</b> <b>clearance</b> of desulfatohirudins and there is accumulation of the drug in patients with renal insufficiency. These drugs should not be used in patients with impaired renal function, since there is no specific antidote available to reverse the effects. Hirudins are given parenteraly, usually by intravenous injection. 80% of hirudin is distributed in the extravascular compartment and only 20% is found in the plasma. The most common desulfatohirudins today are lepirudin and desirudin.|$|E
50|$|In humans {{moclobemide}} {{is rapidly}} and almost completely absorbed and totally metabolised via the liver. Peak plasma levels occur 0.3 to 2 hours after oral administration. The bioavailability increases {{during the first}} week of therapy from 60% to 80% and more. The elimination half-life is around 2 hours. It is moderately bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin. However, the short disposition half life somewhat increases after repeated dosing; moclobemide has an intermediate elimination half life for <b>systemic</b> <b>clearance</b> and an intermediate volume of distribution. Despite its short half-life the pharmacodynamic action of a single dose persists for approximately 16 hours. The drug is almost completely metabolized in the liver; it is a substrate of CYP2C19 and an inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Less than 1 percent of the drug is excreted unchanged; 92 percent of the metabolised drug is excreted within the first 12 hours. The main metabolites are the N-oxide Ro 12-5637 formed via morpholine N-oxidation and lactam derivative Ro 12-8095 formed via morpholine C-oxidation; active metabolites are found only in trace amounts. The unchanged drug (less than 1%) as well as the metabolites are excreted renally (in urine). The main degradation pathway of moclobemide is oxidation. About 44 percent of the drug is lost due to the first pass effect through the liver. Age and renal function do not affect the pharmacokinetics of moclobemide. However, patients with significantly reduced liver function require dose reductions due to the significant slowing of metabolism of moclobemide. Food slows the absorption but does not affect the bioavailability of moclobemide.|$|E

Serial blood samples were collected for 96 h after initiation of the infusion and urine was collected for 2 h during the hydration period after cisplatin administration. Tissue samples from 10 organs were obtained at necropsy, 96 h after cisplatin infusion.

The method requires arterial blood sampling from a radial artery (arterial input function), and {{the aim of this}} study was to develop a method for extracting an image-derived, non-invasive input function from a volume of interest (VOI).|$|E
40|$|The {{tolerance}} and pharmacokinetics of cefmetazole were studied in healthy male volunteers {{who received a}} placebo (sterile saline) or a single dose of cefmetazole sodium intramuscularly. Drug-treated volunteers received one of four doses, 0. 375, 0. 750, 1, or 2 g. The drug was well tolerated, with no adverse medical events or laboratory changes observed during the study that could affect the pharmacokinetic interpretation of the data. Cefmetazole concentrations were determined by using a specific high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Serum cefmetazole concentrations were well described by a one-compartment open model with first-order absorption and elimination. Cefmetazole was rapidly absorbed in most volunteers, with a mean time to maximum concentration in serum of 1. 24 +/- 0. 12 h (+/- standard error of the mean), and the mean maximum concentration in serum increased from 17. 0 +/- 1. 6 to 74. 2 +/- 9. 5 micrograms/ml over the 0. 375 - to 2 -g dose range. Maximum concentrations in serum, areas under serum concentration-time curve, and urinary excretion of intact drug increased in proportion to cefmetazole sodium dose. Times at which maximum concentrations in serum occurred, apparent volumes of distribution, steady-state volumes of distribution, absorption and elimination half-lives, and <b>systemic</b> <b>clearances</b> did not change significantly (P greater than 0. 05) with drug dose. Although absorption and elimination half-lives {{were not significantly different}} in 10 of 40 volunteers (P greater than 0. 05), in a majority of subjects elimination half-lives were approximately 10 times longer than absorption half-lives. The mean recovery of intact drug in urine ranged from 68. 8 to 86. 0 % over the dose range studied, with a mean recovery over all doses of 77. 1 +/- 2. 4 %. Rental clearances were significantly lower (P < 0. 05) for the two lowest doses (93. 0 and 84. 3 versus 115. 0 and 118. 0 ml/min); these differences are not considered clinically important. The results {{of this study indicate that}} cefmetazole pharmacokinetics are linear after administration of single intramuscular doses ranging from 0. 375 to 2 g, that clinically relevant concentrations of cefmetazole in serum (1 to 2 micrograms/ml) persist in a majority of volunteers for more than 8 h after administration of 0. 750 -g or higher doses, and that clinically relevant concentrations of cefmetazole continue to be excreted in urine 8 to 12 h after administration of 0. 375 - to 2 -g doses...|$|R
40|$|A swine {{model was}} {{developed}} to study quantitatively the pharmacokinetics of hepatic extraction and clearance of doxorubicin (DOX). Systemic and hepatic artery infusions of DOX (0. 5 - 9 mg kg- 1) were administered to 34 pigs. Pharmacokinetic analysis was simplified by use of a double-balloon catheter in the inferior vena cava to collect hepatic venous effluent. During hepatic artery infusion only, DOX in hepatic venous blood was extracted using activated carbon filters to prevent drug recirculation. Hepatic extraction and clearance of DOX were independent of dose and route of administration. Extraction ratios varied from 0. 75 to 0. 91 during hepatic artery infusion and from 0. 50 to 0. 72 during <b>systemic</b> infusion. <b>Clearance</b> results were analogous. After cessation of drug infusions, hepatic extraction and clearance of DOX was negative, suggesting that the liver serves as a drug reservoir during DOX infusion and subsequently is a net source of unmetabolised drug. Liver extraction and clearance of DOX in pigs are substantial. During either systemic or hepatic artery infusion of DOX, the liver serves as a drug reservoir. Subsequent mobilisation of this hepatic pool of DOX may cause prolonged systemic exposure to drug...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of morphine}} and {{formation of the}} main metabolite, morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G) after single and intravenous doses of morphine were studied in six cancer patients and compared with the formation rate of M 3 G in vitro in microsomes isolated from liver biopsies obtained from the same patients at palliative laparotomy. The results showed that high formation rates of M 3 G in vitro in microsomes isolated from liver biopsies were associated both with high apparent oral clearance values and high M 3 G/morphine AUC (area under the concentration vs time curve) ratios as measured in vivo in the same patients. In accordance with previous results marked interindividual differences were seen in the kinetics of morphine; the oral bioavailability varied between 30 and 69 % and the <b>systemic</b> plasma <b>clearance</b> between 18. 6 and 34. 0 ml min- 1 kg- 1. This variation correlated with the variation in morphine metabolism as assessed in vitro. In vivo, a high M 3 G/morphine AUC ratio predicted a high oral clearance. Hepatic UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity is thus an important determinant of the in vivo kinetics of orally administered morphine...|$|R
