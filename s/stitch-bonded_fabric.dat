5000|$|Extended Stitch-Bonding process (or the {{extended}} warp-knitting process): the compound needle that pierces the piles is shifted laterally {{according to the}} yarn guides. [...] This then {{makes it possible for}} the layers of the <b>stitch-bonded</b> <b>fabric</b> to be arranged freely and be made symmetrical in one working step. [...] This process is advantageous to the characteristics of the composite as the “residual stresses resulting from asymmetric alignment of the layers are avoided, while the tensile strength and the impact strength of the composite are improved”.|$|E
40|$|The {{compression}} of typical glass fibre woven fabrics, namely plain, twill, satin, and noncrimped <b>stitch-bonded</b> <b>fabric,</b> was studied experimentally by performing {{a series of}} mechanical tests on dry and resin impregnated assemblies of fabrics. This was followed by microstructural studies of corresponding laminates cured under different degrees of compression. The experiments included investigations {{on the effects of}} applied pressure, speed of compression, fabric orientation, number of plies and different resin systems on fibre volume fraction,Vf, of the compressed assembly. It was found that the {{compression of}} dry fabrics followed a power-law relationship between pressure and Vf where the power law index, b, was determined to be approximately equal to 10. 3, 9. 8 and 9. 1 for assemblies consisting of plain, twill and 5 harness satin weaves, respectively. A mathematical analysis was performed for the viscoelastic compression of resin impregnated assemblies of fabrics and a model was developed incorporating the deformation of the fibre network and resin flow through the reinforcement. A methodology was devised for the geometrical representation of plain weaves in the microstructural analysis of cured laminates. The microstructural studies then provided data for the area and geometrical parameters of the yam cross-section; the mean amplitude, wavelength and phase angle of the yarn waveform and the distance between plies at different compression pressures. Cross-sections of laminates with each of the considered fabrics were compared in terms of fibre area fractions, porosity and void content, for the different compression pressures. The aim for the microstructural analysis was to elucidate the mechanism of compression and to follow the development of fibre and pore structure under different degrees of compression. It was concluded that the compression of resin impregnated woven fabrics could be considered as a combination of four modes of deformation; (a) the elimination of a resin rich interlayer between adjacent layers of fabric; (b) the nesting of layers of fabric by slipping while under compression; (c) the deformation of the yam waveform which results in the reduction of thickness of individual plies and (d) the compression and deformation of the cross-sections of individual yarns...|$|E
5000|$|Stitch-Bonding is {{a special}} form of warp {{knitting}} [...] and is commonly used {{for the production of}} composite materials and technical textiles. As a method of production, stitch-bonding is efficient, {{and is one of the}} most modern ways to create reinforced textiles and composite materials [...] for industrial use. The advantages of the stitch-bonding process includes its high productivity rate and the scope it offers for functional design of textiles, such as fiber-reinforced plastics. [...] Stitch-bonding involves layers of threads and fabric being joined together with a knitting thread, which creates a layered structure called a multi-ply. [...] This is created through a warp-knitting thread system, which is fixed on the reverse side of the fabric with a sinker loop, and a weft thread layer. [...] A needle with the warp thread passes through the material, which requires the warp and knitting threads to be moving both parallel and perpendicular to the vertical/warp direction of the stitch-bonding machine. [...] <b>Stitch-bonded</b> <b>fabrics</b> are currently being used in such fields as wind energy generation and aviation. [...] Research is currently being conducted into the usage and benefits of <b>stitch-bonded</b> <b>fabrics</b> as a way to reinforce concrete. Fabrics produced with this process offer the potential of using “sensitive fiber materials such as glass and carbon with only little damage, non-crimp fiber orientation and variable distance between threads”.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{basic methods}} of impregnating porous bodies with solutions of polymers {{and their use}} to manufacture prepregs. It also describes the existing methods of manufacturing multilayer prepregs to produce aerospace coating of the spacecraft "Soyuz". It is shown that these prepregs have to meet high requirements for {{the content of the}} polymer, as compared with other composite materials, about 35 - 40 % of the mass. Methods used for their manufacturing are long-term and non-controllable. The assumption is made that using the vacuum impregnation technology of a woven material will allow to accelerate the manufacturing process of these prepregs and improve their quality. In reviewing the technical literature have been found works on modeling the processes of impregnation, but they are aimed only at studying the speed of the woven material impregnation by various fluids and determining the time of impregnation. There were no models found to define prepreg parameters during the process of multiple impregnations. The aim of this work is to develop the simple mathematical model, which enables us to predict the polymer content of volatile products in the prepreg after each cycle of multiple impregnation of woven material with a solution of the polymer. To consider the vacuum impregnation method are used the prepregs based on silica and silica-nylon <b>stitch-bonding</b> <b>fabric</b> and bakelite varnish LBS- 4 containing 50 - 60 % of phenol resin and the solvent with minor impurities of pure phenol and water, as an example. To describe the process of vacuum impregnation of the porous work-piece is developed a mathematical description of the process of filling the porous space of the material with a varnish. It is assumed that the varnish components fill the porous space of the material in the same proportion as they are contained in the varnish. It is shown that a single impregnation cannot ensure the content of phenol resin in the prepreg over 32 %, which does not meet requirements. The paper presents a developed mathematical model of repeated impregnation of silica fabrics by bakelite varnish with intermediate drying of the workpiece. Equations determining the amount of the polymer and the volatile products after each impregnation-drying cycle are derived. Results of calculations obtained by the mathematical model are given. The calculation results show that the multiple impregnations allow us to increase the polymer content in the prepreg and provide required parameters for a few cycles of impregnation. In the calculations were also considered various drying options with removal of different amounts of solvent. The calculations have shown that providing the specified parameters is possible if more than 50 % of solvent contained in the prepreg after impregnation is removed. The mathematical model is part of a patented vacuum manufacturing technology of prepregs and allows us to define the parameters of the prepreg according to the content of the polymer and the volatile products at each stage of the multiple impregnation process of the porous material. </p...|$|R
