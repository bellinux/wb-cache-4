5|$|Morshead was commemorated {{in several}} ways. Morshead Drive, which runs past the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra {{is named after}} him. In the Canberra suburb of Lyneham is the Morshead War Veterans Home, with high-dependency care and {{associated}} <b>self-care</b> two-bedroom houses. His portrait by Ivor Hele is held by the Australian War Memorial, as are his wartime papers.|$|E
5|$|Relationships {{change as}} {{partners}} {{take on new}} roles, {{such as that of}} caregiver, which may conflict with the role of partner and require substantial sacrifice of time and <b>self-care.</b> These changes in responsibilities may mean a reverse in societally determined gender roles within relationships; inability to fulfil these roles affects sexuality in general.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide is the leading cause of death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when <b>self-care</b> is neglected.|$|E
5|$|Early {{speech or}} {{behavioral}} interventions can help {{children with autism}} gain <b>self-care,</b> social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor <b>self-care</b> or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
25|$|For many {{children}} with CP, parents are {{heavily involved in}} <b>self-care</b> activities. <b>Self-care</b> activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, can be difficult for children with CP as <b>self-care</b> depends primarily on use of the upper limbs. For those living with CP, impaired upper limb function affects almost 50% of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation. As the hands are used for many <b>self-care</b> tasks, sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily <b>self-care</b> more difficult. Motor impairments cause more problems than sensory impairments. The most common impairment is that of finger dexterity, which {{is the ability to}} manipulate small objects with the fingers. Compared to other disabilities, people with cerebral palsy generally need more help in performing daily tasks.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in <b>self-care</b> can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with <b>self-care</b> tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform <b>self-care</b> may allow them to see the benefit in performing <b>self-care</b> independently. If the older adult is able to complete <b>self-care</b> activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E

25|$|Practitioners must {{consider}} an individual patient's health, {{their risk of}} hypoglycemia, and their specific health risks when setting a target HbA1c level. Because patients are responsible for averting or responding to their own hypoglycemic episodes, the patient's input and the doctor's assessment of the patient's <b>self-care</b> skills are also important.|$|E
25|$|There is from {{cross-sectional}} {{research that}} suggests {{the benefits of}} emotional processing for patients with diabetes. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, higher emotional processing was associated with greater diabetes-related knowledge, medication adherence and relevant <b>self-care</b> behaviors such as diet, physical activity and blood glucose monitoring. Similarly, in adolescent patients with Type 1 diabetes, emotional processing was revealed {{to be associated with}} better metabolic control.|$|E
25|$|Prieto et al also {{emphasised}} {{the influence}} that ethnic and cultural factors can have on adherence. They pointed out that groups differ in their attitudes, values and beliefs about health and illness. This view could affect adherence, particularly with preventive treatments and medication for asymptomatic conditions. Additionally, some cultures fatalistically attribute their good or poor health to their god(s), and attach less importance to <b>self-care</b> than others.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for Becker muscular {{dystrophy}} yet. Treatment {{is aimed at}} control of symptoms to maximize {{the quality of life}} which can be measured by specific questionnaires. Activity is encouraged. Inactivity (such as bed rest) or sitting down for too long can worsen the muscle disease. Physical therapy may be helpful to maintain muscle strength. Orthopedic appliances such as braces and wheelchairs may improve mobility and <b>self-care.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{consequent}} {{reports from}} China on some recovered SARS patients showed severe long-time sequelae exist. The most typical diseases include, among other things, pulmonary fibrosis, osteoporosis, and femoral necrosis, which {{have led to}} the complete loss of working ability or even <b>self-care</b> ability of these cases. As a result of quarantine procedures, some of the post-SARS patients have been documented suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with right}} {{hemisphere}} brain damage often display sensory deficits such as left neglect, {{in which they}} ignore everything in the left visual field. This neglect can be present throughout many daily activities including reading, writing and <b>self-care</b> activities. For example, individuals with left neglect typically leave out details on the neglected side of drawings or try to draw out all the details on the nonneglected side. Homonymous hemianopsia is another sensory deficit that is sometimes observed in this population.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} {{her medical}} training, Jemison joined {{the staff of}} the Peace Corps and served as a Peace Corps Medical Officer from 1983 to 1985 responsible for the health of Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Jemison's work in the Peace Corps included supervising the pharmacy, laboratory, medical staff as well as providing medical care, writing <b>self-care</b> manuals, and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues. Jemison also worked with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) helping with research for various vaccines.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{procedures}} {{are used by}} chiropractors for treating the spine, other joints and tissues, and general health issues. The following procedures were received by {{more than one-third of}} patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey: Diversified technique (full-spine manipulation; mentioned in previous paragraph), physical fitness/exercise promotion, corrective or therapeutic exercise, ergonomic/postural advice, <b>self-care</b> strategies, activities of daily living, changing risky/unhealthy behaviors, nutritional/dietary recommendations, relaxation/stress reduction recommendations, ice pack/cryotherapy, extremity adjusting (also mentioned in previous paragraph), trigger point therapy, and disease prevention/early screening advice.|$|E
25|$|Qigong is {{generally}} viewed as safe. No adverse effects {{have been observed}} in clinical trials, such that qigong is considered safe for use across diverse populations. Cost for <b>self-care</b> is minimal, and cost efficiencies are high for group delivered care. Typically the cautions associated with qigong {{are the same as}} those associated with any physical activity, including risk of muscle strains or sprains, advisability of stretching to prevent injury, general safety for use alongside conventional medical treatments, and consulting with a physician when combining with conventional treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{defiance}} of the common complaint that anti-cure advocates' ability to articulate complex opinions in writing—which some critics see as being impossible for autistic people—autistic adults such as Amanda Baggs use their own writing and videos to demonstrate {{that it is possible}} for severely disabled autistics to be autism rights advocates. She says that when the critics assume that intelligent and articulate autistic people do not have difficulties like self-injurious behavior and difficulty with <b>self-care,</b> they affect the opinions of policy makers and {{make it more difficult for}} intelligent and articulate autistic people to get services. Baggs cites an example of an autistic person who was denied services when it was discovered that she could type.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{treatments}} are directed towards alleviating symptoms, not the disease itself. Many patients with hereditary or idiopathic forms of ataxia have other symptoms {{in addition to}} ataxia. Medications or other therapies might be appropriate {{for some of these}} symptoms, which could include tremor, stiffness, depression, spasticity, and sleep disorders, among others. Both onset of initial symptoms and duration of disease are variable. If the disease is caused by a polyglutamine trinucleotide repeat CAG expansion, a longer expansion may lead to an earlier onset and a more radical progression of clinical symptoms. Typically, a person afflicted with this disease will eventually be unable to perform daily tasks (ADLs). However, rehabilitation therapists can help patients to maximize their ability of <b>self-care</b> and delay deterioration to certain extent. Researchers are exploring multiple avenues for a cure including RNAi and the use of Stem Cells and several other avenues.|$|E
25|$|While {{a health}} care {{provider}} visit with a patient may result in the patient leaving with a prescription for medication, not all patients will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. In the U.S., 20-30% of prescriptions are never filled at the pharmacy. There are many reasons patients do not fill prescriptions including {{the cost of the}} medication, doubting the need for medication, or preference for <b>self-care</b> measures other than medication. Cost may be a barrier to prescription drug adherence, but convenience, side effects and lack of demonstrated benefit are also significant factors to a complex situation. A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20-30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions. However, analysis by health insurers suggest that patient co-payment requirements can be reduced to $0 with little or no improvement in long-term adherence rates.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{interventions}} have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that {{some form of}} treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Concerns about outcome measures, such as their inconsistent use, most greatly affect how the results of scientific studies are interpreted. A 2009 Minnesota study found that parents follow behavioral treatment recommendations significantly less often than they follow medical recommendations, and that they adhere more often to reinforcement than to punishment recommendations. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire <b>self-care,</b> social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.|$|E
25|$|Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, {{abdominal}} cramps, and constipation {{are common}} side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells. Malnutrition and dehydration can result {{when the patient}} does not eat or drink enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage. This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much {{in an effort to}} allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs. <b>Self-care</b> measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or ginger tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment. However, a high index of suspicion is appropriate, since diarrhea and bloating are also symptoms of typhlitis, a very serious and potentially life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{interventions}} have some methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that {{some form of}} treatment is preferable to no treatment, the systematic reviews have reported that the quality of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children with ASD acquire <b>self-care,</b> social, and job skills, and often can improve functioning, and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. Educational interventions have some effectiveness in children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children, and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. The limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.|$|E
25|$|Participation is {{involvement}} in life situations and everyday activities. Participation includes {{the domains of}} <b>self-care,</b> productivity and leisure. In fact, communication, mobility, education, home life, leisure and social relationships require participation and are indicators {{of the extent to}} which a child functions in his or her environment. Barriers can exist on three levels: micro, meso and macro. First, the barriers at the micro level involve the person. Barriers at the micro level include the child's physical limitations (motor, sensory and cognitive impairments) or their subjective feelings regarding their ability to participate. For example, the child may not participate in group activities due to lack of confidence. Second, barriers at the meso level include the family and community. These may include negative attitudes of people toward disability or lack of support within the family or in the community. One of the main reasons for this limited support appears to be the result of a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the child's ability to engage in activities despite his or her disability. Third, barriers at the macro level incorporate the systems and policies that are not in place or hinder children with CP. These may be environmental barriers to participation such as architectural barriers, lack of relevant assistive technology and transportation difficulties due to limited wheelchair access or public transit that can accommodate children with CP. For example, a building without an elevator will prevent the child from accessing higher floors.|$|E
25|$|Many authors {{note the}} most obvious {{difference}} between the curricula of DO and MD schools is osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), a form of hands-on care used to diagnose, treat and prevent illness or injury and is taught only at DO schools. As of 2006, the average osteopathic student spent almost 8 weeks on clerkships for OMM during their third and fourth years. The National Institute of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states that overall, {{studies have shown that}} spinal manipulation can provide mild-to-moderate relief from low-back pain and appears to be as effective as conventional medical treatments. In 2007 guidelines, the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society include spinal manipulation as one of several treatment options for practitioners to consider using when pain does not improve with <b>self-care.</b> Spinal manipulation is generally a safe treatment for low-back pain. Serious complications are very rare. A 2001 survey of DOs found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) on less than 5% of their patients. The survey was the latest indication that DOs have become more like MD physicians in all respects: fewer perform OMT, more prescribe drugs, and many perform surgery as a first option. One area which has been implicated, but not been formally studied regarding the decline in OMT usage among DOs in practice, is the role of reimbursement changes. Only {{in the last several years}} could a DO charge for both an office visit (Evaluation & Management services) and use a procedure (CPT) code when performing OMT; previously, it was bundled.|$|E
500|$|While other {{treatments}} for croup have been studied, none have sufficient {{evidence to support}} their use. Inhalation of hot steam or humidified air is a traditional <b>self-care</b> treatment, but clinical studies have failed to show effectiveness and currently it is rarely used. The use of cough medicines, which usually contain dextromethorphan or guaifenesin, are also discouraged. While breathing heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to decrease the work of breathing {{has been used in}} the past, there is very little evidence to support its use. [...] Since croup is usually a viral disease, antibiotics are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected. In cases of possible secondary bacterial infection, the antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended. In severe cases associated with influenzaA or B, the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors may be administered.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "The Life" [...] is an uptempo {{song that}} stylistically {{incorporates}} electronic dance music in its production with notable elements from tropical house and Eurodance. Its instrumentation is composed with heavy synths, bassline and distorted vocals in the hook. Lyrically, {{the song is}} a celebration of self-love and lifestyle, with Peter Meister from Sputnikmusic commenting that lyrics like [...] "we {{the best in the}} biz/breakin' off betting chips" [...] "signify their progression as they recognize their status in music as well as the next phase in their career that they're embarking on." [...] The theme of the song is expressed in lines such as [...] "Give it up for the kids / eating good, getting lit / living life, feeling rich," [...] where they [...] "toast to <b>self-care</b> and preach the importance of living stress-free" [...] as noted by Madeline Roth from MTV. The track features a [...] "spunky mid-tempo number’s chorus" [...] with [...] "auto-tuned vocals".|$|E
500|$|Walker {{also took}} an {{interest}} in demographics later in his career, particularly towards the issues of immigration and birth rates. He published The Growth of the United States in 1882 and Restriction on Immigration in 1896 arguing for increasing restrictions out of concern about the diminished industrial and intellectual capacity of the most recent wave of immigrants. Walker also argued that unrestricted immigration was the major reason behind nineteenth-century Native American fertility decline, but while the argument was politically popular and became widely accepted in mobilizing restrictions on immigration, it rested upon a surprisingly facile statistical analysis that was later refuted. Writing on immigrants from southern Italy, Hungary, Austria, and Russia in The Atlantic, Walker claimed, [...] "The entrance into our political, social, and industrial life of such vast masses of peasantry, degraded below our utmost conceptions, is a matter which no intelligent patriot can look upon without the gravest apprehension and alarm. These people have no history behind them which is of a nature to give encouragement. They have none of the inherited instincts and tendencies which made it comparatively easy to deal with the immigration of the olden time. They are beaten men from beaten races; representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence. Centuries are against them, as centuries were on the side of those who formerly came to us. They have none of the ideas and aptitudes which fit men to take up readily and easily the problem of <b>self-care</b> and self-government, such as belong to those who are descended from the tribes that met under the oak-trees of old Germany to make laws and choose chieftains." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elbow {{extension}} is {{an important}} part of upper limb surgical reconstruction in patients with tetraplegia. [...] Although gravity can extend the arm, active elbow extension is needed to maintain a stable arm while extended in space. This is needed to reach for something or replace an object. Other functional gains include: increasing available workspace, performing pressure relief maneuvers, propelling a manual wheelchair, enhancing <b>self-care</b> and leisure activities, and promoting independent transfer. Elbow extension against gravity further enhances these activities above the shoulder level and reachable workspace.|$|E
2500|$|Occupational therapy assists the {{individual}} with MD {{to engage in}} {{activities of daily living}} (such as self-feeding and <b>self-care</b> activities) and leisure activities at the most independent level possible. This may be achieved with use of adaptive equipment or the use of energy-conservation techniques. [...] Occupational therapy may implement changes to a person's environment, both at home or work, to increase {{the individual}}'s function and accessibility; furthermore, it addresses psychosocial changes and cognitive decline which may accompany MD, and provides support and education about the disease to the family and individual.|$|E
