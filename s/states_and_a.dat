5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United <b>States,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E

5|$|Fat Freddy's Drop {{returned}} to touring New Zealand, Australia and Europe {{to promote the}} new album in 2009. Three shows {{on the west coast}} of the United <b>States,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> show in Canada, were also included in the tour. The only previous time the band had played in the United States was a single performance at the Detroit Electronic Music festival in 2004. Before 2009, the cost of touring in the US, difficulty obtaining visas, and the band's low profile in North America prevented them from including tour dates there. Band members say they now consider playing together as Fat Freddy's Drop their first musical priority, and spend less time playing with other bands.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to stave off the}} Civil War, Dixon participated in a {{convention}} of border <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> peace convention in Frankfort, Kentucky, both in 1861. Both conventions were unsuccessful. At the outset of the war, the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend a course of action for the Commonwealth. Dixon represented the pro-Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas. Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers. The arbiters met on May 11, 1861. After the pro-Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention, the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality, which the General Assembly adopted.|$|E
