40|$|Most Brazilian sugar/alcohol {{industries}} are energy self-sufficient and, in the State of São Paulo, {{some of them}} even export <b>electricity</b> <b>surplus</b> to local utilities. However, despite the huge potential of <b>electricity</b> <b>surplus</b> to be generated, there are still difficulties to be solved. One of these main problems is the sale’s price of electricity. Despite the advantages of sugarcane origin electricity both for electric sector and alcohol industries, they do not agree about the sale’s price and most {{industries are}} not interested on selling electricity, considering too low the price offered by local utilities. This paper evaluates {{the cost of the}} <b>electricity</b> <b>surplus</b> for real plants, using thermoeconomic analysis. Different cogeneration systems are considered and the corresponding electricity costs are evaluated, being compared to the current electricity marginal cost of Southeast Brazil.

According to the official sources, against demand of 40,793 million units during the nine months since April 2010, Gujarat produced 43,848 million units. Gujarat sold surplus power to 12 states: Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal.|$|E
25|$|Iceland already {{converts}} its <b>surplus</b> <b>electricity</b> into exportable {{goods and}} hydrocarbon replacements. In 2002, it produced 2,000tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysis, {{primarily for the}} production of ammonia (NH3) for fertilizer. Ammonia is produced, transported, and used throughout the world, and 90% of the cost of ammonia is the cost of the energy to produce it. Iceland is also developing an aluminium-smelting industry. Aluminium costs are driven primarily by the cost of the electricity to run the smelters. Either of these industries could effectively export all of Iceland's potential geothermal electricity.|$|E

Methane produced through methanation can then be injected into the gas transmission system. Decided in 2015, the first industrial pilot of this type, JUPITER 1000, coordinated by GRTgaz, will be built at Fos-sur-Mer, with commissioning planned in 2018.|$|R
40|$|A typical {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} commodity surpluses is to store them for future sale; though electricity cannot yet be stored on a large scale, this storage strategy will become a natural choice for dealing with <b>electricity</b> <b>surpluses.</b> However, because <b>electricity</b> prices can be negative, there exists another potential strategy: To buy <b>electricity</b> <b>surpluses</b> at negative prices and dispose of them. While at first it may seem counterintuitive to derive profits from destroying electricity, {{it has never been}} established whether a storage strategy or a disposal strategy would be more valuable for a merchant who trades electricity in a market. We investigate this question by modeling the problem of managing an electricity storage facility facing prices that can be negative: By varying the efficiency of the storage facility, our model encompasses both the case when <b>electricity</b> <b>surpluses</b> are stored and the case when they are destroyed. We establish the optimal policy structure of our system, showing that it differs significantly from the known optimal policy structure of commodity storage when prices are positive. Using our optimal policy, we compare storage and disposal strategies based on an existing electricity price model calibrated to historical electricity prices. Our experiments suggest that the disposal strategy can be even more valuable for an electricity merchant than the storage strategy.

25|$|In March 2017 the {{research}} project StEnSea (Storing Energy at Sea) announced their {{successful completion of}} a four-week test of a pumped storage underwater reservoir. In this configuration a hollow sphere submerged in deep water acts as the lower reservoir while the upper reservoir is the enclosing body of water. When a reversible turbine integrated into the sphere uses <b>surplus</b> <b>electricity</b> to pump {{water out of the}} sphere the force of the pump must act on the entire column of water above the sphere, so the deeper the sphere is located, the more potential energy it can store and convert back to electricity by letting water back in via the turbine.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{increasing}} demand for electricity {{and concerned about}} the low reserve situation, the government of Israel began taking steps to increase the supply of electricity and operating reserve, as well to reduce the monopoly position of the IEC and increase competition in the electricity market starting in {{second half of the}} 2000s decade. It instructed the IEC to construct several new power stations and encouraged private investment in the generation sector. By 2015, the IEC's share of total nationwide installed electric generation capacity had fallen to about 75%, with the company then possessing an installed generation capacity of about 13.6 gigawatts (GW). Since 2010, Independent Power Producers have constructed three new gas-fired combined cycle power stations with a total generation capacity of about 2.2 GW, while various industrial concerns constructed on-premises cogeneration facilities with a total electricity output of about 1 GW, and which are licensed by the electric authority to sell <b>surplus</b> <b>electricity</b> to the national grid at competitive rates.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} design energy {{resilient}} communities against disaster-driven blackout risks, this paper propose {{a new system}} to share photovoltaic (PV) generated green electricity using V 2 G technology, which we call vehicle to community (V 2 C) system. In this system, electricity generated from widely introduced solar photovoltaic panels (PVs) is stored in the “cars not in use” in a city. In Japan, {{almost half of the}} cars in the central Tokyo metropolitan area are used only on weekends and thus are kept parked during weekdays. These cars represent a huge new potential storage depot if they were replaced by electric vehicles (EVs), that is, they could be used as storage batteries in a V 2 G system to attain carbon neutral energy self-sufficient community. The results of our study showed that although the entire <b>electricity</b> <b>surplus</b> (PV supply minus demand) could be stored without waste if 12 % of the EVs not in use were utilized as storage batteries at an aggregate (city) level in August (with maximum solar irradiance), there exist significant regional mismatches at the local district level.

2500|$|The {{fortunes}} of the industry declined during World War I and particularly into the early 1920s. Many interurbans had been hastily constructed without realistic projections of income and expenses. They were initially financed by issuing stock and selling bonds. The sale of these financial instruments was often local with salesmen going door to door aggressively pushing this new and exciting [...] "it can't fail" [...] form of transportation. But many of those interurbans did fail, and often quickly. They had poor cash flow from the outset, higher expenses than expected, and struggled to raise essential further capital from a wary financial community. Interurbans were very vulnerable to acts of nature damaging track and bridges, particularly in the Midwestern United States where flooding was common. Receivership was a common fate when the interurban company couldn't pay its payroll and other debts, so state courts took over and allowed continued but temporary operation while suspending the company's obligation to pay its bond interest. With the interest payments suspended, the company had enough cash flow to meet its other cash obligations, but it was expected by the court that Receivership would eventually end and the company would resume its interest payments. Otherwise the company {{would be forced to}} quit, and many did. In addition, the interurban honeymoon period with the municipalities of 1895–1910 was over. The large and heavy interurbans, some weighing as much as 60 tons riding on track designed for lighter street cars, caused damage to city streets which led to disputes and lawsuits over who should bear repair costs. The rise of automobile traffic in the middle 1920s aggravated those trends. As the interurban companies struggled financially, they faced increasing competition from cars and trucks on newly paved streets and highways, and many municipalities sought to remove interurbans from city streets. [...] Some companies exited the passenger business altogether to focus on freight, while others sought to buttress their finances by selling <b>surplus</b> <b>electricity</b> to local communities. Several which attempted to exit the rail business altogether ran afoul of state commissions which required that interurban trains remain running [...] "for the public good," [...] even at a loss, such as the Indiana Railroad's forced passenger operation from Indianapolis to Seymour in 1939.|$|E
