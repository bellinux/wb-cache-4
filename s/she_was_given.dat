5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for thicker armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> more freeboard by the addition of an unarmoured structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and thicker armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker armour and a steel hull.|$|E
