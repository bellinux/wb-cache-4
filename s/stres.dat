5|$|The {{strength}} of the Albanian resistance {{was supposed to be}} fierce, but Alfonso wanted to see the League become powerful enough to seriously challenge the Ottoman Empire, much unlike the Venetians who were troubled by the growing Albanian state. In May, Alfonso sent two experienced Catalan officers with 200 men and plenty of supplies to Krujë and, on 7 June 1451, he established an alliance with George Arianiti, the most powerful League member from southern Albania. Later that same year, Alfonso created similar alliances with John Musachi, George <b>Stres</b> Balsha, Muzaka Thopia, Peter Himariot, and Simon Zenevishi, all important Albanian nobles allied to Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg was pleased with Alfonso, but dissension in the League over political issues was still present. Paul Dukagjini and Peter Spani remained aligned with Venice and established friendly relations with the Sultan.|$|E
5|$|By October 1460, Ferdinand {{was able}} to {{recapture}} his western territories from Capua to Beneventum. In his eastern frontier, however, his enemies remained at large. The most dangerous among them was Piccinino. Piccinino had undertaken the task of blocking papal and Neapolitan troops en route to Apulia. Since Roberto Orsini, the man left {{in charge of the}} east and Giovanni Orsini's brother who had remained loyal to Ferdinand, was deemed incompetent, Ferdinand invited Constantine to Naples, offering him a leading role in an operation against Piccinino. Along with Constantine's cavalry, Francesco del Balzo, the Duke of Andria who had remained loyal to Ferdinand, managed to defeat Ercole d'Este in Gargano. They then had control over the custom-duties gathered there which brought 30,000 ducats annually from which most of Piccinino's pay came. The fighting continued for three months after which Constantine and Ferdinand were able to regain some lost territory. Piccinino prepared his own counteroffensive, along with Giovanni Orsini's men, laying siege to the main castles. A fierce battle soon erupted over Venosa on 28 May 1461 where the Albanian cavalry took part. Ferdinand abandoned the city and fled back to Apulia. Near Troia, he met Skanderbeg's ambassador, Gjokë <b>Stres</b> Balsha, who informed him that Skanderbeg was ready to land in Italy as soon as the proper galleys were provided.|$|E
500|$|George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, {{the son of}} the {{powerful}} prince John Kastrioti, had been a vassal of the Ottoman Empire as a sipahi, or cavalry commander. After his participation in the Ottoman loss at the Battle of Niš, Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army and rushed to Albania alongside 300 other Albanians. By forging a letter from Murad II to the Governor of Krujë, he became lord of the city in November 1443. Hungarian captain John Hunyadi's continued operations against Sultan Murad II gave Skanderbeg time to prepare an alliance of the Albanian nobles. Skanderbeg invited all of Albania's nobles to meet in the Venetian-held town of Alessio (Lezhë) on 2 March 1444. Alessio was chosen as the meeting point because the town had once been the capital of the Dukagjini family and to induce Venice to lend aid to the Albanian movement. Among the nobles that attended were George Arianiti, Paul Dukagjini, Andrea Thopia, Lekë Dushmani, Teodor Korona, Peter Spani, Lekë Zaharia, and Paul <b>Stres</b> Balsha. Here they formed the League of Lezhë, a confederation of all of the major Albanian princes in alliance against the Ottoman Empire. The chosen captain (...) of this confederation was Skanderbeg. The League's first military challenge came in the spring of 1444, when Skanderbeg's scouts reported that the Ottoman army was planning to invade Albania. Skanderbeg planned to move towards the anticipated entry point and prepared for an engagement.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{functional}} {{significance of these}} STRE-, GCRE- and YRE-like elements in C. albicans, a basal promoter construct, based on the C. albicans ADH 1 promoter, was constructed.   The Renilla reniformis luciferase gene (RLUC) was utilised as the reporter of choice in C albicans.   Copies of each type of enhancer element were then introduced upstream of the basal ADH 1 b-RLUC fusion.   Transcriptional activation by GCRE, <b>STRE</b> and two YRE was then studied under morphogenetic inducing conditions (serum and pH-inducing), {{and a range of}} stress conditions including temperature, amino acid starvation, glucose limitation, and exposure of H 2 O 2, ethanol and heavy metal stresses.   The functionality of each element was further tested in C. albans mutants lacking the corresponding transcription factor. The GCRE, <b>STRE,</b> YRE 1 and YRE 2 elements did not activate transcription in response to morphogenesis induced by serum or Lee’s media.   The GCRE was shown to activate transcription in response to amino acid starvation in a Gcn 4 dependent and Efg 1 independent manner.   Surprisingly the well-characterised <b>STRE</b> mediated general stress response of S. cerevisiae {{did not appear to be}} conserved in C. albicans.   The <b>STRE</b> element did not appear to be functional as a stress responsive element in C. albicans under the range of stress conditions tested.   However, Nrg 1, a represser of morphogenesis in C. albicans was shown to act through a STRE-related element, the NRE element (MVCCCT).   The hypha-specific gene ALS 8 contains two Nrg 1 -responsive NREs (Murad et al. 2001).   The fact that the core sequence of the NRE element is closely related to the <b>STRE</b> element raises the possibility of an evolutionary change of function for the <b>STRE</b> sequence in C. albicans.   The functionality of the YRE 1 element appears to have been conserved in C. albicans.   As in S. cerevisiae, YRE 1 mediates transcriptional responses to oxidative and heavy metal stresses in a Cap 1 -dependent manner.

40|$|Glutaredoxins {{are small}} {{heat-stable}} proteins that are active as glutathione-dependent oxidoreductases and are encoded by two genes, designated GRX 1 and GRX 2, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We report {{here that the}} expression of both genes is induced in response to various stress conditions including oxidative, osmotic, and heat stress {{and in response to}} stationary phase growth and growth on non-fermentable carbon sources. Furthermore, both genes are activated by the high-osmolarity glycerol pathway and negatively regulated by the Ras-protein kinase A pathway via stress-responsive <b>STRE</b> elements. GRX 1 contains a single <b>STRE</b> element and is induced to significantly higher levels compared to GRX 2 following heat and osmotic shock. GRX 2 contains two <b>STRE</b> elements, and is rapidly induced in response to reactive oxygen species and upon entry into stationary phase growth. Thus, these data support the idea that the two glutaredoxin isoforms in yeast play distinct roles during normal cellular growth and in response to stress conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Tor and cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) {{signaling}} cascades respond to nutrients and regulate coordinately {{the expression of}} genes required for cell growth, including ribosomal protein (RP) and stress-responsive (<b>STRE)</b> genes. The inhibition of Tor signaling by rapamycin results in repression of the RP genes and induction of the <b>STRE</b> genes. Mutations that hyperactivate PKA signaling confer resistance to rapamycin and suppress the repression of RP genes imposed by rapamycin. By contrast, partial inactivation of PKA confers rapamycin hypersensitivity but only modestly affects RP gene expression. Complete inactivation of PKA impairs RP gene expression and concomitantly enhances <b>STRE</b> gene expression; remarkably, this altered transcriptional pattern is still sensitive to rapamycin and thus subject to Tor control. These findings illustrate how the Tor and cAMP-PKA signaling pathways respond to nutrient signals to govern gene expression required for cell growth via two parallel routes, and they have broad implication for our understanding of analogous regulatory networks in normal and neoplastic mammalian cells...|$|R

40|$|Transcription of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTT 1 gene {{encoding}} the cytosolic catalase T {{is activated}} {{by a variety}} of stress conditions: it is derepressed by nitrogen starvation and induced by heat shock. Furthermore, it is activated by osmotic and oxidative stress. This study shows that a CTT 1 upstream region previously found to be involved in nitrogen, cAMP and heat control (base pairs - 382 to - 325) contains a UAS element (<b>STRE,</b> - 368 to - 356), which is sufficient for the activation of a reporter gene by all types of stress acting on CTT 1. Gel retardation experiments demonstrated the existence of a factor specifically binding to <b>STRE,</b> but to a lesser extent to mutated elements having partly or entirely lost the ability to mediate stress control. Heat activation of <b>STRE,</b> but not of a canonical heat shock element, is enhanced by a ras 2 defect mutation, which enhances thermotolerance, and is dramatically reduced by a bcy 1 disruption mutation, which decreases thermotolerance. It can be hypothesized, therefore, that the novel stress control element is important for the establishment of induced stress tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an {{efficient and effective}} design of Robust Spatio-Temporal Prediction based on Student’s t distribution, namely, St-RSTP, to provide estimations based on observations over spatio-temporal neighbors. The proposed St-RSTP is more resilient to outliers or other small departures from model assumptions than its ancestor, the Spatio-Temporal Random Effects (<b>STRE)</b> model. <b>STRE</b> is a state-of-the-art statistical model with linear order complexity for large scale processing. However, it assumes Gaussian observations, which has the well-known limitation of non-robustness. In our St-RSTP design, the measurement error follows Student’s t distribution, instead of a traditional Gaussian distribution. This design reduces the influence of outliers, improves prediction quality, and keeps the problem analytically intractable. We propose a novel approximate inference approach, which approximates the model into the form that separates the high dimensional latent variables into groups, and then estimates the posterior distributions of different groups of variables separately {{in the framework of}} Expectation Propagation. As a good property, our approximate approach degeneralizes to the standard <b>STRE</b> based prediction, when the degree of freedom of the Student’s t distribution is set to infinite. Extensive experimental evaluations based on both simulation and real-life data sets demonstrated the robustness and the efficiency of our Student-t prediction model. The proposed approach provides critical functionality for stochastic processes on spatio-temporal data. Keywords-Spatio-Temporal Process; Expectation Propagation; Student’s t Distribution...|$|R
