Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw.

5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it is the secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go into a room and ask him very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E

25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab and because actually you {{were not allowed to}} know who {{you were going to get}} married with in the 19th century. Asker's friend Suleyman suggests him disguising as a fabric peddler, a sure way to meet women. Asker agrees and <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> round the houses selling fabrics.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the criticisms}} of season ten, {{it has been}} {{included}} in some definitions of The Simpsons golden age, usually as {{the point where the}} show began to decline but still put out some of the last great episodes. Ian Nathan of Empire described the show's classic era as being [...] "the first ten seasons", while Rubbercat.net believes that [...] "discussing what constitutes The Simpsons 'golden era' is a universal constant," [...] in this case being seasons 3–10. Jon Heacock of LucidWorks states that while season ten was [...] "the season in which, according to many, the show <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> sour," [...] it was also the final season where [...] "the show was consistently at the top of its game," [...] with [...] "so many moments, quotations, and references – both epic and obscure – that helped turn the Simpson family into the cultural icons that they remain to this day." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Warner Bros. took pitches from {{comic book}} writers, screenwriters and {{directors}} {{on how to}} successfully restart the Superman film series. Comic book writers Grant Morrison, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns and Brad Meltzer were among those who pitched their ideas for a reboot. [...] "I told them, it’s not that bad. Just treat Superman Returns as the Ang Lee Hulk," [...] Morrison said. [...] "The Incredible Hulk has proven the audience will forgive you and let you redo the franchise," [...] said Waid. Morrison's idea was similar to his work on All-Star Superman, while Waid's was akin to [...] Mark Millar, teaming with director Matthew Vaughn, also planned an epic eight-hour Superman trilogy, each installment released a year apart, similar to The Lord of the Rings. Millar compared it to the Godfather trilogy, in which it would chronicle the entire life of Superman, {{from the early days}} of Krypton to the finale where Superman loses his powers as the Sun <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> supernova.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{video game}} journalists and enthusiasts {{including}} Thomas, Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack, GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer, and 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish, {{refer to the}} fourth installment as {{a turning point for}} the quality of titles in the Mega Man series. Nutt and Speer admitted that the series was beginning to deteriorate with this game, likely due to the growing reputation of the more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System {{at the time of its}} release. Parrish proclaimed, [...] "Here's where the series <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off the rails a bit -- the Dr. Wily fake out was silly, the music was terrible, the bosses and weapons were uninspired, and the ability to charge up the Mega Buster is often cited as a game-breaking innovation." [...] Thomas identified the chargeable Mega Buster as disrupting the balance of the game and rendering many of the Master Weapons useless, one of the concepts that set the Mega Man games apart from other action-platformers.|$|E

2500|$|As the uprisings peter out {{in early}} 1916, Jeb Stuart III, who had {{destroyed}} his career by protecting Pompey, intentionally allows himself a [...] "heroic death" [...] in combat. His father is General Jeb Stuart, Jr., a {{power in the}} Confederate General Staff at Richmond, who ensures that Featherston never makes officer's rank despite his fitness for the post. Featherston, previously no more racist than other ordinary white Confederates, now hates blacks and aristocratic officers alike. His anger intensifies as the war <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> badly for the Confederates. By {{the end of the}} war, Featherston has begun pouring out his hatred on Gray Eagle scratchpads in what would later become his autobiography, Over Open Sights, analogous to Mein Kampf. When the ceasefire goes into effect, he vows to Clarence Potter that he would have vengeance on the blacks and the aristocrats running the War Department.|$|E
2500|$|Proyas co-wrote the {{screenplay}} with Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer. Goyer had written , {{the sequel to}} Proyas's 1994 film The Crow; Proyas invited Goyer to co-write {{the screenplay}} for Dark City after reading Goyer's screenplay for Blade, which {{had yet to be}} released. Writers Guild of America initially protested at crediting more than two screenwriters for a film, but it eventually relented and credited all three writers. [...] Proyas originally conceived a story about a 1940s detective who is obsessed with facts and cannot solve a case where the facts do not make sense. [...] "He slowly <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> insane through the story," [...] says Proyas. [...] "He can't put the facts together because they don't add up to anything rational." [...] In the process of creating the fictional world for the character of the detective, Proyas created other characters, shifting the focus of the film from the detective (Bumstead) to the person pursued by the detective (Murdoch). Proyas envisioned a robust narrative where the audience could examine the film from the perspective of multiple characters and focus on the plot.|$|E
2500|$|Some photographers {{have found}} {{creative}} ways around these limitations. Louie Liotta of The New York Post told John Tierney {{he holds his}} camera near the ground, pointing upward, and walks with it for a short distance, {{in order to get}} a shot of the defendant's face as he or she is ducking downwards to avoid the cameras. Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground. To catch the defendant's face, he stands near the front door at the top of the steps. [...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts it for a second when he <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's trying very hard to be somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting as he runs, and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E
