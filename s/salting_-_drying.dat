40|$|The {{objective}} was to study the effect of dry period length in dairy cows on immunoglobulin content and natural antibodies (NAb) titers in colostrum, growth, and plasma natural and specific antibody titers in plasma of calves. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (n = 167) {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 dry period lengths (0, 30, or 60 d). Colostrum production, concentration of colostrum IgG and IgM, and titers of NAb (isotypes IgG and IgM) binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and human serum albumin (HuSA) in colostrum were measured. Female calves were immunized with both KLH and HuSA at wk 6 and 10 of life. Titers of NAb and specific antibody (SpAb) for isotypes IgG, IgM, and total immunoglobulin (IgT) binding KLH or HuSA were determined in plasma of female calves. Primary and secondary antibody responses to KLH or HuSA from wk 6 and 10 were expressed as the increase in antibody titers to wk 10 and 11 of life after primary and secondary challenges, respectively. Pregnancy length for cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period was 3 d shorter compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. Birth weight of calves from cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period was lower compared with calves from cows with a 30 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. Growth of calves until 12 wk of life was not affected by dry period length. Colostrum production and IgG and IgM concentration in colostrum were lower for cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period than a 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. Natural IgG and IgM titers binding KLH or HuSA were lower in colostrum from cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period compared with cows with a 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. Natural antibody titers (IgG, IgM, and IgT) binding KLH or HuSA in plasma were lower during the first 2 wk of life for calves from cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period compared with calves from cows with a 30 - or 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. After primary and secondary immunization of calves with KLH and HuSA, SpAb titers of calves were not affected by dry period length. After secondary immunization, the response of IgG and IgT binding KLH was higher in plasma of calves from cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. The results of this study demonstrate that, although omission of the dry period of dairy cows leads to lower plasma NAb titers in calves during the first 2 wk of life, SpAb titers in calves were not affected and even the secondary antibody responses were enhanced compared with calves from cows with a 30 - or 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period...|$|R

40|$|In a prior study, we {{observed}} that cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period had greater energy balance and lower milk production compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period in early lactation. The {{objective of the}} current study was to evaluate the influence of dry period length on metabolic status and hepatic gene expression in cows fed a lipogenic or glucogenic diet in early lactation. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (n = 167) were assigned randomly to 3 × 2 factorial design with 3 dry period lengths (n = 56, 55, and 56 for 0 -, 30 -, and 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry,</b> respectively) and 2 early lactation diets (n = 84 and 83 for glucogenic and lipogenic diet, respectively). Cows were fed a glucogenic or lipogenic diet from 10 d before the expected calving date and onward. The main ingredient for a glucogenic concentrate was corn, and the main ingredients for a lipogenic concentrate were sugar beet pulp, palm kernel, and rumen-protected palm oil. Blood was sampled weekly from 95 cows from wk 3 precalving to wk 8 postcalving. Liver samples were collected from 76 cows in wk - 2, 2, and 4 relative to calving. Liver samples were analyzed for triacylglycerol concentrations and mRNA expression of 12 candidate genes. Precalving, cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period had greater plasma ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea, and insulin concentrations compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. Postcalving, cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period had lower liver triacylglycerol and plasma nonesterified fatty acids concentrations (0. 20, 0. 32, and 0. 36 mmol/L for 0 -, 30 -, and 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period, respectively), greater plasma glucose, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin (24. 38, 14. 02, and 11. 08 µIU/mL for 0 -, 30 -, and 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period, respectively) concentrations, and lower hepatic mRNA expression of pyruvate carboxylase, compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. Plasma urea and ß-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were greater in cows fed a lipogenic diet compared with cows fed a glucogenic diet. In conclusion, cows with a 0 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period had an improved metabolic status in early lactation, indicated by lower plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, greater plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin, and lower mRNA expression of pyruvate carboxylase in the liver, compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 <b>-d</b> <b>dry</b> period. Independent of dry period length, the glucogenic diet also improved the metabolic status compared with the lipogenic diet...|$|R

40|$|Egg cartons have popularly {{been used}} as sound {{absorbers}} because they are inexpensive, easy to install and easily available. However, acoustic experts have demonstrated that egg cartons are bad sound absorbers. This study developed Enhanced Egg Carton <b>–</b> <b>Dry</b> and Enhanced Egg Carton – Wet using additional recycled materials (shredded rice straw paper, textile waste, 2 -cm cut rice straws) to improve the cartons’ sound absorption coefficient while retaining their original advantages. Enhanced Egg Carton <b>–</b> <b>Dry</b> and Enhanced Egg Carton – Wet were tested based on the ASTM C 423 - 02 method of sound absorption measurement. Enhanced Egg Carton <b>–</b> <b>Dry</b> has a noise reduction coefficient of 0. 6 and a sound absorption average of 0. 59, while Enhanced Egg Carton – Wet has a noise reduction coefficient of 0. 54 and sound absorption average of 0. 54. The maximum sound absorption coefficients of Enhanced Egg Carton <b>–</b> <b>Dry</b> and Enhanced Egg Carton – Wet are, respectively, 0. 77 at 500 Hz and 0. 67 at 630 Hz. Enhanced Egg Carton <b>–</b> <b>Dry</b> has a sound absorption coefficient ⩾ 0. 5, between 315 and 2500 Hz, which makes it able to absorb sound energy of the lower to upper mid-range frequencies. With their high sound absorptivity at mid-range frequencies, Enhanced Egg Carton <b>–</b> <b>Dry</b> and Enhanced Egg Carton – Wet are suitable for mosques and auditoriums, where the human voice is the dominant noise source and where an inexpensive sound absorber is needed. The production of Enhanced Egg Carton <b>–</b> <b>Dry</b> and Enhanced Egg Carton – Wet is so simple that users can do it themselves using basic home tools...|$|R
