5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many <b>strobing</b> lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E
5|$|While filming in Washington, D.C., {{the crew}} {{shot on the}} National Mall, and Bay stated {{that there would be}} a car race on the location. Two further {{locations}} announced were the Milwaukee Art Museum and the former Tower Automotive complex on Milwaukee's north side, then under redevelopment for mixed use as well as the city's equipment yard. Filming was scheduled to take place there after work was done in Chicago. On September 23, scenes were filmed at the former city hall in Detroit. On October 16, a scene in the later-1960s was shot at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, utilizing extras with period fashion and hairstyles. One day of shooting was also spent at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. Other planned filming locations included Africa and China. Though about 70% of the film's live action footage was shot in 3-D using Arri Alexa and Sony F35 cameras, more than half of the film still had to be converted into 3-D in post production to fix technical flaws 3-D filming produces. Other footage that needed to be converted into 3-D in post production was either entirely computer generated or shot in the anamorphic format on 35mm film. 35mm film was used for scenes filmed in slow motion and scenes such as closeups of faces or shots of the sky which required higher image quality than the HD digital 3-D cameras could provide. 35mm cameras were also used for scenes where the 3-D cameras proved to be too heavy, or were subject to <b>strobing</b> or electrical damage from dust. Principal photography officially concluded on November 9, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Sonic Research and Planet Waves both {{released}} a true-strobe with {{a bank of}} LEDs arranged in a circle that gives a <b>strobing</b> effect based upon {{the frequency of the}} input note. Both LCD and LED display true strobes do not require mechanical servicing and are much cheaper than the mechanical types. As such, they are a popular option for musicians who want the accuracy of a strobe without the high cost and the maintenance requirements. However, LED strobe displays offer no information about the harmonic structure of a note, unlike LCD types, which do offer four bands of consolidated information.|$|E
50|$|Many {{existing}} installations {{that did not}} include visual signals were retrofitted with <b>strobe</b> plates. These retrofit plates would allow for the easy installation of a <b>strobe</b> without replacing the audible signal. Later ADA codes also required that <b>strobes</b> be at least 15 candelas and have a flash rate of at least 60 flashes per minute (one flash per second).Companies such as Wheelock and Simplex discontinued their translucent <b>strobes,</b> {{and replaced them with}} new, clear, high-intensity <b>strobes.</b> Today, <b>strobe</b> synchronization is often used to synchronize all <b>strobes</b> in a uniform flash pattern. This is to prevent individuals with photosensitive epilepsy from potentially experiencing seizures due to unsynchronized <b>strobes.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are a medium-intensity white <b>strobe</b> and a high-intensity white <b>strobe.</b> Medium-intensity white <b>strobes</b> {{are usually}} used on {{structures}} that are between 200-500 feet (61-152.4 meters). If a medium white <b>strobe</b> {{is used on}} a structure greater than 500 feet (152.4 meters), the structure must be painted. The common medium white <b>strobe</b> flashes 40 times in a minute, at an intensity of 20,000 candelas for daytime/twilight, and 2,000 candelas at nighttime.|$|R

25|$|Sometimes strobe {{lighting}} {{can trigger}} seizures in photosensitive epilepsy. An infamous event {{took place in}} 1997 in Japan when an episode of the Pokémon anime, Dennō Senshi Porygon (commonly translated as Electric Soldier Porygon), featured a scene that depicted a huge explosion using flashing red and blue lights, causing about 685 of the viewing children {{to be sent to}} hospitals. These flashes were extremely bright strobe lights. They involved multiple colors with a strobe effect at about 12 Hz. Although 95% of the 685 just complained of dizziness, some were hospitalized. Organizers later said {{that they did not know}} about the threshold of <b>strobing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{strobe lights}} on sale {{to the public}} are factory-limited to about 10–12Hz (10–12 flashes per second) in their {{internal}} oscillators, although externally triggered strobe lights will often flash as frequently as possible. Studies {{have shown that the}} majority of people that are susceptible to the <b>strobing</b> effects can have symptoms at 15Hz-70Hz, albeit rare. Other studies have shown epileptic symptoms at the 15Hz rate with over 90 seconds of continuous staring at a strobe light. There have been no known seizures at or below the 8Hz (or 8 flashes per second) level. Many fire alarms in schools, hospitals, stadiums, etc. strobe at a 1Hz rate.|$|E
25|$|At the {{southern}} terminus of the freeway, SR 143 {{begins at the}} intersection of 48th Street and Broadway, climbing over Interstate 10 on the original 48th Street bridge built without any shoulder lanes in 1967. Traffic heading southbound at this point is warned of a traffic signal that hides over the optical horizon of the overpass to most traffic. To combat safety issues raised by the lack of visibility of the main traffic signals, a second traffic signal was installed at a higher elevation so that it is visible to traffic on the northern approach of the overpass. At one point, the second signal included a high-intensity strobe embedded in the red signal; however, the strobe has since been removed. In addition to the <b>strobing</b> signal light, rumble strips have been cut into the bridge deck at several intervals, and there is a sign that turns on if the signal is red and the speed limit is reduced, further alerting traffic that the freeway is ending.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} brand in <b>strobe</b> tuner {{technology}} is Peterson Tuners who in 1967 marketed their first <b>strobe</b> tuner, the Model 400. Other companies, such as Sonic Research, TC Electronic, and Planet Waves, sell highly accurate LED-based true <b>strobe</b> tuners. Other LED tuners have a 'strobe mode' that emulates {{the appearance of}} a <b>strobe.</b> However, the accuracy of these tuners in <b>strobe</b> mode, while sufficient for most tuning, is no better than in any other mode, as they use the same technique as any basic tuner to measure frequency, only displaying {{it in a way that}} imitates a <b>strobe</b> tuner.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Strobe</b> tuners (the popular {{term for}} {{stroboscopic}} tuners) {{are the most}} accurate type of tuner. There are three types of <b>strobe</b> tuners: the mechanical rotating disk <b>strobe</b> tuner, an LED array <b>strobe</b> {{in place of the}} rotating disk, and [...] "virtual strobe" [...] tuners with LCDs or ones that work on personal computers. A <b>strobe</b> tuner shows the difference between a reference frequency and the musical note being played. Even the slightest difference between the two shows up as a rotating motion in the <b>strobe</b> display. The accuracy of the tuner is only limited by the internal frequency generator. The <b>strobe</b> tuner detects the pitch either from a TRS input jack or a built-in or external microphone connected to the tuner.|$|R

A description is provided of how <b>strobe</b> lights work, together with information about warning audiences if <b>strobe</b> lighting {{is to be used}} in a performance. By clicking on the resource, students are shown the flashing effects generated by a <b>strobe</b> light on a particular stage set. ...|$|R
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the <b>strobing</b> effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{expensive}} strobe tuners is the Peterson Strobe Center, which has twelve separate mechanical strobe displays; one for each pitch of the equally tempered octave. This unit (about $3,500 US) can tune multiple notes of a sound or chord, displaying each note's overtone sub-structure simultaneously. This gives an overall picture of tuning within a sound, note or chord that is not possible with most other tuning devices. (The TC Electronic Polytune can display the pitch accuracy of up to six pre-selected notes.) It is often used for tuning complex instruments and sound sources, or difficult-to-tune instruments where the technician requires a very accurate and complete aural picture of an instrument's output. For instance, when tuning musical bells, this model displays several of the bell's partials (hum, second partial, tierce, quint and nominal/naming note) as well as the prime, and each of their partials, on separate displays. The unit is heavy and fragile, and requires a regular maintenance schedule. Each of the twelve displays requires periodic re-calibration. It can be used to teach students about note substructures, which show on the separate <b>strobing</b> displays.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} St. Brigid's Cross {{was chosen}} by Edith Cusack the Head of Women's Programming at the newly founded channel in early 1960s. St. Brigid is the female patron saint of Ireland. The first logo lasted until the {{formation}} of Ireland's national radio and television services Raidió Teilifís Éireann in 1966. Part of the redesign was to prevent <b>strobing</b> on screen. The 1966 to 1969 logo was a much simpler form of the cross and was designed by Jim Jones. The letters R, T and E {{were added to the}} logo after the formation of RTÉ as a statutory body. Before this the logo was simply the cross in black on a white background or white on a black background. Don Farrell and Jon Cogan designed the 3rd incarnation of the Brigid's Cross. This logo remain on air until 1986 when RTÉ decided that both channels in a multi-channel landscape need to be identified as clearly RTÉ. The 1986 logo coincided with the 25th anniversary of Irish Television. The Cross on RTÉ One was animated turning into a number 1, while over on RTÉ Two it turned into a number 2. On screen this logo lasted until 1988 when RTÉ Two re-branded as Network 2 moving it further away from the sister channel RTÉ One. 10 years later the logo dropped the Brigid's Cross, {{and for the first time}} placed an accent (Fadá) on the letter E. RTÉ also formal branded Network Two on screen as part of RTÉ until 1997 when the channel was once more re-branded on screen as N2. The three letters are a modern take on Celtic scripting. The Brigid's Cross was seen on many RTÉ One television idents until 2003 and remains on the headed paper of RTÉ, while a variation of the 1966 cross is used by RTÉ's Graphic Design Department. Since 2004 all RTÉ service use the 1996 logo as part of their Identity.|$|E
50|$|The Series MT (Multi-tone) was {{introduced}} in 1993. It features eight different tones including Continuous Horn, Code-3 Horn, March Time Horn, Code-3 Tone, Siren, Slow Whoop, Hi-Lo, and Bell. These could be set using DIP switches {{on the back of}} the horn. However, most of the tones did not grab the attention of bystanders. The most commonly used tones were Continuous Horn, Code-3 Horn, and March Time Horn. The MT has seen different <b>strobe</b> types over time, including translucent vertical <b>strobes,</b> transparent vertical <b>strobes,</b> and transparent horizontal <b>strobes.</b> The transparent horizontal <b>strobe</b> design {{was introduced}} in 2002, and is still used to this day.In 1995, Wheelock introduced the AS, a combination horn and <b>strobe.</b> The AS was first created with a vertical position <b>strobe</b> on the right side of the horn. In 1998 when the NS was introduced, the <b>strobe</b> was moved above the horn horizontally, like most other current Wheelock <b>strobes</b> for better light output. As of 2010 the AS is still being manufactured for weatherproof applications.|$|R
25|$|The <b>strobe</b> light, {{commonly}} called a <b>strobe,</b> is a device {{used to produce}} regular flashes of light. Modern uses of <b>strobe</b> lights serve a purpose for safety warning, and motion detection. <b>Strobes</b> can be found atop most police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks. The origin of <b>strobe</b> lighting dates to 1931, when Harold Eugene Edgerton invented a flashing lamp to make an improved stroboscope {{for the study of}} moving objects, eventually resulting in dramatic photographs of objects such as bullets in flight.|$|R

500|$|Popping {{was created}} in Fresno, California in the 1970s and popularized by Samuel [...] "Boogaloo Sam" [...] Solomon and his crew the Electric Boogaloos. It {{is based on the}} {{technique}} of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in a dancer's body, referred to as a pop or a hit. When performed correctly, each hit is synchronized to the rhythm and beats of the music. Popping is also used as an umbrella term to refer {{to a wide range of}} closely related illusionary dance styles such as <b>strobing,</b> liquid, animation, twisto-flex, and waving. Dancers often integrate these styles with standard popping to create a more varied performance. In all of these subgenres it appears to the spectator that the body is popping. The difference between each subgenre is how exaggerated the popping is. In liquid, the body movements look like water. The popping is so smooth that the movements do not look like popping at all; they look fluid. The opposite of this is <b>strobing</b> (also called ticking) in which the movements are staccato and jerky.|$|E

2500|$|Peterson {{released}} a PC-based virtual <b>strobe</b> tuner in 2008 called [...] "StroboSoft". This computer software package {{has all the}} features of a virtual <b>strobe,</b> such as user-programmable temperaments and tunings. To use this tuner, a musician must have a computer next to the instrument to be tuned. An alternative is the PC-based <b>strobe</b> tuner TB <b>Strobe</b> Tuner with fewer functions.|$|R
5000|$|BenQ later {{developed}} their own native [...] "BenQ Blur Reduction" [...] technology, integrated into several of their gaming monitors. This offers a <b>strobe</b> backlight which can be easily turned on and off by the user. There is no control over the <b>strobe</b> timing or <b>strobe</b> length for the user, although third party utilities have been produced for this purpose. Newer firmware for the BenQ Blur Reduction monitors allow direct user control over the <b>strobe</b> pulse (timing) and <b>strobe</b> length (persistence) directly from the Service Menu. More customization is available by using a higher Vertical Total (from 1498-1502, depending on what does not cause errors), which effectively tricks the Mstar scaler into working with a larger blanking interval, as if the vertical screen size were longer. This effectively pushes the <b>strobe</b> crosstalk farther down {{the bottom of the}} display, improving <b>strobe</b> image quality, but with some drawbacks (like a faint scanlines effect, also seen in <b>strobe</b> LightBoost mode).|$|R
50|$|In {{bi-directional}} {{data transfer}} buses, two opposing unidirectional <b>strobes</b> {{can be sent}} from each device. Often the <b>strobe</b> is free running in this case. That is, the <b>strobe</b> continues to toggle whether there is data being transferred or not.|$|R
500|$|The album's {{title track}} was {{received}} favorably. Draper displayed particular fondness {{for the song}} and was amazed the music could stay fresh for its entire length. Hoffman also spoke highly of it, stating [...] " [...] contains only as many discernible musical ideas as your average five- to seven-minute techno track [...] but its luxurious length lets those ideas stretch out gloriously [...] allowing a slow, fluid evolution that gestures towards a cosmic infinity." [...] Finney praised the title track for its [...] "shimmering, <b>strobing</b> synthesizer melodies" [...] and ability to expand and surprise.

500|$|The Guardians Caroline Sullivan first criticized Cruz for his evident [...] "facelessness" [...] in {{his music}} while {{reviewing}} his album; she, however, {{wrote that the}} song [...] "saves the day" [...] and wrote that it exemplified [...] "British humour by impersonating a camera ('Snap, snap, click!')." [...] Sara Anderson from AOL Radio was positive in her review of the song. Anderson wrote, [...] "Building from <b>strobing,</b> techno back beats, Taio melodically, and bluntly, asks his muse to take a few, er, risque pictures for him, before transitioning into speaking voice {{with the help of}} party queen Kesha."

[...] "Ideally {{at the end of}} the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at," [...] Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film. The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace. In , Fox had announced that 3-D filming for Avatar would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make <b>strobing</b> less noticeable. According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.|$|E

50|$|A high-intensity white <b>strobe</b> {{light is}} used on {{structures}} that are taller than 700 feet (213.4 meters). These lights provide the highest visibility both day and night. Unlike a medium <b>strobe,</b> a high-intensity <b>strobe</b> does not provide 360˚ coverage; this {{requires the use of}} at least 3 high <b>strobes</b> at each level. On the other hand, it reduces maintenance costs (i.e. no painting). If the structure has an antenna at the top that is greater than 40 feet, a medium-intensity white <b>strobe</b> light must be placed above it rather than below.
