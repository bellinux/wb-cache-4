500|$|Luminosity— Ignite the Night! {{has mostly}} {{received}} positive reviews {{from the general}} public and enthusiasts. James Koehl from Theme Park Insider described it as [...] "The kind of show that you can watch over and over from different vantage points and <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> show every time." [...] Jeff Putz, co-creator of PointBuzz and creator of CoasterBuzz said [...] "Luminosity succeeds in keeping the energy of the park's guests very high until the moment they leave." [...] Putz along with others criticized the show as too long and having inconsistent singers.|$|E
500|$|Actor Daniel Dae Kim {{enjoyed the}} fight scene {{between him and}} guest actor Tony Lee, commenting that [...] "I really {{appreciate}} the fact that 's just a down-and-dirty street fighter. I think his style of fighting fits his character". He continued [...] "it was great to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> layer to Sun's character. Because previously she had always been the good wife, and Jin was the bad husband". Actress Yunjin Kim added that [...] "now we know that 's not what she's been advertised to be for the last two seasons, but actually {{she has a lot of}} secrets." ...|$|E
500|$|Petersen had {{difficulty}} ridding {{himself of the}} Will Graham character after principal photography wrapped. While rehearsing for a play in Chicago, he felt the old character [...] "always coming out" [...] instead of his new role. To try and rid himself of the character, Petersen went to a barbershop where he had them shave his beard, cut his hair and dye it blond {{so that he could}} look into the mirror and <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person. At first he felt it was due to the rigorous shooting schedule for Manhunter, but later realized that the character [...] "had creeped in".|$|E

500|$|... "Circle the Drain" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Katy Perry, {{from her}} third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). It was written by Perry, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Monte Neuble. Lyrically, [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] candidly focuses on a former lover's drug-addiction and the strains it put on both of them. Following its release, several media outlets {{reported}} it to {{have been inspired by}} her former relationship with Travie McCoy. Critics were divided on the track, with some finding Perry to be in a hypocritical position, given the album's other material. Other reviewers found it nice to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> side to the singer.|$|E
500|$|On the character's {{transformation}} Dawson told Digital Spy {{that when}} Darren was younger he was [...] "just a horrible child {{and he had}} nothing nice to say about anyone" [...] before Darren matured and softened. Dawson added that {{it was nice to}} <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> side to the character. Dawson later added that the character's change was good as [...] "everyone goes through changes in their life and Darren just hit that time. It was good timing for him". He also explained that his character becoming a father led him to develop and mature further, stating that Darren accepted his responsibilities as a father and [...] "tries hard to be the father that he wants to be". He felt that Darren enjoyed being a father and that it made him feel [...] "complete and like he has a purpose in life, whereas before he was always chasing his tail". Dawson felt that as time went on, Darren became more helpful, sympathetic and more empathetic towards other characters, especially Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre). Dawson stated, [...] "It's very uncharacteristic but Darren is softening up". Dawson added that Darren's difficult life has led him to mature and act like a [...] "bit of a saint", but that Darren was still greatly misunderstood.|$|E
500|$|The Who's That Girl World Tour was musically and {{technically}} {{superior to}} Madonna's Virgin Tour, because she incorporated multimedia components {{to make the}} show more compelling. As the tour was confirmed, Madonna and her team started planning for it. Madonna wanted a show which consisted of theatrics, drama, dance and choreography in [...] "full-force". Her publicist Liz Rosenberg commented, [...] "She wants a visual impact that would knock people out. She was very determined about this. And she's the type that makes decisions quickly; If something doesn't work, she starts over. You'll <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> look this year, but it's still Madonna, still bigger than life." [...] In order to engage herself completely and handle the grueling dance routines, she started attending aerobics classes at Hollywood health centre The Sports Connection. By the time the tour drew nearer, she hired a personal trainer, and her daily routine involved jogging, weight-lifting, dancing, gymnastics, trampoline, swimming and cycling. She started eating vegetarian food with plenty of protein and carbohydrate and avoided the sun. British funk band Level 42 was the supporting act of the tour. Madonna's image {{was that of a}} blond girl with soft curls, making a striking contrast with the firm, almost hard lines of her eye make-up and lipstick; the idea of her friend actress Debi Mazar.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{marks the}} return of Jenna-Louise Coleman, who {{previously}} appeared in the series opener, [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". Coleman was cast because of her chemistry with Matt Smith, and especially because {{she was able to}} talk faster than him. She auditioned for the role of Clara, not Oswin from [...] "Asylum", as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to Moffat whilst casting for Clara. The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep Coleman's appearance a secret until [...] "Asylum" [...] was broadcast; the effort was ultimately successful. Moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made [...] "the show feel different" [...] and brought the story to [...] "a new beginning" [...] with a different person meeting the Doctor. Smith said that Clara was different from her predecessor Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), which allowed the audience to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> side of the Doctor. Coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated, citing the reason for following the Doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers. The Clara who would become a travelling companion of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring premiere, [...] "The Bells of Saint John"; save for a brief cameo at the end of [...] "The Snowmen". Coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with [...] "trust {{that there would be a}} payoff" [...] to her mystery.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1983 Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 20, 1983, Waltrip, a pre-race {{favorite}} to win the race, drove the Junior Johnson prepared 1983 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Pepsi Challenger. He was involved in an accident when his car spun on lap 64, at exit of turn 4, at nearly , as he was making an evasive maneuver to avoid rear-ending a much slower car ahead of him. Waltrip locked his brakes but the car slid for several hundred feet, then struck an earthen embankment {{near the entrance to}} pit road. The force of the impact was so violent that Waltrip's car was thrown back onto the track, in front of oncoming traffic. Waltrip then made hard contact with the outside concrete retaining wall once again into oncoming traffic. Cale Yarborough, the eventual winner of the race, barely avoided hitting the demolished Pepsi Challenger. Waltrip suffered a concussion and was taken by ambulance to the Halifax Medical Center for observation and medical treatment. The crash was a wake-up call and a life-changing event for Waltrip. When he heard drivers and fans joking that the crash would [...] "knock him sane" [...] or [...] "finally shut him up", he realized for the first time how unpopular he was and resolved to clean up his image. The years following that crash would <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Darrell Waltrip, one who worked hard to repair and rebuild his relationship with fans and fellow drivers. Years later, Waltrip would be voted (by NASCAR fans) [...] "Most Popular Driver", two years in a row, (1989, 1990).|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money I will pay you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where he could <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish my picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E

I had to throw conscience aside, and brazenly concede {{that he ought to}} have brought twenty-five dollars; whereas I was quite well aware that in all the ages, the world had never seen a king that was worth half the money, and during the next thirteen centuries wouldn't see one that was worth the fourth of it.
