40|$|The Buccaneer CubeSat will {{be fitted}} with a high {{frequency}} antenna made from spring <b>steel</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>tape.</b> The geometry of the antenna is described as open bowtie. In the microgravity of low Earth orbit {{there is a risk}} that the antenna will collapse or bend due to the extremely small loads. Worst case empirical analysis has shown that the antenna will remain deployed in low Earth orbit. This has been shown in the presence of worst case environmental loads due to aerodynamic drag (at 300 km) and solar radiation pressure, combined with peak rotational accelerations. The high frequency open bowtie antenna will have a margin of safety of at least 54. 8...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of networks in rural industrial clusters, {{in particular in}} the context of China has been paid more attention to in the world. Applying the theory and techniques of social network analysis (SNA), this study is with particular regard to the business network relationships and their evolutionary dynamics of <b>steel</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>tape</b> manufacturing clustered in Nanzhuang Village, Yucheng County of Henan Province, China, which is important for better understanding the industrial and regional development in less developed rural areas. From data collected by comprehensive questionnaire survey in 2002 and mass interviews with 60 enterprises and assembling families and several government authorities in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008, four types of networks are identified: spin-off, consulting, communication and cooperative. The characteristic of these networks is outlined in detail. Compared with the high-tech clusters of typical developed areas, the networks that have evolved in traditional manufacturing clusters are more affected by emotive linkages. The cluster networks are shown to exhibit a polycentric hierarchical structure. The family relationships are the dominate spin-off channels of enterprises, while the supply and demand relationships and the mobility of the skilled workers are also important paths of network learning, and the cooperation relationships are comparatively stable. Besides the root enterprises, the middle-sized enterprises are comparatively more active than small-sized enterprises, and the intermediary agencies and the service institutions act as bridges of the inter-enterprises cooperation. By analysis of the structure of networks and the interactions between the networks, the four stages of network evolution are also identified. The four stages are dominated by the family networks, the internal division production networks, the local innovation networks and the global supply networks respectively, and they play different roles in cluster development...|$|E

50|$|Tracking and {{recording}} of drill pipe at the rig site starts when individual joints are picked up. Joint numbers are manually {{marked on the}} side of the pipe. Typically three sections of pipe are joined together into a stand (of about 27-29 m in length) and stacked in rows of 10, with their base resting on the drill floor. Prior to running in the hole each stand is manually <b>measured</b> with a <b>steel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> and the measurement recorded in a computer spreadsheet (previously a pipe tally book was used) alongside the stand number. To confirm at any stage what depth the drill bit is operating at, the driller consults the pipe tally records, and measures the length of the current stand of drill pipe below the rig floor.|$|R
40|$|Note: This {{paper is}} a rewrite {{of a paper}} {{submitted}} for journal publication but rejected because the reviewers wanted two primary improvements: 1. More review of related prior studies, and 2. Ratings of political leaders on warmongering-proneness done by more "professional", "expert ” raters. The present paper version includes an extended background review but not yet ratings by professional raters. Such ratings will be sought in future studies. However, the expectation is that no difference will be found between lay and "expert " raters. A <b>steel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> is a highly reliable measuring instrument that will yield accurate measures of the square footage of a house, even when measured by a careful "lay" person rather than a building contractor or realtor. The warmongering-proneness rating scale has extremely high reliability (alpha. 98) when used by intelligent, well-educated lay raters. Therefore, their ratings of political and historical figures {{are expected to be}} as accurate as those that could be done by "experts"...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{computerized}} measurement system (CMS) combined with a sticky belt test stand for examining in-row seed spacing distribution accuracy. For this purpose 8 performance parameters were selected for precision seeding: mean seed spacing, the standard deviation, the multiples index, the miss index, the quality of feed index, the precision, the population index, and the coefficient of precision (CP- 3). The CMS hardware consisted of a high precision optical mouse coupled with a laser pointer and a notebook computer. The use of optical laser technology is a new method for the determination of seed spacing distribution. The CMS stored seed coordinate data, which was input using a simple user interface, and sent to the data to Microsoft Excel for further statistical analysis. The results obtained from this study confirm that the combination of a sticky belt test stand and CMS can be used instead of a digital caliper and <b>steel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> to rapidly and correctly obtain quantitative evaluations of seed spacing uniformity in the laboratory. Key Words: Computerized measurement system, sticky belt test, seed spacing accuracy, precision seedin...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>measures</b> {{that were}} {{intended}} for use in tailoring or dressmaking were made from flexible cloth or plastic. They are named [...] "sewing tape". These types of <b>tape</b> <b>measures</b> were mainly used for the measuring of the human's waist line. Today, <b>measuring</b> <b>tapes</b> made for sewing are made of fiberglass, which does not tear or stretch as easily. <b>Measuring</b> <b>tapes</b> designed for carpentry or construction often use a stiff, curved metallic ribbon that can remain stiff and straight when extended, but retracts into a coil for convenient storage. This type of <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> will have a floating tang or hook on the end to aid measuring. The tang {{is connected to the}} tape with loose rivets through oval holes, and can move a distance equal to its thickness, to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate. [...] A <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> of 25 or even 100 feet can wind into a relatively small container. The self-marking <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> allows the user an accurate one hand measure.|$|R
