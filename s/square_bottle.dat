40|$|Recombinant {{proteins}} {{are important}} for biomedical research and {{for the treatment of}} human disease. Therefore it is necessary to develop reproducible bioprocesses to rapidly produce proteins of adequate quality and quantity. Expression in mammalian cells is preferred if the proteins are to be properly folded and post-translationally modified. For the rapid production of milligram to gram quantities of a protein in mammalian cells, large-scale transient gene expression is an attractive option. The two most important components of this technology are the cell cultivation system and the gene delivery method. For this reason the goal of this thesis was to develop novel cost-efficient cell cultivation systems and gene delivery methods for the large-scale transfection of mammalian cells in chemically defined media free of any animal-derived components including serum. Cultivation of mammalian cells in suspension is essential for large-scale transient gene expression. A superior system for the cultivation of mammalian cells based on the agitation of cells in "square-shaped" glass <b>bottles</b> (<b>square</b> <b>bottles)</b> was developed. It is an inexpensive but efficient means to grow cells to a high density without instrumentation. The growth and viability of cultures of both human embryo kidney (HEK) 293 E and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG 44 cells in agitated one-liter <b>square</b> <b>bottles</b> exceeded that in spinner flasks, reaching cell densities 1. 5 times higher on average. Furthermore, an efficient and reproducible method to transfect cells in agitated <b>square</b> <b>bottles</b> was developed for both HEK 293 E and CHO DG 44 cells. A novel gene delivery method termed calfection that relies on the addition of DNA and CaCl 2 directly to a suspension culture was developed. Calfection has a number of advantages over existing gene delivery methods such as calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation in that there are no time-dependent steps. The DNA/CaCl 2 solution can be stored for long periods and is filterable. It is suitable for both large-scale transfections in bioreactors and for high-throughput transfections in microtiter plates. One drawback, however, is its dependence on the presence of serum in the culture medium. A second gene delivery method, serum-free transfection with polyethylenimine (polyfection), proved to be highly efficient for the transfection of both HEK 293 E and CHO DG 44 cells. A reproducible method for polyfection in microtiter plates, 50 ml centrifuge tubes, agitated <b>square</b> and round <b>bottles,</b> spinner flasks, and bioreactors was optimized for these two cell lines. Polyfection proved to be a simple and successful gene transfer method in both instrumented and non-instrumented cultivation systems. Importantly, it could be performed in serum-free chemically defined media. With HEK 293 E cells, 80 mg/l of antibody was produced in agitated <b>square</b> <b>bottles</b> and with CHO DG 44 cells, more than 2 g of antibody were produced in one week in a 150 -liter bioreactor...|$|R

We found that ‘‘square-shaped’ ’ bottles (square bottles) provide an inexpensive but efficient means to grow HEK- 293 EBNA and CHO-DG 44 cells to high den-sity.

50|$|Mughal glassmaking in India, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{a return to the}} {{enamelling}} and gilding traditions from the Middle Islamic Period, as well as the glass-carving techniques used in Persia during the earliest centuries of the Islamic world. Glass workshops and factories were initially found near the Mughal capital of Agra, Patna (eastern India), and in Gujarat province (western India), and by the 18th century had spread to other regions in western India. New forms were introduced using these older Islamic glass-working techniques, and of these, nargileh (water pipe) bases became the most dominant. <b>Square</b> <b>bottles</b> based on Dutch forms, decorated with enamelling and gilding in Indian motifs, are another important expression in Mughal glassmaking, and were produced at Bhuj, Kutch, and in Gujarat.

40|$|Efficient {{production}} of the recombinant proteins (r-proteins) {{must be based on}} previous testing of an expression of a small amount of the r-proteins. This work focuses on optimizing the expression of the r-proteins in 12 -well plates. It includes testing of an appropriate speed of shaking, production and transfection volume. It compares all the current testing vessels (it compares a 50 -ml centrifugation tube to new tested plates that can substitute the unsuitable tubes). It also compares these new tested plates to production <b>square</b> <b>bottles</b> in order to compare the r-protein expression in the plates to the r-protein expression in the bottles. It monitors effects of carbon dioxide on a number of vital cells, their viability, a relative frequency of positive cells on GFP in various cultivation vessels (plates, tubes, bottles), and pH of HEK 293 cellular cultivation during the 4 -day cultivation process as well. On the basis of the results and statistical processing of the results, we have set the optimal agitation speed of 230 rpm for the 12 -well plates. We have also set the appropriate production and transfection volume of 2 and 0. 5 ml for the 12 -well plates. In order to evaluate variables and compare cultivations in all the vessels, the tubes could be substituted by the plates. There is a statistically significant impact of carbon dioxide on the number of cells, their variability, relative frequency of cells (positive on GFP) and pH of the cellular HEK 293 cultivation in the cultivation vessels. There is the strongest r-protein expression in carbon dioxide conditions. The results of this work allow to employ the 12 -well plates when we aim to test the expression of the r-proteins in a small amount and in carbon dioxide conditions. On the basis of the findings, the expression of the r-proteins in the 12 -well plates and carbon dioxide conditions can substitute the expression of the r-proteins in the production bottle and in carbon dioxide free conditions...|$|R

60|$|Evil {{might have}} come from it, had not the old woman opportunely brought the 'grub' into the room. This she chucked {{down on the table}} {{in such a way that}} the grease out of the dish spattered itself all around. There was no tablecloth, nor had any {{preparation}} been made; but in the middle of the table there was a heap of dirty knives and forks, with which the men at once armed themselves; and each took a plate out of a heap that had been placed on a shelf against the wall. Caldigate and Shand, when they saw how the matter was to be arranged, did as the other men. The 'grub' consisted of an enormous lump of boiled beef, and a bowl of potatoes, which was moderate enough in size considering that there were in all about a dozen men to be fed. But there was meat enough for double the number, and bread in plenty, but so ill-made as to be rejected by most of the men. The potatoes were evidently the luxury; and, guided by that feeling, the man who had told the strangers that they need not be afraid of being robbed, at once selected six out of the bowl, and deposited three each before Dick and Caldigate. He helped the others all round to one each, and then was left without any for himself. 'I don't care a damn for that sort of tucker,' he said, as though he despised potatoes from the bottom of his heart. Of all the crew he was the dirtiest, and was certainly half drunk. Another man holloaed to 'Mother Henniker' for pickles; but Mother Henniker, without leaving her seat at the bar, told them to 'pickle themselves.' Whereupon one of the party, making some allusion to Jack Brien's swag,--Jack Brien being absent at the moment,--rose from his seat and undid a great roll lying in one of the corners. Every miner has his swag,--consisting of a large blanket which is rolled up, and contains all his personal luggage. Out of Jack Brien's swag were extracted two large <b>square</b> <b>bottles</b> of pickles. These were straightway divided among the men, care being taken that Dick and Caldigate should have ample shares. Then every man helped himself to beef, as much as he would, passing the dish round from one to the other. When the meal was half finished, Mrs. Henniker brought in an enormous jorum of tea, which she served out to all the guests in tin pannikins, giving to every man a fixed and ample allowance of brown sugar, without at all consulting his taste. Milk there was none. In the midst of this Jack Brien came in, and with a clamour of mirth the empty pickle jars were shown him. Jack, who was a silent man, and somewhat melancholy, merely shook his head and ate his beef. It may be presumed that he was fond of pickles, having taken so much trouble to provide them; but he said not a word of the injury to which he had been subjected.|$|R
