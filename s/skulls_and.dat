5|$|Another {{prominent}} early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, {{was primarily}} responsible {{for the creation of}} the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> skeletons, 600 anthropoid <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> skeletons. Todd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic symphysis. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, {{but it was not until}} the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, Wilton M. Krogman, that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{belongs in}} the {{subfamily}} Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae, along with Tarbosaurus, Tyrannosaurus and Alioramus. Animals in this subfamily are {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Albertosaurus and are known– with the exception of Alioramus– for their robust build with proportionally larger <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> longer femora than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} {{subfamily}} of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, which includes Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> longer {{bones of the}} lower leg (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).|$|E

5|$|A. f. styani {{has been}} {{described}} by Thomas in 1902 based on one skull from a specimen collected in Sichuan. Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter coat and greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E
5|$|After the {{original}} Russian-Mongolian expeditions in the 1940s, Polish-Mongolian joint expeditions to the Gobi Desert began in 1963 and continued until 1971, recovering many new fossils, including new specimens of Tarbosaurus from the Nemegt Formation. Expeditions involving Japanese and Mongolian scientists between 1993 and 1998, {{as well as}} private expeditions hosted by Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie {{around the turn of}} the 21st century, discovered and collected further Tarbosaurus material. More than 30 specimens are known, including more than 15 <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> several complete postcranial skeletons.|$|E
50|$|A <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> {{crossbones}} symbol {{will also}} occasionally appear {{in lieu of}} a rune. The <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> crossbones functions by removing any rune of choice from the board. The <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> crossbones can often be used to the advantage of the player by clearing one of the runes from a joint (a square adjacent to two or more non-matching runes where the number of possible runes that can be placed there is more limited). When fewer runes are present on the board, the <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> crossbones symbol may be more harmful than helpful.|$|R

5|$|Corythosaurus is {{currently}} {{classified as a}} hadrosaurid, in the subfamily Lambeosaurinae. It is related to other hadrosaurs such as Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus and Olorotitan, {{with the exception of}} Olorotitan they all share similar looking <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> crests. However, research published in 2003 has suggested that even though it possesses a unique crest, Olorotitan is Corythosaurus closest known relative. Benson et al. (2012) found that Corythosaurus was closely related to Velafrons, Nipponosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus, and said that they formed a group of fan-crested lambeosaurines.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, <b>skulls,</b> <b>and</b> hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female <b>skulls,</b> <b>and</b> to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E

All specimens were collected from the Tambach-Sandstein Member, the uppermost part of the Tambach Formation, dating to the Artinskian stage of the Late Cisuralian Series (or alternatively upper Rotliegend), about 284-279.5 million years ago. They {{were found in the}} Bromacker Quarry, the middle part of the Thuringian Forest, near the small town of Tambach-Dietharz.|$|R

5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> {{abundant}} skeletal material, Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere. It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse <b>skulls,</b> <b>and</b> witch bottles in the {{structure}} of a building, but concealed shoes are by far the most common items discovered. Archaeologist Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences. Such hidden caches of objects are known by archaeologists as spiritual middens.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus is {{classified}} as a theropod in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. Other members include Tyrannosaurus and the earlier Daspletosaurus, both from North America, and possibly the Mongolian genus Alioramus. Animals in this subfamily are {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Albertosaurus and are known for their robust build with proportionally larger <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> longer femurs than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
25|$|The group <b>Skull</b> <b>and</b> Bones is {{featured}} in conspiracy theories, which {{claim that the}} society {{plays a role in}} a global conspiracy for world control. Theorists such as Alexandra Robbins suggest that <b>Skull</b> <b>and</b> Bones is a branch of the Illuminati, having been founded by German university alumni following the order's suppression in their native land by Karl Theodor, Elector of Bavaria with the support of Frederick the Great of Prussia, or that <b>Skull</b> <b>and</b> Bones itself controls the Central Intelligence Agency.|$|R

5|$|Tarbosaurus {{lived in}} a humid {{floodplain}} criss-crossed by river channels. In this environment, it was an apex predator {{at the top of}} the food chain, probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the hadrosaur Saurolophus or the sauropod Nemegtosaurus. Tarbosaurus is represented by dozens of fossil specimens, including several complete <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> skeletons. These remains have allowed scientific studies focusing on its phylogeny, skull mechanics, and brain structure.|$|E
5|$|The Naradiya Purana {{mentions}} that Ardhanarishvara is half-black and half-yellow, nude {{on one side}} and clothed on other, wearing <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> a garland of lotuses on the male half and female half respectively. The Linga Purana gives a brief description of Ardhanarishvara as making varada and abhaya mudras and holding a trishula and a lotus. The Vishnudharmottara Purana prescribes a four-armed form, with right hands holding a rosary and trishula, while the left ones bear a mirror and a lotus. The form is called Gaurishvara in this text.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there have}} been many {{underground}} organizations on the Colgate campus, the first secret honor society on record is the <b>Skull</b> <b>and</b> Scroll society founded in 1908. Members of the <b>Skull</b> <b>and</b> Scroll wore white hats with a black <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> scroll added to them. [...] The <b>Skull</b> <b>and</b> Scroll had a rich history of membership with important names in Colgate history such as Ellery Huntington, Melbourne Read, and Harold Whitnall. A rival organization, The Gorgon's Head, was founded in 1912 and had members that wore black hats with a golden emblem. The Gorgon's Head chose people for traits such as character, distinguished service, and achievement. These two organizations competed with each other until 1934 when they merged to create the Konosioni senior honor society.|$|R

5|$|The skull {{generally}} {{resembles that}} of the brown-tailed mongoose, but the rostrum (front part) is broad and deep, the nasal bones are broad and short, and {{the region of the}} palate is broad. The mandible (lower jaw) is robust and shows a high, steeply rising coronoid process (a projection {{at the back of the}} bone). Statistical analysis of measurements of the <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> teeth strongly separates S.durrelli from specimens of the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|Yates has {{cautioned that}} P. {{gracilis}} {{may be a}} metataxon, which {{means that there is}} neither evidence that the material assigned to it is monophyletic (belongs to one species), nor that it is paraphyletic (belongs to several species). This is the case because the holotype of P.(Sellosaurus) gracilis has no skull, and the other specimens consist of <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> material that overlaps too little with the holotype to make it certain that it belongs to the same taxon. It is therefore possible that the known material contains more species belonging to Plateosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Between 1926 and 1972, no Albertosaurus fossils {{were found}} at all; but, since the seventies, {{there has been a}} steady {{increase}} in the known material. Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more <b>skulls</b> <b>and</b> skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. However, due to vandalism and accidents, no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming, but these probably do not represent A. sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus Albertosaurus.|$|E
