60|$|Guesses at the undiscovered must {{necessarily}} be vague, but my anticipations {{fall into two}} groups, and first I am disposed to expect a great <b>systematic</b> <b>increment</b> in individual human power. We probably have no suspicion as yet {{of what may be}} done with the human body and mind by way of enhancing its effectiveness I remember talking to the late Sir Michael Foster upon the possibilities of modern surgery, and how he confessed that he did not dare for his reputation's sake tell ordinary people the things he believed would some day become matter-of-fact operations. In that respect I think he spoke for very many of his colleagues. It is already possible to remove almost any portion of the human body, including, if needful, large sections of the brain; it is possible to graft living flesh on living flesh, make new connections, mould, displace, and rearrange. It is also not impossible to provoke local hypertrophy, and not only by knife and physical treatment but by the subtler methods of hypnotism, profound changes can be wrought in the essential structure of a human being. If only our knowledge of function and value were at all adequate, we could correct and develop ourselves in the most extraordinary way. Our knowledge is not adequate, but it may not always remain inadequate.|$|E
40|$|Cable {{structures}} are often subjected to severe and variable environmental conditions, and their mechanical behavior {{is known to}} be particularly sensitive to different ambient factors. The paper analyzes temperature effects on the static and dynamic response of suspended inclined cables through a continuous monodimensional model including geometric nonlinearities. Uniform temperature changes are introduced through a nonhomogeneous constitutive law for the material linear elasticity. Exact and approximate solutions of the equations governing the cable static equilibrium under self-weight are achieved, and the significance of the temperature-dependent variation of tension and sag are parametrically investigated. The spectral properties characterizing the free dynamics are obtained in a closed-form fashion for shallow parabolic cables within the low frequency vibration range. The sensitivity of the linear frequencies to temperature changes is discussed, outlining two thermal effects, which are distinguished by their different origins, geometric or static. For a generic temperature change, the geometric effect produces a <b>systematic</b> <b>increment</b> or reduction of all the frequencies, for both symmetric and anti-symmetric modes. The static effect stiffens or softens only the symmetric modes, and may prevail over the competing geometric effect, depending on the cable Irvine parameter. Finally, the thermal effects on the frequency veering and modal hybridization phenomena, which characterize quasi-resonant shallow cubic cables, are analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of cyanate esters (CEs) versus competitor {{systems such as}} epoxies and polyimides, {{as well as the}} great reinforcing potential of organoclays properly dispersed into a polymeric matrix, have been examined in a series of poly-cyanurate (PCN) /montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposites prepared under appropriate polymerization conditions. The curing schedule applied resulted in gradual propagation of polymerization. Through this procedure, the intragallery curing rate becomes comparable to the extragallery one, allowing intercalation before gelation. Systems with clay loadings from 1 to 3 % per weight were synthesized, and their morphology and mechanical properties were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and tensile tests. Microscopy investigations revealed better dispersion for the 3 wt % system compared to smaller concentrations, in which aggregation and, in some cases, agglomeration were the conspicuous features. Roughness and area analyses revealed more homogeneous dispersion for this nanocomposite. Topology and 3 D-phase images further suggested considerable reduction of the average particle diameters. WAXS analysis showed that the interlayer spacing of nanocomposites was increased compared to pristine MMT, indicating the formation of intercalated structures. On the other hand, tensile strength and elongation at break values displayed abrupt diminution with MMT addition, while Young's modulus exhibited a slight but <b>systematic</b> <b>increment</b> with MMT content. The decreasing glass transition tendency observed for small clay loadings was reversed in the case of 3 wt %, while secondary transitions were practically unaffected by the presence of MMT.

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} {{the utility of the}} impact {{response}} surface (IRS) approach for investigating model ensemble crop yield responses under a large range of changes in climate. IRSs of spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) yields were constructed from a 26 -member ensemble of process-based crop simulation models for sites in Finland, Germany and Spain across a latitudinal transect in Europe. The sensitivity of modelled yield to <b>systematic</b> <b>increments</b> of changes in temperature (- 2 to + 9 °C) and precipitation (- 50 to + 50 %) was tested by modifying values of 1981 – 2010 baseline daily weather, with CO 2 concentration fixed at 360 ppm. The IRS approach offers an effective method of portraying model behaviour under changing climate as well as advantages for analysing, comparing and presenting results from multi-model ensemble simulations. Though individual model behaviour may depart markedly from the average, ensemble median responses across sites and crop varieties indicate that yields decline with higher temperatures and decreased precipitation and increase with higher precipitation. Across the uncertainty ranges defined for the IRSs, yields are more sensitive to temperature than precipitation changes at the Finnish site while sensitivities are mixed at the German and Spanish sites. Precipitation effects diminish under higher temperature changes. While the bivariate and multi-model characteristics of the analysis impose some limits to interpretation, the IRS approach nonetheless provides additional insights into sensitivities to inter-model and inter-annual variability. Taken together, these sensitivities may help to pinpoint processes such as heat stress, vernalisation or drought effects requiring refinement in future model development. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Single, 50 - and 100 -mg oral {{doses of}} {{phenobarbital}} and a matching placebo were administered double-blind to 8 young, healthy male subjects.  Multilead electroencephalographic (EEG) samples were recorded prior to, and {{at regular intervals}} within the 2 h following administration.  The EEG signal was processed by power spectral analysis; the drug plasma concentration was assessed concomitantly.  Plasma peaks after the 50 - and 100 -mg dose were, respectively, 3. 38 +/- 1. 29 and 4. 09 +/- 1. 24 micrograms/ml.  Despite the low drug plasma concentration, a <b>systematic</b> power <b>increment</b> of the EEG fast frequency spectral segments occurred at either dose on the anterior scalp areas from the 30 - or 60 -min postdrug control onward, and was preponderant on central electrodes; a significant correlation (Kendal's coefficient for ranked data) with the drug plasma concentration was observed limitedly to the anterior scalp areas.  No correlation with plasma levels was observed for unsystematic EEG variations...|$|R
40|$|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are {{a family}} of linear bio-polysaccharides, which are {{heterogeneously}} modified with negatively charged sulfate and carboxylate groups. They are located on every cell surface, extracellular matrix or intracellular space in the body. GAGs are composed of alternating units of an amino sugars (glucosamine or galactosamine) and hexuronic acid/hexose (iduronic acid, glucoronic acid/ or galactose), which are linked by glycosidic bonds with different geometries. In recent years, GAGs have attracted considerable interest. GAGs play vital roles in fundamental biological processes, such as hemostasis, angiogenesis, cell signaling, growth and differentiation. Thus, GAGs contribute {{to a number of}} diseases such as thrombosis, cancer, inflammation, osteoarthritis and degenerative diseases. One of the most studied GAGs is heparin, which is widely used as an anticoagulant and is also implicated in other biological processes. Despite its extensive clinical use, heparin continues to suffer from major problems, such as life threatening hemorrhagic complications and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. These activities originate from the large number of glycan sequences generated during its biosynthesis. Many different enzymes act in a non-template fashion to produce heparin chains with various chain lengths, sulfation and acetylation patterns. Their inherent heterogeneity, complexity and highly anionic nature have seriously limited the development of tools for rapid identification of sequences critical for many biological activities. A RPIP-UPLC MS protocol was developed to separate and characterize structures of heparin oligosaccharides prepared through enzymatic cleavage process and chemoenzymatic synthesis. In designing such protocol, several UPLC and MS parameters were considered. An efficient separation of each oligosaccharide mixture was achieved with different ion-pairing reagents. Yet, the structural elucidation of the multiple chromatographic peaks was hindered by the heterogeneity inherent in these mixtures even with supposedly defined standards. In order to elucidate the structures of these complex molecules, we utilized a strategy, which exploits the ease with which sulfate groups can be fragmented during MS ionization. A <b>systematic</b> <b>increment</b> of the MS cone voltage was employed starting from a minimum dissociation voltage, where the intact molecule is preserved, to a high enough dissociation voltage, where the only core oligosaccharide backbone was retained. This allowed identifying the number of sulfate groups and the core structures. However, positions of substituents were difficult to pinpoint because of the phenomenal number of possibilities. Such analysis would require tandem MS/MS–based approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of Task 3. 2 was to {{introduce}} the role of local geology in the seismic hazard evaluation at national scale. This was achieved by grouping the geological formation of the 1 : 500, 000 Italian geological map into three classes A, B, C according to the EuroCode 8 provisions (GCM, Geological-Class Map). These classes are associated to {{a variation of the}} ground motion due to the different seismic properties of the lithologies included in each group (ANNEX 1). For a critical evaluation of the proposed approach, we have checked the occurrence of a <b>systematic</b> <b>increment</b> of macroseismic intensity {{as a function of the}} geological classes at a national scale. The study of distribution of Intensity anomalies associated to the 3 classes show a statistical significant tendency of positive anomalies to be related to classes B and C and negative anomalies to be related to class A (ANNEX 2). We then assumed that the effect of local geology on ground motion is the one described by variation of elastic response spectra prescribed by EC 8 (in terms of PGA, PSA, Housner Intensity). This variation is controlled by a set of parameters depending on the soil classes and earthquake magnitude (ANNEX 3). We compared the increment factors to those deriving from a numerical simulation of the Città di Castello (Central Italy) basin where many geological and seismological data were available. The results at local scale show a good fit (within a factor of two) with the variations of hazard parameters for classes B e C (ANNEX 4). Moreover, we launched a national-scale enquiry over the 8101 Italian Municipalities whose main goal was the estimation of the buildings distribution on the three soil classes corresponding to those of the CGM. We collected and organized the received forms in a database (see product 3). The comparison at a Municipality-scale of the GCM and the questionnaire results shows that their information is complementary, the first referring this percentage to the housing, the latter considering all the municipality territory (ANNEX 5). The questionnaire is a good data gathering tool for pointing out area where more detailed microzonation investigation must be performed. The questionnaire can be a powerful tool to increase awareness of Municipality Administration and the lack of involvement could be overcome by coordination at the Region levels. Products 1.

40|$|AbstractUsing the probed-sinewave paradigm, {{we explore}} the {{differences}} between increment and decrement probes {{across a range of}} frequencies (approx. 1 – 19 Hz). In this paradigm, detection threshold is measured for a small test probe presented on a large sinusoidally flickering background (at eight different phases). Probe thresholds are very similar for increment and decrement probes, but there is a very small (and <b>systematic)</b> difference: <b>increment</b> thresholds are usually slightly higher relative to decrement thresholds during the part of the cycle when the background's intensity is increasing. Although Wilson's (1997, Vis. Neuro., 14, 403 – 423) model substantially underestimates the size of this difference, it predicts some phase dependency. However, the existence of On- and Off-pathways in Wilson's model is not important for these predictions. A recent model by Snippe, Poot, and van Hateren (2000, Vis. Neuro., 17, 449 – 462) may be able to predict this result by using explicit contrast-gain control rather than separate On- and Off-pathways. Auxiliary experiments measuring the perceived polarity of the probe provide a further argument suggesting that separate On- and Off-pathways are not useful in explaining increment and decrement probe thresholds...|$|R
