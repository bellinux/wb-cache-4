The distinguishing features of mmWave communications such as directional beamforming and having different path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are incorporated in the average error probability analysis. First, average pairwise error probability (APEP) expression is obtained by averaging pairwise error probability (PEP) over fading and random shortest distance from mobile user (MU) to its serving BS. Subsequently, average symbol error probability is approximated from APEP using the nearest neighbor (NN) approximation.

Based on 29 stations near in Seoul, we estimated grid precipitation by station densities, grid sizes using daily precipitation data of KMA's AWS and Automatic Synoptic Observation System (ASOS) during 2001 - 2010.

Therefore, content caching on different network elements has been proposed as a mean of offloading he backhaul by caching strategic contents at the network edge, thereby reducing latency. In this paper, we investigate cache-enabled small cells in which we model and characterize the outage probability, defined as the probability of not satisfying users requests over a given coverage area. We analytically derive a closed form expression of the outage probability as a function of signal-to-interference ratio, cache size, small cell base <b>station</b> <b>density</b> and threshold distance. By assuming the distribution of base stations as a Poisson point process, we derive the probability of finding a specific content within a threshold distance and the optimal small cell base <b>station</b> <b>density</b> that achieves a given target cache hit probability.

These three elements are strongly correlated: the higher the altitude, the more uncertain the altitudinal relation between altitude and precipitation (low <b>stations</b> <b>density)</b> and the more important the underestimation of the precipitation (high quantity of snow). In mountainous regions, the low density of the precipitation gauging network often causes numerous problems(Barry 1992). Among others, Fortin, Therrien et al.

Gridded precipitation station analyses are valuable observational data sources {{with a wide variety}} of applications, including model validation. The representativeness errors associated with two gridding methods are presented, consistent with either a point or areal average interpretation of model output, and it is shown that they differ significantly (up to 30 %). An experiment is conducted to determine the errors associated with <b>station</b> <b>density,</b> through repeated gridding of station data within the United States using subsequently fewer stations. Two distinct error responses to reduced <b>station</b> <b>density</b> are found, which are attributed to differences in the spatial homogeneity of precipitation distributions. The error responses characterize the eastern and western United States, which are respectively more and less homogeneous. As the <b>station</b> <b>density</b> decreases, the influence of stations farther from the analysis point increases, and therefore, if the distributions are inhomogeneous in space, the analysis point is influenced by stations with very different precipitation distributions. Finally, ranges of potential percent representativeness errors of the median and extreme precipitation across the United States are created for high-resolution (0. 25 °) and low-resolution areal averaged (0. 9 ° lat × 1. 25 ° lon) precipitation fields. For example, the range of the representativeness errors is estimated, for annual extreme precipitation, to be from + 16 % to − 12 % in the low-resolution data, when <b>station</b> <b>density</b> is 5 stations per 0. 9 ° lat × 1. 25 ° lon grid box...|$|E

In particular, optimal assignments for special topologies and heuristics for general topologies are proposed. The schemes show better average results with respect to existing alternatives. Furthermore, the gaps between the upper bound given by the heuristic solution, the lower bound obtained from the maximum-clique problem, and the optimal solution obtained by branch & bound are investigated in the different settings. A scaling law is then proposed to explain the relations between the number of codes needed in Euclidean networks with different <b>station</b> <b>densities</b> and connection distances.

Backed by an analytical stochastic geometry-based model, we study the coverage, the Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE) and the energy efficiency of UDNs with LOS/NLOS propagation. We show that when LOS/NLOS propagation components are accounted for, the network suffers from low coverage and the ASE gain is lower than linear at high base <b>station</b> <b>densities.</b> However, this performance drop can partially be attenuated by means of frequency reuse, which is shown to improve the ASE vs coverage trade-off of cell densification, provided {{that we have a}} degree of freedom on the density of cells. In addition, from an energy efficiency standpoint, cell densification is shown to be inefficient when both LOS and NLOS components are taken into account. Overall, based on the findings of our work that assumes a more advanced system model compared to the current state-of-the-art, we claim that highly crowded environments of users represent the worst case scenario for ultra-dense networks.
