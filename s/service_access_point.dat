It is common to think of SAP only in terms of its use at Layer 2, specifically in its Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-layer as defined in the IEEE 802.2 standards. Link <b>Service</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Point</b> (LSAP) includes both Destination <b>Service</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Point</b> (DSAP) and Source <b>Service</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Point</b> (SSAP).

50|$|In the OSI model, {{communicating}} {{systems are}} assumed to be connected by an underlying physical medium providing a basic (and unspecified) transmission mechanism. The layers above it are numbered (from one to seven); the nth layer is referred to as (n)-layer. Each layer provides service to the layer above it (or at the top to the application process) using the services of the layer immediately below it. The layers communicate with each other by means of an interface, called a <b>service</b> <b>access</b> <b>point.</b> Corresponding layers at each system are called peer entities. To communicate, two peer entities at a given layer use an (n)-protocol, which is implemented by using services of the (n-1)-layer. When systems are not directly connected, intermediate peer entities (called relays) are used. An address uniquely identifies a <b>service</b> <b>access</b> <b>point.</b> The address naming domains need not be restricted to one layer, so it is possible to use just one naming domain for all layers.For each layer {{there are two types of}} standards: protocol standards defining how peer entities at a given layer communicate, and service standards defining how a given layer communicates with the layer above it.|$|E

50|$|A last {{powerful}} {{concept of}} ROOM is layering. This notion {{refers to the}} vertical layers of a software system consisting of services and their clients. ROOM introduces the notions of <b>service</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> (SAP) for the client side and service provision point (SPP) for the server side. From {{the point of view}} of an actor implementation the SAPs and SPPs work like ports. Like ports they are associated with a protocol. But other than ports they don't have to (and even cannot) be bound explicitly.Rather, an actor is bound to a concrete service by a layer connection and this binding of a service is propagated recursively to all sub actors of this actor.This concept is very similar to dependency injection.|$|E

50|$|The SAP is a {{conceptual}} location at which one OSI layer can request {{the services of}} another OSI layer. As an example, PD-SAP or PLME-SAP in IEEE 802.15.4 can be mentioned, where the Media Access Control (MAC) layer requests certain services from the Physical Layer. <b>Service</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> are also used in IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control in Ethernet and similar Data Link Layer protocols.|$|R
50|$|Standard Network layer {{protocols}} {{have been}} assigned reserved LLC addresses, as recorded in ISO/IEC TR 11802-1. One half of the LLC address space is reserved for such assignment. Other protocols are accommodated in two ways. One way is by local assignment of LSAPs, for which {{the other half of}} the LLC address space is available.The second way is through the use of a particular reserved LLC address value that has been assigned for use in conjunction with the Sub-network Access Protocol (SNAP) which is called SNAP address. The SNAP address identifies, at each MAC SAP, a single LSAP. Thus, each protocol using SNAP must employ a protocol identifier. Thus, the Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) is a mechanism for multiplexing, on networks using IEEE 802.2 LLC, more protocols than can be distinguished by the 8-bit 802.2 <b>Service</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Point</b> (SAP) fields. SNAP supports identifying protocols by Ethernet type field values; it also supports vendor-private protocol identifier spaces. It is used with IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.4, IEEE 802.5, IEEE 802.11 and other IEEE 802 physical network layers, as well as with non-IEEE 802 physical network layers such as FDDI that use 802.2 LLC.|$|E
50|$|Both SPBV and SPBM {{inherit the}} rapid {{convergence}} of a link state control plane. A special attribute of SPBM {{is its ability}} to rebuild multicast trees in a similar time to unicast convergence, because it substitutes computation for signaling. When an SPBM bridge has performed the computations on a topology database, it knows whether it is on the shortest path between a root and one or more leaves of the SPT and can install state accordingly. Convergence is not gated by incremental discovery of a bridge’s place on a multicast tree by the use of separate signaling transactions. However, SPBM on a node does not operate completely independently of its peers, and enforces agreement on the current network topology with its peers. This very efficient mechanism uses exchange of a single digest of link state covering the entire network view, and does not need agreement on each path to each root individually. The result is that the volume of messaging exchanged to converge the network is in proportion to the incremental change in topology and not the number of multicast trees in the network. A simple link event that may change many trees is communicated by signaling the link event only; the consequent tree construction is performed by local computation at each node. The addition of a single <b>service</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> to a service instance involves only the announcement of the I-SID, regardless of the number of trees. Similarly the removal of a bridge, which might involve the rebuilding of hundreds to thousands of trees, is signaled only with a few link state updates.|$|E

40|$|Financial {{inclusion}} assures easy <b>access</b> {{to financial}} <b>services</b> by enabling the disadvantaged and vulnerable {{sections of the}} society to actively contribute to development and protect themselves against socio-economic shocks. Nigeria has a sizeable rural poor population with limited access to conventional financial institutions or services. This study investigated the impact of financial inclusion on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) performance in Nigeria. The survey research design method was used, involving the use of questionnaires, in collecting data from respondents. Data were analyzed using the Pearson Chi-square technique. The results show that, whereas financial inclusion positively and significantly impacts the operations and growth of MSMEs, distance to financial <b>services</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> and infrastructural deficiency challenged fast and effective <b>access</b> to financial <b>services</b> by MSMEs in Nigeria.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{customer}} relationship management is premised on fostering lasting relationships {{in order to provide}} improved services to customers. Electronic service delivery has {{become a way of life}} to many whilst others are excluded as a result of what is referred to as the digital divide. As technologies evolve they are assimilated into the workplace. Whilst private companies have adopted many technologies to improve services to clients, governments have realised their importance and are increasingly adopting them to enhance service delivery. Many cumbersome public administrative strategies have been translated into electronic format. E-administration, of which {{customer relationship management}} forms an integral part, is an effort by Government to manage and improve the relationship with the citizen as client. Whilst the paper is premised on the case of the Government Employees Pension Fund of South Africa, the principle of e-administration is common for across Government departments. E-administration is typified by various <b>service</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> for clients.
