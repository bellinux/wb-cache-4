40|$|This paper proposes and evaluates {{different}} protocols {{for individual}} peers to <b>self-configure</b> the P 2 P overlay networks in various network environments. For smallscale homogeneous networks, an optimizer peer selection protocol is proposed {{and found to}} be superior to other peer selection protocols, including random, egoist, altruist and greedy protocols, in terms of network diameter and node eccentricity. For large-scale heterogeneous P 2 P systems, peer-power based peer selection protocols are proposed to <b>self-configure</b> semi-structured overlay networks for heterogeneous P 2 P systems. An index-based query mechanism is also proposed for peers to search documents in the P 2 P network. Performance studies demonstrate that the proposed self-configuration protocols and search scheme are efficient and viable, and the <b>self-configured</b> P 2 P network has a significantly lower query cost than traditional Gnutella-like P 2 P systems. In addition, a caching-assisted query mechanism is proposed to exploit the surplus storage power of the peers, improving further the query efficiency. Caching-assisted query permits a quicker response to subsequent queries for popular data without incurring the excessive overhead of globally replicated directory information...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — My paper {{presents}} a <b>self-configured</b> secure protocol for wireless ad hoc networks which uses an hybrid symmetric/asymmetric scheme. My proposal {{is a complete}} <b>self-configured</b> secure protocol that is able to create the network within the region and share secure services. The protocol consists of several functions to create network and to share the among the users in the network. The management of network will {{be done in a}} secure way that provides the trust between users. In these days Ad hoc networks plays main role in the sharing of data with limited resources. The network will be created spontaneously for the completion of particular task that includes data sharing in a secure environment. The protocol will provide the secure environment for the users in the network. After completion of the task, all users will be disconnected from the network. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{field of}} {{ubiquitous}} robotics is burgeoning, and different brands of massively distributed heterogeneous robotic systems are being proposed {{and applied to}} several domains. The strong added value of these systems comes from their potential ability to dynamically <b>self-configure,</b> by changing the form of their cooperation {{to adapt to a}} given task or situation. In face of this, no satisfactory solution exists to the problem of how such a system should <b>self-configure.</b> In this paper, we explore a reactive approach to self-configuration inspired by ideas from the field of semantic web services. We illustrate our approach on a specific type of ubiquitous robot system, called a PEIS Ecology. We show experiments in which our approach autonomously generates a configuration to perform a cooperative navigation task, and dynamically changes this configuration when one of the components fails.

50|$|Renumbering an {{existing}} network {{for a new}} connectivity provider with different routing prefixes is a major effort with IPv4. With IPv6, however, changing the prefix announced by a few routers can in principle renumber an entire network, since the host identifiers (the least-significant 64 bits of an address) can be independently <b>self-configured</b> by a host.|$|R
50|$|One key {{differentiation}} for AppleTalk was {{it contained}} two protocols aimed at making the system completely <b>self-configuring.</b> The AppleTalk {{address resolution protocol}} (AARP) allowed AppleTalk hosts to automatically generate their own network addresses, and the Name Binding Protocol (NBP) was a dynamic system for mapping network addresses to user-readable names. Although systems similar to AARP existed in other systems, Banyan VINES for instance, nothing like NBP has existed until recently.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive Wireless Path Protocol (AWPP) is a Cisco's {{proprietary}} protocol for wireless mesh networks. It dynamicallydiscovers neighboring radios and calculates {{the quality of}} all possible paths to a wired network. An optimal path is established through a mesh of wireless nodes to a wired gateway and these calculations are continuously updated, allowing paths to change and optimize as traffic patterns on wireless links change. Furthermore, a <b>self-configuring</b> and self-healing wireless mesh backhaul is created.|$|E
50|$|Nodes can be added, removed {{or may be}} {{physically}} moving without the need to reconfigure the network. The GOSSIP protocol is a <b>self-configuring</b> network solution. The network may even be heterogeneous, where several types of nodes communicate different pieces of information with {{each other at the}} same time. This is possible {{due to the fact that}} no interpretation of the message content is required in order to be able to forward it to other nodes.|$|E

30|$|The channel adaptation, called chAdapt, {{consists}} of a hardware module that <b>self-configures</b> the transmission according to the platform characteristics.
