30|$|Many {{studies that}} have {{attempted}} to relate biological traits to invasiveness have explained little of the variation and have neglected trait interactions. Including interactions among traits (i.e. explicitly considering that one trait value might have a different influence on invasion success {{in the presence of}} other traits) can result in much better explanatory models. Küster et al. [88] found that trait interactions accounted for > 40 % of the variation that could explain invasion success of non-native terrestrial plants in Germany. Interestingly, long flowering season was beneficial for <b>self-pollinated</b> <b>species,</b> but was disadvantageous for wind pollinated species, and had no effect on insect-pollinated species. Furthermore, the effect of timing {{of the end of the}} flowering season on invasion success differed among plant species with different vegetative reproduction strategies or different levels of ploidy (number of chromosome sets in the cell). Thompson and Davis [89], however, argue that such analyses tell us very little because successful invaders do not differ in their traits from those of widespread native plant species. Despite this critique, incorporating statistical interactions among traits should increase our knowledge of characteristics that make a species likely to expand or contract its range, whether non-native or native.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Concerns {{regarding}} {{the most effective}} means of evaluating segregating generations of spring barley prompted this investigation. Three methods of selection were considered: bulk, pedigree, and single seed descent. F₆ lines derived by each method were grown in a replicated yield trial. The effectiveness of each method was measured in terms of grain yield and four other agronomic traits. Continuity of method performance was evaluated across three spring barley populations. Parents used in developing these populations were chosen on the basis"of their diverse genetic backgrounds. Experimental populations differed for all agronomic traits measured. Differences between methods of selection were only found for 100 kernel weight, with lines from the single seed descent method being superior. The pedigree method was least effective for this trait. No significant differences between selection methods were found for plant height, spikes per meter, kernels per spike or grain yield. Significant differences were found between individual lines within methods and crosses for all traits except spikes per meter. There was no conclusive superiority of lines derived by any given method for any of the five traits. Although the single seed descent method was not significantly different from the pedigree and bulk methods on a mean basis, it did derive a number of superior individual lines and preserved substantial between-line variability for all traits measured, except spikes per meter. Because of the overall efficiency achieved with the single seed descent method, it may be a useful tool for the breeder of <b>self-pollinated</b> <b>species...</b>|$|E

This selection method was simulated in QuCim to investigate the effects of deviations from the additive genetic model, in the form of dominance and epistasis, on selection outcomes. The simulation results indicate that the partial dominance model does not greatly influence genetic advance compared with the pure additive model. Genetic advance in genetic systems with overdominance and epistasis are slower than when gene effects are purely additive or partially dominant. The additive gene effect is an appropriate indicator of the change in gene frequency following selection when epistasis is absent. In the absence of epistasis, the additive variance decreases rapidly with selection. However, after several cycles of selection it remains relatively fixed when epistasis is present. The variance from partial dominance is relatively small and therefore hard to detect by the covariance among half sibs and the covariance among full sibs. The dominance variance from the overdominance model can be identified successfully, but it does not change significantly, which confirms that overdominance cannot be utilized by an inbred breeding program.

Genetic diversity of the species was investigated using six allozyme systems. Allelic frequencies were scored representing eight polymorphic and five monomorphic loci. Coefficient of gene differentiation (Gst) was 0. 3019, which indicated great genetic differentiation. The number of alleles per locus was 2. 6154, the percentage of polymorphic loci was 61. 54, and the expected heterozygosity was 0. 2462 in all populations. Genetic diversity in A. maroccana was high in comparison to <b>self-pollinated</b> <b>species.</b> In total, nine heterozygotes resulting from outcrossing {{were found in the}} progeny from M 1, M 3, M 4, M 22 and M 26. The population of M 7 had peculiar alleles Pgd? 2 SS and Pgd- 1 SS in high frequency. M 9 had the lowest level of diversity out of the 11 populations. Geographic and genetic distances between all the populations were not significantly correlated with each other (r = 0. 0996).

Importantly, tedera demonstrated broad adaptation to diverse soils, and some accessions have shown moderate levels of tolerance to waterlogging and salinity. Tedera exhibits minimal leaf shedding during summer and autumn. Economic modelling strongly suggests that giving livestock access to green tedera in summer and autumn will dramatically increase farm profit by reducing supplementary feeding. The breeding program (2006 – 12) evaluated the available genetic diversity of tedera for its field performance in seven nurseries with 6498 spaced plants in total covering a wide variation in rainfall, soils and seasons. Best overall plants were selected using a multivariate selection index generated with best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) of dry matter cuts and leaf retention traits. The breeding program also evaluated tedera for grazing tolerance, grazing preference by livestock, waterlogging tolerance, seed production, cold tolerance, disease susceptibility and presence of secondary compounds. Tedera is a diploid, <b>self-pollinated</b> <b>species.</b> Therefore, 28 elite parents were hand-crossed in several combinations to combine outstanding attributes of parents; F 1 hybrids were confirmed with the aid of highly polymorphic, simple sequence repeat markers.

Recently, sorghum has received attention as a bioenergy crop {{because of its}} high water use efficiency, yield biomass potential and biomass composition. To develop superior sorghum inbred lines for bioenergy production, it would be beneficial to understand the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture traits. Sorghum presents a remarkable diversity in the species bicolor that can be exploited to identify new genes associated with those traits of interest. Brassinosteroids (BR) are steroid hormones that control different aspects of plant growth and development. Brassinosteroid biosynthesis and signaling pathways have been studied in model species such as Arabidopsis, rice and maize, but not in sorghum. In this study, candidate gene association mapping and a diverse sorghum collection of 315 accessions {{were used to assess}} marker-trait associations between BR biosynthesis and signaling genes and eight plant architecture traits. Phenotypic data for plant height, leaf angle, stem circumference, panicle exertion, panicle length, number of tillers, number of internodes and flowering time was collected in three locations in Iowa in 2010 and 2012. Using 702 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), population structure was determined as five subpopulations that corresponded to three major races Caudatum, Durra and Kafir and the two intermediate races Guinea/bicolor and Guinea Caudatum (west Africa). Coefficient of co-ancestry was also estimated to account for the degree of ancestor relatedness. A total of 82 SNPs markers out of 263 SNPs present in 19 BR candidate genes were significantly associated with seven phenotypes of interest, confirming the genetic complexity of the traits. Nineteen markers were found associated with more than one phenotype, showing possible pleiotropic effects of BR candidate genes on plant architecture phenotypes. Differences in one or few genes are expected to have an effect on more than one trait. Moreover, the effects of associated markers over phenotypes were consistent with phenotypic correlations, which provide more support to our findings. This study constitutes the first association analysis for plant architecture traits with BR in sorghum.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyGenetics Interdepartmental Program-Plant PathologyJames NelsonThe goal of quantitative-trait locus (QTL) mapping is to {{understand}} the genetic architecture of an organism by identifying the genes underlying quantitative traits. It targets gene numbers and locations, interaction with other genes and environments, and the sizes of gene effects on the traits. QTL mapping in plants is often done on a population of progeny derived from one or more designed, or controlled, crosses. These crosses are designed to exploit correlation among marker genotypes {{for the purposes of}} mapping QTL. Reducing correlations between markers can improve the precision of location and effect estimates by reducing multicollinearity. The purpose of this thesis is to propose an approach for developing experimental populations to reduce correlation by increasing recombination between markers in QTL mapping populations especially in selfing species. QTL mapping resolution of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) is limited by the amount of recombination RILs experience during development. Intercrossing during line development can be used to counter this disadvantage, but requires additional generations and is difficult in <b>self-pollinated</b> <b>species.</b> In this thesis I propose a way of improving mapping resolution through recombination enrichment. This method is based on genotyping at each generation and advancing lines selected for high recombination and/or low heterozygosity. These lines developed are called SA-RILs (selectively advanced recombinant inbred lines). In simulations, the method yields lines that represent up to twice as many recombination events as RILs developed conventionally by selfing without selection, or the same amount but in three generations, without reduction in homozygosity. Compared to methods that require maintaining a large population for several generations and selecting lines only from the finished population, the method proposed here achieves up to 25 % more recombination. Although SA-RILs accumulate more recombination than conventional RILs and can be used as fine-mapping populations for selfing species, the effectiveness of the SA-RIL approach decreases with genome size and is most valuable only when applied either to small genomes or to defined regions of large genomes. Here I propose the development of QTL-focused SA-RILs (QSA-RILs), which are SA-RILs enriched for recombination in regions of a large genome selected for evidence for the presence of a QTL. This evidence can be derived from QTL analysis in a subset of the population at the F 2 generation and/or from previous studies. In simulations QSA-RILs afford up to threefold increase in recombination and twofold increase in accuracy of QTL position estimate in comparison with RILs. The regional-selection method also shows potential for resolving QTL linked in repulsion. One of the recent Bayesian methods for QTL mapping, the shrinkage Bayesian method (BayesA (Xu)), has been successfully used for estimating marker effects in the QTL mapping populations. Although the implementation of the BayesA (Xu) method for estimating main effects was described by the author, the equations for the posterior mean and variance, used in estimation of the effects, were not elaborated. Here I derive the equations used for the estimation of main effects for doubled-haploid and F 2 populations. I then extend these equations to estimate interaction effects in doubled-haploid populations. These derivations are helpful for an understanding of the intermediate steps leading to the equations described in the original paper introducing the shrinkage Bayesian method...|$|E

Assim, este trabalho teve por objetivo verificar a possibilidade de se reunir em uma mesma planta de soja genes para alta produtividade de óleo e para tolerância a PVR. O sistema genético compreendeu um dialelo parcial 7 x 7, envolvendo sete genitores com alta produtividade de óleo e sete genitores tolerantes a PVR. A maioria dos genitores compreendeu linhagens experimentais desenvolvidas no Setor de Genética Aplicada às Espécies Autógamas (ESALQ/USP). Os experimentos envolveram as plantas F 2, na safra 2008 / 2009 e progênies F 2 : 3, na safra 2009 / 2010, para avaliação de caracteres agronômicos, do teor de óleo e produtividade de óleo em campo experimental; já a avaliação da reação a PVR foi realizada em progênies F 2 : 4, em casa de vegetação com inoculação {{artificial}} do patógeno, por meio de uma escala de notas para a severidade dos sintomas radiculares. Além disso, por meio de marcadores microssatélites fez-se um estudo de genética de associação entre os marcadores e os caracteres reação a PVR e teor de óleo em três populações. Os resultados evidenciaram a existência de variabilidade nos genitores e nas progênies para todos os caracteres avaliados.

Moreover, the sudden death syndrome (SDS) in soybean, caused by the fungus Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, has become a worrying disease for soybean producers, technicians and researchers, and the adoption of an integrated control system using tolerant cultivars as an essential component has been a recommended strategy. This work aimed to verify the possibility of gathering genes for high oil yield and tolerance to SDS in the same soybean plant. The genetic system comprised a partial diallel 7 x 7 involving seven parents with high oil yield and seven parents tolerant to SDS. Most of the parents were experimental lines developed at the Sector of Genetics Applied to <b>Self-Pollinated</b> <b>Species</b> (ESALQ/USP). The 2008 / 2009 trials involved the F 2 plants, and the 2009 / 2010 trials involved the evaluation of F 2 : 3 progenies traits, such as agronomic characters, oil content and oil yield in the experimental field; whereas {{the analysis of the}} SDS reaction was tested in F 2 : 4 progenies, in a greenhouse with artificial inoculation of the pathogen through a rating scale for severity of radicular symptoms. Moreover, a study of genetic association among microsatellite markers and the characters reaction to SDS and oil content in three populations was performed. The results showed the existence of variability in parents and progenies for all characters. The parent who had the highest general combining ability and average oil content was the cultivar A 7002; on the other hand, the lowest values were found in PI 520733 and IAC 100. The crosses that originated the best oil content progenies have involved the parent A 7002, except when it was crossed with IAC 100. Ten crosses (USP 70004 with USP 14 - 10 - 38, USP 14 - 01 - 20, USP 14 - 13 - 16 and M-Soy 8001; USP 14 - 10 - 38 with USP 70057 and USP 70080; M-Soy 8001 with USP 70006, USP 70080 and USP 70123; USP 14 - 01 - 20 x USP 70006) distinguished from the others by originating the majority of their progenies with the best features in all traits, in other words, showed early and semi-early maturity, medium height, upright plants, good or average agronomic value, high grain and oil yield, high oil content and tolerance to SDS. None of the crosses originated the majority of their progeny with the worst characteristics in all traits. Oil content showed low genetic correlation with plant height at maturity, lodging, agronomic value, yield and reaction to SDS. SDS showed a low genetic correlation with lodging, grain yield, oil content, oil yield. However, it was possible to obtain progenies with high grain and oil yield and tolerance to SDS.

Buxus hyrcana is an ambophilous (i.e. pollinated by wind and insects) species and is an outcrosser that shows partial self-compatibility based on studies of flowering and pollination biology (Von Balthazar and Endress 2002).

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{allozyme}} variation in cultivar-groups of cowpea (#Vigna unguiculata$ (L.) Walp.) was undertaken by examining 21 enzyme systems encoded by 36 loci in 271 accessions representing the five cultivar-groups. Very {{low levels of}} variation were found within accessions, which is typical of <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>species.</b> Little variation was also found among accessions. Compared with other legume crops, #V. unguiculata$ is depauperate in allozyme variation. We found an average of 1. 61 alleles per locus with 42 % of the loci polymorphic and a total heterozygosity of 0. 061. Of the variation present, 90 % was found within cultivar-groups, while 10 % was among cultivar-groups. Data analyses revealed continuous variation among cultivar-groups and geographic regions with the accessions failing to segregate into discrete morphophysiological or geographic clusters. However, evolved cultivar-groups (cv. -gr. #Melanophthalmus$ and cv. -gr. #Sesquipedalis$) appear to be less diverse than their putative primitive cultivar-group progenitors. Due to lack of availability of critical material, no clear center of origin can be established. However, the data presented suggest that Northeast Africa could be a possible center of domestication.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} how informative a set of microsatellites from tomato is across the genus Lycopersicon, 17 microsatellite loci, derived from regions in and around genes, were tested on 31 accessions comprising the nine species of the genus. The microsatellite polymorphisms were used to estimate the distribution of diversity throughout the genus and to evaluate the efficacy of microsatellites for establishing species relationships in comparison with existing phylogeny reconstructions. Gene diversity and genetic distances were calculated. A high level of polymorphism was found, {{as well as a}} large number of alleles unique for species. The level of polymorphism detected with the microsatellite loci within and among species was highly correlated with the respective mating systems, cross-pollinating species having a significantly higher gene diversity compared to <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>species.</b> In general, microsatellite-based trees were consistent with a published RFLP-based dendrogram as well as with a published classification based on morphology and the mating system. A tree constructed with low-polymorphic loci (gene diversity < 0. 245) was shown to represent a more-reliable topology than a tree constructed with more-highly polymorphic loci...|$|R

40|$|Mode of {{reproduction}} was studied in 15 species of Adesmia DC. (Leguminosae). In six species, three treatments were used: mutual pollination, mechanical stimulation and control. Fifty-four plants of these six species were grown in a greenhouse, individually isolated in nylon screen boxes. Flowers were labelled and {{submitted to the}} different treatments. In addition, the frequency of spontaneous self-pollination {{in the absence of}} pollinators was studied in 200 plants of nine other species. These 200 plants were kept in a greenhouse, which avoided contact with any possible pollinator. Adesmia bicolor, A. muricata, A. punctata and A. riograndensis produced seed both by cross- and self-pollination. Adesmia punctata and A. riograndensis need mechanical stimulation for self-pollination. Adesmia incana reproduced by self-pollination; however, the possibility of cross-pollination cannot be totally ruled out. Adesmia tristis reproduced mainly by cross-pollination and a mechanism of self-incompatibility is suggested. Among the nine species that were not exposed to pollinators, A. securigerifolia produced a large amount of seed, indicating that it is a <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>species.</b> Adesmia arillata, A. araujoi, A. ciliata, A. psoraleoides, A. rocinhensis, A. reitziana, A. sulina and A. vallsii did not produce any seed under the experimental conditions, suggesting that they are cross-pollinated or that they need mechanical stimulation to reproduce...|$|R

[...] The wild {{ancestor}} of domesticated barley, Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum, is abundant in grasslands and woodlands throughout the Fertile Crescent area of Western Asia and northeast Africa, and is abundant in disturbed habitats, roadsides and orchards. Outside this region, the wild barley is less common and is usually found in disturbed habitats. However, in a study of genome-wide diversity markers, Tibet was found to be an additional center of domestication of cultivated barley.|$|R

40|$|The {{styles of}} flowers may {{represent}} an arena for pollen {{competition in the}} race to fertilize ovules. Accordingly, selection should favour a longer 'race' to better discriminate among variable pollen by increasing style length. Sampling across a taxonomically diverse range of wild and outcrossed species, we found that the distribution of style lengths within plants were skewed towards longer styles, as predicted. In <b>self-pollinated</b> domesticated <b>species,</b> where discrimination among pollen is less important, we found no such pattern. We conclude that style length is under directional selection towards longer styles as a mechanism for mate choice among pollen of variable quality...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a terrific}} book [1] about why human {{civilisation}} started earlier and made more rapid progress in some places on the Earth than others. Why were the 'fertile crescent' around ancient Mesopotamia, or parts of China, favoured over south America, or Australia, or Europe? One answer is grass. The world's 56 heaviest-seeded wild grass species (excluding bamboos) have grain weights of 10 to over 40 mg, about 10 {{times higher than the}} median for all world's grass species. These 56 comprise {{less than one percent of}} all grass species. And look at where they are found (Table 1). Almost two-thirds are found in the fertile cres-cent and the Mediterranean shores of Europe and north Africa. Australia has only two. Many fertile crescent grass <b>species</b> are hermaphrodite <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>species,</b> which means they grow easily and reproducibly without sowing seeds. Projections of what would have been available in the ancient grasslands of Mesopotamia, without any form of agriculture are aston-ishing. Yields of up to 1 tonne of seeds per hectare would not be exceptional even 10, 000 years ago. To put that into perspective, grain yields from the most in-tensively farmed and most fertile fields of England in a good year would be about 8 tonnes per hectare. Organic farming without intensive use of chemicals and fertilizers would reduce that to 4 tonnes per hectare. Ten thousand years of technological progress has improved nature's bounty by just four to eight times...|$|R
40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), {{one of the}} world's most {{important}} food crops, is a strictly autogamous (<b>self-pollinating)</b> <b>species</b> with exclusively perfect flowers. Male sterility induced by chemical hybridizing agents has increasingly attracted attention {{as a tool for}} hybrid seed production in wheat; however, the molecular mechanisms of male sterility induced by the agent SQ- 1 remain poorly understood due to limited whole transcriptome data. Therefore, a comparative analysis of wheat anther transcriptomes for male fertile wheat and SQ- 1 -induced male sterile wheat was carried out using next-generation sequencing technology. In all, 42, 634, 123 sequence reads were generated and were assembled into 82, 356 high-quality unigenes with an average length of 724 bp. Of these, 1, 088 unigenes were significantly differentially expressed in the fertile and sterile wheat anthers, including 643 up-regulated unigenes and 445 down-regulated unigenes. The differentially expressed unigenes with functional annotations were mapped onto 60 pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. They were mainly involved in coding for the components of ribosomes, photosynthesis, respiration, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, RNA transport and signal transduction, reactive oxygen species metabolism, mRNA surveillance pathways, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, protein export, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. This study is the first to provide a systematic overview comparing wheat anther transcriptomes of male fertile wheat with those of SQ- 1 -induced male sterile wheat and is a valuable source of data for future research in SQ- 1 -induced wheat male sterility...|$|R
40|$|Foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv. ] is {{a largely}} <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>species</b> {{that is used}} as a warm-season annual in the USA. Nearly all cultivars of this species grown in the USA are {{selections}} from land races. This research was undertaken to determine whether sufficient high-parent heterosis is expressed in foxtail millet for grain yield and other key traits to justify the development and use of varietal crosses. Seven diverse parents and 21 F 2 s and 21 F 3 s produced from biparental crosses were evaluated in five environments in 1996. Genotype x environment interaction was highly significant for grain yield, but the highest yielding entries were high-yielding in each environment. High-parent heterosis for grain yield was detected in 18 of 21 F 2 s. On the basis of the estimate of average heterosis, which was highly significant in every environment, the expected yield of the F 1 generation was 68 % greater than the average yield of the parental cultivars. This high level of heterosis for grain yield suggested that varietal crosses or other types of cultivars in which there exists a relatively high amount of heterozygosity would provide a significant yield benefit over nonhybrid cultivars. Although significant heterotic effects was observed for each of the other traits, additive effects were more important. Significant correlations between traits of the estimates of additive and/or variety heterosis effects suggest {{that at least some of}} the genes controlling grain yield, plant height, and spike length were either the same or in coupling phase linkage...|$|R
40|$|Soybean (Glycine max) is a <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>species</b> {{that has}} {{relatively}} low nucleotide polymorphism rates {{compared with other}} crop species. Despite the low rate of nucleotide polymorphisms, {{a wide range of}} heritable phenotypic variation exists. There is even evidence for heritable phenotypic variation among individuals within some cultivars. Williams 82, the soybean cultivar used to produce the reference genome sequence, was derived from backcrossing a Phytophthora root rot resistance locus from the donor parent Kingwa into the recurrent parent Williams. To explore the genetic basis of intracultivar variation, we investigated the nucleotide, structural, and gene content variation of different Williams 82 individuals. Williams 82 individuals exhibited variation in the number and size of introgressed Kingwa loci. In these regions of genomic heterogeneity, the reference Williams 82 genome sequence consists of a mosaic of Williams and Kingwa haplotypes. Genomic structural variation between Williams and Kingwa was maintained between the Williams 82 individuals within the regions of heterogeneity. Additionally, the regions of heterogeneity exhibited gene content differences between Williams 82 individuals. These findings show that genetic heterogeneity in Williams 82 primarily originated from the differential segregation of polymorphic chromosomal regions following the backcross and single-seed descent generations of the breeding process. We conclude that soybean haplotypes can possess a high rate of structural and gene content variation, and the impact of intracultivar genetic heterogeneity may be significant. This detailed characterization will be useful for interpreting soybean genomic data sets and highlights important considerations for research communities that are developing or utilizing a reference genome sequence...|$|R
