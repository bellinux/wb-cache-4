5|$|In 1987, Holden <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (HSV) {{was formed}} in {{partnership}} with Tom Walkinshaw, who primarily manufactured modified, high-performance Commodore variants. To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the HSV Dealer Team into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005 under the naming rights of Toll HSV Dealer Team.|$|E
5|$|The Commodore and its {{derivatives}} {{have been}} the basis of modified variants by companies separate to Holden. Officially, Holden's performance partner is HSV, although other prominent high performance brands include HDT <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicles,</b> Corsa Specialized Vehicles (CSV) and Walkinshaw Performance (WP), since the first, third and fourth generation Commodore, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{enhanced}} performance VE range sold by Holden <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (HSV) is marketed as the E Series and it comprised the variants listed below. For the first time, {{in order to}} more greatly differentiate its products from the mainstream donor cars, HSV invested in revised sheetmetal (chiefly, different front fender panels with dedicated air vent and different tail lights). E Series HSV vehicles {{have been the most}} successful and mass-produced vehicles in HSV's history.|$|E
5|$|Early {{vehicles}} were {{built by a}} number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway's rolling stock. <b>Special</b> <b>vehicles</b> included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and slip coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk at express speeds. Representative examples of these carriages survive in service today on various Heritage railways up and down the country.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{implemented}} a staged roll-out of the VE variants, releasing the sedan first in July 2006. Prior to this, Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores {{until the new}} station wagon and utility body styles were launched. Variants by Holden's performance vehicle partner, Holden <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (HSV), were released soon after the sedan's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 when it was accompanied by the previewing of a Sportwagon concept. The Sportwagon itself was subsequently introduced in July 2008 with the standard Commodore wheelbase instead of the extended wheelbase of previous Commodore wagons.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{introduced}} {{as a single}} sedan body style, the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon. From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship Commodore model as Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and all-wheel drive (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.|$|E
5|$|Rivalry came {{predominantly}} {{from the}} Ford Falcon—also locally built. Prior {{to the second}} generation Commodore of 1988, the Holden was positioned a full class below the full-size Falcon. To varying degrees, competition also came from mid-size offerings from Toyota Australia as well as Chrysler Australia, which morphed into Mitsubishi Motors Australia. Moreover, between 1989 and 1997, Australian federal government policy saw {{the launch of the}} Toyota Lexcen, which was a rebadged version of the second generation Commodore. With the introduction of the third generation in 1997, Holden implemented its largest export programs involving Commodore and its derivatives. In the Middle East, South Africa and Brazil, the Commodore sold as a Chevrolet. High-performance export versions followed in North America, sold as Pontiac and later Chevrolet. HSV also exported to the United Kingdom as Vauxhall, in the Middle East as Chevrolet <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (CSV) and in New Zealand and Singapore as HSV.|$|E
