40|$|Purpose: The {{method of}} {{pneumatic}} injection of powdered reagents into liquid alloys in some moment ofmelting process is known since many years. Mostly it is carrying out {{with use of}} submerged lance but in somecases that technique is difficult or impossible at all to use. This {{is the reason for}} making investigations in thefield of powders injection with non-submerged lance. Design/methodology/approach: The main experimental method was measurement and recording of timechangingdiphase <b>stream</b> <b>force</b> value with use of dedicated laboratory stand. The recorded data made possible toshow character of force in form of graphs and calculation of stream parameters. The last step was formulatingof statistical equations joining all important parameters of the process. Findings: In the course of the work was found a diphase <b>stream</b> <b>force</b> character (especially interesting are startand end point of injection). The influence of main pneumatic parameters on the force value was analyzed too. Research limitations/implications: The future experiments will be conducted with use of Fluent 6. 2 programfor checking the results in computer simulations. The limitation is number of values being analyzed inexperimental plan. Practical implications: The invented lance can be used for powders pneumatic injection but only for smallits quantities (e. g. microalloying) because non-immersed lance should be used with low stream concentration. The usage of that lance can decrease liquid alloy heat losses (not introducing carrier gas into liquid) and lanceconsumption (non-immersed in liquid bath). Originality/value: The problem of <b>stream</b> <b>force</b> in powder injection process is in Poland only analyzed byDepartment of Foundry and nobody (in author’s opinion) was analyzed it with connection in powder injection.

40|$|Purpose: The {{pneumatic}} powder injection into liquid alloys {{is known}} since many years. It is use in many metallurgical processes (recarburization, alloy additions introduction, desulphurization etc.). The problem {{in some cases}} is to prevent the carrier gas introduction into liquid bath. Design/methodology/approach: The objectives were achieved by researches with laboratory injection stand. The main research method was measurement of stream parameters and computation of pneumatic injection indexes. Findings: The new injection lance was invented and analyzed {{and this is one}} of the main subjects of this paper. The lance has a construction, that makes possible even complete elimination of carrier gas introduction into liquid metal with proper particles stream range. The paper shows the results of the tests of lances with various geometrical parameters and model experiments with diphase <b>stream</b> <b>force</b> measurement. Research limitations/implications: The future research should be made with various type of powdered materials to find the question what are the limits of changing the most important parameters (grain size, stream concentration etc.). The limitation is number of values being analyzed (in powder injection processes there are many) in experimental plan. Practical implications: The lance can be used for powders pneumatic injection but only for small its quantities (e. g. microalloying) because non-immersed lance should be used with low stream concentration. The usage of that lance can decrease liquid alloy heat losses (not introducing carrier gas into liquid) and lance consumption (non-immersed in liquid bath). Originality/value: The original value of the paper is taking into account the parameter called by authors “diphase stream force” on liquid metal surface being “attacked” by particles (or carrier gas stream). Nobody (in author’s opinion) was analyzed that problem with connection in powder injection processes. The paper can be helpful for everybody who is studying pneumatic injection processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} research was to provide a detailed understanding of the performance of gas turbine engines inside indoor sea-level test beds. In particular the evaluation of both thrust correction factors and the estimation of the mass flow entering the test cell were {{at the core of the}} research. The project has been fully sponsored by Rolls-Royce pIc. Initially, their principal objective was to assess the relevance and accuracy of CFD when applied to thrust measurement inside indoor test beds with an intended outcome of minimising the use of expensive experimental measurements. The different system interfaces and accounting systems for in-flight conditions, available in the open literature have been developed and adapted for indoor environments. This has led to the definition of three different thrust correction equations using alternative definitions of thrust correction factor. Aero-dynamic principles have been applied for the derivation of one-dimensional relationships for the calculation of each thrust correction factor using generic engine-cell performance and dimensions. A one-dimensional analytical model has been developed to represent the enginedetuner ejector pump. This is able to characterise the engine-cell system performance and is used as the main tool for providing a matching procedure capable of predicting the cell entrainment ratio. By processing experimental data relevant to different engine-cell configurations through the ejector pump analytical model, a method for achieving the entrainment ratio control inside the cell has been identified. The CFD work has been concentrated into three main activities: • A quantitative extrapolation of the thrust correction factors including, the pre-entry force, the external and the total bellmouth force, the throat <b>stream</b> <b>force,</b> the intake momentum drag and the base drag. • The representation of the engine-detuner ejector performance for a variety of engine-cell configurations. • The modelling of the generic test cell components including the inlet stack, the cascade elbow, the exhaust stack & the blast basket. The outcomes of this research have been very successful in enhancing the validity of the thrust correction equations developed [...] In particular, the use of a one-dimensional approach in their estimation has been shown to be fully justified. The work has also emphasised the value of CFD in supporting the derivation of the matching procedure for predicting and controlling cell entrainment ratio. Indeed, one of the strongest outcomes of this work has been the conclusion that both the engine-cell characteristic lines computed with the one-dimensional model and those computed with CFD for different cell configurations are almost identical. In addition, the use of CFD as a tool for the quantitative evaluation of the thrust correction factors has been established. Finally, the CFD results have facilitated an enhanced understanding of the complex flow structure inside indoor test cell...|$|E

The Sonicare and Blend-a-Dent have a lateral vibratory action, while the Interplak and Braun produce a rotary movement of the brush head. The vibratory action of the Sonicare was susceptible to loading. All devices produced both stable-pulsating cavitation and acoustic microstreaming that was demonstrated in vitro using a suspension of particles in water. Their effectiveness in removing a food debris medium was assessed with and without water. Three of the brushes (Sonicare, Braun, and Blend-a-Dent) were similar in their ability to remove the plaque, and all were superior to the Interplak; its <b>streaming</b> <b>forces</b> removed no food debris.

40|$|For energy {{efficiency}} and material cost reduction it is preferred to drive high-intensity discharge lamps at frequencies of approximately 300 kHz. However, operating lamps at these high frequencies bears the risk of stimulating acoustic resonances inside the arc tube, which can result in low frequency light flicker and even lamp destruction. The acoustic streaming effect {{has been identified as}} the link between high frequency resonances and low frequency flicker.

40|$|Abstract. Forced {{convection}} in {{a narrow}} channel is investigated both numerically and experimen-tally. The flow field is established through the mechanism of acoustic streaming. This is accomplished by high frequency vibration {{of one of the}} channel walls, which is composed of a piezoelectric bi-morph. In the numerical computations, the Navier-Stokes equations are decomposed into the acoustic equations and the streaming equations by the perturbation method. The acoustic field is first nu-merically obtained, which provides the driving <b>force</b> for the <b>streaming</b> field. The streaming field and the associated temperature field are then obtained numerically. Heat losses from a heat source are measured to determine the efficiency of this as a cooling method. The air-flow patterns in the channel between the heat source and the bimorph actuator are visualized using the particle track-ing velocimetry. The visualization clearly shows that vortical streaming (acoustic streaming) can be induced by bimorph vibration, which enhances heat transfer between the heat source and the sur-rounding air. The temperature decreases obtained computationally and experimentally are in good agreement.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop acoustic sensors and actuators for microfluidic applications. To this end, capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (cMUTs) were developed which generate guided acoustic waves in fluid half-spaces and microchannels. An interdigital transducer structure and a phased excitation scheme were used to selectively excite guided acoustic modes which propagate in a single lateral direction. Analytical models were developed to predict the geometric dispersion of the acoustic modes and to determine the sensitivity of the modes to changes in material and geometric parameters. Coupled field finite element models were also developed to predict the effect of membrane spacing and phasing on mode generation and directionality. After designing the transducers, a surface micromachining process was developed which has a low processing temperature of 250 C and has the potential for monolithically integrating cMUTs with CMOS electronics. The fabrication process makes extensive use of PECVD silicon nitride depositions for membrane formation and sealing. The fabricated interdigital cMUTs were placed in microfluidic channels and demonstrated to sense changes in fluid sound speed and flow rate using Scholte waves and other guided acoustic modes. The minimum detectable change in sound speed was 0. 25 m/s, and the minimum detectable change in flow rate was 1 mL/min. The unique nature of the Scholte wave allowed for the measurement of fluid properties of a semi-infinite fluid using two transducers on a single substrate. Changes in water temperature, and thus sound speed, were measured and the minimum detectable change in temperature was found to be 0. 1 C. For fluid pumping, interdigital cMUTs were integrated into microchannels and excited with phase-shifted, continuous wave signals. Highly directional guided waves were generated which in turn generated acoustic <b>streaming</b> <b>forces</b> in the fluid. The acoustic <b>streaming</b> <b>forces</b> caused the fluid to be pumped in a single, electronically-controlled direction. For a power consumption of 43 mW, a flow rate of 410 nL/min was generated against a pressure of 3. 4 Pa; the thermodynamic efficiency was approximately 5 x 10 - 8 %. Although the efficiency and pressure head are low, these transducers can be useful for precisely manipulating small amounts of fluid around microfluidic networks. Ph. D.

40|$|Abstract — A {{real-time}} telerobotic system {{consisting of}} client station (operator) and server station (slave arm) interconnected {{by a computer}} network has been implemented using a distributed component framework. To minimize overall delays a multi-threaded execution is proposed for pipelining of information pro-cessing and real-time transmission. Thread engineering allowed pipelining stereo grabbing and live transfer of stereo video data. Different scenarios are statistically analyzed to relate the effect of thread manipulation to overall time delays. Analysis of telerobotic delays through three campus routes with different network loads is presented. A sampling rate of 120 Hz is achieved for force feedback and 50 Hz for operator commands when network load is below 80 %. Copying stereo images from cameras to memory is done in 24 ms. Stereo video transfer operates {{at a rate of}} 17 fps. Total reference delays for force and stereo are 8 ms and 83 ms, respectively.

Results were expressed in dimensionless form using Reynolds number, Richardson number for heat transfer, Richardson number for mass transfer, Prandtl number, and Schmidt number as parameters.

Once the optical trapping stiffness has been calibrated, observation of this displacement enables a direct {{measurement of}} the forces acting upon the micro-sphere.
