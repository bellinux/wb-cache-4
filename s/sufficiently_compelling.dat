50|$|The term is {{a metaphor}} {{deriving}} from chain gangs, groups of people, usually prisoners or slaves, bound together with chains or other devices as they work or march. Like a real-life chain gang, the states joined together in a chain gang, according to bound obligation, have no option to refuse to follow along {{with the intent of}} the others. However, in reality, the members of a chain gang coalition can and sometimes do choose to refuse to acquiesce, in which case they may face international ostracism (at least from the other members of their former alliance), and possibly courtship on the part of rival coalitions. This is because, typically, few punitive actions exists in the realm of international law that can <b>sufficiently</b> <b>compel</b> a power to follow its obligations at all costs, and therefore, the incentives to breaking ranks can sometimes be rather high, especially when the state does not agree with the actions taken by the other members of its coalition.|$|R
40|$|The nascent Ghanaian {{horticulture}} export sector, {{which emerged}} in the mid- 1980 s, has been ignored by ruling elites, especially after the return to multiparty democracy in 1993. Ruling elites across the two party governments between 1993 and 2008 did not actively pursue initiatives to support the industry. Without sustained political support, the types of public-private coordination of actions and investments needed to help the sector expand and upgrade were not forthcoming in an effective and timely manner. This private sector-driven non-traditional export sector constitutes a neglected opportunity for export diversification and building a new agro-industry, and also highlights some of the factors explaining why the country's economy was still dependent on the traditional exports of cocoa and gold by {{the close of the}} 2000 s. The political challenges to changing the productive structure in Ghana {{can be found in the}} characteristics of ruling coalitions - vulnerability of the ruling elite in power, the high fragmentation within ruling coalitions, and their existing sources of and strategies for financing the state and the ruling coalition, combined with the country's existing economic structure as well as the size and capabilities of domestic capitalists.

60|$|But {{as regards}} the second proposal, {{that there should be}} no {{obligation}} to work, and no economic reward for work, the matter is much more doubtful. Anarchists always assume that if their schemes were put into operation practically everyone would work; but although there is very much more to be said for this view than most people would concede at first sight, yet it is questionable whether there is enough to be said to make it true for practical purposes. Perhaps, in a community where industry had become habitual through economic pressure, public opinion might be <b>sufficiently</b> powerful to <b>compel</b> most men to work;[44] but it is always doubtful how far such a state of things would be permanent. If public opinion is to be really effective, it will be necessary to have some method of dividing the community into small groups, and to allow each group to consume only the equivalent of what it produces. This will make the economic motive operative upon the group, which, since we are supposing it small, will feel that its collective share is appreciably diminished by each idle individual. Such a system might be feasible, but it would be contrary to the whole spirit of Anarchism and would destroy the main lines of its economic system.|$|R

50|$|In {{psychological}} terms, FAST marketing {{was generally}} {{understood in the}} 1990s {{in the context of}} cognitive dissonance theory with its emphasis on a universal drive to reduce asymmetry between belief and reality. Its behavioral effects were specifically ascribed to the bond of trust established by experiential affirmation of an expectation set honestly by advertising. In the 21st century, this understanding has been refined by neuroscientific developments concerning the dopamine-reward system, notably in respect of behaviors established automatically by the accurate matching of expectation and reality. Such findings have prompted more sophisticated investigations into the nature of customer experience employing neuroscientific tools and scientific method as distinct from questionnaire-based, interpretation-led market research. These more sophisticated means of defining business experiences have in turn enabled the creation of more psychologically rounded experiences - ones <b>sufficiently</b> <b>compelling</b> that a hyperbole-free advertising evocation may by itself be persuasive.

50|$|Some {{prominent}} authorities (Köchel, Tyson and Edge) {{suggest that}} the paper and watermarks of this work prove a composition date of 1781 or 1782. That the work was specially composed for a public concert given by Anton Stadler on March 23, 1784 is less likely, because this performance has no proven connection with the date of composition and only marks an ante quem date.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that on sufficiently large scales the Universe is well-described as a homogeneous, isotropic FRW cosmology {{with a dark}} energy. Does the formation of nonlinear cosmic inhomogeneities produce {{a significant effect on}} the average large-scale FLRW dynamics? As an answer, we suggest that if the length scale at which homogeneity sets in is much smaller than the Hubble length scale, the back-reaction due to averaging over inhomogeneities is negligible. This result is supported by more than one approach to study of averaging in cosmology. Even if no single approach is <b>sufficiently</b> rigorous and <b>compelling,</b> they are all in agreement that the effect of averaging in the real Universe is small. On the other hand, it is perhaps fair {{to say that there is}} no definitive observational evidence yet that there indeed is a homogeneity scale which is much smaller than the Hubble scale, or for that matter, if today's Universe is indeed homogeneous on large scales. If the Copernican principle can be observationally established to hold, or is theoretically assumed to be valid, this provides strong evidence for homogeneity on large scales. However, even this by itself does not say what the scale of homogeneity is. If that scale is today comparable to the Hubble radius, only a fully non-perturbative analysis can establish or rule out the importance of cosmological back-reaction.

40|$|The {{war will}} {{fundamentally}} change the international relations landcape, argues Ann Kent BEHIND the ‘shock and awe’ {{of the war}} on Iraq, three major developments are in train which promise to change the nature of the West, and indeed the world, as we know it. These are quite apart from the massive destabilisation and human tragedy that the war represents for the Middle East and its possible role in encouraging a regional arms race and international terrorism. The first new development is a shift in the international balance of power. After the end of the Cold War in 1991, many states confidently predicted a move from bipolarity to multipolarity, with power being dispersed away from the traditional divisions of West and East to more diverse and equal power centres. By the mid- to late 1990 s, however, {{it became clear that the}} US was emerging, unchallenged, as the unipolar hegemon. This was primarily due to the fact that while the Clinton administration maintained a relatively benevolent international presence and upheld multilateralism and the rule of international law, states and communities of states in the second tier were not inclined to dispute the emerging hierarchy. Deprived of international solidarity, leaders of rising states such as China resigned themselves to learning to coexist with the hegemon and to circumnavigate its uncertain moods rather than confront them. (1) All this changed with the advent of George Bush in 2000. As is well known, even before September 11, 2001, a new mood of US isolationism had become increasingly apparent. The new president refused to ratify, abrogated, or reneged on, one multilateral treaty after another, from the Kyoto Protocol and the ABM Treaty to the draft agreement to provide verification mechanisms for the Biological Weapons Convention. The alarming justification offered for this new unsociability was that the various treaties did not conform to America’s ‘national interests’. After September 11, national introspection mutated into unilateral internationalism. The US now looked outwards, seeking to avenge its horrifying tragedy by identifying a state on which to fasten the more abstract and inchoate goals of its ‘war on terrorism’. Once Iraq had been officially targeted, the neoconservative US administration made clear its willingness not only to take unilateral international action to defend its perceived interests but also to threaten multilateral institutions, in particular the UN security council, with ‘irrelevance’ if they did not submit to the new US security agenda. Unilateral and pre-emptive action, in other words, was, in their eyes, not only legitimate, but trumped, indeed subsumed, multilateral activity. The essence of the international balance of power, put simply, is that if enough impetus is exerted to destabilise or concentrate it, countervailing forces will arise to re-establish equilibrium. The pressure applied by a proactive, ambitious and paranoid US administration on members of the UN security council over Iraq was judged <b>sufficiently</b> threatening to <b>compel</b> the combined forces of France, Germany and Russia - a historically unique but informal coalition formed in the council chamber, and supported on the sidelines by China - to re-establish that balance. China, relieved that it had been saved the decision of whether to use its veto, but wishing to assert its moral leadership, was the first to criticise strongly the decision of the US-led ‘coalition’ to launch an attack on Iraq on March 20 without security council authorisation. Five days later, China’s new premier, Wen Jiabao, appealed for an early end to the war and for the issue to be brought back to the UN. (2) The resulting new, loose association of four security council members, including three permanent members, cuts across the Western alliance and geopolitical boundaries. It may well be a coalition of convenience, but it is likely to last at least as long as these four major powers feel a need to deflect the real and present danger to global stability posed by unilateral internationalism. As further reinforcement, a recommitment to the norms, principles and rules of the UN and its charter is likely to be made. This is because the UN is the only multilateral institution that has the potential to check American power. (3) The second new development is the split occurring in the relationship between leaders and the led, so dramatically reflected in the worldwide popular demonstrations against the war. Whether in the Middle East, in other parts of Asia or within Western liberal democracies, a huge divide has appeared between those governments pledging their support for the war in Iraq and the majority of their citizens who oppose it. The phenomenon of ‘street Arabs’, in other words, is making its appearance on Western streets. The vertical schism identified above within the Western alliance is thus itself being horizontally bisected. It is particularly unusual that such schisms should occur within liberal democracies. The political contract of trust that, between elections, has maintained the link between such governments and their citizens has been torn asunder. Millions of citizens - particularly in the three democracies that make up the ‘coalition of the willing’, whose leaders have adopted presidential authority - have been deprived of government representatives who will respond to their opposition, expressed in demonstrations, talk-back radio, letters to the editor and polls. The result can only be huge popular resentment which will have long-term effects not only on national leaders but on US relations with its traditional allies. The problem confronting the US is not just France or Russia or ‘old’ Europe. In Australia’s case, the problem is that the democratic expression of the people’s will and their elementary sense of justice and legality have been subverted, precisely and ironically, by government action invoking the instrument of Australia’s alliance with the US. Such a schism between leaders and the led has been facilitated, but not produced, by the advent of the internet and email. Rather, the unanticipated uses of globalisation have been driven by an almost global sense of political alienation. The newly universalised ‘people power’ will, however, have a part to play in the shift in the global balance of power. It has the potential to provide a counter-balance, though still an asymmetrical one, to the overwhelming powers of the hegemon and the multinational corporation. The third development is more subtle, transcending the Western alliance as a whole to liberate the mindset of the Anglo-Western alliance itself. This is not just because Canada and New Zealand have joined the ‘coalition of the UNwilling’. During the Cold War, the moral reputation of the US coexisted uneasily in the Anglo-Western mind with an awareness of the violent mechanisms it often utilised to spread its message. Here, another implicit, even unconscious, contract was concluded between the US and the citizens of its allies. By common consent, because of the value of the ends, the knowledge of the terrible means was, if not ignored, at least expunged from public discourse. Mostly those means were, in any case, adopted far away, within US ‘spheres of influence’, like Latin America. Only members of the Socialist Alliance, Trotskyites or the international periphery of developing and socialist states adopted the embarrassing habit of calling a US spade a spade, causing loyal American allies to walk by on the other side, feigning deafness. Now, partly assisted by the audacity of US citizen-entrepreneur Michael Moore, notions of the US as a rogue state, as a possessor of weapons of mass destruction, and as one of the chief suppliers of those weapons to Saddam Hussein, are no longer ideas quickly banished. (4) They are now common parlance on the Western street, familiar currency in letters to the editor. One wakes, astonished at the unconscious self-censorship that had sat for decades like a tight band around one’s brain. Will these changes permanently alter our world or will they disappear with the end of hostilities? The answer depends partly on the path war takes. But whatever the direction, a new scepticism, a new lack of trust, new interests, the reaffirmation of international values and institutions which had been taken for granted, new perspectives on the past, the shock of brutal treatment at the hands of our allies and our leaders, and the will not to submit, have woken us in fright. Such lessons and emotions are now hopefully directing us, at the very least, along the road to multipolarity, a destination anticipated since the end of the Cold War and now long overdue.

40|$|This article {{claims that}} {{liability}} of supervisors, given the arguments in favour and against liability, {{should be treated}} as a regular form of civil law liability (either in tort or contract). The rules regarding the existence and content of the duty of care are well equipped to deal with that topic fairly and justly, thus preventing undesirable or unreasonable outcomes. There is no <b>sufficiently</b> <b>compelling</b> reason to deviate from these generally applied rules or to accept immunity for supervisors. The system of tort law is well capable of avoiding the award of too much compensation too fast, as the conditions for liability are not easily fulfilled...|$|E

It is now well established that sons of alcoholic fathers are approximately four times more likely to develop alcoholism compared to the male offspring of nonalcoholics. ’ Indeed, the evidence supporting the contribution of genetic factors in alcoholism is <b>sufficiently</b> <b>compelling</b> to warrant a search for markers of the genetic influence.
