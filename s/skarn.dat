25|$|Sulfur and {{chlorine}} may {{be derived}} from the crust, evaporites such as these found at Salar de Atacama, subducted lithosphere or the mantle. Carbon in the gases may come from <b>skarn</b> assimilation. Sulfur isotope data {{support the notion that}} evaporite deposits contribute part of Lascar's sulfur. Water appears to be in part magmatic and in part precipitation-derived. The high concentrations of halogens are typical for subduction-associated volcanoes; the halogens are supplied to the volcanoes through subduction.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; {{a large amount}} of the phenocrysts are {{ultimately}} derived from them. Hornfels, <b>skarn,</b> and rocks derived from Lascar's lava dome ridge form these xenoliths. Minerals encountered in xenoliths include andradite, anhydrite, anorthite, apatite, biotite, calcite, diopside, fassaite, garnet, gypsum, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, perovskite, plagioclase, prehnite, quartz, sphene, thorite, wilkeite, wollastonite and zircon. A number of such xenoliths formed from carbonate rocks that were influenced by magma from Lascar and from other volcanoes such as Tumisa.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{gold and silver}} and their related deposits, tin, iron, and mercury occur, sometimes in later units, mostly in later volcanics, and Molybdenum occurs in the mountains, often along with older copper deposits or in oligocene deposits in the east. The belt of tin deposits resides mostly within the eastern slopes from Durango to Guanajuato. In these areas, tin occurs in rhyolitic ignimbrites in many, possibly over 1000, small deposits of cassiterite. Typically these deposits are divided from overlying ignimbrites by breccia, which may also contain ore. Many of these {{are thought to be}} hydrothermal deposits To the east of these units is a belt of more mercury deposits, followed by another belt of manganese deposits, although these deposits are mostly limited to Chihuahua and Hidalgo. Iron occurs in three different regions placed by different mechanisms. Along the Pacific there the numerous <b>skarn</b> and replacement deposits mentioned above with relation to gold. Iron occurs in Durango in the form of magnetite lava flows, which are often surrounded by smaller hematite deposits, thought to be ash flows. There is also a belt of iron deposits further east.|$|E

2500|$|Temperatures of the {{magma chamber}} {{range from the}} mafic magmas that are {{injected}} in the chamber are about [...] hotter than the extant andesite and dacite. The chamber may be surrounded by skarnic alteration. This alteration gives rise to wollastonite and pyroxene-containing <b>skarn,</b> depending on {{the distance from the}} magma chamber walls. Metasomatism does further affect rocks derived from magma chamber walls. The conditions at the magma chamber may be comparable to these under which epithermal mineral deposits form. The oxidation conditions in the magma chamber are favourable for the formation of sulfate, but unfavourable for the deposition of sulfide minerals.|$|E
2500|$|Gold {{and silver}} {{deposits}} most commonly {{occur in the}} altered andesites of the early volcanics, typically these deposits are between 30 and 50 million years old. These {{are believed to be}} caused by later intrusions into the early flows. Fissure-vein deposits have been divided into two groups of fissure vein deposits, which are divided geographically into an eastern and western series. In the east, the gold and silver are accompanied by lead and zinc. [...] In the south, the Bolaños mine district is contained with the Bolaños Graben. Some also occur as epithermal deposits. Also, some gold occurs along with copper in Cenozoic iron-oxide <b>skarn</b> and replacement deposits along the Pacific.|$|E
2500|$|Paddys River Mine or Cowley copper mine {{is located}} 700m {{upstream}} on Paddys River. [...] The host rock is a <b>skarn</b> where Shannons Flat Adamellite baked limestone from the Paddy's River Volcanics. [...] The {{bulk of the}} mineral here is magnetite, but other sulfide and minerals of copper, lead zinc and silver attracted miners. [...] Thomas Coyle operated the mine in 1895, producing 2.6 tons of copper and 26.1kg of silver. In 1907 the Cowley Copper Syndicate Ltd started more work cutting two more adits and winzes. However it was abandoned by 1909 as the ore was too low grade. [...] More than a million tons of magnetite remain. [...] Many minerals such as aurichalcite, bronchanite, caledonite, cerussite, hemimorphite, hydrozincite, linarite, native silver, rozenite, and zincsilite have been found at the location.|$|E

50|$|The mine {{has yielded}} several tens of {{thousands}} of tons of magnetite ore; associated with the magnetite ore are supergene hematite, vonsenite, Fluorite in dar mica <b>skarn,</b> pyroxeneamphibole <b>skarn</b> and quartz-bearing amphibole <b>skarn.</b> Parts of the amphibole <b>skarn</b> and the iron ore are rish in Fluorite; this type of <b>skarn</b> is as much as a few feet thick and ranges from 20 to 60 percent fluorite. If the iron deposit is mined again, Fluorite and vonsenite should be considered as coproducts.|$|E
50|$|These three metals {{generally}} form in {{a certain}} type of granite, via a similar mechanism to intrusive-related gold and copper. They are considered together because the process of forming these deposits is essentially the same. <b>Skarn</b> type mineralisation related to these granites is a very important type of tin, tungsten, and molybdenum deposit. <b>Skarn</b> deposits form by reaction of mineralised fluids from the granite reacting with wall rocks such as limestone. <b>Skarn</b> mineralisation is also important in lead, zinc, copper, gold, and occasionally uranium mineralisation.|$|E
50|$|Hedenbergite can {{be found}} in skarns. A <b>skarn</b> is a {{metamorphic}} rock that is formed by the chemical alterations of the original minerals by hydrothermal causes. They are formed by large chemical reactions between adjacent lithologies. The Nickel Plate gold <b>skarn</b> deposit of the Hedley District in southern British Columbia is characterized by hedenbergitic pyroxene.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{metamorphic}} occurrences are in high-temperature metamorphosed impure limestones. For instance, melilite {{occurs in}} some high-temperature <b>skarns.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Skarns</b> are a {{class of}} calc-silicate rocks and are intimately {{associated}} with granite intrusions, usually of sedimentary-metamorphic origin (S-type). <b>Skarns</b> are rarely seen {{with other types of}} granites, because of the fluid chemistry and crystallization behaviour of M-type (mantle origin) and I-type (igneous-metamorphic origin) granites. S-type granites are more prone to generating late-stage fluid rich in silica, incompatible elements and halides because they are generally more potassic, oxidised and hydrous.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{the occurrence of}} high-temperature, spurrite-, tilleyite- and gehlenite-bearing <b>skarns</b> from Cornet Hill, part of the Metaliferi Massif, Apuseni Mountains, Romania, and the main mineral species developed in these rocks. The host <b>skarns</b> are developed at the contact between a quartz monzonitic - monzodioritic body of Paleocene - Ypresian age and Tithonian limestones. The primary mineral assemblage mainly consists of tilleyite, spurrite and gehlenite, with various amounts of garnet and wollastonite; perovskite, monticellite and hydroxylellestadite are present but scarce. The <b>skarns</b> have clearly undergone a late metasomatic event, which produced, for example, diopside veins cross-cutting tilleyite, spurrite, and gehlenite, and small masses and veins of vesuvianite replacing gehlenite.
