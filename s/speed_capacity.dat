25|$|A city {{car is a}} small {{automobile}} {{intended for}} use in urban areas. Unlike microcars, a city car's greater <b>speed,</b> <b>capacity</b> and (in perception at least) occupant protection are safer in mixed traffic environments and weather conditions. While city cars can reach highway speeds, that is not their intended use. In Japan, city cars are called kei cars. Kei cars have to meet strict size and engine requirements: engines have a maximum displacement of 660nbsp&cc and the car's length must be under 3400nbsp&mm.|$|E
25|$|Historically, steel ties have {{suffered}} from poor design and increased traffic loads over their normally long service life. These aged and often obsolete designs limited load and <b>speed</b> <b>capacity</b> but can still be found in many locations globally and performing adequately despite decades of service. There are great numbers of steel ties with over 50 years of service {{and in some cases}} they can and have been rehabilitated and continue to perform well. Steel ties were also used in specialty situations, such as the Hejaz Railway in the Arabian Peninsula, which had an ongoing problem with Bedouins who would steal wooden ties for campfires.|$|E
25|$|As we age, deficits {{are seen}} {{in the ability to}} integrate, manipulate, and reorganize the {{contents}} of working memory in order to complete higher level cognitive tasks such as problem solving, decision making, goal setting, and planning. More research must be completed in order to determine what the exact cause of these age-related deficits in working memory are. It is likely that attention, processing <b>speed,</b> <b>capacity</b> reduction, and inhibitory control may all play a role in these age-related deficits. The brain regions that are active during working memory tasks are also being evaluated, and research has shown that different parts of the brain are activated during working memory in younger adults as compared to older adults. This suggests that younger and older adults are performing these tasks differently.|$|E

500|$|The Vestfold Line {{opened in}} 1881 as a narrow-gauge railway. Although later {{converted}} to standard gauge and electrified, the line retains poor capacity and many curves. The only previous tunnel north of Larvik is the [...] Smørstein Tunnel, which {{was completed in}} 1921. In the early 1990s, work started on increasing <b>speed,</b> <b>capacity</b> and reliability by building shorter sections of double-track with higher permitted speeds. During this period, {{there was very little}} investment funding for railways; thus the Vestfold Line was split into a series of small segments, each which was planned individually. Between 1995 and 2003, three sections with a combined length of [...] were opened. The segment between Barkåker and Tønsberg was the fourth section of the line to be upgraded. When later projects are completed, it will allow travel time from Tønsberg to Oslo to be reduced from 90 to 60 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|In 1995, the {{transmission}} <b>speed</b> <b>capacity</b> for Ethernet increased from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. By 1998, Ethernet supported transmission speeds of a Gigabit. Subsequently, higher speeds {{of up to}} 100 Gbit/s were added (...) [...] The ability of Ethernet to scale easily (such as quickly adapting to support new fiber optic cable speeds) is a contributing factor to its continued use.|$|E

50|$|German {{shipping}} {{lines were}} aggressive {{competitors in the}} transatlantic trade, and Cunard responded by trying to outdo them in <b>speed,</b> <b>capacity,</b> and luxury. Both Lusitania and Mauretania were fitted with revolutionary new turbine engines that enabled them to maintain a service speed of 25 kn. They were equipped with lifts, wireless telegraph, and electric light, and provided 50% more passenger space than any other ship; the first class decks were noted for their sumptuous furnishings.|$|E
50|$|This {{intervention}} underpins {{the other}} two options below, but is justifiable {{in its own right}} owing to <b>speed,</b> <b>capacity</b> and performance benefits. It involves adapting the Up (southbound) goods line between Alexandra Palace and Finsbury Park to passenger use, including additional platforms at Alexandra Palace, Hornsey and Harringay and a reopened platform at Finsbury Park. LDHS trains will achieve a three-minute speed increase, and southbound inner-suburban trains exiting from Hertford-loop can be totally segregated.|$|E

50|$|The {{nature of}} high {{mobility}} of military operations and their logistics support requires wide use with high <b>speed</b> <b>capacities</b> of voice, data and image communications, etc. Control, surveillance, reconnaissance and reporting systems {{play a vital}} role in the command and control system. Many of these requirements can be only met with the use of radio systems. The equipment of military communications adds and multiplies the power of forces. That is why the use of radio frequencies’ spectrum is evaluated as one of the preliminary conditions for successful military operations.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to long-standing practices in transportation design that place primary importance on moving traffic (vehicular throughput), the CSS process emphasizes that transportation facilities should fit their physical settings and preserve scenic, aesthetic, historic and environmental resources, while maintaining safety and mobility. For instance, if a state highway that {{passes through a}} downtown main street, applying CSS principles would entail creating a street where the movement of vehicles does not impede pedestrian activity and sidewalk commerce, rather than a street that is simply widened and straightened to increase <b>speed,</b> <b>capacity</b> and mobility for vehicles as a singular transportation objective. CSS therefore includes principles for context-sensitive decision-making that place {{a high value on}} community input and consensus, and more technical principles of context sensitive design.|$|E
