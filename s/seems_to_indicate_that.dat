5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the first syllable is stressed, while F0 <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E

A number of sources indicate that Gauguin was suffering at the time from a syphilitic rash that prevented him from travelling to Tahiti for several months. She suggests the orifice is a pars pro toto for the woman who infected him.|$|E
5|$|Once back in {{northern}} Thrace, Vitalian went into hiding, {{while many of}} his erstwhile aides were captured and executed. Nothing is known of him {{for the next three}} years, although a short remark by a chronicler <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> he resurfaced and led another armed rebellion during the last months of Anastasius's life. When Anastasius died in July 518, he was succeeded by Justin I, the comes excubitorum (commander of the imperial bodyguard). The new emperor quickly moved to strengthen his rule, dismissing a number of potential rivals or enemies. At the same time, he called upon Vitalian to come to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of this}} group is not well documented, but the known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions: the earliest known modern picids were piculet-like forms of the Late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago (mya). By that time, however, the group was already present in the Americas and Europe, and it is hypothesized that they actually evolved much earlier, maybe {{as early as the}} Early Eocene (50 mya). The modern subfamilies appear to be rather young by comparison; until the mid-Miocene (10–15 mya), all picids seem to have been small or mid-sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a wryneck. On the other hand, there exists a feather enclosed in fossil amber from the Dominican Republic, dated to about 25 mya, which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the Nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then.|$|E
5|$|In the Pasión River {{region of}} Petén, rulers {{began to be}} portrayed as ballplayers on stelae. Seibal was the first site {{in the region to}} depict its rulers thus. Seventeen stelae were erected at Seibal between 849 and 889, and show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, {{including}} a lord wearing the beaked mask of Ehecatl, the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth. Some of these have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at Cacaxtla, a non-Maya site in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala. This hybrid style <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the kings of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources. Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs. Stelae at Oxkintok, to the north in the Puuc region of the Yucatán Peninsula, divided the face of the stela into up to three levels, each of which contained a different scene, usually of a lone figure that could be either male or female. The representation of the human figure differed from the formal treatment in the south, and were simplified, coarse representations lacking individuality amongst sociopolitical and religious symbols.|$|E
5|$|According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple {{was built}} atop {{what is known}} as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and {{destroyed}} by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod's building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod’s great-grandson. Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} eventually, the APU and tail vibrations eventually {{reached the same}} frequency and went into resonance, where the force of multiple same-frequency vibrations add to that of one another and create one large vibration. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the replacement of that one bolt may have actually worsened the vibration by changing the vertical stabilizer's natural frequency and possibly bringing it closer {{to that of the}} APU. Thus, the tail's vibration increased in amplitude until it failed and broke off.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to model the {{distribution}} of galaxies with a fractal pattern was made by Luciano Pietronero and his team in 1987, and a more detailed view of the universe’s large-scale structure emerged over the following decade, {{as the number of}} cataloged galaxies grew larger. Pietronero argues that the universe shows a definite fractal aspect over a fairly wide range of scale, with a fractal dimension of about 2. The fractal dimension of a homogeneous 3D object would be 3, and 2 for a homogeneous surface, whilst the fractal dimension for a fractal surface is between 2 and 3. The ultimate significance of this result is not immediately apparent, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> both randomness and hierarchal structuring are at work on the scale of galaxy clusters and larger.|$|E
