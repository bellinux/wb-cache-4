The discs use the ISO 9660 file system, without any copy protection mechanism {{other than a}} <b>simple</b> <b>sensor</b> in the case jacket, {{making it possible to}} make a disc image out of the media, although there hasn't been any known cases of piracy involving the V.Flash.

5000|$|Next to {{pressure}} sensors, airbag sensors and other mechanically movable structures, fluid handling devices were developed. Examples are: channels (capillary connections), mixers, valves, pumps and dosing devices. The first LOC analysis system was a gas chromatograph, developed in 1979 by S.C. Terry - Stanford University. However, {{only at the}} end of the 1980s, and beginning of the 1990s, the LOC research started to seriously grow as a few research groups in Europe developed micropumps, flowsensors and the concepts for integrated fluid treatments for analysis systems. [...] These µTAS concepts demonstrated that integration of pre-treatment steps, usually done at lab-scale, could extend the <b>simple</b> <b>sensor</b> functionality towards a complete laboratory analysis, including additional cleaning and separation steps.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{satellite}} has a 56 kbit/s backhaul that utilises {{the popular}} TDMA multiplexing scheme and QPSK modulation. ORBCOMM {{is the only}} current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for [...] "Little LEO" [...] systems. Several such systems were planned {{in the early to}} mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there {{is likely to be a}} satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night. Every satellite has an on-board GPS receiver for positioning. Typical data payloads are 6 bytes to 30 bytes, adequate for sending GPS position data or <b>simple</b> <b>sensor</b> readings.|$|E

40|$|This poster {{abstract}} {{introduces the}} problem of macroscopic sensing composition, where a sensor capable to detect complex events is synthesized dynamically by a collection of <b>simpler</b> <b>sensors</b> using a data-driven approach. Our solution is geared towards discovering the structure of human activities by considering the triggering of <b>simple</b> <b>sensors</b> over a diverse set of spatial and temporal scales. The goal is to identify routines from their components by leveraging {{the fact that the}} components have the same temporal persistence as the routines themselves. To this end we have devised an algorithm for determining if an event occurs consistently within a time interval where the interval is periodic but the event is not. The goal of the algorithm is to identify events with this property and also determine the minimum interval in which they occur. Our first results using testbed data and simulations indicate that this approach can uncover components of routines by identifying which events are parts of the same routine through their temporal properties...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} make future {{satellites}} both smaller and smarter, more navigation information must be extracted from <b>simpler,</b> smaller <b>sensors.</b> One of the <b>simplest</b> <b>sensors</b> is an optical or infrared camera. With a camera, a satellite can track a second satellite located within its field-of-view. This simple measurement {{is the foundation of}} angles-only navigation. By its very nature, angles only navigation cannot determine the relative range to an object. Even as the dynamics associated with orbital rendezvous and proximity operations unfold, the relative range will generally remain unobservable. In this paper we confirm that an angles only navigation system can observe range if small maneuvers can be executed, and we show that the level of accelerometer accuracy determines how well the range can be observed...|$|R
