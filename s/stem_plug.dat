40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} kiwifruit host resistance and, in particular, of kiwifruit chitinases, in preventing infection by Botrytis cinerea. The effects of various host and pathogen factors on disease incidence were studied in artificial inoculation trials. High inoculum loads and addition of yeast extract to spore suspensions significantly increased infection, and most rots were visible within 6 - 8 weeks of harvest. In contrast, the average time taken for symptoms to appear increased (8 - 12 weeks), and total infection decreased when fruit were harvested {{later in the season}} or exposed to a curing treatment (6 - 24 h at 20 °C) following pedicel removal. These findings indicate that kiwifruit can develop postharvest resistance to B. cinerea. A range of chitinase assays, including four colorimetric, two fluorometric, a viscometric and a radiometric assay, were evaluated and adapted for use in the kiwifruit/B. cinerea system. Most published methods proved too insensitive to quantify the levels of chitinase in this system (160 - 6400 ng solubilized substrate/minute/g of <b>stem</b> <b>plug</b> tissue). However, a radioassay resolved two-fold concentration differences and distinguished ng/min/g amounts of activity in plant extracts. For detection of chitinase activity in gels after isoelectric focusing, a highly sensitive gel overlay assay was used. This assay was also adapted for use in petri dishes to facilitate rapid, qualitative screening of large numbers of fractions generated in the process of protein purification. Exochitinase activity was assessed using p-nitrophenyl-/β-D-N,N'-diacetylchitobiose as a substrate in a colorimetric assay. Differences between plant and fungal chitinases were evaluated by measuring exo- and endochitinase activities in healthy and diseased regions on live and autoclaved leaves. Endochitinase activity was associated with the plant, since it was found in both healthy and diseased areas on leaves, but was absent in autoclaved tissue which had been subsequently inoculated with the fungus. Conversely, equivalent amounts of exochitinase activity were present in diseased lesions on live and autoclaved leaves, but were absent from uninfected areas, showing that all exochitinase activity was of fungal origin. Enzyme activity was measured in the <b>stem</b> <b>plug</b> (picking scar wound and the underlying sclerified tissue), because this area was found to have higher chitinase and lower protease activity than {{the main body of the}} fruit. The initial level of endochitinase activity at harvest was not affected by fruit maturity, but subsequent increases in activity during coolstorage were most marked in later harvested, more mature fruit. Levels of chitinase in the stored fruit from four different harvests correlated with resistance to B. cinerea. Curing treatments (1 - 7 days at 20 °C prior to coolstorage) significantly reduced infection and induced activity of a single constitutive basic (pI≈ 9) 30 kDa protein with putative chitinase activity, but did not significantly increase total chitinase activity. At least one basic and two acidic isoforms were present in uncured, uninoculated healthy tissue, and inoculation with spores of B. cinerea appeared to induce new basic and acidic isoforms. Application of chitosan was evaluated as a potential technique for controlling stem end rot. Solubilization of chitosan required an acidic solvent, but use of this solvent without pH adjustment predisposed host tissue to disease. No chitosan treatment significantly decreased infection below the level found in the inoculated control, hence chitosan is considered unlikely to have commercial application. Cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography were used to purify to apparent homogeneity a protein with associated chitinase activity from cured kiwifruit stem plugs. The N-terminal sequence of this protein did not resemble any known chitinases, but exhibited 65 - 72 % amino acid identity with thaumatin-like (TL) proteins in barley and tobacco and 66 % with zeamatin in maize. This represents the first record of a TL protein in kiwifruit. Further analysis of the extract by Western blotting indicated that the previously ascribed chitinase activity was most probably due to small levels of contaminant chitinases. Properties of TL proteins include enzyme inhibition and membrane permeabilization of fungal hyphae. In addition, some thaumatins are sweet tasting. Further investigation is required to determine whether this compound influences resistance and taste in kiwifruit. Overall, the results from this study support the theory that chitinases are involved in kiwifruit resistance against B. cinerea, although the low level of induction relative to other crops and slowness of the response suggest that they are not the primary defence mechanism...|$|E

In order to maintain the <b>plug</b> <b>stem</b> packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The seat ring is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the seat ring contracts more than the seat ring. This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The seat ring has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|R

Wound healing occurs due to a proliferation of stem cells capable of restoring the injured tissue. The ability of adult stem cells to repair tissue is dependent upon the intrinsic ability of tissues to proliferate. The amazing capacity of embryonic stem cells to give rise to virtually any type of tissue has intensified the search for similar cell lineage in adults to treat various diseases including cardiovascular diseases. The ability to convert adult stem cells into pluripotent cells that resemble embryonic cells, and to transplant those in the desired organ for regenerative therapy is very attractive, and may offer the possibility of treating harmful disease-causing mutations. The race is on to find the best cells for treatment of cardiovascular disease. There is a need for the ideal stem cell, delivery strategies, myocardial retention, and time of administration in the ideal patient population. There are multiple modes of stem cell delivery to the heart with different cell retention rates that vary depending upon method and site of injection, such as intra coronary, intramyocardial or via coronary sinus. While there are crucial issues such as retention of <b>stem</b> cells, microvascular <b>plugging,</b> biodistribution, homing to myocardium, and various proapoptotic factors in the ischemic myocardium, the regenerative potential of stem cells offers an enormous impact on clinical applications in the management of cardiovascular diseases.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is: ''To create a sterilizable {{instrument}} that measures the compressive force in the axial direction of {{the neck of the}} hip implant during surgery''. This measured axial force in combination with a standardized ROM test could be used to objectively assess the soft tissue tension during surgery. It is expected that this instrument will be a helpful tool for inexperienced surgeons, because literature shows that errors made by the surgeon are the biggest cause of early failures and inexperienced surgeons registered twice as much dislocations as experienced surgeons. Therefore, the instrument could improve the success rate and quality of total hip arthroplasty by reducing the number of early failures caused by dislocation resulting from the inadequate soft tissue tension created by inexperienced surgeons. Furthermore, it could improve the patients' quality of living by reducing their limping and pain after the surgery. The current techniques to obtain the optimal length and angle of the implant are: preoperative radiography, intraoperative leg length assessment and subjective soft tissue tension assessment methods. Factors that influence soft tissue tension, apart from the implant, are either caused by the patient (inter- or intra-personal), the surgeon or the environment. Although a 3 DOF sensory system integrated in the test stem is preferable, it is likely that measuring only the axial force in a so called 'the neck' of the prosthesis, in combination with a standardized range of motion (ROM) test, provides valuable inside information about the relation between variation in force and success of the procedure. This assessment is not based measuring absolute forces, but on pattern recognition while moving the hip through its range of motion. The validity of this hypothesis should be investigated in future research. Different sensors have been tested to see if they survive the standard sterilization program of an autoclave, which uses hot steam at 134 degree Celsius, at a pressure of 2 bar for 20 minutes. The linear Hall sensor was chosen based on this test and a list of pros and cons. After that, a design was made in SolidWorks. Then it was manufactured and calibrated. The final prototype can be implanted in a few seconds when the stem is in place, by sliding it onto the <b>stem</b> and <b>plugging</b> it into a monitor. The device is intuitive to use, because the monitor produces real time graphs of the axial force that are easy to understand. Immediate adjustments to the soft tissue tension can be made by switching the head of the implant, while keeping the force sensing neck in place, in order to provide the greatest chance for surgical success. Furthermore, the device is highly reusable, because it can be sterilized with the standard autoclave procedure. Finally, the prototype was tested in a cadaver at the Erasmus hospital in Rotterdam. The axial hip force was measured at rest, when pulling the leg and when moving the leg through its range of motion. Although there were inaccuracies due to the elastic hysteresis of the rubber spring and friction of between axis and cylinder, consistent patterns in the measured axial hip force were observed. Recommendations are proposed in chapter 5 to reduce the errors caused by elastic hysteresis, friction and ROM tracking. Based on what was learned from the cadaver test and from literature, a standardized test proposal with hypothesis was made. This test should serve as a guideline to get consistent and useful results in future research. This future research should investigate if the axial force measured during these ROM tests provides enough information to objectively assess the soft tissue tension, or if more information is required. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to study the internal water relations,of ageing Gerbera inflorescences and their consequence on keepingquality of cut inflorescences. As {{in all parts of}} this paper, the term "flower" will be used to describe an inflorescence with its supporting stem. A great problem during vase-life of cut Gerbera flowers is ',stem break", a sudden bending of the stem. As described in part 1, this phenomenon was caused by a water shortage in the flower. The water-stress was a result of a decline of the absorption rate, due to an increase of the resistance to the water flow between the vase and the petals. In roses (which show a similar phenomenon) a water deficit in the flower-neck occurs because of competition between the various organs when the water supply is limiting (Zieslin et al., 1978). Also in the Gerbera flower {{there seems to be a}} competition for the available water, between flower head and stem. The increase in flow resistance causing stem break, was a result of microbial activity in the vase water. "Stem-plugging" by bacteria can be considerable already after 2 days for many flower species (Aarts, 1957). Silver-ions can extend keeping-quality of cut carnation flowers by their anti-ethylene effect (Halevy and Kofranek, 1977; Veen and Van de Geijn, 1978). However, the prevention of stem break by silver nitrate in the vase water is related to its bactericidal effect, as the mobility of silver supplemented as silver nitrate, is very low in flower stew (Veen and Van de Geijn, 1978; Nowak, 1979). Moreover, a pretreatment (1 - 24 h) of Gerbera stems with silver nitrate does not counteract the detrimental effect of etephon (Nowak, 1979). Mayak et al. (1977) demonstrated, that a pretreatment of the carnation stem with silver nitrate reduced the microbial population of the vase solution by the release of silver from the impregnated stem. They found that another important beneficial effect of such a pretreatment of the stem base is to decrease the toxic effect of metabolites produced by bacteria. So, the use of silver nitrate as a short pretreatment immediately after cutting will have advantages above other bactericides. There are 2 different pathways for water uptake by a Gerbera stem: a direct one through the xylem vessels at the cut surface and an indirect one through the cavity in the stem. Only the direct water uptake is strongly inhibited by bacterial activity in the vase water. Stem break can be prevented therefore without the use of chemicals by cutting the stem through the cavity in its center. The beneficial effect of this treatment could be improved by making a small hole in the stem as an air outlet from thecavity, together with a high water level in the vase in order to promote the rise of water inside the cavity. Stem stiffness consists of the strength from turgor of the cells and that of the structural elements. Gerbera cultivars with structurally strong stew do not show the phenomenon of stem break when a water deficit develops (De Jong, 1978). Breeding for flowers with structurally strong stems only will prevent stem break, however, not the water stress caused by microbial activity in the vase water. It is worthwhile therefore to select flowers not only with a structural strong stem, but also with a hollow one all the year round from an early stage of development. When Gerbera flowers were placed in water with silver nitrate, there was. still a gradual increase in the resistance for water flow through the stem ("physiological plugging") causing a decrease of water potential of the petals (part II). This decrease of petal water potential, however, was not accompanied by stem break. Possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy are discussed in detail in part II. The calculated resistance of the flower stem was obtained without induced pressure differences between 2 sides of a cut stem piece, so the results could not be due to artifacts caused by artificial pressures as suggested by Carpenter and Rasmussen (1973) for roses. The physiological plugging could be prevented by a constant low pH of the vase water. Even when the stem resistance for water flow remained constant at a low pH, water absorption of the cv. 'Wageningen Rood' became lower than transpiration after 5 days, resulting in a decrease of flower fresh weight and petal water content (as a percentage of dry weight and as relative water content). The water potential of the petals, however,' remained steady, which seems a rather conflicting result. It should be realised, that the pressure chamber method used for estimating petal water potential, actually measures the non-osmotic component of the xylem water potential. As there ate no semi-permeable membranes between petal xylem elements and vase water, it is an accurate value for calculating stem flow resistance, but not for the actual water potential of the petal cells. This problem is discussed in more detail later on. Ageing petals of cut Gerbera flowers without <b>stem</b> <b>plugging</b> (part Ill) showed that the water content (W. C.) as a percentage of dry weight was correlated with ion leakage (I. L.) and with petal dry weight (D. W.) as given by the formula: W. C. = a + b(I. L.) - c(I. L.) 2 - d(D. W.). The increase in W. C. during the first days of vase life of cut flowers was due to a decrease of dry weight, while the sudden decrease in W. C. after some days of vase life was correlated with an increase in I. L., indicating a change in the semi- permeability of the membranes. Flowers ageing on the plant did not show the sharp decrease of W. C., whereas also the increase of I. L. was absent. The date at which I. L. of cut flowers increased depended on the cultivar and was affected by temperature and cytokinin treatments. The influence of temperature on the onset of the decrease of W. C. and increase of I. L. showed the importance for keeping-quality of a low temperature during storage and transport of the flowers. In part IV is demonstrated that the internal water relations of ageing petal-tissue were influenced to a large extent when flowers were separated from the plant. Sap osmotic potential (ψ osm) of petals of cut flowers cv. 'Wageningen Rood' increased the first 6 days of vase life, followed by a decrease. Pressure potential (ψ press) decreased during the entire vase period. When flowers were left on the plant, ψ osm was steady during the first 6 days and increased thereafter, whereas ψ press was steady until day 6 and then decreased. This different behaviour of the various components of water potential was due to the increase of ion leakage of petal cells of ageing cut flowers, whereas ion leakage remained constant when flowers were ageing on the plant. An increase of ion leakage of petal cells will decrease the osmotic potential of the xylem fluid of the petals. This change in xylem osmotic potential will not influence the potential difference between vase water and petal cells and thus absorption rate of vase water. However, it will decrease the water potential of the petal cells and therefore water content, osmotic potential and pressure Potential. The increase of ion concentration of the xylem fluid of the petals will cause a water shortage in the petal cells, even when these cells still act as good osmometers. Comparison of the results with literature data are difficult because of different measuring techniques and experimental circumstances. Mayak et al. (1974) using an isopiestic method, found a decline of petal water potential after 6 days with roses. However, they demonstrated an increase in stem water flow resistance when the flowers aged. Osmotic values of ageing carnation petals as given by Mayak et al. (1978) are conflicting with that given by Acock and Nichols (1979). Changes in ion leakage from the petal cells dominate the petal water relations of cut Gerbera flowers as discussed already previously. To obtain a better understanding of factors involved in keeping-quality of cut flowers, it will be important to know more about the triggering processes inducing the changes in ion leakage. Some experiments in this aspect are described in parts V and VI. It is known for many plant 'species that root-synthesized cytokinins are transported to the shoots, while ageing of leaves is hastend by excising and retarded by exogenous cytokinins. Moreover, ageing of cut flowers can be retarded by application of cytokinins. Therefore, experiments were done to investigate if differences in ion leakage between Gerbera petals of flowers ageing in a vase and on the plant could be ascribed to differences in cytokinin activities (part V). Cytokinin activities in petal-extracts of 3 cultivars, differing in their keeping-quality, were also compared. Activities decreased when the flowers aged (except on day 8 of the experiment). However, there were no differences between flowers ageing in a vase or on the plant. With the 3 cultivars used, there was no correlation between cytokinin content of petals at day of harvest and their keeping-quality. The results suggest strongly that no correlation exists between cytokinin activities of Gerbera petal cells and changes in their ion leakage. From the data given in part VI, it is concluded that changes in pressure potential of Gerbera petal cells can induce changes in the leakage of ions from the cells. The positive results of "pulsing" flowers, either with sugar (Kohl and Rundle, 1972; Mayak et al., 1973; Nichols, 1974; Sacalis and Chin, 1976) or mineral salts (Halevy, 1976), could also be a result of enhancing the pressure potential of the petal cells. Carnation flowers grown under dry conditions kept longer than those grown under moist irrigation regime (Hanan and Jasper, 1969; Mayak and Kofranek, 1976). It is likely, that the "dry grown" flowers have a higher pressure potential at the same water potential, than the "moist grown" flowers, as was found with leaves of plants grown in culture solutions with different osmotic potential (Jarvis and Jarvis, 1963). For the 3 Gerbera cultivars used, there was a correlation between their keeping-quality and their pressure potential at day of harvest. When a decrease of pressure potential initiates an increase of ion leakage, and subsequently causes a decrease of water content, the process of ageing will accelerate itself, once it has began. There seems to be a discrepancy between the conclusion that pressure potential of petal cells influences ion leakage of the cells and the data in Fig. 4 of part III where induced changes of water content did not influence ion leakage. The changes in water content in part III, however, were induced within 24 h, while the results in part VI were obtained when pressure potential was influenced during some days. The dominant influence of ion leakage on water relations, as demonstrated in parts III and IV, and the results of part VI suggest strongly that keeping pressure potential of flower petals above a certain level will be very important for a good keeping-quality of cut flowers. It might be possible that pressure potential at day of harvest, can be a selection criterion for potential keeping-quality of cut flowers. ...|$|R
