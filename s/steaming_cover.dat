40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a novel drying system {{which includes a}} superheated steam drying and a hot air drying. The conventional viscose fiber drying is experimental studied and the drying quality and energy consumption were analyzed. In the experiments, the temperature of superheated <b>steam</b> <b>covered</b> the range from 120 ˚C to 150 ˚C and, hot air temperature is about 80 ˚C. A series of drying kinetics curves were determined to optimize the operation parameters. The {{results show that the}} combined drying has high energy efficiency because of the exhaust heat recovery from superheated drying period...|$|R

50|$|Tamale-making is {{a ritual}} {{that has been}} part of Mexican life since pre-Hispanic times, when special {{fillings}} and forms were designated for each specific festival or life event. Today, tamales are typically filled with meats, cheese or vegetables, especially chilies. Preparation is complex, time-consuming and an excellent example of Mexican communal cooking, where this task usually falls to the women. Tamales are a favorite comfort food in Mexico, eaten as both breakfast and dinner, and often accompanied by hot atole or champurrado and arroz con leche (rice pudding) or maize-based beverages of indigenous origin. Street vendors can be seen serving them from huge, <b>steaming,</b> <b>covered</b> pots (tamaleras) or ollas.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, {{like most}} other methods of <b>steaming,</b> a <b>cover</b> is {{necessary}} to allow the trapped heat and steam to thoroughly cook the food. Canvas tarps or potato sacks soaked in sea water are often used for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|The rebuild did {{not just}} involve the {{installation}} of a new boiler; the entire locomotive underwent modification. The most obvious external change was the <b>steam</b> space <b>cover</b> running {{the length of the}} boiler barrel and copied from the ČSD Class 477.0, which lent the locomotives a sleek, modern appearance. The large smoke deflectors too were replaced by smaller ones with the upper front corners clipped off at an angle.|$|R
50|$|In the 3001 {{class the}} steam chest was located {{underneath}} the cylinders, and contained two slide valves. The inverted {{placement of the}} valves allowed them to drop away {{from the face of}} the steam ports when steam was shut off, thus reducing wear. The steam chest and valves lay above the front carrying axle, and there was sufficient clearance to allow the <b>steam</b> chest <b>cover</b> to be removed over the axle for maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The DR {{planned to}} replace them with the Neubau diesel {{locomotives}} of DR Class V 36.48. However, because trials with the two prototypes were not promising, 20 of the former Saxon engines underwent extensive modernisation in 1962. To begin with the locomotives were given new welded boilers, and later a new welded locomotive frame as well. External identification marks of the upgraded locomotives are the missing sandbox on the boiler and the flatter <b>steam</b> dome <b>cover.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear, {{controlled by}} steam reversing gear. The cylinders and steam chests were formed in three separate castings. The high-pressure cylinders were arranged with piston valves, while the low-pressure cylinders were arranged with Richardson balanced type slide valves, arranged above the cylinders. The <b>steam</b> chest <b>covers</b> of the low-pressure cylinders were designed with inclined joint faces {{to facilitate the}} handling of the valve and refacing of the ports during servicing.|$|R

5000|$|Further {{towards the}} stern on the boiler deck was the ladies saloon, which {{included}} six rooms, painted {{in a different}} color from the dining room. One of the rooms had been fitted up as a ladies toilet, in which the pumps kept “continuous jets of water playing, while the boat is in motion, so that no offensive effluvia taints these sumptuous cabins.” [...] During winter, this area was heated by a <b>steam</b> radiator <b>covered</b> a marble slab. [...] At night the room was lit by nickel-plated lamps.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were typically}} American in their design and construction, with bar frames, overhead equalised springing and very spacious steel cabs. They had an elegant look, {{brought about by}} the flared copper-top chimney and large brass <b>steam</b> dome <b>cover.</b> When built they were painted in the then-standard VR green livery and were kept in immaculate condition, in accordance with standards of the era. During the early 20th century they were painted in Canadian Pacific Red, and then in the 1920s the entire class received the standard livery adopted at that time - all-over black.|$|R
50|$|Replacing {{the axle}} with a bogie of {{conventional}} design would have obstructed {{access to the}} port faces. Dean instead used a suspension bogie, in which {{the weight of the}} locomotive was transferred upwards to the bogie by four bolts mounted on the inside frames. The centre pin of the bogie rotated in a spring-centred block mounted beneath the steam chest on cross beams. This setup gave sufficient clearance so that, when the bolts were undone, {{the front end of the}} locomotive raised, and the bogie was run out from underneath, the <b>steam</b> chest <b>cover</b> could be removed without hindrance.|$|R
50|$|The {{expansion}} stroke of the <b>steam</b> engine <b>covers</b> piston travel from {{top dead center}} to bottom dead center. When the piston reverses to return to top dead center, an exhaust valve needs to open so that the expanded steam from the previous stroke can be released from the cylinder. The WHE engine has an exhaust valve in each piston actuated by a protrusion on the connecting rod (see figure to right). On the exhaust stroke {{the angle of the}} connecting rod causes it to open the piston valve, allowing expanded steam to exhaust into the crankcase.|$|R

Richmond was taking on coal from the schooner, Joseph N. Toone, when Manassas rammed Richmond tearing a hole in the sloop's side. Passing aft, the ram tried but failed to hit Richmond again before disappearing astern. Richmond's gunners got away one complete broadside from the port battery though, somewhat evening the score.|$|R

50|$|The {{two main}} {{applications}} of <b>steam</b> power <b>covered</b> were <b>steam</b> cars and small steam launches. Much of the magazine's content was influenced, if not indeed written, by skilled and enthusiastic amateurs describing their own projects and so {{their choice of}} these projects influenced the magazine's own direction. Steam turbines and large steamships were less frequent, being beyond the constructional capacity of most readers, but they were described as news items when particularly interesting events took place. One aspect that oddly was only lightly covered {{was the use of}} steam on railways, unusually so as the magazine's heyday coincided with the demise of mainline steam but with increasing interest in the railway and steam preservation movements.|$|R

5|$|Water is a {{chemical}} substance that {{is composed of}} hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or <b>steam.</b> Water <b>covers</b> 71% of the Earth's surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% {{in the air as}} vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.|$|R
