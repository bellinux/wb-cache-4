25|$|Later, {{the scandal}} behind P.J. {{is that in}} order to receive his trust fund he must marry before he turns 28 years old, and so he proposes to Naomi, unbeknownst to her. Annie finds out about the clause and tells P.J. to come clean to Naomi, which he is about to but {{chickens}} out and ask if she will take his last name instead of saying what he should have. Annie and the girls are with Naomi at a wedding dress store and Annie tells Naomi about P.J's secret. As Naomi learns the truth, she breaks off the engagement. While Dixon is away, Austin returns to town and suggests that Adrianna should start a country music career with his help. Adrianna accepts his offer. But as Austin becomes her manager, he also has his eyes set on steering Adrianna away from Dixon. Navid also returns and reveals that he wants to resume his relationship with Silver, who has found out she has the cancer gene. This causes a dramatic turn, as both Liam and Navid want to be with Silver. A fight breaks out between Liam and Navid during the premiere of Liam's new movie. As a result, Silver decides to side with Navid. Meanwhile, Naomi is the event planner for a young woman named Madison who is enthused by her upcoming nuptials. Naomi gets the shock of her life when she learns that the groom-to-be is none other than Max, her ex-boyfriend. At the bachelor party Max questions Naomi, asking her if he is doing the right thing, and before she can reply is interrupted by Max's fiancée. During the rehearsal wedding, Holly's mother offers Naomi a job offer that she cannot refuse. Naomi takes the offer, but at the airport is talked out of it by Austin because she is still in love with Max. As the wedding of Madison and Max begins, Naomi abruptly interrupts the services and confesses her love for Max. Elsewhere, Ivy is seen going off to Mexico to be with Diego, who was deported because he was an illegal immigrant in the U.S., and only ask for a one-way ticket. Diego and Ivy had begun dating and Diego had helped cease the pain she had been feeling after Raj's death. Diego was arrested for illegal graffiti, and that is why he was being deported. Annie and Caleb break off their relationship because Caleb cannot leave the covenant for Annie; nor does <b>she</b> <b>think</b> he should. Navid reveals that he isn't ready to have a baby, which causes Silver to dump him. She still wants to conceive a child and proposes to have a baby...with Teddy. At {{the very end of the}} season finale, Adrianna is boarding a plane to Las Vegas to kickstart her country music career because Dixon has not returned on time from the tour, but little does she know the car broke down and he had to hitchhike. As Dixon is on the phone with Navid telling him to stop Adrianna, a truck hits Dixon's car and it is left unknown if Dixon is still alive.|$|E

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did <b>she</b> <b>think</b> I was doing?

2500|$|Despite the UDA women {{having found}} Ogilby guilty, the two UDA men {{present at the}} [...] "trial" [...] couldn't reach a verdict and gave orders that she be released. The women drove her to the Glengall Street bus station where she got on a bus headed for the YWCA hostel she had moved to on the Malone Road. The women then [...] "rearrested" [...] her. It was alleged that this {{decision}} came about after she sarcastically remarked in reference to Douglas, [...] "Who does <b>she</b> <b>think</b> she is? The Queen?" [...] which had freshly infuriated Douglas and the others. Blocking the bus as it {{pulled out of the}} station into the street, Douglas and her [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] then boarded the bus and dragged her off into the waiting car for a further grilling. Minutes later, after being alerted by the bus station staff, the car was stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Although Douglas claimed {{they were on their way}} to a party, the querying policeman told the women about the report of one of them having been forced off the bus. In an attempt to mollify Douglas, Ogilby then spoke up admitting that she was the person who had been removed from the bus but that [...] "It was nothing. Just a couple of us fooling around". The police however remained unconvinced of their claims and the eight women and Ogilby were taken into the RUC Queen Street station for questioning. All of the women were asked for their names and addresses; the majority lived in the Sandy Row area. [...] Fearing the grisly fate that typically befell informers, Ogilby did not say anything to the RUC about the UDA kangaroo court or threats against her. Therefore, she and the eight other women were released without being charged the following morning at 2.00 a.m. Ogilby returned to the police station a few hours later, visibly frightened, but was sent home in a taxi after refusing to give the reason for her distress. That same day inside a Sandy Row pub, Douglas told the other women that Ogilby was a troublemaker who had to die, and she speedily made arrangements to facilitate the murder.|$|E
