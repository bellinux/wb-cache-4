40|$|Rose apple or jambu (Syzygium jambos L.), <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> (Eugenia uniflora L.) are {{tropical}} fruits from Madeira Island. Rose apple is reddish and rose-scented while <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> {{is a small}} eight-ribbed fruit, {{of about}} 2 - 3 cm and ranges from orange to red colour. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate their antioxidant activity using two methods, β-carotene bleaching assay and 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•) scavenging assay. The extract concentration providing 50 % inhibition of DPPH radical (EC 50) was calculated from the graph of scavenging effect percentage against extract concentration in the solution. The β-carotene bleaching assay studied the ability of the extracts to avoid the oxidative bleaching of β-carotene in a β-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion. DPPH• reduction assay showed higher antioxidant activity of <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> (EC 50 = 3. 74 ± 0. 09 mg/mL) than Rose apple (EC 50 = 10. 0 ± 0. 21 mg/mL). β-carotene bleaching assay showed an antioxidant activity capacity (AAC) also higher for <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> (AAC= 831. 5) than for Rose apple (AAC= 582. 5). <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> showed better antioxidant capacity in both trials. Madeira Island has many tropical fruits with antioxidant activity, which could improve health status, by preventing diseases caused by oxidative stress, since these bioactive compounds can help to counteract the oxidizing agents. The results of this study indicate that both Rose apple and <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> have potential as antioxidants sources. In the future more research is needed in order to identify the compounds responsible for the antioxidant properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to know and assess natural {{infestation}} of frugivorous flies (Diptera: Tephritidae and Lonchaeidae) and their parasitoids in <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits. The survey was conducted in an organic orchard, located in the municipality of Maceió, Alagoas. From October 2010 to January 2011, mature green, half-ripe and ripe <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> were collected. Infestation index was higher for mature green and half-ripe fruits. Five species of frugivorous flies were identified: Anastrepha fraterculus, Anastrepha obliqua, Anastrepha sororcul, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), and Neosilba pendula (Diptera: Lonchaeidae). It were identified the parasitoids: Doryctobracon areolatus, Opius bellus, Utetes anastrephae and Asobara anastrephae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), being D. areolatus with highest percentage of parasitism in all maturation stages. N. pendula was recorded in Brasil associated to Eugenia uniflora L. (Myrtaceae). O. bellus, U. anastrephae and A. anastrephae were also recorded for the first time in the State of Alagoas.

40|$|Madeira Island {{is a prime}} {{location}} {{for the production of}} some exotic and tropical fruits, such as Cattley guava (Psidium cattleianum Sabine), rose apple (Syzygium jambos L.) and <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> (Eugenia uniflora L.). They all have distinct antioxidant characteristics that are still scarcely studied. The extracts of these fruits were evaluated regarding their total phenolic compounds (TPC) and total flavonoids content. The TPC assay relies on the transfer of electrons from phenolic compounds to phosphomolybdic/phosphotungstic acid complexes in alkaline medium. These are determined spectrophotometrically at 765 nm. The content of total flavonoids was also measured, spectrophotometrically, by using the aluminium chloride colorimetric assay. TPC results are given in gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 100 g and the results of total flavonoids in epicatechin equivalents (ECE) per 100 g. Phenolic compounds are considered to be antioxidants, scavengers of free radicals, metal chelators, antimutagens, and signalling agents and flavonoids act on several different synergistic pathways as both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Therefore, the consumption of fruits with high content on these compounds is important. The following order was found for TPC content in the analysed fruits: Rose apple (36. 1 mg GAE/ 100 g) < <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> (57. 9 mg GAE/ 100 g) < Cattle guava (109 mg GAE/ 100 g). Regarding flavonoids content the following order was found: <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> (37. 2 mg ECE / 100 g) < Cattle guava (72. 4 mg ECE / 100 g) < Rose apple (168. 9 mg ECE / 100 g). Cattle guava presented about 3 times more phenolics than rose apple, but rose apple contained about 4. 5 times more flavonoids than <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry.</b> Some properties like antioxidant activity of Madeira island fruits remain uncharacterized, therefore these studies are very important to provide information to the population about the health benefits of their consumption.

Branches and leaves were collected every two weeks during the 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 crops in <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> orchards situated in the city of Pelotas, state of Rio Grande do Sul, and taken to the laboratory for gall counting. Out of the collected material, ten leaves were isolated per sample into plastic containers (200 ml) with 30 ml of agar solution (2 %) and methylparahydroxybenzoate (nipagin) (0. 2 %). The containers were closed and kept under temperature-controlled conditions (24 ± 2 ºC), relative humidity (70 ± 10 %) and photophase (14 h). The number of emerged insects was daily reported. As a result, one species of Hymenoptera, Rileya hegeli (Eurytomidae) as a parasitoid of E. dispar was obtained. In relation to the population dynamics of the E. dispar and of the R. hegeli, during two years of evaluation it was noticed that the population of both species had an increase from October, and the largest populations were achieved in December, January and February, and then, decreasing onward. The number of galls per leave varied from zero to 23 and 61. 19 % of the leaves had one to eight galls. The number of leaves with galls in a branch varied from one to nine, and 63. 00 % of the branches had one to three infested leaves...|$|E
40|$|Madeira Island is a Portuguese {{region with}} {{excellent}} climate {{conditions for the}} production of some exotic and tropical fruits, such as, <b>surinam</b> <b>cherry</b> (Eugenia uniflora) and tree tomato (Solanum betaceum). The production of such fruits has increased in the last years due to their attractive sensorial properties and because they are claimed to be a good source of vitamins and other bioactive compounds, like polyphenols or carotenoids. Because of this new and emerging market, there is a growing demand and need for new studies regarding the consumption and health benefits of such fruits. Food composition databases (FCDB) provide detailed information on nutritionally important components in foods. However, in some FCDB there is a significant lack of information on the nutritional composition of traditional fruits. Analytical methods are critical elements for the correct and accurate determination of bioactive compounds. This review focuses on the traditional fruits from Madeira Island and it was found that most of the reported studies in the literature, only determine antioxidant activity (most of the time using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity method and/or Folin-Ciocalteu assay), and/or proximate composition of these fruits. Therefore, bioactive compounds are not frequently identified and quantified in traditional fruits. Although fruits cultivated in temperate parts of the world have already been and continue to be studied for their nutritional and health-promoting value, traditional fruits from Madeira Island remain an expansive and potentially novel source of natural products that up to now have not been characterized.

For this reason, an investigation was undertaken with a view to determining the efficacy {{of the effects of the}} brute aqueous extract (BAE) of the leaves of Psidium guajava (guava), Stachytarpheta cayenensis (bastard vervain), Polygonum punctatum (water. smartweed), Eugenia uniflora (Brazil or <b>Surinam</b> <b>cherry)</b> and Aster squamatus (zé-da-silva) on the intestinal transport of water in rats and on the gastrointestinal propulsion in mice. With the exception of the BAE of S. cayenensis, all other BAE's have increased the absorption of water in one or more intestinal portion in relation to the control group. All tested BAE, except that of P. punctatum, reduced the gastrointestinal propulsion in relation to that of the control group. The results indicate that the BAE of the leaves of P. guajava, S. cayenensis, P. punctatum, E. uniflora and A. squamatus have a potential antidiarrhoeic effect to be confirmed by additional investigations in animals infected with enteropathogenic agents. Para combater a diarréia muitas vezes as pessoas utilizam extratos de plantas conhecidas popularmente como anti-diarréicas, mesmo sem base científica. Em razão disto, verificou-se o efeito do extrato aquoso bruto (EAB) das folhas da Psidium guajava (goiabeira), Stachytarpheta cayenensis (gervão), Polygonum punctatum (polígono ou pimenta d'água), Eugenia uniflora (pitangueira) e Aster squamatus (zé-da-silva) no transporte intestinal de água em ratos e na propulsão gastrointestinal em camundongos. Com exceção do EAB de S. cayenensis, os demais aumentaram a absorção de água em uma ou mais porções do intestino em relação ao grupo-controle. Todos os EAB testados, com exceção do P. punctatum, reduziram o trânsito intestinal em relação ao grupo-controle. Com base nos resultados obtidos conclui-se que os EAB das folhas de P. guayava, S. cayenensis, P. punctatum, E. uniflora e A. squamatus têm potencial ação anti-diarréica, a ser confirmada em novas investigações em animais infectados por agentes enteropatogênicos.

Verificou-se que as condições ótimas de rendimento para o processo foram as de 40 ºC e 300 bar e a 60 ºC, nas pressões de 250 e 300 bar, que corresponderam aos rendimentos: 3, 68, 3, 54 e 3, 96 %, respectivamente. Os extratos das folhas obtidos por extração supercrítica, por hidrodestilação e por microextração em fase sólida foram caracterizados. Os compostos majoritários encontrados no extrato obtido por hidrodestilação foram curzereno (34, 76 %), germacreno B (11, 84 %) e C 15 H 20 O 2 (9, 56 %). Os compostos: ß-elemeno, ß-cariofileno e ?-elemeno estão presentes tanto no óleo essencial das folhas como também no extrato obtido por microextração em fase sólida. O composto majoritário presente nos extratos supercríticos foi o C 15 H 20 O 2 seguido de curzereno e germacreno B. Pelo método de DPPH (1, 1 -difenil- 2 -pirilhidrazina) o extrato obtido com álcool hidratado é o que apresenta maior atividade antioxidante, visto o maior conteúdo de fenóis totais, dentre todos os extratos obtidos das folhas de E. uniflora. O valor da atividade antioxidante expressa em CI 50 para o extrato etanólico das folhas de pitangueira foi 16, 95 µg/mL.

40|$|The polyhydroxylated {{alkaloids}} uniflorines A and B {{were isolated}} in 2000 from {{the leaves of}} the tree Eugenia uniflora L. The common name for this tree is <b>Surinam</b> <b>Cherry</b> and the water soluble extracts of its leaves have been used as an antidiabetic agent in Paraguayan traditional medicine. Uniflorines A and B showed moderate activity in inhibiting the -glucosidases, rat intestinal maltase (IC 50 values of 12 and 4. 0 M, respectively) and sucrase (IC 50 values of 3. 1 and 1. 8 M, respectively). Uniflorines A and B were deduced from NMR analysis to have pentahydroxyindolizidine structures. In 2004 Davis and Pyne reported the synthesis of the proposed structure of uniflorine A. Unfortunately, the NMR spectroscopic data of this synthetic material did not match with those of natural uniflorine A. Davis and Pyne then assumed that the structure of uniflorine A must be a diastereomer of the initially proposed structure. Several other diastereomers of the proposed structure, that were epimeric in the A-ring, have been synthesised by other researchers. One remaining A-ring diastereomer was the C- 2 epimer of the proposed structure. In Chapter 2 of this thesis we report the synthesis of this compound in 11 synthetic steps and in 0. 5 % overall yield from L-xylose. However the NMR spectroscopic data for this synthesic compound did not match with those of the natural product. We then re-examined the NMR spectroscopic data of the natural product and revised the structures of uniflorines A and B from initially proposed pentahydroxyindolizidines to 1, 2, 6, 7 -tetrahydroxy- 3 -hydroxymethylpyrrolizidines. Uniflorine B was the known alkaloid casuarine, while uniflorine A was tentatively assigned as 6 -epi-casuarine. This was confirmed by the synthesis of the enantiomer of 6 -epi-casuarine and then 6 -epi-casuarine itself. These syntheses are reported in Chapters 2. 2 and 2. 3. The total synthesis of uniflorine A (6 -epi-casuarine) was achieved in 11 steps and in 13 % overall yield from L-xylose. The NMR spectroscopic data of this synthetic compound matched with those of the natural product uniflorine A. Thus we had successfully determined the correct structures of uniflorines A and B. Glycosidase inhibitor testing of uniflorine A at 143 M showed it had 94 - 97 % inhibition against the -D-glucosidases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus sterothermophilus and the amyloglucosidase of Aspergillus niger. The IC 50 values were only determinated for the two aforementioned -D-glucosidases and were found to be modest at 34 and 28 M, respectively. In addition, we describe a flexible method for the diastereoselective total synthesis of several natural and unnatural polyhydroxylated indolizidines and pyrrolizidines from a common precursor. The synthesis of the alkaloid casuarine, which was obtained in total of 13 synthetic steps and in 8 % overall yield from L-xylose, is described in Chapter 3. A key step in this synthesis was a regioselective epoxide ring-opening reaction with hydrogensulfate ion. This reaction secured the correct configurations at C- 6 and C- 7 of the target molecule. In Chapter 4 we describe the successful synthesis of australine in a total of 14 steps and 6 % overall yield from from L-xylose. Key steps in this synthesis were a regioselective epoxide ring-opening reaction with LiAlH 4 followed by a Mitsunobu reaction that secured the correct configuration C- 7 of the target molecule. The synthesis of the natural product 3 -epi-casuarine was completed in 13 steps and in 0. 4 % overall yield. This synthesis required an inversion of configuration at C- 3 ’ of the butyl side chain which was achieved using the Mitsunobu reaction. The low overall yield was due to a low yielding epoxide ring-opening reaction due to a competing intramolecular epoxide ring-opening reactions involving the 3 [...] hydroxymethyl substituent. Natural 3 -epi-australine was obtained in total of 14 synthetic steps and in 2 % overall yield, all from L-xylose. This synthesis required an inversion of configuration at C- 3 ’ of the butyl side chain which was achieved using the Mitsunobu reaction. Key steps in this synthesis were a regioselective epoxide ring-opening reaction with LiAlH 4 followed by a Mitsunobu reaction that secured the correct configuration C- 7 of the target molecule. From this work a number of novel unnatural indolizidine and pyrrolizidine compounds were also obtained as side products. Some of these compounds were screened against 10 different glycosidases at 800 g/mL. Unfortunately, none showed strong inhibition with only four compounds showing approximately 40 - 50 % inhibition at this relative high concentration...|$|E
