It is obtained that the displacement output curve of the hydraulic cylinder by changing the rolling different strip thickness. Finally contrasting the input and output spectrum curve, it found that given the vibration signal by hydraulic system can transfer to the hydraulic cylinder.

40|$|Dynamic {{characteristic}} {{analysis of}} a two-stand reversible cold rolling mill in the startup process was carried out. The delay algorithm of the interstand thickness was proposed. A new method combined with the accelerated secant and the tangent methods was established to solve the simultaneous equations. The thickness and interstand tension transition processes with different static tension establishing processes were analyzed. Both mills were operated under constant rolling force control mode in the above process. The {{results show that the}} strip thickness in the rolling gap reduces in the static mill <b>screwdown</b> process. The entry stand runs inversely to establish the static interstand tension. This area becomes an abnormal thickness reduction area of the incoming strip. It results in several abnormal interstand tension increases in the subsequent startup process. The tension increase leads to an impact force on the strip that is the main reason of the strip breakage in the startup process. So the static tension establishing process was optimized, and the interstand tension fluctuation and the strip breakage accidents both reduced significantly. The results are beneficial to the startup process of the two-stand reversible cold rolling mill...|$|E
40|$|The Force Feed Forward (FFF) System is {{the only}} hot strip mill AGC {{system in the world}} today which does not {{incorporate}} the BISRA principle for gage control. Instead, using a revolutionary control algorithm, FFF has proven in five installations in North and South America, that steelmakers need not replace their existing electro-mechanical <b>screwdowns</b> with hydraulic cylinders in order to achieve world-class thickness tolerances. The current version of the System in conjunction with electro-mechanical <b>screwdowns</b> achieves gage performance equal to that published for some hydraulic AGC (HAGC) mills, and exceeds that of any electro-mechanical mills. This performance can be obtained {{at a fraction of the}} cost of HAGC systems while requiring no mill down time. Moreover an FFF installation requires only about nine (9) months after which time the System is fully operational at the specified gage performance. One of the factors responsible for this high level of gage control is the unique method by which the System deals with the problem of roll stack eccentricity. This paper describes that method. Furthermore, although FFF is an extremely cost-effective alternative to HAGC, this paper also demonstrates that the System can produce significant improvement in eccentricity contro...|$|R
