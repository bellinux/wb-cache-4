40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} effects of intratracheal general {{anesthesia}} (ITGA) and regional (<b>saddle</b> <b>block)</b> <b>anesthesia</b> on leptin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cortisol blood concentrations during anorectal surgery. Methods: Fifty-eight patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease, pilonidal sinus, anal fissure, or anal fistula were included the study. Patients were randomly assigned {{into one of the}} two groups (n[*]=[*] 29). Patients in one group received ITGA. After thiopental and fentanyl induction, vecuronium was used as a muscle relaxant. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. In the other group we applied saddle block, injecting hyperbaric bupivacaine into the subarachnoid space, through the L 3 -L 4 intervertebral space, in the sitting position. Blood samples were collected for leptin, CRP, and cortisol analysis before the induction of anesthesia at 3 and 24 hours postoperatively. Results: Preoperative leptin, CRP, and cortisol concentrations were comparable between the groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} postoperative levels of leptin and CRP in both groups. Although not significant, leptin and CRP concentrations were lower in the saddle block group at three hours postoperatively (mean[*]±[*]SD, 6. 95 [*]±[*] 8. 59 and 6. 02 [*]±[*] 12. 25, respectively) than in the ITGA group (mean[*]±[*]SD, 9. 04 [*]±[*] 9. 89 and 8. 40 [*]±[*] 15. 75, respectively). During early postoperative period, cortisol increased slightly in the ITGA group and remained at similar level in the saddle block group, but later decreased in both groups. Cortisol levels in the saddle block group were significantly lower than in the ITGA group at 3 hours postoperatively (343. 7 [*]±[*] 329. 6 vs 611. 4 [*]±[*] 569. 8; P[*]=[*] 0. 034).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relative risk of perinatal complications in common childhood disorders. Specifically, the ability of perinatal complications to predict membership into children's disorders was studied. The sample consisted of 634 normal children and children with mental retardation, learning disabilities, and emotional handicaps, whose mothers completed the Maternal Perinatal Scale (WS). Seven MPS items significantly contributed {{to the prediction of}} the mentally retarded, learning disabled, emotionally handicapped, and regular education groups. The two significant discriminant functions correctly classified about 46 % of the students, with the greatest misclassification occuring for those with emotional handicaps. When the separate disorders were collapsed to form a single group, eleven MPS items significantly contributed to the prediction of the special education and regular education groups. The linear composite from discriminant function analysis correctly classified about 74 % of the students. Some 89 % of the special education students were correctly classified. When MPS factors were used as predictors, 90 % of the special education students were correctly classified. Seven MPS factors comprised the discriminant function. Relative risk ratios were computed for each perinatal item. Significant relative risk ratios included maternal weight over 151 pounds, <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> no anesthesia, stress during pregnancy, prenatal care, medically induced labor, unplanned pregnancy, medication use during pregnancy, hypoxia, and cigarette use during pregnancy. An overall relative risk of 6. 35 was computed based on the linear composite of perinatal variables defined by the discriminant function, suggesting that a suggesting that a synergism of perinatal complications makes a child over 6 {{times more likely to be}} placed in special education. A second overall relative risk of 3. 83 was derived from the linear composite of MPS factor scores. This indicated that children with a perinatal history marked by this particular combination of perinatal complications were nearly 4 times as likely to require special educational services. Results were discussed in terms of comorbidity among special education categories. The potential use of the MPS as a screener for early intervention was also discussed.

40|$|Background: Spinal {{anesthesia}} is {{the technique}} of choice in transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). The major complication of spinal technique is risk of hypotension. <b>Saddle</b> <b>block</b> paralyzed pelvic muscles and sacral nerve roots and hemodynamic derangement is less. Aims and objectives: To compare the hemodynamic changes and adequate surgical condition between <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> and subarachnoid block for TURP. Material and methods: Ninety patients of aged between 50 to 70 years of ASA-PS I, II scheduled for TURP were randomly allocated into 2 groups of 45 in each group. Group A patients were received spinal (2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine) and Group B were received <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> (2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine). Baseline systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation were recorded and measured subsequently. The height of block was noted in both groups. Hypotension was corrected by administration of phenylephrine 50 mcg bolus and total requirement of vasopressor was noted. Complications (volume overload, TURP syndrome etc.) were noted. Results: Incidence of hypotension and vasopressor requirement was less (P < 0. 01) in Gr B patients. Adequate surgical condition was achieved in both groups. There was no incidence of volume overload, TURP syndrome, and bladder perforation.

Design Prospective case series. Setting Tertiary university hospital. Patients A total of 441 consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy under cervical <b>block</b> and monitored <b>anesthesia</b> care using midazolam and narcotics were included. Patients with known multiglandular, familial, or secondary hyperparathyroidism or noninformative preoperative localization or those electing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy under GA were excluded. Intervention All patients underwent cervical <b>block</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and focused exploration using minimally invasive techniques. Main Outcome Measure Intraoperative need for conversion from cervical <b>block</b> <b>anesthesia</b> to general endotracheal anesthesia. Results: Of the 441 patients, 47 (10. 6 %) required conversion to GA. In all instances, conversion was performed in a controlled fashion using neuromuscular blockade, endotracheal intubation, and maintenance of the original surgical field preparation. Sixteen procedures were converted to accomplish simultaneous thyroid resections. An additional 15 were converted because the intraoperative parathyroid hormone level failed to decrease by at least 50 % from the baseline after resection of the incident parathyroid tumor and extensive exploration was required. Eight procedures were converted because of technical difficulties related to ensuring adequate protection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Five procedures were converted to optimize patient comfort, and 2 were converted because of the intraoperative recognition of parathyroid carcinoma. One patient experienced a toxic reaction to lidocaine, causing a seizure. Conclusions :The vast majority of minimally invasive parathyroidectomies can be performed using cervical <b>block</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> However, conversion to GA is appropriate when unexpected intraoperative findings are encountered or for patient comfort...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Regional (<b>saddle</b> <b>block)</b> {{anaesthesia}} in anorectal {{and some}} urological and gynaecological procedures provides suitable {{conditions for the}} surgeon due to the sufficiency of analgesia and decreases {{the side effects of}} spinal anaesthesia. In this study, duration of the painless period and complications after <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> with Meperidine (pethidine) were assessed in perineal surgeries. Materials and Methods:This study was conducted on 50 cases observed by the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class I, II(21 - 70 years old patients), who were scheduled to undergo anorectal surgery. All patients received 500 ml of crystalloid solution. The <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> was done with 30 mg pethidine and sub arachnoid puncture was performed with the patient in the sitting position. Vital signs were recorded 5 minutes before the block and at the 5 th, 10 th, 15 th and 60 th minutes after the block. The severity of postoperative pain was assessed by a visual analog scale. The data was analyzed by appropriate descriptive statistical methods. Results: The mean period of analgesia was more than 24 hours in 18 % of the patients. The VAS pain score showed no pain in 78 % of the patients. Sixteen percent of the patients complained of itching in the nose, face and chest, ten minutes after injection and it continued for about two hours. Conclusions: This study showed that the haemodynamic stability and quality of postoperative analgesia with pethidine was good, without any need for additional analgesia.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the utility of carotid {{shunting}} in the context of eversion endarterectomy. A comparison of patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy by eversion with and without shunts was performed. Methods: Over a 5 -year period, 2724 eversion carotid endarterectomies were performed. In most of these operations patients were under cervical <b>block</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> A shunt was used in 112 eversion endarterectomies (4. 1 %). Cervical <b>block</b> <b>anesthesia</b> was used in 103 patients (92. 0 %), general anesthesia was used in 5 patients (4. 5 %), and 4 patients (3. 6 %) were converted from cervical <b>block</b> to general <b>anesthesia</b> intraoperatively. The indications for shunting were neurologic deterioration in 99 patients (88. 4 %) who were under cervical <b>block</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> procedures performed in neurologically unstable or otherwise compromised patients who were under general anesthesia, and the operator's discretion in the remaining eight patients. Results: There was a combined stroke/death rate of 2. 7 % in the shunt group. These three cases included one death from myocardial infarction and one delayed death due to intracerebral hemorrhage after discharge. Shunt insertion was unrelated to the negative outcome in these two cases. One perioperative major stroke in the shunt group was identified. Follow-up averaged 12. 3 months (range, 1 - 53 months). Conclusion: Carotid shunts can be used effectively in the context of eversion endarterectomy. Shunt insertion is not associated with an increased stroke/death rate in these patients.
