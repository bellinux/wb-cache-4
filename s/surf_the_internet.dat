500|$|In 1998, the Scientology {{organization}} publicized {{an initiative}} {{to hand out}} software on CDs to all its members, which would help them create their own websites describing their activity in the movement, and linking {{back to the main}} site at www.scientology.org. The Scientology organization did not reveal to these individuals that the CD was simultaneously bundled with censorship software which blocked websites critical of the organization. This censorship software was termed, [...] "Scieno Sitter" [...] by critics of the organization. (Janet Weiland, vice president of the OSA, has stated that it remains Scientologists' personal choice whether to use the filter, to protect them and their family members from encountering on-line harassment, and some Scientologists have always chosen to <b>surf</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> without filtering.) OSA agents wished for Christman to specifically monitor such critical websites and report to the organization about her findings, so they removed the Scieno Sitter censorship software from the computer at her residence in 1999, allowing her to research sites online freely. She came across the Scientology critic website Operation Clambake, managed by Andreas Heldal-Lund.|$|E
