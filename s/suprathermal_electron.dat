40|$|Magnetic {{clouds are}} a subset of interplanetary coronal mass ejections {{characterized}} by a smooth rotation in the magnetic field direction, which is interpreted as a signature of a magnetic flux rope. <b>Suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> observations indicate that one or both ends of a magnetic cloud typically remain connected to the Sun as it moves out through the heliosphere. With distance from the axis of the flux rope, out toward its edge, the magnetic field winds more tightly about the axis and electrons must traverse longer magnetic field lines to reach the same heliocentric distance. This increased time of flight allows greater pitch-angle scattering to occur, meaning <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> pitch-angle distributions should be systematically broader {{at the edges of}} the flux rope than at the axis. We model this effect with an analytical magnetic flux rope model and a numerical scheme for <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> pitch-angle scattering and find that the signature of a magnetic flux rope should be observable with the typical pitch-angle resolution of <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> data provided ACE's SWEPAM instrument.

The H and O emissions are mainly produced by impact dissociation of water molecules by suprathermal electrons. In this paper we explore further the electron dissociative excitation of H 2 O to produce the UV emissions by using simultaneous observations of water and H Lyman-β done by the VIRTIS-H and Alice instruments during four periods of time in 2014 December, 2015 March and 2015 May.

The efficiency of the electron dissociative excitation of H 2 O is lower during the three last periods of time studied compared to the first period in 2014 December.

Two different phases of the ECRH-driven {{transport of}} <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electrons</b> can be seen; {{the first one is}} a rapid convective phase due to the direct radial motion of trapped electrons and the second one is a slower phase due to the collisional transport.

The ECRH driven flux is also evaluated and put in relation with the ""electron root"" feature recently observed in W 7 -AS. It is found that, at low collisionalities, the ECRH driven flux due to the <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electrons</b> can play a dominant role in the condition of ambipolarity and, thus, the observed ""electron root"" feature in W 7 -AS is thought to be driven by the radial (convective) flux of ECRH generated supratherrnal electrons.

The linear dispersion relation derived for electrostatic waves demonstrates a weak dependence of the phase speed on physical conditions of positrons in appropriate ranges of parameters.

40|$|The velocity-space {{anisotropy}} of <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> distributions is {{a source}} of free energy that may destabilize plasma waves through a resonant interaction between the waves and the energetic electrons. In this work we use a <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> distribution appropriate for the case when the accelerating electric field is near-critical and we investigate the frequencies, wave numbers and propagation angles of the most unstable waves using a general dispersion relation. It is shown that if the electric field is sub-critical, the anisotropy is not enough to drive electromagnetic waves unstable, as the Landau damping of the waves overwhelms the drive through the anomalous Doppler resonance. In the case when the electric field is supercritical, two types of electromagnetic waves will be destabilized, the electron-whistler and the extraordinary electron wave. The number of electrons for destabilization of the latter is several orders of magnitude lower than for the electron-whistler wave.

In particular, calculated photoelectron fluxes are compared with <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> fluxes measured by the Solar Wind Electron Analyzer, and calculated electron temperatures are compared with temperatures measured by the Langmuir Probe and Waves experiment. The major heat source for the thermal electrons is Coulomb heating from the <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> population, and cooling due to collisional rotational and vibrational CO 2 dominates the energy loss. The models used in this study were largely able to reproduce the observed high topside ionosphere electron temperatures (e. g., 3000 [*]K at 300 [*]km altitude) without using a topside heat flux when magnetic field topologies consistent with the measured magnetic field were adopted. Magnetic topology affects both <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> transport and thermal electron heat conduction. The effects of using two different solar irradiance models were also investigated.

In this paper, we analyse ACE/SWICS and WIND/ 3 DP data spanning [*]>[*] 12 years, and test properties of solar wind <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> distributions for the presence of signatures of the coronal temperature at their origin which may remain at 1  AU. In particular we re-examine a previous suggestion that these properties correlate with the oxygen charge state ratio O 7 +  ∕ O 6 +, an established proxy for coronal electron temperature. We find only a very weak but variable correlation between measures of <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> energy content and O 7 +  ∕ O 6 +. The weak nature of the correlation leads us to conclude, in contrast to earlier results, that an initial relationship with core electron temperature has the possibility to exist in the corona, but that in most cases no strong signatures remain in the <b>suprathermal</b> <b>electron</b> distributions at 1  AU. It cannot yet be confirmed whether this is due to the effects of coronal conditions on the establishment of this relationship or due to the altering of the electron distributions by processing during transport in the solar wind en route to 1  AU. Contrasting results for the halo and strahl population favours the latter interpretation. Confirmation of this will be possible using Solar Orbiter data (cruise and nominal mission phase) to test whether the weakness of the relationship persists over a range of heliocentric distances. If the correlation is found to strengthen when closer to the Sun, then this would indicate an initial relationship which is being degraded, perhaps by wave–particle interactions, en route to the observer...|$|E
