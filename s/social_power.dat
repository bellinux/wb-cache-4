5|$|In January 1894, the Fasci were outlawed and brutally {{repressed}} on {{the orders}} of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. Many leaders were put in jail; Cascioferro fled to Tunis for a year. After serving his sentence {{for his role in}} the peasant unrest, Cascioferro returned to a position of <b>social</b> <b>power</b> and pressured authorities in Palermo to put him in charge of granting emigration permits in the district of Corleone. According to Mafia historian Salvatore Lupo, Cascioferro was involved in clandestine emigration networks.|$|E
5|$|The story also explores Balzac's {{conviction}} that a person's {{name is a}} powerful indicator {{of his or her}} destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more <b>social</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} based upon two-and-a-half month field research on the tea plantations in Sri Lanka. Ethnic identity formation is a hot topic for the plantation community. In this thesis we focused on the tensions between the insider’s perspective (emic) {{as well as the}} outsider’s perspective (etic) on identity formation. Both perspectives were researched {{through the eyes of the}} plantation community itself. Etic and emic perceptions are extremely interwoven. Identity formation is a complex process because it is a real tug of war between all <b>social</b> <b>powers.</b> Many <b>social</b> <b>powers</b> influence the process of ethnic identity formation. In our research we mentioned <b>social</b> <b>powers</b> like the government, Sinhalese community, Muslim community, Sri Lankan Tamils, religion, caste, language and work. Every individual attaches different values to different <b>social</b> <b>powers.</b> It is an ongoing and complex process. ...|$|R

5|$|The nation enjoyed {{considerable}} international prestige {{during the}} final years of the Empire and had become an emerging power in the international arena. While PedroII was receiving medical treatment in Europe, the parliament passed, and Princess Isabel signed on 13 May 1888, the Golden Law, which completely abolished slavery in Brazil. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery proved to be unfounded. Nonetheless, the end of slavery was the final blow to any remaining belief in the crown's neutrality, and this resulted in an explicit shift of support to Republicanism by the ultraconservatives—themselves backed by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and <b>social</b> <b>power</b> in the country.|$|E
5|$|The nation enjoyed great {{international}} prestige {{during the}} final years of the Empire, and it had become an emerging power within the international arena. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful. The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and <b>social</b> <b>power</b> in the country. Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil, with little support in the provinces. The combination of republican ideas and the dissemination of Positivism among the army's lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a serious threat to the monarchy. They dreamed of a dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the monarchy.|$|E

40|$|The mere descriptiveness of {{the term}} {{coexistence}} shows {{the dissolution of the}} modern ordering logic. The essay argues that the ontology of the individual elements and immanent <b>social</b> <b>powers</b> that cannot be transcended is functional to the neo-liberal governmentality, which organizes the disconnection through competition and determines an heavy anti-democratic hierarchy.

After consulting with several psychiatrists, police released a psychological profile of their suspect on May 26, 1977. He was described as neurotic and probably suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and believed himself to be a victim of demonic possession.|$|E
25|$|Early in the Edo period, {{prominent}} {{officials in}} the shogunate established {{the protection of the}} shogun and Edo Castle as a priority on windy days, when arson was most likely to occur. In contrast, as a remnant of the Sengoku period, fire prevention measures concerning chōnins residential areas were given almost no attention. However, as chōnin gained <b>social</b> <b>power,</b> the shogunate's policies also evolved, as a symbol of which, , the eighth shogun, expanded the fire prevention measures to cover Edo universally as part of the Kyōhō Reforms.|$|E

50|$|Globalization {{requires}} {{a country to}} give up its sovereignty for the sake of executing Western ideals in its country. As a result, sovereignty only belongs to a select few: those whose views and ideals are being implemented. In the name of free markets and with the promise of an improved standard of living, countries give up their political and <b>social</b> <b>powers</b> to international organizations. Thus, globalization causes the greater empowerment of these international organizations and the diminishing influence of local state institutions.|$|R
25|$|Fearchar's {{ability to}} defeat the proven might of the Meic Uilleim and MacHeths {{together}} suggests that Fearchar could command large military resources, and as McDonald points out, this can hardly be entirely explained by his background as a hereditary priest from Tain. However, the Scottish kings themselves were hardly without authority in Ross, and their position could command <b>social</b> <b>power</b> even in this distant land, something proved by the MacWilliams, whose authority depended on their descent from a Scottish king. Fearchar's power then is not so mysterious.|$|E

In postcolonial literature, the anti-conquest narrative analyzes the identity politics that are the social and cultural perspectives of the subaltern colonial subjects—their creative resistance to the culture of the colonizer; how such cultural resistance complicated the establishment of a colonial society; how the colonizers developed their postcolonial identity; and how neocolonialism actively employs the Us-and-Them binary social relation to view the non-Western world as inhabited by The Other.|$|E

25|$|Standardized {{testing has}} been a part of American {{education}} since the 1800s, but the widespread reliance on standardized is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. For instance the College Entrance Examination Board did not begin standardized testing in connection to higher education until 1900. This test was implemented with the idea of creating standardized admissions for the United States in northeastern elite universities. Originally, the test was also meant for top boarding school in order to standardize curriculum. With origins in World War I the Army Alpha and Beta tests developed by Robert Yerkes and colleagues. Before then, immigration in the mid-19th century contributed to the growth of standardized tests in the United States. Standardized tests were used in immigration when people first came over to test social roles and find <b>social</b> <b>power</b> and status.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, {{members of}} noble {{families}} {{continued to hold}} political and <b>social</b> <b>power,</b> for example Severin Løvenskiold as Governor general of Norway and Peder Anker and Mathias Sommerhielm as Prime Minister. Aristocrats were active in Norway's independence movement in 1905, {{and it has been}} claimed the union with Sweden was dissolved thanks to a 'genuinely aristocratic wave'. Baron Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg's personal effors contributed to Norway gaining sovereignty of the arctic archipelago Svalbard in 1920. From 1912 to 1918, Bredo Henrik von Munthe af Morgenstierne was Rector of the University of Oslo. When Norway co-founded and entered NATO, ambassador Wilhelm Morgenstierne represented the Kingdom when US President Truman signed the treaty in 1949. Whilst they now acted as individuals rather than a unified estate, these and many other noblemen played a significant public rôle, mainly until the Second World War (19401945).|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{empowerment}} movements {{that use the}} social action model, aiming for disadvantaged people to become empowered, organized, and educated {{so that they may}} create change. These programs advocate for constructive confrontations to enhance the <b>social</b> <b>power</b> of people who are considered disadvantaged. Another model is the 5C's model that focuses on emphasizing competence, confidence, connection, character and caring. A sixth C of contribution to society was later added. This model focuses primarily on engagement as a key marker of positive youth development, emphasizing the need to foster initiative. Youth-adult partnerships are another type of empowerment method used around the world. This method has been defined as a developmental process and a community practice. The partnership involves people of different ages working together on community issues over a period of time. The method emphasizes reciprocity among adults and youth with a focus on shared decision making and reflective learning. The concept of shared control is key for empowering youth.|$|E

This relationship is mediated by historically contingent legal and economic institutions, like the central banks, which subordinate creditor power to the whims of governments, courts and technocrats. It is only based on these fundamentally-determined interest rates that the price mechanism comes into play.|$|R
