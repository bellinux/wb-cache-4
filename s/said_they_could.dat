He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to disarm the cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his questions, or in which they <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not remember.|$|E
5|$|Although in most {{countries}} English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. In {{the countries of the}} EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E

5|$|In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, {{including}} the Houston Rockets, proposed {{legislation that would}} dedicate state tax revenue to build new arenas. Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced {{he would continue to}} study the possibility of constructing a new arena in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit's management <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> renovate the building for {{a small part of the}} cost of a new arena, the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.|$|E
5|$|Although tape {{samplers}} {{had been}} explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The {{concept of the}} Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon, they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.|$|E
25|$|An {{instance}} of a Japanese atrocity was {{committed in the}} area of the rubber trees around Trolak. In this area were a number of Argyll and Hyderabad wounded. 2nd Lieutenant Ian Primrose reports that after he regained consciousness from an injury during the fighting he discovered that the Japanese were dividing the wounded into those who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> walk and those who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not. Primrose decided he could walk, which was fortunate as the Japanese soldiers proceeded to shoot and bayonet the wounded who could not. Afterward the survivors were forced to dig graves for the dead and then told to carry the Japanese wounded.|$|E

When Judy Zimmet traveled to Israel and asked to visit him in prison, prison authorities <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only meet in the presence of prison officials and with them separated by a glass barrier. Vanunu rejected these conditions, demanding he be allowed to meet her face to face. He also filed three appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court protesting his conditions, which were rejected.

25|$|Artemis played quite a {{large part}} in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshipped at Troy, Artemis took {{the side of the}} Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis {{becalmed}} the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> win the goddess' heart by sacrificing Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke that promise. Other sources said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into Hecate, goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.|$|E

25|$|On July 13, {{the kidnappers}} {{contacted}} Sergio Cázares Garza, {{one of the}} family members who lived in Texas, and told him that his remaining relatives would be released if the family paid a ransom. Initially, the family <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only pay a few thousand dollars, but the captors allowed for them to have at least two days to collect more money. In total, the Cázares made four different payments to the kidnappers in Matamoros in a sum of US$100,000. The first one was delivered at a grocery store parking lot and the second one was left behind a fast-food eatery. The kidnappers communicated with the Cázares family that was in hiding in Texas through telephone, and the cash deliveries were made by a trusted employee of the family in Matamoros. Each time the deliveries were made, the Gulf Cartel sent a different envoy to pick up the money from the Cázares at a disclosed location.|$|E
25|$|In a rocky {{wilderness}} Morald and Gunther meet Gernot. The former pair {{have been}} sent to find out what has happened to Arindal, who disappeared eight years ago. In the meantime his father, the king, has died from grief and the kingdom is being attacked by their enemy Murold who demands they surrender Arindal's sister Lora as his wife. Gernot relates how he and Arindal had hunted a beautiful doe to a river where it vanished. They heard a voice and jumped into the river where they found a beautiful woman in luxurious surroundings. She declared her love for Arindal and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> stay together provided Arindal could go eight years without asking who she is. But the day before he did ask her, and Arindal and Gernot found themselves in the wilderness. Morald and Gunther depart before Arindal can know of their presence. Arindal appears and sings of his grief at the loss of Ada (Wo find ich dich, wo wird mir Trost?). Gernot tries to argue him round to believing that Ada is a sorceress who has abandoned him and that he should return to his kingdom. He sings of an evil witch who had disguised herself as a beautiful woman (War einst 'ne böse Hexe wohl). Gunther returns, disguised as a priest, and continues the attempt to persuade Arindal that he will be turned into a wild beast by the witch unless he returns at once; Morald similarly disguises himself as the ghost of Arindal's father and announces that his kingdom is threatened. Each disguise is magically destroyed just as Arindal is about to be convinced. However, the three are finally able to persuade him of his country's need. They agree to depart in the morning, although Arindal fears he will not see Ada again. When he is left alone he falls into an enchanted sleep.|$|E

25|$|Sometime after 0100, 12 August, 2nd Battalion {{lost contact}} with C Company on the ridge northward and sounds of combat could be heard coming from that area. When further efforts to reach the company by {{telephone}} and radio failed, the battalion commander sent runners and a wire crew out to try to re-establish contact. He then urged speedy movement of the trains and artillery westward through the pass. But the regimental commander reluctantly held firm to division orders not to move until after daylight. The runners returned and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not find the company. The wire crew was missing. Members of the battalion staff had again heard sounds of combat in the company area. They also had seen flares there. This was interpreted to mean that North Korean troops held it and were signaling to allied units. Still unable to contact the division, 5th Infantry now decided to move the trains and artillery out westward {{while it was still}} dark, despite division orders to wait for daylight, seeing too much risk in delaying any longer. The battalion of the 24th Infantry promised by the division had not arrived. About 0400 the trains to moved out. They were to be followed by the artillery, and then the 1st Battalion would bring up the rear. In the meantime, the battalion was to hold open the pass and protect the regimental column. Movement of the trains through the pass should have been accomplished in twenty minutes, but it required hours. During the hour or more before daylight, no vehicle moved more than ten or twenty feet at a time. One of the factors creating this situation was caused when the Medical Company tried to move into the column from its position near the 1st Battalion command post. An ambulance hung up in a ditch and stopped everything on the road behind it until it could be pulled out.|$|E
