The rocks that are simulated represent sandstones and their mechanical laboratory parameters are characterized by the ones obtained in laboratory test simulations using the same numerical approach and program named above. The environment of the rock <b>scratching</b> <b>test</b> is distinguished by the particle size and crushability, which are highly important parameters that affect the failure mode and the cutting force pattern. The implementation of a crushing criterion and strength is introduced to the particles based on micromechanics and laboratory results, respectively. The depth of cutting is considerably shallow and the cutting force results are processed under the physical concept of mechanical work. The proportion of the cutting force to the depth of cutting is possible in any type of sandstone-like simulated material, which has been demonstrated by laboratory results. The correlation of the cutting force and the unconfined compressive strength of different rock scratching tests show that the simulations provide effective results. The failure characteristics of micro-cracks and macro-cracks under the cutting tool, represented by broken bonds, simulates the damage occurring in real scratching tests, taking the model to a realistic plane...|$|E

Current testing methods, such as tensile or puncture tests, do not necessarily correlate well with field damages that are observed to be scratch-like. The standardized linearly increasing load <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> is investigated as a new means of evaluating the mechanical integrity of packaging films. Mechanical clamp and vacuum fixtures were considered for securing the films {{to a set of}} backing materials and tested under various testing rates and film orientation conditions. Film performance was evaluated according to their puncture load. Based on the above study, the vacuum fixture offers the most consistent and meaningful results by providing a more intimate contact between film and backing and minimizing uncontrolled buckling of the film during testing. Additional testing was also carried out on a commercial film to confirm similarity between damage observed in the scratched films and that from the field. The <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> gives good correlation between field performance and <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> results on a set of commercial films. The usefulness of the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> methodology for packaging film mechanical integrity evaluation is discussed.

40|$|Background: A {{reliable}} and accurate estimation of liver size by physical examination {{is an important}} aspect of the clinical assessment of a patient. The <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> uses auscultation to detect the lower liver edge by using the difference in sound transmission through the abdominal cavity over solid and hollow organs. The test is thought to be particularly useful if the abdomen is tense, distended, obese, or very tender. Although the sign is often taught to medical students and residents, the value of the technique for detecting the liver edge has become controversial. Methods: The study was performed in two parts. In the first part, 18 patients undergoing upper abdominal ultrasound as outpatients were randomly selected and the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> was performed by two raters independently, followed by ultrasound (USG) as the reference standard. In {{the second part of the}} study, the two raters independently performed the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> on separate randomly selected patients (15 patients by rater 1, and 16 patients by rater 2), followed by USG. Results: Agreement between raters on the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> was very high, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0. 97. The agreement between the raters and the USG was 0. 37 using Spearman’s rho. A Bland–Altman plot indicated that, on average, raters underestimated the distance from the right costal margin to the liver edge by only about 2. 4 centimeters compared to USG. This translates into 37 % and 54 % of raters’ estimates falling within 2 and 3 cm of USG estimates. Each unit increase in BMI increased the discrepancy between raters and USG by 0. 26 cm (p = 0. 012). Conclusion: The <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> has very high reproducibility and overall agreement between the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> and USG was moderate, with a spearman’s rho of 0. 37. The accuracy may potentially be improved by using the point of initial sound transmission rather than the point of maximal transmission.

30|$|In summary, {{this letter}} {{presents}} an AFM-based nanomachining method to fabricate nanochannels with ladder nanostructure at the bottom. The ladder nanostructures {{can be obtained}} by continuous scanning of the AFM tip according to the matching relation of the velocities of the tip feeding and the precision stage moving. With the high-precision stage moving in the same direction with the tip feeding velocity, the tip feed can hardly reach as large as the value to ensure the cutting state playing a main role in the <b>scratching</b> <b>test.</b> Simultaneously, in this condition, when the stage moving velocity is larger than the tip feeding velocity, the nanochannel cannot be obtained due to extremely small attack angle in the machining process and the materials cannot be effectively removed. On the contrary, when the stage moves opposite to the feeding direction, an appropriate feed value can be easily achieved. Moreover, the edge of the tip {{plays an important role in}} the scratching tests. The materials are mainly removed by the cutting state in this condition resulting in good surface quality. The perfect nanochannel with ladder nanostructure at the bottom can be obtained under this condition. Moreover, a large scale of the length of 500  μm and the width of 10  μm of such kind of nanochannel is machined successfully using this novel method.|$|E

Comparing the shape and size of chips made by honing with the grain structure of Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4, it can be estimated that the chips are mainly formed by the fracture occurred along the grain boundary, although chips of Si 3 N 4 are also formed by the fracture occurred through the grain. Two types of material removal are observed depending on the load acting on the cutting grits.

Meanwhile, the period changes from 250  nm to 580  nm, 270  nm to 450  nm, and 230  nm to 500  nm for scratching angles of 0 °, 45 °, and 90 °, respectively. For different scratching directions, the tip scratch face, the scratch edge, and the cantilever deformation are all different. The tip scratch face and the scratch edge affect the contact area, and the cantilever deformation affects the actual normal load acting on the sample surface in <b>scratching</b> <b>test,</b> which has been discussed in detail in our previous work [17]. The contact area and the actual normal force will directly affect the contact press, which is the important factor for forming the ripple structures [15]. For the three scratching angle, the contact area is the same due to the scan-scratch trace. So, the tip edge and faces have no effects on the different scratching angles. But, the actual normal load follows the order 0 °[*]<[*] 45 °[*]<[*] 90 °, which means that {{in order to get the}} same contact press, the normal load follows the order 0 °[*]>[*] 45 °[*]>[*] 90 °. For the change of the period scope in different scratching directions, it may be due to the change of the actual normal load under each scan-scratching direction.

The applicability of the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> to newly developed coating techniques, systems, and applications is discussed. Among the methods based {{on the use of}} a physical measurement, acoustic emission detection is the most effective. The dynamics ratio between the signals below and above the {{critical load}} for the acoustic emission (much greater than 100) is well above that obtained with the normal, tangential, and lateral forces. The present commercial instruments are limited in load application performance. A scratch tester able to apply accurate loads as low as 0. 01 N would probably overcome most of the actual limitations and would be expected to extend the <b>scratch</b> <b>testing</b> technique to different application fields such as optics and microelectronics...|$|R
