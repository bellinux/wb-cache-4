40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIV) are {{prevalent in}} birds, several mammals and in humans. Low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) of subtypes H 5 and H 7 can become highly pathogenic {{due to the}} high frequency of mutation. Certain virus strains have zoonotic potential. Infections with highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) of subtype H 5 N 1 have caused hundreds of cases of illness and deaths in humans in recent years. LPAIV are widely distributed among wild birds, especially wild waterfowl. However, since {{the emergence of the}} HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 in the year 2005, numerous infections have occurred in wild birds, with different susceptibility of certain species. Although the role of wild birds in HPAIV is still controversial, this host reservoir poses a risk for AIV infections to occur among commercial poultry which then results in extensive epizootic disease control activities and enormous economic consequences. Besides HPAIV infections, it is also mandatory to control LPAIV infections of subtypes H 5 and H 7 throughout Europe. To acquire data for risk assessment, first voluntary and later obligatory specifications for monitoring the prevalence of AIV in wild birds were developed. According to refined risk assessment certain species, especially of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriformes, were preferentially included in the monitoring program. Through implementation of these specifications wild bird monitoring was performed in the federal state of Brandenburg. This work evaluates the resulting data from the period of 2006 to 2010. In total, 8. 290 wild birds of 139 domestic species and 43 families have been examined for AIV by testing organs from bird remains, pharyngeal or cloacae swabs as well as excrement. The largest fraction of the investigated species were geese and ducks (Anseriformes) forming 35 % of total. 21 birds, predominantly swans, tested positive for HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 infection with the “Asia” strain in combination with Europe-wide outbreaks of the virus in wild birds during spring-time 2006. Subsequently, there was no further evidence for HPAIV infection in the federal state of Brandenburg. During the period of five years (2006 - 2010) 90 cases of LPAIV have been diagnosed, among them the subtypes H 5 and H 7. The species with the highest prevalence was Mallard followed by Eurasian Coot. Orders with LPAIV infections have been Anseriformes, Podicipediformes (Grebes), Gruiformes (cranes and relatives), Accipitriformes (raptors) und Strigiformes (owls). Significant differences in the distribution pattern of LPAIV have been detected within individual years and between different years, as well as differences in geographic distribution. Numbers of AIV infections showed a peak in late summer to early winter, especially in the Ramsar Site Peitzer Teiche located in the administrative district Spree-Neiße. The wild bird monitoring was completed by the investigation of Mallards (Anas plathyrhynchos) which were kept in a facility at the Lake Felchowsee in the administrative district Uckermark. These sentinel animals lived in a permanent contact with the local wild birds for the period of October 2008 to October 2010. A sampling of the sentinels was performed every two weeks by taking swabs for AIV detection and every four weeks with blood tests for AIV antibody detection. Compared to the comprehensive wild bird monitoring, the detection rate among the sentinels was significantly higher and several subtypes were detected. AIV antibodies were found in the Mallards two weeks after beginning testing with a positive serological response lasting from two weeks to several months. However, the subtype specificity of the antibodies (H 7) could only be determined for a single animal by hemagglutination inhibition reaction. From the wild bird monitoring an overview of the AIV prevalence in the federal state of Brandenburg could be achieved. However, for some species the number of investigated animals was not sufficient to confirm AIV infection’s significance in certain months and areas. Examination of data clearly shows that sampling of carcasses (passive monitoring) is superior to sampling of live animals (active monitoring) in confirmation of HPAIV infection in wild birds. However, active monitoring seems to be more suitable for the detection of LPAIV. Focusing on certain species (Mallard, Eurasian Coot), certain areas (wetlands, especially Lakes Peitzer Teiche and Lakes Havelseen), certain months (September, October and January to March) and a certain <b>sampling</b> <b>specification</b> (hunted Mallards) could increase efficiency of surveillance. Sentinel facilities seem to provide a cost-efficient alternative to conventional monitoring in order to provide data, including serology, to follow the course of AIV infections over long time periods in a particular ecosystem...|$|E
