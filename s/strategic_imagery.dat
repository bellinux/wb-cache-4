5000|$|No. 7010 (VR) Photographic Interpretation Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force is {{a unit of}} the British Royal Air Force. It {{was founded}} in April 1953 as No. 7010 Flight, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, to provide <b>strategic</b> <b>imagery</b> {{analysis}} support to the Royal Air Force. In 1965 the flight expanded its role to include tactical imagery analysis. In August 1982, Her Majesty The Queen approved the issue of a badge to the flight. In allusion to the unit's role, the emblem of a human eye is portrayed with a wing embellishment and set in front of a roundel. The motto Vocati Veniemus may be freely translated as [...] "when summoned we shall be there". The collapse of the Warsaw Pact resulted in a large reduction of NATO forces in central Europe. In turn this has led to a major reduction in, and reorganisation of, the United Kingdom's regular and reserve forces. Within this overall plan for defence, No. 7010 Flight became No. 7010 (VR) Photographic Interpretation Squadron.|$|E

The intervention conditions included alternating the use of <b>strategic</b> <b>imagery</b> (Cognitive general; Paivio, 1985) and video feedback. Both participants demonstrated an increase in the frequency of Cognitive general use. Specific and global performance measures were assessed to determine the relative effectiveness of the interventions. Poor inter-rater reliability resulted in the elimination of specific performance measures. Consequently, only the global measure (i. e., save percentage) was used in subsequent analyses.

40|$|In {{the master}} {{plan of the}} {{redevelopment}} of the former industrial harbor Bjørvika, funding for art is stipulated along {{with access to the}} site during the construction phase. This article looks at an intervention, from 2005, of the artist Marianne Heier, in relation to the <b>strategic</b> use of <b>imagery</b> in place branding and the use of images to structure change. The epistemological dimension of images will be argued to have ontological implications on how we perceive the world and consequently act upon it. This article suggests the need for a critical approach to mediated images in the context of urban development. By discussing the relationships between Lorraine Daston’s use of the notion of ‘skilled perception’ and Jaques Rancière’s concept of the ‘distribution of the sensible’, I attempt to draw attention to how our perception is skilled and thus affects what we hold in common. Ultimately, the formation of public spaces is the subject of the article and by pointing to the role that images play, as the way we see the city is shaped, this paper argue the need for images that unveil otherwise unrepresented potentials and interests. The notion of skilled perception is presented as a tool for investigating how mediated images in Bjørvika form the basis of perceptual habits, and are suggested to be of use in grasping the “politics” of artistic interventions within the larger constructed image of Bjørvik...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} print {{advertisements and}} branding materials to analyse {{the use and}} usefulness of imageries of the racial Other in historical and contemporary advertising and branding campaigns. At its core, the research seeks to delineate both the continuities and changes in what is termed the &lsquo;colonial racial script&rsquo; within advertising representations. The origins of that script are {{traced back to the}} 18 th century and key moments in its genealogical production are identified. The thesis poses the question as to whether the concept of the &lsquo;racial Other&rsquo; deployed in print advertising and branding campaigns has changed within the context of contemporary globalisation and, if so, in what ways? Using a combination of critical media analysis that draws strongly upon semiotic interpretation and Foucauldian-inspired genealogical approach, the research interrogates a wide range of advertising data to examine the uses and usefulness of imageries of the racial Other. It offers a detailed analytical snapshot of an important dimension of everyday and popular culture in order to assess whether &ndash; as some have claimed &ndash; that the world has moved on to a &lsquo;colour-blind&rsquo; era where the concept of &lsquo;race&rsquo; ceases its relevance or, conversely, whether racial politics continue to be a pervasive dimension of current advertising media representations. The research discovers that the <b>strategic</b> use of <b>imageries</b> of the racial Other in a range of public interest and commercial campaigns confirm the currency of race as a commodity-sign in the age of globalisation and the value that the racial Other possesses continues to hold and in some instances grow. The thesis evidences this through its identification of a number of thematically organised types of reworking of the existing colonial notions and visions of the racial Other within global media culture. While, at a cursory level, the representation of the racial Other in the materials examined, which date from the 1980 s onward, does to some extent differ from earlier ads it does so more in terms of variation than outright change. The analysis reveals more similarities than differences in terms of colonial and existing racial representations. Significant residual traces of the colonial racial script are in evidence &ndash; the legacy of stereotypes continues and mutates through recycling and remodeling. At the same time, racial stereotypes being coded in contemporary advertising language are found to be more ﬂuid and vulnerable to manipulation...|$|R

(Under the {{supervision}} of Diane Stevens) The implementation of imagery and video feedback programs has become an important tool for aiding athletes in achieving peak performance (Halliwell, 1990).

40|$|Previous neuroimaging studies {{suggested}} an involvement of sensory-motor brain systems during conceptual processing {{in support of}} grounded cognition theories of conceptual memory. However, in these studies with visible stimuli, contributions of <b>strategic</b> <b>imagery</b> or semantic elaboration processes to observed sensory-motor activity cannot be entirely excluded. In the present study, we therefore investigated the electrophysiological correlates of unconscious feature-specific priming of action- and sound-related concepts within a novel feature-priming paradigm to specifically probe automatic processing of conceptual features without the contribution of possibly confounding factors such as orthographic similarity or response congruency. Participants were presented with a masked subliminal prime word and a subsequent visible target word. In the feature-priming conditions primes as well as targets belonged to the same conceptual feature dimension (action or sound, e. g., typewriter or radio) whereas in the two non-priming conditions, either the primes or the targets consisted of matched control words with low feature relevance (e. g., butterfly or candle). Event-related potential analyses revealed unconscious feature-specific priming effects at fronto-central electrodes within 100 to 180 ms after target stimulus onset that differed with regard to topography and underlying neural generators. In congruency with previous findings under visible stimulation conditions, these differential subliminal ERP feature-priming effects demonstrate an unconscious automatic access to action versus sound features of concepts. The present results therefore support grounded cognition theor...|$|E
