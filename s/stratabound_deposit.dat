The Mutonda Formation has been divided into several distinct members among which the predominantly coarse-grained and conglomeratic basal Lubembe Member rests unconformably on the basement. The Luina Dome is dominantly granitic in nature and belongs to the Bangweulu block. It has been dated by U-Pb on zircon at 1, 882 + 23 /- 19 Ma and also records an event at 526 ± 250 Ma.

40|$|Abstract. The Bouarfa {{ore deposit}} {{represents}} one of the main Manganese ore deposits of Morocco. The mineralization corresponds to a <b>stratabound</b> <b>deposit</b> in a liassic dolostone unit. Previous studies have suggested that this deposit has been formed during sedimentation at the sedimentary water interface. However, the location of the Bouarfa district along the North Atlasic Front in a fold cut by a thrust fault questions the influence of this structure on the mineralization, its origin and evolution. The petrographic characterization of the dolostone emphasizes a late diagenetic dolomitization process prior to Mn mineralization. Moreover, petrographical, minera-logical and trace element geochemistry demonstrate that the fluids involved in the mineralization precipitated Mn tunnel-like structure oxides in a high oxidised environment. The fluids probably derived from hydro-thermal systems. These elements argue for a post-sedimentary model for the mineralization...|$|E

Despite {{the fact that these}} deposits were long under exploitation and investigated many times, they are still insufficiently classified in harmony with the crustal evolution models suggested for the evolution of the Nubian Shield. Several plate tectonic models were proposed {{for the development of the}} Nubian Shield and the present classification relies heavily on the model that implies collision of arc-inferred continent through subduction and obduction of oceanic lithosphere. A three-fold classification of gold deposits of Egypt is offered here in harmony with this evolutionary model. These are <b>stratabound</b> <b>deposits</b> and non-stratabound deposits hosted in igneous and metamorphic rocks, as well as placer gold <b>deposits.</b> The <b>stratabound</b> <b>deposits</b> are hosted in island arc volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of comparable composition formed in ensimatic island arcs.

Non-stratabound deposits occur in a wide range of igneous and metamorphic rocks. They were formed during orogenic and post-cratonization periods by mineralizing fluids of different sources.

This geological setting offers {{the opportunity to}} determine the preferred form(s) of Pb following soil formation on this unique anomaly. In the soil profile studied, Pb concentrates in the B-horizon (2055 mg/kg Pb) relative to both the A- (1330 mg/kg Pb) and C- (1874 mg/kg Pb) horizons. Plumbogummite (PbAl 3 (PO 4) 2 (OH) 5 ·H 2 O) is the main host of Pb in the soil profile. Pb {{also appears to be}} associated with Mn-(hydr) oxides, as shown by micro-analyses (EMPA, SEM-EDS, and µ-SXRF), in the form of inner-sphere Pb 2 + complexes, as suggested by Pb LIII-edge EXAFS spectroscopy. Linear least-squares fitting of background-subtracted, k 3 -weighted Pb LIII-edge EXAFS functions derived from bulk soil samples was carried out using Pb LIII-EXAFS spectra of 22 Pb-containing model compounds. Quantitative assessment of Pb speciation revealed that, whereas plumbogummite is the most abundant Pb phase in the soil profile, Pb 2 +–Mn-(hydr) oxide surface complexes are gradually replaced by Pb 2 +-surface complexes with other phases, possibly Pb 2 +-organic complexes, upward in the soil profile. The presence of large amounts of Pb-phosphate in the Largentière soil suggests that low solubility phosphates may be important long-term hosts of Pb in Pb-contaminated soils that have sufficiently high phosphorous activities to cause formation of these phases...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} examines {{two types}} of Mn deposits, which were exploited {{in the past in}} Sardinia. Both types are Tertiary in age, but not strictly coeval and they are both linked to a continental arc setting characterized by the presence of calcalkaline volcanics and shallow marine sediments. Mn-deposits formed in terrestrial or shallow marine environments are unusual compared to the most common deep oceanic ones, and therefore poorly studied. TheMn-ores of Sardinia occur either as <b>stratabound</b> <b>deposits</b> with stratiformgeometry associated to ruditeswith littoral facies or as vein-type deposits hosted within volcanic rocks. In the stratiformdeposits the Mn ores form the matrix or cement of a transgressive conglomeratic bed overlain by shallow water limestones and underlain by calc-alkaline volcanics. The vein-type deposits consist of Mnoxides hosted by latite lava domes, comenditic lava flows and rhyolitic ignimbrites. Although these geological settings are markedly different, the main Mn-bearing phases are the same, namely pyrolusite and hollandite. The deposits differ in the presence of accessory minerals, such as todorokite, manganite, coronadite, cryptomelane and gangue minerals. Rare earth element geochemistry is themost effective tool in discriminating the {{two types of}}Mn deposits. These analyses indicate that the vein-type deposits were formed from geofluid mixtures linked to the Oligocene– Miocene calcalkaline volcanic cycle. Mineralogical and geochemical data indicate that the crystallization of the Mn oxides in the <b>stratabound</b> <b>deposits</b> was diagenetic, related to sudden changes in Eh and pH in coastal, meteoric waters that came in touch with the marine coastal water after having flushed the calcalkaline volcanics...|$|R

40|$|Stratiform and <b>stratabound</b> ore <b>deposits</b> {{commonly}} show {{a direct}} relationship with rifts. This association is studied by developing a geodynamic model of mantle processes and crustal responses. The geodynamics of the earth can be modelled {{by the process of}} mantle advection, which involves the episodic generation and segregation of low density mantle diapirs and their rise and subsequent interaction with the crust. The theory of mantle advection explains the genetic association between rifting, magmatism, basin development and subsequent orogeny and metamorphism. Global evolution has passed through a number of major stages of non-uniformitarian development in which each cycle was characterized by fairly uniform behaviour terminated by intense geodynamic upheaval. The relationship between geological evolution and mantle advection is examined by reviewing the major characteristics of each of the cycles, which correspond to the Archean, Early Proterozoic, Mid Proterozoic, Late Proterozoic-Palaeo 2 oic, and Mesozoic - Cainozoic eras. Although mentle advection has controlled crustal processes throughout time, the decrease in the thermal energy of the earth has caused >the major evolutionary changes in response to thickening and a greater rigidity of the sialic crust. Rifts are penetrative taphrogenic faults in the earths crust which act as major conduits for the transfer of magmas, from the mantle and lower crustal levels, to the upper crust and the surface. Rifts are also permeable zones for the migration of metalliferous brines, generated by magmatic differentiation. These metalliferous brines would either be exhaled at surface to form stratiform volcanogenic and volcanosedimentary ore deposits, or would interact with preferential host horizons to form <b>stratabound</b> ore <b>deposits.</b> The associat ion between rifting and stratiform and <b>stratabound</b> ore <b>deposits</b> is illustrated by examining :he tectonic setting, and st ratigraphic relationships of typical ore deposit types...|$|R

40|$|The Ossa-Morena Zone {{contains}} abundant ore {{deposits and}} showings {{for the most}} part formed during the Cadomian and the Variscan orogenic cycles, and the intermediate rifting and stable platform stages. Despite major tectonic dismembering during Var-iscan rejuvenation which masked older geologic features, Cadomian mineralisation is comparable to active arc-related ore deposits, i. e., volcanic-hosted massive sulphides, barite and Zn-Pb SEDEX deposits and some minor porphyry copper-like mineralisation. Post-Cadomian Early Paleozoic ore deposits are scarce. Most are iron oxide <b>stratabound</b> <b>deposits</b> probably related to the Early Cambrian rifting volcanism. Variscan tectonic, metamorphic and magmatic activity {{led to the formation of}} very different types of mineralisation, including syn-metamorphic and perigranitic base metal-bearing veins, small volcanic-hosted polymetallic massive sulphide deposits, iron oxide replacements and skarns, magnetite and Cu-Ni magmatic ore bodies and Sn-W veins and replacements. Orogenic Au mineralisation is of imprecise age and could be either Variscan or Cadomian. Relatively low temperature Late Variscan hydrothermal activity is believed to be responsible for the formation of abundant Pb-Zn- and Cu-dominated lodes in different geo-logical settings, Hg replacements and uranium-bearing veins. As a whole, the diverse Variscan metallogenesis of the OMZ is interpreted as a vertical continuum in a continental crust under-going transpressional strain. During the Variscan cycle, the OMZ first was an active continental margin –and magmatic arc-, that evolved into a collided zone after amalgamation to the South Portuguese Zone terrane. Furthermore, the recently discovered large mafic-ultramafic body set in the middle crust, probably played a key role in Variscan metallogenesis...|$|R

However, a significant proportion of this production (c. 20 per cent) came from <b>stratabound</b> <b>deposits.</b> Though much is known about the vein-mineralisation, the relationship between the veins and the stratabound mineralisation is not well understood. New petrographic, isotopic and fluid inclusion data derived from samples of stratabound mineralisation allow us to present a unified model that addresses the genesis of both the vein and stratabound styles of mineralisation. We recognise three episodes of mineralisation: (i) Dolomitisation and ankeritisation — {{in the vicinity of the}} stratabound mineralisation limestones are pervasively dolomitised/ankeritised with extensively developed vuggy porosity. This occurred in the presence of a high-salinity brine consistent with fluids derived from adjacent mud and shale-filled basins. (ii) Main stage fluorite–quartz–sulphide mineralisation — in addition to metasomatic limestone replacement, repeated brecciation, dissolution and hydrothermal karstification plus additional porosity modification and redistribution of carbonate occurred, with open space filled with fluorite, galena, sphalerite, quartz and barite. Microthermometric and microchemical fluid inclusion data provide direct evidence for mineralisation in response to mixing of a low-salinity sodic groundwater with a high-salinity, calcic, Fe-rich, metalliferous brine which had highly elevated metal contents relative to ‘normal’ high total dissolved sulphur (TDS) sedimentary brines.

Whole-rock samples of quartz-tourmaline tourmalinite from the footwall alteration pipe yield a Sm-Nd isochron age of 1470 ± 59 Ma, recording synsedimentary B metasomatism of clastic sediments during early evolution of the Sullivan hydrothermal system. Data for variably altered (chloritized and/or albitized) tourmalinites from the hanging wall of the deposit, which are believed to have formed originally ca. 1470 Ma, define a younger 1076 ± 77 Ma isochron because of resetting of Sm and Nd isotopes during Grenvillian metamorphism.

The data were combined with existing lead isotope data (ore lead) for hydrothermal polymetallic deposits from the same area and compared with the isotopic compositions of potential lead sources. Copper and polymetallic pre-Variscan (Late Ordovician–Early Silurian) stratiform, post-Variscan (Permian to Triassic) vein, and stratabound sediment-hosted (Late Permian to Early Triassic) deposits, are characterised by highly variable ratios of radiogenic to non-radiogenic lead, but show very similar, high, time-integrated mu (= 238 U/ 204 Pb) and W (= 232 Th/ 204 Pb) values. A progressive relative increase in radiogenic lead is observed from (i) pre-Variscan deposits to (ii) post-Variscan sulphide-rich veins in the Variscan metamorphic basement and in the lower units of the Early Permian volcanic sequence, to (iii) post-Variscan sulphide-rich and fluorite-rich veins in the upper units of the Early Permian volcanic sequence, to (iv) post-Variscan fluorite-rich veins cutting the overlying Late Permian sediments and mid-Triassic mafic dikes. The dominant lead sources for all these deposits were Cambrian–Devonian (meta) sediments of the Variscan basement. Contributions from Permian and Triassic igneous rocks were of minor importance, if any, even for vein deposits which were evidently related to Permian magmatism. The isotopic compositions {{of some of the}} Permian vein deposits are consistent with, although they do not unequivocally prove, remobilization of metals from the pre-Variscan stratiform <b>deposits.</b> <b>Stratabound</b> <b>deposits</b> in the Late Permian sandstones and, possibly, those in the Early Triassic carbonates also received a major lead input from the Variscan metasediments, with a variable additional contribution from the host Permian sediments.

It is intended, however, more as a paradigm for the genesis of the hydrogen-sulphide geochemical barrier, an important ore formation episode prior to heavy metal accumulation, which shows the utility of RENFRO’s (1974) epigenetic model.

The discovery of cryptalgal fabrics and other conspicious sedimentary features in underlying siliciclastics with massive pyrite and surmounting barite-bearing dolomites supports their affiliation to a tidal flat facies and sabkha environment. Barite and pyrite accumulation were formed by an early diagenetic, bacteriogenic sulphate reduction in a peritidal muddy environment, concommitant to a widespread process of evaporative dolomitization.

Conclusions are summarized as follows: (1) Uranium in the deposits is supplied from surrounding source rocks, mostly from granite. (2) Uranium is transported by circulating ground-water solutions. (3) The uranium dissolved in ground water is fixed in minerals in various ways, the most important being adsorption by carbonaceous matter. (4) Ore-grade uranium concentrated from very dilute solutions occurs by multiple repetition of a leaching-and-fixation cycle between minerals or adsorbents and circulat-ing uraniferous ground water.

Geological modelling of the deposit in 3 D space shows a correlation between some of the lineaments defined by magnetic minima and faults in the Ediacaran-Cambrian siliciclastic rocks, which are inferred to be spatially coupled to reactivated faults in the basement. Basement fault reactivation caused syn-sedimentary block faulting and also post-sedimentary and post-mineralisation fault movement. The reactivated faults define two major sets, which are inferred to have conditioned basin architecture and deposition of sediment during Ediacaran-Cambrian time, as N-S to NE-SW basin-parallel and WNW-ESE to NW-SE transfer faults. Lead and zinc grade modelling in 3 D space revealed plume-like features that are spatially linked to NE-SW faults, suggesting these were conduits to the mineralizing fluids. These conduits {{and the location of}} the Laisvall ore bodies are spatially linked to inflection areas along magnetic minima. The geometry of the ore bodies is consistent with the presence of sour gas traps in the sandstone aquifers that may provide reduced sulphur for the formation of economic Pb-Zn deposits...|$|R
40|$|The Las Canas <b>stratabound</b> Pb-Zn <b>deposit,</b> in {{northern}} Chile, is {{hosted by the}} Lower Cretaceous back-arc marine carbonate and subordinate andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Chanarcillo Group, one hundred meters above a thick pile of magmatic arc-related basaltic to andesitic lavas of the Bandurrias Formation. The deposit is not obviously related to local intrusive rocks, which include an Upper Cretaceous granodiorite batholith and dacite dikes emplaced along normal faults. Stratabound Pb-Zn-Ba mineralization is constrained within several porous stratigraphic units, including a 50 cm thick lapilli-tuff and less well mineralized algal-laminated limestone. Veins that locally carry some Pb-Zn occur along normal faults that displace the stratabound orebodies, and this study shows that they represent {{a different type of}} mineralization. Fluid inclusion microthermometric data for ore-stage quartz and barite indicate saline fluids (6 to 30 wt% NaCl eq) and a formation temperature in the range of 80 degrees C to 160 degrees C for the stratabound mineralization. Two types of fluid inclusions occur in the veins. The type I vein fluid inclusions indicate less saline (average 7 wt% NaCl eq) and slightly higher temperature fluids, in the range of 110 degrees C to 220 degrees C. The type II vein fluid inclusions indicate highly saline fluids (25 to 40 wt% NaCl eq) which might be related to minor copper mineralization. 206 Pb/ 204 Pb, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios for galenas from the stratabound mineralization, with mean values of 18. 42, 15. 59, and 38. 25, respectively, fall within the range of <b>stratabound</b> polymetallic <b>deposits</b> of northern and central Chile, and indicate a Lower Cretaceous magmatic rock source. Galenas from veins have slightly more radiogenic 206 Pb/ 204 Pb, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios, with mean values of 18. 47, 15. 61, and 38. 34, suggesting two distinct episodes of mineralization. delta 34 S values for galena and barite range from negative values (- 31. 2 per mil to - 12. 5 per mil and - 7. 7 per mil to + 12 per mil, respectively) in the mineralized tuff to higher values in the algal-laminated limestone (- 2. 5 per mil to + 1. 2 per mil and + 13. 2 per mil to + 17. 4 per mil, respectively), close to Lower Cretaceous marine sulfate values for barite, and homogeneous values for the galena from veins (- 12. 0 per mil+ or - 1 per mil). Changing redox conditions can partly account for delta 34 S variations in the tuff. Sulfur sources include magmatic rock sulfur (- 1. 5 per mil to + 9. 7 per mil) as well as sedimentary sulfides and marine sulfate...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} of the geochemistry of tungsten is given. The geochemical properties of tungsten have a strong influence on its mineralogy, distribution and abundance in crustal rocks and rock-forming minerals, and its migration/deposition within the ore-forming and supergene environments. The behaviour of tungsten during migration, from source to site of deposition, within the crust is discussed in some detail and environments considered favourable to the concentration of tungsten ore minerals are suggested. All major types of tungsten ore deposit are described with emphasis placed on those of greater economic importance. Characteristic features of each type of deposit are particularly emphasized {{in order to provide}} clear guidelines to exploration. Hydrothermal, pyrometasomatic and <b>stratabound</b> tungsten <b>deposits</b> present themselves, economically, as the most important exploration targets. The recently developed concept of syngenetic stratabound tungsten mineralisation is outlined. Exploration for deposits of this type should be aimed predominantly, but not exclusively, at volcano-sedimentary sequences of Lower Palaeozoic age, particularly within regions known to contain occurrences of Sb and Hg. Tungsten deposits commonly contain concentrations of {{one or more of the}} following metals: Sn, Sb, Bi, Mo, Au and Ag. The presence and possible extractive value of these metals, together with commonly associated metal impurities such as As, must always be taken into account in a feasibility studyAdobe Acrobat 9. 53 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{delineate}} the different lead–zinc mineralized zones in the Zardu area of the Kushk zinc–lead <b>stratabound</b> SEDEX <b>deposit,</b> Central Iran, through concentration–volume (C–V) modeling of geological and lithogeochemical drillcore data. The geological model demonstrated that the massive sulfide and pyrite+dolomite ore types as main rock types hosting mineralization. The C–V fractal modeling used lead, zinc and iron geochemical data to outline four types of mineralized zones, which were then compared to the mineralized rock types identified in the geological model. ‘Enriched’ mineralized zones contain lead and zinc values higher than 6. 93 % and 19. 95 %, respectively, with iron values lower than 12. 02 %. Areas where lead and zinc values were higher than 1. 58 % and 5. 88 %, respectively, and iron grades lower than 22 % are labelled “high-grade” mineralized zones, and these zones are linked to massive sulfide and pyrite+dolomite lithologies of the geological model. Weakly mineralized zones, labelled ‘low-grade’ in the C– V model have 0 – 0. 63 % lead, 0 – 3. 16 % zinc and > 30. 19 % iron, and are correlated to those lithological units labeled as gangue in the geological model, including shales and dolomites, pyritized dolomites. Finally, a log-ratio matrix was employed to validate the results obtained and check correlations between the geological and fractal modeling. Using this method, a high overall accuracy (OA) was confirmed for the correlation between the enriched and high-grade mineralized zones and two lithological units — the massive sulfide and pyrite+dolomite ore types...|$|R

The reserves {{are estimated to be}} about 5. 5 Mt of fluorite within six fluorite deposits. In this study,we aim to determine the age of the major fluorite mineraliza-tion event of the Pierre-Perthuis deposit (1. 4 Mt fluorite) by acombined study of the paragenetic mineral sequence and Sm-Nd dating on fluorite crystals. Fluorite occurs as isolatedcubes or filling geodes in a Triassic, silicified, dolomitic for-mation. Threefluoritestagesassociated with sphalerite,pyrite,galena, barite, and quartz have been distinguished using opti-cal, cathodoluminescence, and scanning electron micro-scopes. Seven crystals of the geodic fluorite stage were ana-lyzed for their rare earth element (REE) contents and their 147 Sm/ 144 Nd and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotopic compositions. Thenormalized REE distribution displays homogeneous bell-shaped patterns for all the geodic fluorite samples with aMid-REE enrichment over the Light-REE and Heavy-REE. The 147 Sm/ 144 Nd varies from 0. 3108 to 0. 5504 and the 143 Nd/ 144 Nd from 0. 512313 to 0. 512518. A six-point Sm-Nd isochron defines an age of 130 ± 15 Ma (initial 143 Nd/ 144 Nd= 0. 512054, MSWD= 0. 21). This Sm-Nd iso-chron provides the first agefor the stratabound fluorit...|$|R
