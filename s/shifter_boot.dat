2500|$|The {{downturn}} of the Mexican economy {{early in}} 1982 {{and a government}} decree banning the importation of [...] "luxury" [...] automotive accessories hit the country's auto industry. The 1982 VAM Gremlin returned as a slightly consolidated model. Both trim levels incorporated amber front parking lights and the AMC square pattern grille design {{that was used in}} U.S. domestic Eagle models. The base model incorporated chromed headlight bezels with blacked out internal areas while the X model were completely blacked out as also was the hood trim molding. The [...] I6 was upgraded {{for the first time since}} 1976, receiving a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio and net output of [...] at 4000rpm. This was achieved through a new head design that incorporated smaller spark plug outlets and a plastic valve cover. The A904 model automatic transmission was replaced in favor of the A998 model with wider gear ratios. The base model was similar to the prior year's except for new side trim and front end design. The X model saw the return of side decals the form of four thin stripes starting at the base of the B-pillar trim molding running all the way to the front edge of the fenders near the marker lights. A new silver [...] "GX" [...] decal appeared between the rear window and the right side tail light. For some reason, the sports steering wheel was replaced by the base design. The model was restricted to a three-speed automatic transmission with the novelty of the AMX/GT's console-type <b>shifter</b> <b>boot</b> and the rear differential changed to a [...] 3.07:1 ratio as used the year before with the now-unavailable four-speed manual.|$|E
5000|$|.....finely detailed, {{high-quality}} character. The {{more you}} look, {{the more you}} see. Throughout the cabin are few straight lines and 90-degree joints, if any. Instead, surfaces and controls are rounded, coved, or arched. Real stitching is used to join seams of the seats, <b>shifter</b> <b>boot</b> and soft material used on the door panels and around the instruments. Chrome and wood trim are used judiciously, tastefully, and the materials in the headliner and upper parts of the cabin look and feel like premium material.|$|E
2500|$|From 2001 to 2004 Buick {{offered a}} Joseph Abboud {{appearance}} package {{on both the}} GS and LS models. This package included either a solid taupe or two-tone taupe/chestnut leather seats, two-tone leather wrapped steering wheel, leather <b>shifter</b> handle and <b>boot,</b> 16" [...] aluminum wheels; and Joseph Abboud signature emblems on the front doors, floor mats, front seat head rests, and taillights.|$|R
50|$|The S-Zero {{is a more}} circuit-oriented {{version of}} the {{standard}} Type S. The suspension is even stiffer by using the NA1 Type R (1992 to 1995) suspension but retaining the Type S's larger rear sway bar. Unlike the standard Type S, the S-Zero did not offer cruise control, stereo, power door locks, airbags, air conditioning, traction control, power steering, fog lights or a navigation system. Honda {{came up with a}} new lightweight lead-acid battery and halved the thickness of the partition glass between engine bay and cabin to reduce even more weight. Changes were also made to the interior's manual transmission <b>boot</b> <b>shifter,</b> replacing the original material from leather to mesh. Much of the sound deadening material was also removed to reduce weight. Making the S-Zero 50 kg (110 lb) lighter than the Type S.|$|R

This infraction was levied as a P5 penalty - the second-highest level - outlined in Section 12-4.5 A (9) of the 2014 NASCAR rule book. Per the subsequent Section 12-4.5 B of the regulations, any P5 penalty resulted in a 50-point penalty for both the driver and team owner, a fine of between $75,000 and $125,000 as well as race suspension and probation periods for team members {{in relation to the}} infraction. As the infraction was detected during a post-race inspection, a further 25 championship points were deducted as well as a further fine of $50,000.|$|E
