They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction at these two secular cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a <b>scriptorium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive.

5|$|In {{the time}} of Sulien and his sons and grandsons the clas at Llanbadarn Fawr was an {{important}} <b>scriptorium</b> where texts were composed and copied. Rhygyfarch or Rhigyfarch, who was Sulien's eldest son, and may have succeeded him as bishop of St David's (after Sulien's second time in post), wrote, surely at his father’s request, his Vita Davidis or Life of St David (later translated into Welsh as Buchedd Dewi) c.1081 – c.1090. Clearly the book was intended to promote {{the restoration of the}} damaged see, especially {{in the face of the}} Norman challenge. Rhygyfarch and his brother Ieuan were both fine poets in Latin. Ieuan copied manuscripts and composed poetry (Ieuan also wrote, in Welsh, a verse to Padarn’s staff Cyrwen).|$|E
5|$|The book's current {{dimensions}} are 330 by 250mm. Originally, the folios were of no standard size, {{but they were}} cropped to the current size during a 19th-century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text. The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing. The book {{must have been the}} product of a major <b>scriptorium</b> over several years, yet was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline. It is believed that some 30 folios of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries. Ussher counted 344 folios in 1621, but several leaves had already been lost by then. The overall estimate is based on gaps in the text and the absence of certain key illustrations.|$|E
5|$|There are {{at least}} five {{competing}} theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona, then brought to Kells, where the illuminations were perhaps added, and never finished. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the <b>scriptorium</b> at Kells. Fourth, {{it may have been}} produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne, then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, {{it may have been the}} product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.|$|E

5|$|During Ceolnoth's archbishopric, monastic life {{declined}} {{under the}} pressure of the Viking attacks, and there was a noticeable decline in the quality of the books and other works produced by the <b>scriptoriums.</b> A number of monasteries died out {{under the pressure}} of the raids by the invaders, who wintered over in Kent in 851 and 855. He held councils in 839 and 845, the second at London.

5|$|During Leofric's bishopric, his cathedral {{library was}} the fourth largest in England, and was an {{important}} <b>scriptorium.</b> He gave an important manuscript of Old English poetry, the Exeter Book, to the cathedral library in 1072. Contained in the Exeter Book {{are a number of}} poems showing of all the principal types of poems composed in Old English. This manuscript is one of four main sources for modern knowledge of Anglo-Saxon poetry. Along with the Exeter Book, he also gave a number of other manuscripts and books to the cathedral upon his death. Three versions of the donation list drawn up by Leofric survive, {{which is one of the}} earliest surviving cathedral library catalogues. The list consists of 31 books used to conduct cathedral services, 24 other ecclesiastical works, and 11 works that were secular. This last group included philosophical works as well as poetry. The number of manuscripts that he owned and bequeathed to his cathedral was quite large for his time. Besides the Exeter Book and the Leofric Missal, Leofric's own copy of the Rule of Chrodegang also survives, although it is no longer at Exeter. Now it is at Cambridge University, where it is Corpus Christi College MS 191. Another surviving manuscript from Leofric's collection is a Gospel book written in Latin now in the Bodleian Library, which was probably acquired by Leofric while he was on the continent, as the manuscript was originally written for a Breton monastery. In all, about 20 of the manuscripts gifted by Leofric can be identified and are still extant, and only two remain at Exeter– including the Exeter Book.|$|E

50|$|This {{scenario}} changed {{during the}} renaissance of the 12th century. For several centuries, Popes had been sending clerics {{to the various}} kings of Europe.

As such, these clerics would become part of a kings retinue or court educating the king and his children, paid for by the pope, whilst facilitating the spread of knowledge into the Middle Ages. The church maintained classic scriptures in scrolls and books in numerous <b>scriptoriums</b> across Europe, thus preserving the classic knowledge and allowing access to this important information to the European kings. In return, kings were encouraged to build monasteries that would act as orphanages, hospitals and schools, benefiting societies and eventually smoothing the transition from the Middle Ages.|$|R
40|$|In Croatia the Benedictines arrived mostly {{likely in}} the VII. century. In their monasteries they {{developed}} <b>scriptoriums</b> which thankfully today give us an insight into writings and documents which would have very likely otherwise have been lost. Along with Latin the Benedictines in Croatia used the Old-slavic-croatian (hrvatskostaroslavenski) language. They wrote {{not only in the}} Latin script, but also in Cyrillic and glagolitic script which, given their ``tri-literate'' ability, made a distinct impression on Croatian culture. Pope Inocent IV {{played an important role in}} old Croatian multilinigualism and multi-literacy, who in 1252, at the request of the Benedictine monastery St Nicholas in Omišalj on the island of Krk, allowed the Benedictine clergymen the use of glagolitic script, and in church the use of old-slavic-croatian instead of Latin. Some of the most important monuments of Croatian culture are the work of the Benedictines: the Duke Trpimir inscription, the Povalj document, the Baška tablet and the Rule of Saint Benedict, the only preserved Glagolitic written Rule of Saint Benedict from the XIV. century, and probably the oldest known translation of St Benedict's Rule from latin to any other surviving language...|$|R
5000|$|Adémar de Chabannes {{was educated}} as a cantor and poet by his uncle Roger de Chabannes. The manuscripts written or revised by Roger de Chabannes {{together}} with his nephew, were created {{in the form of}} troper-prosers and sequentiaries with a new diastematic form of neume notation (F-Pn lat. 1240, 1120, 1121, 909), which became soon much more popular than the letter notation of William of Volpiano. They belonged to a new type of chant book which was no longer simply a liturgical book, but rather collected new poetry based on liturgical forms (in music as well as in poetry). This new form of chant book consisted of several books ("libelli") - the [...] "proser" [...] or [...] "troper" [...] for verses and tropes, the [...] "sequentiary" [...] for prosulae and sequences (troped elaborated alleluia refrains), the processional with processional antiphons, the offertorial for offertories etc. and the tonary. This new structural form soon spread beyond Aquitaine becoming popular in France and Normandy, {{due in part to the}} Cluniac Monastic Order, which was expanding its influence and adopted the work of the school of cantors at the Abbey of Saint-Martial for liturgical use. Cluny Abbey was founded by William I and already in Adémar's time its laic association had gained its power over more and more abbeys, their cantors and their <b>scriptoriums.</b> Adémar's fruitless efforts to become an abbot at Saint Cybard of Angoulême was a personal disappointment, but his ambitions were quite symptomatic for monasteries under Cluniac influence.|$|R

40|$|Sažetak Hrvatsko je srednjovjekovlje najsloženije razdoblje u našoj jezičnoj povijesti. Funkcionalna višejezičnost, prisutna u to vrijeme, dovodi do zaključka da između crkvenoslavenskoga i govornoga jezika nije postojao odnos bilingvizma nego diglosije, točnije triglosije u kojem postoje najviša varijanta, srednja varijanta te najniža varijanta. Autorice u radu navode argumente za tu tvrdnju, a to su postojanje čakavsko-crkvenoslavenskoga(-kajkavskoga) amalgama, postojanje hrvatskog crkvenoslavenskoga jezika te govornoga narodnog hrvatskoga jezika (lingua vernacula). Summary Bilingualism {{between the}} Church Slavonic (CS) and other Croatian idioms and Latin {{is based on}} the fact that they are two {{different}} languages, and these two systems never interefered in manuscripts. There are no examples of Latin liturgical texts in which rubrics are written in Croatian, as we often find that rubrics of liturgical codices are written in lingua vernacula, and the text in CS. This shows that the scribes see CS and lingua vernacula as higher and lower idioms. Thus, the Latin language was always experienced as a foreign and as such was in use, separated from the variants of Croatian. It performed all functions: official legal texts, liturgy and literature. Furthermore, in the Croatian Middle Ages, the relationship between the Croatian Church Slavonic (CCS) and lingua vernacula was diglossia, more accurately, including the transitional type of language, triglossia in which there were high, medium and low variations. All variants of Croatian have their own names and are different. There was the CCS, with high literary features. However, that language never satisfied all the requirements that one standard language must meet. There were two lower ranks of language which also had their scopes: Chakavian- -Church Slavonic (-Kajkavian) amalgam and Chakavian. Their scopes are socially well-defined. In some areas they negligibly overlap, but they never had a function of a high variant CCS – liturgy. It was used at the highest, official level, in the liturgical, biblical and ritual texts; it had determined scope. It was stable and highly regarded both in culture and in terms of language, and equally valuable as Latin. It was the highest version for liturgical use, as well as the language of miscellanies, where it was used only in texts of biblical content. It didn’t have native speakers (no one normally uses a high variant in everyday communication) and was taught only by formal education, primarily because it was a written language, language of literature. For private or informal reading a transitional type of language was used, the hybrid structure, Chakavian-Church Slavonic (-Kajkavian) amalgam as a literary language, super regional version found in miscellanies, the medium variant; a kind of link between the CCS and lingua vernacula. Non-liturgical literary works, written by the late 14 th Century in CCS were mainly created in Glagolitic monastery <b>scriptoriums.</b> Kajkavian elements were not involuntary. We find them in Petrisov zbornik. The tendency of that language is directed toward national, primarily Chakavian. Lingua vernacula, Chakavian or Chakavian-Kajkavian (Chakavian-Štokavian) language, the lowest variant, is used for everyday life, charters and testaments, especially in legal documents from 14 th century; apart from Latin, the only representative of the administrative style; standardized to a certain degree (its norm is unwritten, but noticeable). We find it in epigraphy, graffiti, in the rubrics of codices, in notes on the margins of manuscripts, colophons, etc. It sometimes had elements of CS, but only as feature of higher style. Finally, it dominated both Latin and CCS; it eventually became very expressive, multi-functional and stylistically developed linguistic form, despite the opinion that the low variant was inappropriate for any valuable written expression. In bilingualism, borrowing terms has never occurred with Latin. However, in triglossia that was intentional. This confirms that the scribes have not experienced CS as a foreign system in relation to Chakavian and Chakavian-Church Slavonic (-Kajkavian) amalgam, as they have Latin. Confirmation for this is the name of Kožičić’s Missal: Missal hruacki, not Missal (Old or Church) Slavionic. Then, scholars in the Vrbnik Capitol School studied Latin and Croatian school, and not (Old) Slavonic. Besides, there was never Chakavian- -Latin amalgam as Chakavian-Church Slavonic (-Kajkavian) ...|$|R
