5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) {{have few}} instances; {{there is one}} example of a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor <b>stereoselectivity,</b> poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E
40|$|We {{synthesized}} {{several types}} of novel D-psicofuranosyl acetate derivatives, and investigated their use as glycosyl donors in scandium triflate-catalyzed D-psicofuranosylation reactions. Psicofuranosylation demonstrated unique <b>stereoselectivities</b> depending on the protecting groups of psicofuranosyl donors. The donor having a 3, 4 -isopropylidene group afforded β-psicofuranosides with high <b>stereoselectivities.</b> Donors having a C 3 benzoyloxy group demonstrated low <b>stereoselectivities</b> with no neighboring group participation. This study also discusses the <b>stereoselectivities</b> of psicofuranosylation based on the conformers of the glycosyl oxocarbenium ion intermediates as influenced by the protecting groups of the psicofuranosyl donors. We also compared the neighboring group participation of the glycosyl donors bearing a C 3 benzoyloxy group during D-psicofuranosylation and D-fructofuranosylation...|$|R

These cycloadditions are predicted {{to take place}} via stepwise mechanisms. The <b>stereoselectivities</b> of cycloadditions involving siloxyallyl cations derived from chiral α-methyl benzylic alcohols are controlled by two effects: minimization of steric repulsion between the α-Me group and the allyl group and attractive CH−π interactions between the furan and the aryl group...|$|R

However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall <b>stereoselectivity.</b> These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E

40|$|Ab initio (RHF/ 3 - 21 G and RHF/ 6 - 31 G* basis sets) and semiempirical (AM 1 and PM 3) quantum {{chemical}} calculations {{have been}} applied to a study of Diels-Alder reactions of furan and cyclopentadiene as 1, 3 -dienes, with norbornene and 7 -oxanorbornene as dienophiles, in order to model π-facial selectivities and <b>stereoselectivities</b> of these reactions. To achieve this goal, transition states for these reactions are located and activation energies estimated. The exclusive exo π-facial selectivity exhibited in these cycloadditions are readily predicted using semiempirical or ab initio methods. To determine stereochemical outcomes following π-facial attack, ab initio calculations are required. Exo,endo <b>stereoselectivities</b> found experimentally, are successfully predicted by using RHF/ 6 - 31 G*// 3 - 21 G or higher levels of calculations.

On the other hand, when the reactions were carried out under neutral conditions, the <b>stereoselectivities</b> were very low, and the yields were decreased by visible light irradiation. Comparison of the UV-vis spectra between the acidic and the neutral conditions elucidated that the red shift was observed in acidic solutions. These results show that HCl plays essential roles {{not only in the}} preorientation of substrates through cation-π interactions, but also in the changes in the absorption properties of substrates that enable visible light reactions...|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen bond {{catalysts}} {{can also}} accelerate reactions by assisting {{in the formation}} of electrophilic species through abstracting and/or coordinating an anion such as a halide. Urea and thiourea catalysts are the most common donors in anion-binding catalysis, and their ability to bind halides and other anions has been well established in the literature. The use of chiral anion-binding catalysts can create an asymmetric ion pair and induce remarkable <b>stereoselectivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the seminar}} {{paper on the}} total {{synthesis}} of (+)-monensin, Kishi and co-workers utilized the allylic strain to induce asymmetric induction in the hydroboration oxidation reaction. The reaction is regioselective and stereoselective. The regioselectivity of the reaction {{is due to the}} significant positive character developed at the tertiary carbon. The <b>stereoselectivity</b> of the reaction is due to the attack by the borane from the least hindered side to which is where the methyl group lies at.|$|E
25|$|The use of cation-pi {{interactions}} {{has also}} been successfully implemented in reactions with synthetic catalysts. A combination of anion-binding and cation-pi strategies {{can be used to}} effect enantioselective cationic polycyclizations. In the transition state, it is proposed that the thiourea group binds chloride, while the aromatic system stabilizes the associated polyene cation. In support of this, increasing the size of the aromatic ring leads to improvements both in yield and <b>stereoselectivity.</b> The enantioselectivity correlates well with both the polarizability and the quadrupole moment of the aryl group.|$|E

25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{carbonyl}} olefination methods that are direct alternative to the Julia olefination are known: the Wittig reaction, the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, Peterson olefination, and others. The primary advantage of Julia olefination is that the sulfone precursors are sometimes more readily available and easier to purify than the corresponding phosphorus- or silicon-containing compounds. Additionally, {{a variety of methods}} to synthesize sulfones exist. Nonetheless, the sometimes limited <b>stereoselectivity</b> (and in particular, the difficulty of accessing (Z) -alkenes) of the Julia reaction can be problematic. Many alternative methods for olefination, including the Peterson reaction, do not have this issue.|$|E
25|$|Samarium iodide is {{effective}} for {{the reduction of}} {{a wide array of}} functional groups; however, other reducing agents are more useful in certain contexts. SmI2 causes reductive dimerization of allylic or benzylic halides, and chiral halides undergo non-stereospecific reduction. On the other hand, its functional group compatibility is greater than many reducing agents—halide reduction is possible in the presence of esters or alcohols. Reductive fragmentations with samarium iodide have the disadvantage that they are not stereospecific; however, <b>stereoselectivity</b> is higher in some cases when SmI2 is used in place of other reducing agents. Reduction of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives to the corresponding saturated carbonyl compounds by SmI2 is a useful transformation mediated by few other reducing agents. The mild reaction conditions employed for samarium iodide reductions represent a significant advantage of the reaction over other single-electron reductions, including dissolving metal reduction and transition-metal induced methods.|$|E
