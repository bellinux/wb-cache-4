5|$|The Velvet Underground & Nico is {{the debut}} album by American rock band the Velvet Underground, {{released}} in March 1967 by Verve Records. Accompanied by vocalist Nico, {{the album was}} recorded in 1966 while the group were featured on Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia event tour, which gained attention for its experimental performance sensibilities and controversial lyrical topics, including drug abuse, prostitution, <b>sadomasochism</b> and sexual deviancy.|$|E
5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian {{themes in}} {{literature}} {{became much more}} diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values {{are evident in the}} writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian <b>sadomasochism</b> themes.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Barbarella and Danger: Diabolik {{led to a}} minor trend of film adaptations of comic strips that {{emphasized}} mild <b>sadomasochism</b> and late 1960s fetish gear. Diabolik {{was the first of}} three European comic strip adaptations released in 1968, the other two being Piero Vivarelli's Satanik and Roger Vadim's Barbarella. These films were followed by Bruno Corbucci's Ms. Stiletto and Corrado Farina's Baba Yaga (1973). The look of Diabolik influenced the comic series. The film's audiences could see Diabolik's mouth because Law's mask was made of latex. This resulted in the comic's artists Enzo Facciolo and Sergio Zaniboni giving up on trying to shade in his mouth and simply outlining it.|$|E
5|$|Tightrope (1984) had Eastwood {{starring}} opposite Geneviève Bujold in {{a provocative}} thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for <b>sadomasochism.</b> Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Miller portrayed Piggy in Robert Siodmaks The Rough and the Smooth {{opposite}} Tony Britton, William Bendix and Edward Chapman. He played Dr. Pfeiffer in {{the episode}} Twentieth Century Theatre: The Price of Freedom of the BBC Sunday Night Play. The same year, Miller starred in Michael Powell's psychological horror thriller Peeping Tom, playing {{a doctor who}} the main protagonist (Karlheinz Böhm), a serial killer who murders women while using a portable movie camera fitted with a spike to record their dying expressions of terror, approaches to cure his scopophilia. It was a controversial film {{at the time of}} release with themes of child abuse, <b>sadomasochism</b> and fetishism, although Miller's performance, played comically, stood in contrast to the film's dark themes, and it has since gained a cult following and is now considered a masterpiece.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{inheritance}} {{was running}} out. Trying to earn money, {{he was hired}} by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to help protect him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in <b>sadomasochism.</b> Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as Ambergris, Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The World's Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote Liber 777, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.|$|E
5|$|In 1209, the Jain scholar, minister, {{builder of}} temples and army {{commander}} Janna wrote, among other classics, Yashodhara Charite, a {{unique set of}} stories in 310verses dealing with <b>sadomasochism,</b> transmigration of the soul, passion gone awry and cautionary morals for human conduct. The writing, although inspired by Vadiraja's Sanskrit classic of the same name, is noted for its original interpretation, imagery and style. In one story, the poet tells of the infatuation of a man for his friend's wife. Having killed his friend, the man abducts the wife, who dies of grief. Overcome by repentance, he burns himself on the funeral pyre of the woman. The stories of infatuation reach a peak when Janna writes about the attraction of Amrutamati, the queen, to the ugly mahout Ashtavakra, who pleases the queen with kicks and whip lashes. This story has piqued the interest of modern researchers. In honour of this work, Janna received the title Kavichakravarthi ("Emperor among poets") from his patron, King Veera BallalaII. His other classic, Anathanatha Purana (1230), is an account {{of the life of the}} 14thtirthankar Ananthanatha.|$|E
5|$|This {{change is}} {{apparent}} {{in the writings of}} the Hoysala court poets, some of who are noted for pioneering works in native metres. The Veerashiava poet Harihara, {{one of the most prominent}} poets of the medieval era, established the ragale tradition with his biography of Basavanna (Basavaraja Devara ragale, 1160), the earliest available biography of the social reformer and of the Kannada language as well. His nephew Raghavanka established the shatpadi metre in his unique and original narration of the story of King Harishchandra called Harishchandra Kavya (1200). Sisumayana is credited with introducing a new composition called sangatya (1232) in his allegorical poems Tripuradahana ("Burning of the triple fortress") and Anjanacharita. Some Jain authors continued the champu tradition, such as Janna, immortalised by his writing Yashodhara Charite (1207), a unique set of stories in 310 verses dealing with <b>sadomasochism</b> and transmigration of the soul. The earliest well-known Brahmin writers also emerged during the late 12th century and wrote on themes ranging from Vaishnava faith (Rudrabhatta's Jagannatha Vijaya, 1185) to secular treatises on poetics (Kavi Kama's Sringara Ratnakara, on poetic sentiment and flavor).|$|E

25|$|The term <b>sadomasochism</b> {{is derived}} from the words sadism and masochism. These terms differ {{somewhat}} from the same terms used in psychology, since those require that the sadism or masochism cause significant distress or involve non-consenting partners. <b>Sadomasochism</b> refers to the aspects of BDSM surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain. Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting pain, degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being hurt, humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario. Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM—for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised—and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties. <b>Sadomasochism</b> does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures).|$|E

25|$|However, some gay {{men such as}} Andrea Dworkin's husband John Stoltenberg {{are also}} {{critical}} of <b>sadomasochism</b> and pornography and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that <b>sadomasochism</b> eroticizes both violence and powerlessness. The gay pro-feminist author Christopher N. Kendall wrote the book Gay Male Pornography: An Issue Of Sex Discrimination, advancing the idea that gay male pornography involved sex discrimination and should be banned under Canada's equality laws. He uses radical feminist theory {{to make the case}} that gay male pornography reinforces misogyny and homophobia.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, an {{organization}} called ReviseF65 has worked to remove <b>sadomasochism</b> from the ICD. In 1995, Denmark became the first European Union country to have completely removed <b>sadomasochism</b> from its national classification of diseases. This was followed by Sweden in 2009, Norway in 2010 and Finland 2011. Recent surveys on the spread of BDSM fantasies and practices show strong variations {{in the range of}} their results. Nonetheless, researchers assume that 5 to 25 percent of the population practices sexual behavior related to pain or dominance and submission. The population with related fantasies is believed to be even larger.|$|E
25|$|BDSM is {{a variety}} of often erotic {{practices}} or roleplaying involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, <b>sadomasochism,</b> and other related interpersonal dynamics. Given {{the wide range of}} practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent upon self-identification and shared experience.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{suffered}} a severely dysfunctional upbringing. He committed various crimes {{from the age}} of 16 and had served time in borstals and prisons. While living in Southend, he started frequenting the Coleherne pub, a gay pub in Earl's Court. Ireland sought men who liked the passive role and <b>sadomasochism,</b> so he could readily restrain them as they initially believed it was a sexual game.|$|E
25|$|Robert Mapplethorpe’s XYZ portfolios, {{explored}} three subjects: homosexual <b>sadomasochism</b> (X); flower {{still lifes}} (Y); and nude portraits of African American men (Z). The extremely graphic S photos from Mapplethorpe’s X Portfolio were {{displayed in a}} separate, age-restricted area during at each venue of the exhibition. The portfolios were displayed {{with a series of}} poems by poet and singer Patti Smith. The poems echo Mapplethorpe's X,Y,Z trope.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010 a Swedish court acquitted a 32-year-old man {{of assault}} for {{engaging}} in consensual BDSM play with a 16-year-old woman (the age of consent in Sweden is 15). Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position, that safe and consensual BDSM play should {{not be subject to}} criminal prosecution. This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries which have removed <b>sadomasochism</b> from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.|$|E
25|$|In her 2003 book Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective, Australian radical lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys {{advances}} {{the position}} that lesbian culture has been negatively affected by emulating the sexist influence of the gay male subculture of dominant/​submissive sexuality. While she stresses that many gay men {{who were members of}} the gay liberation movement repudiated <b>sadomasochism,</b> she writes that the dominant gay male perspective has promoted sadomasochistic sexuality to the detriment of lesbians and feminist women.|$|E
25|$|BDSM is {{a variety}} of erotic {{practices}} or roleplaying involving bondage, dominance and submission, <b>sadomasochism,</b> and other interpersonal dynamics. Given {{the wide range of}} practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on self-identification and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include cross-dressers, extreme body modification enthusiasts, animal players, latex or rubber aficionados, and others.|$|E
25|$|Antichrist is a 2009 English-language Danish {{experimental}} horror film {{written and}} directed by Lars von Trier, and starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. It {{tells the story of a}} couple who, after the death of their child, retreat to a cabin in the woods where the man experiences strange visions and the woman manifests increasingly violent sexual behaviour and <b>sadomasochism.</b> The narrative is divided into a prologue, four chapters and an epilogue. The film was primarily a Danish production and co-produced by companies from six different European countries. It was filmed in Germany and Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Both Krafft-Ebing and Freud {{assumed that}} sadism in men {{resulted}} from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. Masochism in men, however, {{was seen as a}} more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that masochism in men was ever a primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism. <b>Sadomasochism</b> in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Both also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that {{it would be difficult to}} distinguish as a separate inclination.|$|E
25|$|Havelock Ellis, in Studies in the Psychology of Sex, {{argued that}} there is no clear {{distinction}} between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that <b>sadomasochism</b> is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, psychologists Kurt Ernulf and Sune Innala from Sweden {{published}} an analysis based on answers {{from members of}} the bondage-oriented Usenet group alt.sex.bondage. Most of the answers (76%) were from men. In 71% of the answers the active (restraining) role in bondage was played by heterosexual men, in 11% by heterosexual women and in 12% by homosexual men. 29% of the heterosexual men, 89% of the heterosexual women and 88% of the homosexual men played the passive (restrained) role. A third of the people who answered said they practised bondage in connection with sadomasochistic activities or at least thought bondage and <b>sadomasochism</b> belonged together.|$|E
25|$|Flower and Snake {{and other}} Dan's works {{published}} in various S magazines, such as Kitan Club, Fuzoku Club, Uramado, and Abu Hunter, were {{made available to}} a large public. Moreover, he influenced many subsequent writers who took up the theme of <b>sadomasochism</b> later, such as Murakami Ryu, for example. Thus, although Dan Oniroku's works are generally not considered a high-brow literature but a soft pornography, his influence on certain works of Japanese popular fiction and film industry is considerable. Moreover, Dan not only contributed to the Japanese pink film industry {{but also to the}} S publications, as he established another S magazine, SM King in 1972 (active till 1974).|$|E
25|$|It is {{agreed on}} by some psychologists that {{experiences}} during early sexual development {{can have a}} profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life. Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of <b>sadomasochism</b> within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males. The results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for sadism.|$|E
25|$|The {{first day}} of the trial {{consisted}} of personal testimonies of a number of witnesses, which included one of the victim's girlfriend who had left the house in the early morning before the murders, a mail carrier, house cleaner, neighbors who had entered the house in the evening after registering smoke, and other people who were text messaging either with the victims or with Dahlgren {{on the day of the}} killings. On the second day, more testimonies were, after State Attorney's and Dahlgren's consent, read by the judge. This was followed by questioning of expert witnesses. According to toxicology report, there were no drugs nor alcohol in the blood of the victims. According to a sexologist testimony, Danhlgren was not a sadist, despite being interested in <b>sadomasochism.</b> His sexual orientation could not be determined due to his sexual immaturity.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{development in}} body piercing in England occurred in 1987, when during Operation Spanner, {{a group of}} homosexuals—including well known body piercer Alan Oversby—were convicted of assault for their involvement in consensual <b>sadomasochism</b> over a 10-year period, including acts of body piercing. The courts declared that decorative body piercing was not illegal, but that erotic body piercing was. Subsequently, the group Countdown on Spanner formed in 1992 in protest. The group appealed the decision before the High Court of Justice, the House of Lords and finally the European Commission of Human Rights, attempting to overturn the verdict which ruled consent immaterial in acts of <b>sadomasochism,</b> without success. In spite of their repeated failures, the situation publicized the issue, with The Times editorializing the court's decision as [...] "illiberal nonsense" [...] in 1993.|$|E

500|$|There is an {{aesthetic}} focus on Béart's body, Julien telling Marie that [...] "I love your neck, your arms, your shoulders, your mouth, your stomach, your eyes -- I love everything." [...] The focus {{is more than}} erotic as it symbolises Marie's fight for corporeality. The film includes Rivette's first ever sex scenes, one of them arranged by Béart. The five candid and emotionally charged sex scenes focus on their upper bodies and faces, and on their erotic monologues that employ elements of fairy tale, horror, and <b>sadomasochism.</b>|$|E
