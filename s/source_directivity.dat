The <b>source</b> <b>directivity</b> is expressed as a linear combination of elementary spherical harmonic sources.

At runtime, the timevarying <b>source</b> <b>directivity</b> is decomposed into spherical harmonic coefficients. These coefficients are combined with precomputed spherical harmonic sound fields to generate propagated sound field at the listener position corresponding to the directional source. In order to compute spatial audio for a moving and rotating listener, an efficient plane-wave decomposition approach based on the derivatives of the sound field is presented.

The microphone data is corrected for shear-layer effects using the model of an infinitely thin shear layer by Amiet. Investigations of the room-acoustics of the test hall show strong reflections from the ceiling and two side walls, which cause strong interference patterns at the microphone positions. The acoustic change between different rotor confgurations, like different rotor spacings and an upstream mounted mock pylon, is shown with spatially averaged spectra. The evaluation of the <b>source</b> <b>directivities</b> is strongly influenced by the interference patterns of the reflections in the test hall.

The first study in this dissertation shows that using directional sources over an omni-directional source in room acoustics computer models produces significant differences both in terms of calculated room acoustics parameters and auralizations.

We simulated the strong ground motion of the Meinong earthquake using the stochastic finite-fault technique and then analyzed the residual of the ground motions between simulated and observed values. The finite-fault simulation utilized the EXSIM code, developed by Boore (2009) and modified from Motazedian and Atkinson (2005). We designed the parameters carefully to include new regional attenuation models to our stochastic modeling and applied site correction processing to the synthetic waveforms using the HVSR of the weak motions and the Meinong earthquake. The synthetic ground motion was applied with the following steps to correct the site response: (1) The Fourier spectrum of the synthetic waveform was calculated. (2) HVSR for individual stations were multiplied by the synthetic Fourier spectrum. (3) An inverse fast Fourier transform was applied to convert the modified synthetic Fourier spectrum back to the synthetic waveform in the time domain. We applied the same steps to site-correct the synthetic waveforms using the HVSR of weak motions and the Meinong mainshock. The nonlinear site effect and <b>source</b> rupture <b>directivity</b> were investigated with residual analysis. We applied the HVSR of earthquakes to correct site amplification in the stochastic modeling because HVSR is readily available. In addition, we analyzed the nonlinear site effect by calculating the DNL values in the frequency domain and the PGA reduction in the time domain. The DNL values can quantify the difference in the Fourier spectrum between strong and weak motions and reveal the de-amplification during strong shaking in the frequency domain. We calculated the PGA reduction during the Meinong mainshock by comparing the simulated PGA that used the HVSR of weak motions and the simulated PGA that used the HVSR of the Meinong mainshock for site correction. The de-amplification site response during strong shaking in the time domain is revealed in the PGA reduction phenomenon. The nonlinear soil effect induced by the Meinong earthquake was identified. In addition, the analysis of the ground motion simulation by two different site corrections using weak and strong motion also indicates the importance of the nonlinear site effect in ground motion prediction especially in regions with soft deposits. We analyzed the residuals of the observed and simulated PGA and compared them with the azimuth to determine the influence of <b>source</b> rupture <b>directivity.</b> The Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE) was applied to verify our results.
