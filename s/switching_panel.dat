50|$|Each {{microphone}} was channeled to {{a central}} <b>switching</b> <b>panel,</b> where an operator would read the score and mute those that were not in use to keep noise and leakage to a minimum. Engineers in the basement used headphones for sound mixing and cathode ray oscilloscopes for level indicators, while those who picked up the distant orchestra sound used horn monitoring. In the 42 days of sessions, over ninety miles of sound track were recorded. After being developed, the film was shipped to the Disney studios in Burbank, California where tone and other adjustments were made prior to mastering. The nine recorded sound tracks were then mixed into four - three for the music, voices and special effects and the fourth {{for control of the}} volume of the first three.|$|E

These areas had used 4-1-1 for directory assistance, {{and because of the}} ability of common-control switching to analyze the initial digits of a number in a [...] "sender" [...] before routing the call, these areas did not require the dialing of an initial [...] "1" [...] to initiate a long-distance call. There was no ambiguity, because the initial assignment of area codes always used either a [...] "0" [...] or a [...] "1" [...] as the second digit, and the second digit of local numbers was never a [...] "0" [...] or a [...] "1" [...] because of the use of two-letter plus 5-digit local numbering, with the letters only on digits 2-9 of the dial.|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} contained in a large panel data set is used to date historical turning points of the Austrian business cycle and to forecast future ones. We estimate groups of series with similar time series dynamics and link the groups with a dynamic structure. The dynamic structure identifies a group of leading {{and a group of}} coincident series. Robust results across data vintages are obtained when series specific information is incorporated {{in the design of the}} prior group probability distribution. The results are consistent with common expectations, in particular the group of leading series includes Austrian confidence indicators and survey data, German survey indicators, some trade data, and, interestingly, the Austrian and the German stock market indices.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the lending behavior of banks by exploiting a rich panel dataset on the contract terms of approximately two million {{commercial and industrial}} loans granted by 580 banks between 1977 - 1993. Using a Markov <b>switching</b> <b>panel</b> model we demonstrate that banks change their lending standards from tightness to laxity systematically over the cycle. We then use an efficient minimum chi-square estimator {{to examine the relationship}} between the cyclical component of aggregate unemployment and bank lending standards when both variables are jointly endogenously determined in a system of simultaneous equations with mixed, continuous/discrete dependent variables. The patterns we uncover suggest that lax lending standards that tend to occur during expansions exert considerable influence on the dynamics of aggregate fluctuations. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between financial development and economic growth {{in a sample of}} 69 countries. A regime <b>switching</b> <b>panel</b> vector autoregression model is specified to detect directional changes in finance-growth causality and potential time variation of such causality patterns. In addition, a clustering analysis is performed to identify the presence of convergence clubs based on data properties. The findings show that most countries have switching between two states: one way causality from growth to financial development but not the other way round, and coexistence of bi-directional causality. Poorer countries are represented by a system with stable steady state while the clusters of advanced economies tend to exhibit multiple steady states. The clustering results map closely the degree of financial openness, and the cultural and geographical proximities of member countries. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of second phase of issuing banking licences, on the determinants of allocative, scope, and cost efficiencies of Indian scheduled commercial banks. The paper follows a two stage estimation process. In the first stage, allocative, scope and cost efficiency scores are estimated following Data Envelopment Analysis. Thereafter, in the second stage, using these scores, determinants of the stated efficiencies are analysed by specifying a regime <b>switching</b> <b>panel</b> regression model. Prior studies, both {{in the context of}} Indian and international banks, do not measure and analyse the determinants of scope efficiencies of Banks. The findings reveal that reforms had little impact on the stated measures of efficiency. However, on each of these efficiency parameters, state owned banks perform better than private or even foreign owned banks. Further, the paper finds that profitability, size, ownership and economic growth rate are significant determinants of the stated efficiency measures. As expected, we find {{that as a result of}} competition, net interest margins of Indian public and private sector banks have come close to global standards. Reforms have resulted in adoption of global asset classification norms which has resulted in rationalisation of risk across assets. We also find that bigger banks tend to be more efficient although {{the impact of}} size on all stated measures of efficiency is diminishing over time. Thus, in order to enhance efficiency, policy measures must encourage banks to reduce their cost to income ratio and enhance their size measured as log of deposits. Accordingly, in order to enhance efficiency, banks need to introduce a number of investment products that are linked to the risk of advances, thus catering to the diversified expectation of depositors. Another way for banks to enhance their efficiency is by offering a wide array of products and services which would result in higher scope efficiency by reducing the cost to income ratio.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for simulating wear, rolling contact fatigue, and plastic deformation for a mixed traffic situation in {{switches and crossings}} (S&C) has been developed. The methodology includes simulation of dynamic vehicle—track interaction considering stochastic variations in input data, simulation of wheel—rail contacts accounting for non-linear material properties and plasticity, and simulation of wear and plastic deformation in the rail during {{the life of the}} S&C component. To find means of improving the <b>switch</b> <b>panel</b> design, the geometry of a designed track gauge variation in the <b>switch</b> <b>panel</b> has been represented in a parametric way. For traffic in the facing and trailing moves of the through route, an optimum solution was identified and then validated by evaluating a wide set of simulation cases (using different wheel profiles). The optimum design includes a 12 mm maximum gauge widening. Several crossing geometries were investigated to find an optimal geometric design for the crossing nose and wing rails. The MaKüDe design showed the best performance for moderately worn wheel profiles in both running directions (facing and trailing moves). In connection with reduced support stiffness (e. g. elastic rail pads), this crossing design is predicted to lead to a significant reduction of impact loads and consequently provide a high potential of life-cycle cost reduction...|$|R
