50|$|High <b>subsonic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> (0.4 < M < 0.75) and {{transonic}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> (0.75 < M < 1.2) {{are designed}} {{on the same}} principles as the <b>subsonic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The highest speed is reached in the test section. The Mach number is approximately 1 with combined subsonic and supersonic flow regions. Testing at transonic speeds presents additional problems, mainly due to {{the reflection of the}} shock waves from the walls of the test section (see figure below or enlarge the thumb picture at the right). Therefore, perforated or slotted walls are required to reduce shock reflection from the walls. Since important viscous or inviscid interactions occur (such as shock waves or boundary layer interaction) both Mach and Reynolds number are important and must be properly simulated.Large-scale facilities and/or pressurized or cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are used.|$|R
