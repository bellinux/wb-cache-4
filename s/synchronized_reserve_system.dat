50|$|The Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> {{has faced}} various criticisms since its {{inception}} in 1913. These criticisms include the assertions that the Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> violates the United States Constitution and that it impedes economic prosperity. Critic Miranda Fleschert contends that the twelve regional Federal Reserve banks (as opposed to the entire Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>System)</b> consider themselves to be private corporations with private funding. The movement to audit the Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> has gained national traction; a bill related to the movement was passed through the House of Representatives in 2012. Many critics see auditing the Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> as a means of gaining insight into an institution they contend has historically had little to no transparency, that has acted without congressional approval or oversight, and that has the power to create and loan U.S. dollars based on a monetary policy determined by its own interests.|$|R

40|$|Ad hoc reserve {{design has}} been shown to produce inefficient <b>reserve</b> <b>systems</b> in {{terrestrial}} environments, limiting opportunities to achieve conservation goals. In this paper, we devise a framework for systematic marine reserve design using South Australia as a case study. The framework consists of the reservation goals, a database of conservation features, a method for identifying conservation priorities and measures to evaluate the performance of alternative marine <b>reserve</b> <b>systems.</b> MARXAN, a <b>reserve</b> selection algorithm, was used to identify marine <b>reserve</b> <b>systems</b> for three different scenarios. In the first scenario, MARXAN was free to either ignore or incorporate South Australia’s existing marine reserves. The second scenario was required to identify marine <b>reserve</b> <b>systems</b> that built on South Australia’s existing marine reserves, whilst the third scenario gave preference to sites adjacent to South Australia existing coastal and island reserves. Expanding on the existing marine reserves led to significantly larger marine <b>reserve</b> <b>systems,</b> reflecting the inefficiency of ad hoc marine reserve design decisions in South Australia. Using area to perimeter ratio as a measure of efficiency, we then explore the consequences of spatial clustering in alternative marine <b>reserve</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The UK {{has begun}} {{looking for an}} {{alternate}} electric systems and wind generation is a solution they have started researching. Wind generation can displace {{a significant amount of}} energy by a large conventional plant, but the concern is weather this system can replace the capacity and flexibility of a conventional power plant. Another dilemma that they have with this system is {{that the majority of the}} wind is located in Scotland and the North of England; they need to have reinforcements for the transmission of north-south flow of energy[...] The concern about wind generation being able to replace a power plant is important because wind power is variable, and the power will need to be retained to ensure that there is a supply of power under conditions of high demand and low wind. Since wind is not easy to predict additional reserves will be needed to maintain the balance of supply and demand. The obvious answer would be an energy storage system that has intermittency of renewable sources: during periods when wind exceeds the demand, the supply can be stored in a standing <b>reserve</b> or <b>synchronized</b> <b>reserves.</b> Standing reserve will increase the capability of the systems to incorporate wind power. <b>Synchronized</b> <b>reserve</b> will accommodate relatively frequent but comparatively small imbalances between generation and demand while standing reserve will be absorbing less frequent but relatively large reductions in wind power. This trade-off between reserves should balance out costs and wind power. It was found that this wind system would be able to accommodate, power with a small increase in overall cost, about 5% for consumers.|$|R

40|$|Implementing {{systematically}} designed <b>reserve</b> <b>systems</b> {{is crucial}} to slowing the global decline of coral reef health and diversity. Yet, the paucity of spatial data for most coral reef taxa often requires conservation planners to design <b>reserve</b> <b>systems</b> based only on a subset of taxonomic groups as surrogates for all other taxa. In terrestrial systems the validity of surrogates for reserve design is established by testing for cross-taxon congruence (similarities in spatial patterns of species richness), but this concept has rarely been examined in the marine environment. We tested the suitability of taxa as conservation representation surrogates of coral reef species richness across the Indo-Pacific, based on species lists of fishes, corals, and mollusks from 167 sites. First, we tested the relevance of cross-taxon congruence patterns to predict these surrogacy patterns. We determined congruence between taxonomic groups by conducting a correlation analysis of dissimilarity values between pairs of sites. We then evaluated how well each taxonomic group represented the other groups in a marine <b>reserve</b> <b>system</b> selected by a greedy reserve-selection algorithm relative to <b>reserve</b> <b>systems</b> selected by chance. No taxonomic group we examined was a reliable surrogate for the other groups such that site selection based on that group always represented other taxa significantly better than random selection of sites. Sites selected based on hard corals represented the other taxonomic groups in a <b>reserve</b> <b>system</b> worse than randomly selected sites. Although we found high cross-taxon congruence between fishes and corals and between corals and mollusks, for some regions cross-taxon congruence was not always a reliable indicator of the ability of one taxonomic group to efficiently represent another in a <b>reserve</b> <b>system.</b> We concluded that in Indo-Pacific coral reef ecosystems one can only be sure that a target taxon is efficiently represented in a <b>reserve</b> <b>system</b> when data on that taxon are used to select a <b>reserve</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
