5|$|The {{effects of}} the film were entirely low-budget. Nearly every effect in the film was done via things picked up at a make-up and Halloween store located close to where the film was shot. The effects in the film were notably more {{intricate}} than the simple ones featured in Raimi's prior projects, and contained mutilated bodies, stabbed body parts and demonic possession skin-attachments. Tom Sullivan {{was one of the}} primary make-up supervisors on set, and he found it difficult working presentable effects out of such low budgets. One notable example involved a chest stabbing rig that had to be attached to Spiegel's chest by <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> duct tape.|$|E
5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E

5|$|Gaga did not preview {{the costumes}} {{for the tour}} until the opening night. There were seven outfits created for the show, all {{throughout}} the different segments. The first was a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the dress {{with a pair of}} feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from The Fame era. A rave inspired outfit was worn for the last segment and consisted of colorful dreadlocks and legwarmers made of fur. She added a shirt consisting of <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> plastic sleeves with it. One of the complex outfits was made of latex and consisted of a polka dotted leotard and a number of tentacles attached to the dress as well as a headpiece with two tentacles from it.|$|E
5|$|In {{interviews}} {{before the}} release of Rewrite, Tonokawa expressed interest in expanding on the story if the game was well received. Shortly after Rewrites release, Tonokawa approached Takahiro Baba with the proposal, who gave his approval {{for the production of}} a fan disc. Titled Rewrite Harvest festa!, the fan disc was produced by the same staff as Rewrite, and was released on July 27, 2012, playable on a Windows PC. It came bundled with the fan disc's original soundtrack titled Feast, a CD containing recordings of Radio Rewrite, an original booklet, two mobile phone <b>straps,</b> <b>and</b> one promotional card each from the trading card games Weiß Schwarz, Lycèe and Phantasmagoria. Prototype released a PS Vita port of Harvest festa! on May 18, 2017.|$|E

25|$|The décolleté style made shawls {{to become}} an {{essential}} feature of dresses. Corsets lost their shoulder <b>straps,</b> <b>and</b> fashion was to produce two bodices, one closed décolletage for day and one décolleté for evening.|$|E
25|$|Sports and {{hydration}} backpacks {{are smaller}} with a profile {{closer to the}} body, wider <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> can come with water bladders and hip belts for running, cycling or hiking. Camelbak is one such company {{best known for its}} hydration pack.|$|E

25|$|Pointe {{shoes are}} {{designed}} for ballet dancing. These have a toe box that is stiffened with glue and a hardened sole so the dancer can stand on the tips of their toes. They are secured by elastic <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> ribbons that {{are tied to the}} dancer's ankles.|$|E
25|$|Early scuba {{sets were}} usually {{provided}} with a plain harness of shoulder <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses {{did not have a}} backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{established}} methods and materials for stabilizing and securing intermodal containers loaded on ships, {{as well as}} the internal cargo inside the boxes. Conventional restraint methods and materials such as steel <b>strapping</b> <b>and</b> wood blocking and bracing have been around for decades and are still widely used. Polyester <b>strapping</b> <b>and</b> lashing, and synthetic webbings are also common today. Dunnage bags (also known as [...] "air bags") are used to keep unit loads in place.|$|R
25|$|Regal {{interiors}} {{were generally}} more luxurious than lesser Century models with woodgrain trim on dashboard and door panels, along with door-pull <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> bench seats with center armrests with cloth, velour, or vinyl upholstery. Optionally available throughout the run was a 60/40 split bench seat with armrest. For 1976-77, the Regal coupe was available with the S/R option that included reclining bucket seats with corduroy upholstery.|$|E
25|$|Fish-skin boots (amirak ~ amiraq sg amiriik dual in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) are {{waterproof}} skin boot made of fish skin. In {{the past}} fish-skin boots {{were made with}} depilated soles of bearded seal, ankle <b>straps,</b> <b>and</b> a casing sewb to the upper edge of the leg. Large salmon skins were prepared for boots by sewing up the fin holes. A round needle was used because a triangular needle would split the skin.|$|E
25|$|Typical school backpacks {{generally}} {{lack the}} rigid frame of an outdoor-style backpack and include {{only a few}} pockets in the front {{in addition to the}} main storage compartment. While traditionally very simple in design, school backpacks are often made with padded shoulder <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> backs as well as additional reinforcement to hold large numbers of heavy textbooks, as well as safety features such as reflective panels to make the wearer of the pack more visible at night.|$|E

25|$|Traditional babywearing in Japan {{was done}} with a wrap carry, using an obi (sash). In the 1940s, a carrier known as the onbuhimo became popular. Similar to the Hmong and Mei tai carriers, the onbuhimo has long top <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> a {{rectangular}} body. But {{at the bottom of}} the rectangle, loops or rings allow the top straps to be threaded through and tightened, while the straps are tied at the waist. The body is much smaller than the bodies of most mei tais and other Asian-style carriers, and the onbuhimo is traditionally used on the back. Variations may have stiff headrests or padding in the body.|$|E
25|$|Despite the closure, FWP did not {{implement}} {{new rules}} to require bear-proof food containment in 2014, as staff had recommended. Instead, the agency purchased food storage boxes for placement at leased boat camps on private land, ordered all floaters to close food containers with <b>straps</b> <b>and</b> to pack out certain food waste (such as bacon grease), {{and issued a}} new floater education pamphlet about how to avoid bear problems. But with bear activity continuing, {{by the end of}} 2015 the agency began a rulemaking to implement mandatory bear-proof food and waste storage. The new rules went into effect in the 2016 float season, and the food lockers were removed from the boat camps.|$|E
25|$|The {{bulk of the}} Roman port {{was quickly}} rebuilt after Boudicca's {{rebellion}} when the waterfront was extended with gravel to permit a sturdy wharf to be built perpendicular to the shore. The port was built in four sections, starting upstream of the London Bridge and working down towards the Walbrook {{at the center of}} Londinium. Expansion of the flourishing port continued into the 3rd century. Scraps of armour, leather <b>straps,</b> <b>and</b> military stamps on building timbers suggest that the site was constructed by the city's legionaries. Major imports included fine pottery, jewelry, and wine. Only two large warehouses are known, implying that Londinium functioned as a bustling trade center rather than a supply depot and distribution center like Ostia near Rome.|$|E
