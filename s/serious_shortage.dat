5|$|Gaza's {{food prices}} rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, {{households}} spent {{an average of}} 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According {{to a report by}} OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.|$|E
5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E

50|$|The Axis {{countries}} had <b>serious</b> <b>shortages</b> of petroleum {{from which to}} make liquid fuel. The Allies had much more petroleum production.

25|$|Following the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, the World Bank {{reported}} severe {{damages to}} the water and sanitation infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. Almost all sewage and water pumps were out of operation {{due to a lack}} of electricity and fuel. Spare parts and other maintenance supplies were in urgent need to be replenished. This situation resulted in a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of water and sewage overflows in urban areas, posing a threat to public health.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{communications}} {{plagued the}} Austrian commanders throughout the campaign. This was {{a consequence of}} the wide separation between the two wings. Furthermore, many of Alvinczi's men were indifferently equipped raw recruits who straggled badly. The Austrians also suffered from a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of officers. After Alvinczi sent him a mistaken report that Masséna was reinforcing Vaubois, Davidovich became very cautious. The report was sent on 9 November but only reached its recipient on the 11th, which was typical of the Austrian communications problems. Alvinczi also repeatedly urged Davidovich to speed up his march toward Verona.|$|E
25|$|In {{its final}} years, ASOPA {{introduced}} training for secondary teachers and more specialised administration courses. In 1970 {{there was a}} major change of focus as, with Papua New Guinea independence looming, the Australian Government turned to ASOPA to make good a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of trained indigenous administrators. The School enrolled up to 60 Papua New Guineans in ten-month management training courses. At the same time, the training of Australians was phased out. In these later years, ASOPA's work became more international. Although Papua New Guinea remained strongly represented, increasing numbers of students came from other developing countries in the Pacific and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|McGruder’s {{second term}} (2112–2116) was {{initially}} successful, despite {{the mental health}} problems which she had acquired during the interval, but her mental impairment became worse over time. She suspended the Council of Five (as noted above) in favour of calling forums of senior judges if and when needed. Among several misguided policies was a controversial scheme to use robot judges to alleviate a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of human judges, continually trying to force the scheme through even though the robots repeatedly malfunctioned and killed people. After a robot attempted to kill her, she was eventually persuaded to resign again. An Interim Council of three judges ruled briefly until a new chief judge was elected.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} flaw arose because a large {{proportion}} of the land in the new colony was bought for speculative reasons by people who had no intention of migrating to New Zealand and developing the land they had bought. This meant that the new colonies had a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of employers and consequently a shortage of work for the labouring classes. From the outset the New Zealand Company was forced to be the major employer in the new colonies and this proved a serious financial drain on the company. Repeated approaches were made to the British government seeking financial assistance and in late 1846 the company accepted an offer for a £236,000 advance with strict conditions on, and oversight of, future company operations.|$|E
25|$|Later, Georgia also severed {{diplomatic}} relations with Nicaragua. Georgia moved to economically isolate the regions. A ban on economic activity in the regions without Georgian permission was issued, and anyone caught violating this ban by the Georgian authorities faced prosecution. The Georgian Navy blockaded the coast of Abkhazia, and has seized 23 cargo ships trying to bring supplies to Abkhazia, most notably fuel supplies. Abkhazia is dependent on fuel imports, and faced a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> as a result. Russia began deploying boats from its own Black Sea Fleet on 21 September 2009, in response. In August 2009, Russia and South Ossetia accused Georgia of shelling Ossetian villages and kidnapping four South Ossetian citizens. Russia threatened to use force unless the shelling stopped, and put its troops stationed in South Ossetia on high alert.|$|E

50|$|The {{popularity}} of the UCR nominee, Hipólito Yrigoyen, and <b>serious</b> <b>shortages</b> of goods and capital {{as a result of}} World War I both undermined the Conservatives, whose strategists counted on a deadlock in the electoral college to translate favorably for the Rojas-Serú ticket (such as deadlock would necessitate the election of the presidential by Congress, where Conservatives retained majorities). Ultimately, however, Yrigoyen secured a narrow majority in the college, and Rojas was defeated.|$|R
25|$|On 10 May, Joffre and Foch {{decided that}} {{infantry}} attacks {{would have to}} reflect {{the capacity of the}} artillery to support them and a proposal by d'Urbal to attack south of Arras was rejected. Joffre ordered several cavalry divisions to move towards the Tenth Army area as a decoy. To keep German reserves pinned down, a feint attack was made north of the Lorette Spur towards Loos, which managed a small advance on the left, until stopped by the fire of German artillery in Angres. On the Lorette Spur, machine-gun fire from a German strong point near the chapel caused many French casualties. A counter-attack from the sugar refinery between Ablain and Souchez was seen assembling and the French attack in the area was suspended. Barrage fire by the French artillery prevented the German infantry from advancing and the French infantry descended from the spur towards the Ablain ravine. The attack on Carency continued and German counter-attacks recover ed some of the communication trenches and tunnels connecting it with Souchez. During the day, houses east of the village were stormed and a hollow south of the Carency–Souchez road was captured. A lull occurred on the main front as the French infantry reorganised and the surviving German defenders recovered from the effects of the attack. French gunners were hampered (paralysed) by their ignorance of the positions of the infantry and left unable to fire a preparatory bombardment; the gunners concentrated on shelling German reserves seen advancing and on counter-battery fire. The most advanced French infantry were cut off by German barrage-fire, suffered from a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of water and frequently were counter-attacked, which rapidly reduced their ability to attack again, particularly in the units which had advanced the furthest. To the south of XXXIII Corps, the 39th Division attacked Neuville on the orders of the corps commander, despite the reservations of the divisional and army commanders and suffered a costly repulse by devastating fire from the defenders. On the right, beyond the Arras–Béthune road, Neuville cemetery was taken and counter-attacks by German reserves brought up from Douai and Lens were repulsed.|$|E
500|$|To {{increase}} {{the rate of}} discharge, the Tug and Lighter Company, a unit which {{had served in the}} Siege of Tobruk, was sent to Port Moresby. On arrival on 23 August, it found only two lighters and no tugboats. It improvised, repairing the wharf's crane and salvaging tackle from the wreck of the Macdhui. Harbour craft arrived on Liberty ships {{over the next couple of}} months, but no more than one tug and ten lighters were available at any time during 1942. The African-American 611th Port Company arrived in June, and an Australian docks operating company in mid-September. Major R. C. Ballantyne, who had been in charge of wharf operations at Tobruk, was appointed Docks Superintendent. [...] Unloading was still slowed by the lack of storage space in the wharf area.

500|$|Simpson {{embarked}} on the transport Nieuw Holland on 15 September 1940, arriving in Kantara, Egypt, on 12 October. He {{met with his}} British counterparts, and discussed arrangements {{for the creation of}} an AIF Signals School in the Middle East. Some negotiation was required before this proposal was finally accepted. He was disappointed at the standard of training that had been achieved by the I Corps and 6th Division signals units in the Middle East, and just as disappointed with the reinforcements arriving from Australia. Both the standard of training of the units and the establishment of the schools intended to remedy the situation were hampered by a <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of equipment. The 6th Division's list of critical shortfalls—by no means restricted to signals equipment—included 120 telephones and [...] of electrical cable. Not until January 1941—after the 6th Division had been committed to battle in Libya—did the cable become available in Australia. Some units equipped themselves with captured enemy materiel.|$|E
50|$|The first {{movement}} toward {{what was to}} become The University of Michigan-Dearborn began with some studies in the middle 1950s of manpower supply conducted by Archie Pearson, director of training for Ford Motor Company.

500|$|Variously {{throughout}} the war, <b>serious</b> <b>shortage</b> of able-bodied men ("manpower") {{occurred in the}} country, and women were required to take {{on many of the}} traditional male roles, particularly in the area of arms manufacture; though this was only significant in the later years of the war, since unemployed men were often prioritised by employers. Women both found work in the munitions factories (as [...] "munitionettes") despite initial trade union opposition, which directly helped the war effort, but also in the Civil Service, where they took men's jobs, releasing them for the front. The number of women employed by the service increased from 33,000 in 1911 to over 102,000 by 1921. The overall increase in female employment is estimated at , from 5.9 to , and female trade union membership increased from 357,000 in 1914 to over a million by 1918—an increase of 160 percent. Beckett suggests that most of these were working class women going into work at a younger age than they would otherwise have done, or married women returning to work. This taken together with the fact that only 23 percent of women in the munitions industry were actually doing men's jobs, would limit substantially the overall impact of the war on the long-term prospects of the working woman.|$|E
500|$|The Spruce Production Division {{established}} approximately 60 military logging camps {{throughout the}} Pacific Northwest, usually near existing sawmills.

He said that the production must be increased from [...] to [...] to meet the demand. In early 1918, the division opened a sawmill at Vancouver Barracks, the largest spruce sawmill in the world, [...] "producing more than one million feet of spruce lumber each day."

500|$|The deteriorating {{quality of}} roads {{was due to}} bad attendance, and the then ongoing growth in road {{transport}} made it even harder for the Soviet authorities to focus their resources on attendance and maintenance projects. The transport of freight by road had increased by 4,400 {{percent in the past}} thirty years, while the growth of hardcore surfaced roads had grown only by 300 percent. Growth of motor vehicles had increased by 224 percent in the 1980s, while hardcore surfaced roads only increased by 64 percent. As Soviet economists in the early to mid-1980s said, the Soviet Union had 21 percent of the world's industrial output, but only a meager 7 percent of the world's top quality roads. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–85; spanned through the rules of Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko) called for the construction of an additional 80,000km hardcore surfaced roads, but this was far from adequate in solving the <b>serious</b> <b>shortage,</b> and the planners needed to build at least twice as many roads to meet consumer demand. Another obstacle was that Five-Year Plans in the USSR's later life were rarely fulfilled due to economic malfunctions. Many roads were not paved, and because of this shortage, several dirt roads were created. By 1975 only 0.8 percent of [...] households owned a car. Productions of cars, however, had increased dramatically in the late 1970s. From 1924 to 1971 the USSR produced 1 million vehicles, and the government passed another milestones five years later when it had produced 2 million vehicles.|$|E
