500|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} reasons why Ganteaume played no further Test cricket after his single match. Apart from {{the slow pace}} of his batting during that hundred—Goddard later suggested {{that it would have been}} better for Ganteaume's career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred— West Indies' batting was strong at the time and there was plenty of competition for places in the team. Even so, his teammate and later West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky to be left out of subsequent teams. It is also possible that Ganteaume was affected by his attitude to authority. The cricket journalist Martin Williamson suggests: [...] "Ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti-establishment attitude as for slow scoring. He was certainly not someone who was going to bow and <b>scrape</b> <b>to</b> the white players who still dominated the region's cricket." [...] In later years, Ganteaume served as a Test selector and was West Indies manager in 1973–74. In 2007, his autobiography, My Story: The Other Side of the Coin was published, in which he criticised the West Indies [...] "establishment" [...] of his playing days. He died at the age of 95 on 17 February 2016. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer, and the second oldest in the world.|$|E

60|$|Charles Doricourt {{was another}} {{friend of the}} Count Mirabel, but not his imitator. His {{feelings}} were really worn, {{but it was a}} fact he always concealed.

Any other man but Charles Doricourt must have sunk beneath these accumulated disasters, but Charles Doricourt always swam. Nature had given him an intrepid soul; experience had cased his heart with iron. But he always smiled; and audacious, cool, and cutting, and very easy, he thoroughly despised mankind, upon whose weaknesses he practised without remorse. But he was polished and amusing, and faithful to his friends. The world admired him, and called him Charley, from which it will be inferred that he was a privileged person, and was applauded for a thousand actions, which in anyone else would have been met with decided reprobation.|$|E

The hand however is almost immediately stolen by Boogey (who uses it to scare Grim to pieces, though Grim actually blew himself up on purpose). Believing he has won, Boogey {{turns out to be}} incapable of facing his worst fear, realizing that he is not at all scary (Grim actually turned the hand's power off right after he picked it up).
