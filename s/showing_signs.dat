5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands.

A male may stop <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other.

5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{produced}} extensive {{poetry in}} Old English, {{some of which}} was written down {{as early as the}} 9th century, although most surviving poems were compiled in the 10th and early 11th century. Beowulf, probably written between 650 and 750, is typical of these poems, portraying a vivid, heroic tale, ending with the protagonist's death {{at the hands of a}} dragon, but still <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of the new Christian influences in England. Old English was also used for academic and courtly writing from the 9th century onwards, including translations of popular foreign works, including The Pastoral Care.|$|E
5|$|Whales {{were once}} {{uncommon}} in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, but {{have increased their}} presence in both waters as global populations have recovered. Recent increases within the Mediterranean basin, including re-sightings, indicate that more whales may migrate into the inland sea in the future, not only for wintering but also for feeding. Humpbacks are also <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of re-expanding into former ranges, such as Scotland, Skagerrak and Kattegat, as well as Scandinavian fjords such as Kvænangen, where {{they had not been}} observed for decades.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} convection roughly 1,100km (700mi) east of Guam. A broad, low-level circulation center {{had formed}} within the system and became increasingly organized, <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of developing convective banding. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released later that day as convection was rapidly consolidating around the low, which was embedded within {{the eastern end of}} the monsoonal trough. It was then declared as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC with the latter designating it as Tropical Depression 15W The tropical depression was tracking westward along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge situated east of the international dateline.|$|E

The two met in an unadvertised match for the United States Championship at the Royal Rumble event with Miz retaining his title, but in the Royal Rumble match itself MVP eliminated both himself and The Miz. During the rivalry with MVP, Miz began <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of an allegiance with The Big Show and on the February 8 episode of Raw, the two defeated champions D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows) to become the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, making Miz the first wrestler in WWE history to hold three championships {{at the same time}} (U.S., World Tag Team, and WWE Tag Team Champion).|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2015 it was {{revealed}} that during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet. Police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.|$|E
5|$|On September 4, a {{cold front}} exited {{the coast of}} Texas into the Gulf of Mexico. A {{convective}} band from the front continued southeastward and stalled between Veracruz, Mexico and Tampa, Florida. The band began to split into two on September 6; the northeastern portion developed into a frontal wave and tracked northeastward, while the southwestern portion remained nearly stationary and began <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of tropical organization. Located {{in an area of}} generally low pressures, the system developed a spiral band structure, though deep convection was mostly intermittent. Subsequent to the formation of a surface circulation, the system developed into a tropical depression while located about 450miles (725km) northwest of Mérida, Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wavean area of {{low pressure}} oriented north to southmoved off the African coast well south of Dakar on September5, 1993, and tracked rapidly westward across the tropical Atlantic. Positioned {{at a relatively}} low latitude, the wave interacted with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, fostering convection in its vicinity. It developed a weak low-pressure center at sea level, which passed directly over Trinidad on September11. The majority of the system subsequently moved inland along the northern coast of South America, although it maintained its identity and emerged over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September13. Owing to favorable tropospheric conditions aloft, the system began <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of development as the deep convection organized into well-defined curved rainbands. Based on the improvement in the cyclonic structure and the presence of a surface circulation, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as a tropical depression at 1800UTC on September14, about 105miles (165km) north of the northern coast of Panama.|$|E
5|$|After Michigan {{began the}} season with a 22 record under senior starter Gardner and with head coach Hoke under pressure, Morris started in the September 27 Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. Michigan lost the game 3014, earning its third loss earlier than it had ever done in the 135-year history of Michigan football. The 16-point loss was the largest loss to Minnesota since 1977 and the largest to Minnesota at home since 1962. On September 30, Michigan {{athletic}} director Dave Brandon revealed that Morris suffered a concussion during the game but still played after <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> of a concussion. This revelation sparked calls for Brandon to be fired, including a protest on the Michigan campus. When Gardner was injured in week 7 (October 11) against Penn State, Russell Bellomy and not Morris was the replacement, due to what was presumed to be lingering injuries (high-ankle sprain and/or concussion) to Morris.|$|E
