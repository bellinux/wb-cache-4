The growth {{and exploitation}} parameters of Pomadasys jubelini (Cuvier, 1830) were studied from January 2007 to December 2008 in Grand-Lahou, Ebrié and Aby lagoons. A total of 2284 specimens (8. 50 to 32. 70 cm FL) were examined. Length-frequency data collected were analyzed with FiSAT software (FAO-ICLARM Fish Stock Assessment Tool). The demographic structure of P. jubelini was composed of young individuals with a majorant allometric growth. Estimation of growth and exploitation parameters gave: L∞= 33. 60 cm; K= 0. 53 year- 1; t 0 = - 0, 30 year; φ'= 2. 78; M= 1. 10 year- 1; F= 0. 26 year- 1; E= 0. 19 in Grand-Lahou lagoon, L∞= 31. 50 cm; K= 0. 56 year- 1; t 0 = - 0, 29 year; φ'= 2. 75; M= 1. 21 year- 1; F= 0. 63 year- 1; E= 0. 34 in Ebrié lagoon and L∞= 31. 50 cm; K= 0. 57 year- 1; t 0 = - 0, 28 year; φ'= 2. 74; M= 1. 22 year- 1; F= 0. 71 year- 1; E= 0. 37 in Aby lagoon. Pomadasys jubelini stock was more exploited in lagoon Aby than in the other lagoons. The maximum recruitment was observed from July in Grand-Lahou and Ebrié lagoons and May in Aby lagoon...|$|E
