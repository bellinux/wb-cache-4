500|$|One of {{the major}} {{difficulties}} early in the deployment to Namibia was poor radio communications. The Australian contingent was equipped with PRC-F1 HF radios (manufactured by AWA), first issued to the Australian army in 1969. Output power was limited to one or ten watts PEP. HF radio communications were frequently impossible in the early month {{or two of the}} deployment. The primary factor was the March 1989 geomagnetic storm, exacerbated by <b>skip</b> <b>zone,</b> and ground plane effects resulting from the sandy environment and the high water table. [...] Detachments were often out of radio contact for extended periods, with no satisfactory alternate means of communication except couriers. Because the Australian force operated over large distances, with troop deployments often up to [...] from squadron or force headquarters, courier communications often took days. Later in the deployment, the UN provided the contingent with higher-powered (100W) Motorola Micom X state-of-the-art HF equipment.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} {{decreasing}} the <b>skip</b> <b>zone</b> is by decreasing {{the frequency of}} the radio waves. Decreasing the frequency is akin to increasing the ionospheric width. A point is eventually reached when decreasing the frequency results in a zero distance <b>skip</b> <b>zone.</b> In other words, a frequency exists for which vertically incident radio waves will always be refracted back to the Earth. This frequency is equivalent to the ionospheric plasma frequency and is also known as the ionospheric critical frequency, or foF2.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{retailers}} are currently experiencing explosive growth and mounting pressure from consumers to provide faster and cheaper delivery of product. This project develops two strategies to improve delivery speed, reliability, and cost for digital retailers operating in key North American markets (i. e. New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago). <b>Zone</b> <b>Skipping</b> Transportation This project develops a <b>zone</b> <b>skipping</b> transportation model and associated business case for retailers with multiple consumer channels (i. e. digital and brick and mortar). <b>Zone</b> <b>skipping</b> pools digital and retail shipments, utilizing dedicated ground transportation of product from central distribution hubs to last-mile delivery hubs in key cities. For reasonable input parameters, <b>zone</b> <b>skipping</b> {{is shown to}} improve delivery speed by 20 %, improve on-time delivery performance by 20 %, and reduce costs by 10 % over traditional carrier zone shipping. Multinodal Distribution (Ship-from-Store Simulation) Many multi-channel retailers employ multinodal distribution networks, but desire store fulfillment capabilities in key cities to improve key delivery metrics (speed and cost). To validate these capabilities, retailers can develop easily-tailorable analytical simulation models to test various hypotheses and distribution parameters. This project helps address two major ship-from-store questions: 1. What to Ship - A SKU stocking strategy that minimizes variability and ensures predictable and right-sized demand levels. The strategy needs to accurately predict future demand based on limited historical information. 2. How to Fulfill - The transformation of a store back room into a mini distribution center {{and all of the}} processes design to enable rapid fulfillment time given highly variable demand The SKU stocking strategy leverages advanced analytics, and the operational fulfillment processes are tested using simulation software that enables rapid manipulation of key variables to uncover optimal process flows. The resulting simulation model and SKU stocking framework can be leveraged by digital retailers to operationalize ship from store processes and accurately predict digital demand levels for future store fulfillment nodes. by Jordan Daniel Charles.

50|$|A <b>skip</b> <b>zone,</b> {{also called}} a silent zone or zone of silence, is {{a region where}} a radio {{transmission}} can not be received. The zone is located between regions both closer and farther from the transmitter where reception is possible.|$|E
50|$|The <b>skip</b> <b>zone</b> is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} that cannot be influenced by technical means. Its width depends on the height {{and shape of the}} ionosphere and, particularly, on the local ionospheric maximum electron density characterized by critical frequency foF2. It varies mainly with this parameter, being larger for low foF2. With a fixed working frequency it is large by night and may even disappear by day. Transmitting at night is most effective for long distance communication but the <b>skip</b> <b>zone</b> becomes significantly larger. Very high frequency waves and higher normally travel through the ionosphere wherefore communication via skywave is exceptional. A highly ionized Es-Layer that occasionally may appear in Summer may produce such an example.|$|E
5000|$|Shortwave radio {{frequency}} energy {{is capable of}} reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by ionospheric reflection back to the earth by the ionosphere, (a phenomenon known as [...] "skywave propagation"). A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a <b>skip</b> <b>zone</b> (see first figure on that page) where reception fails. With a fixed working frequency, large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night.|$|E
40|$|Bedload {{transport}} {{studies are}} essential {{in the understanding}} of river forms, functions and processes. These studies have been done using various methods over the past century. In recent years Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) has become popular with researchers to track bedload particles. However, no standard operating procedures are used in the implementation of this technology. Methods used for tagging, seeding and tracking RFID tracers (RFID transponders inserted into a bedload particle) can introduce variability in their detection. In this study, RFID tracers were used to study four sites in Laurel Creek in Waterloo, Ontario. Two hundred RFID tracers were seeded {{in each of the four}} sites. Following three major storm events, the tracers were tracked with an antenna and their locations surveyed. The tracers were able to be detected to a precision of 1 m as a transponder used can be detected at a maximum of this distance. Practical tracking in the field highlighted the need for the understanding of how precisely the tag location can be identified. Laboratory experiments were designed and carried out to determine the effects of factors (tracer orientation, antenna orientation, tracer size, clustering of multiple tracers, burial depth, saturation and submergence of the soil matrix) that possibly confounded detection. Of these factors, tracer orientation, clustering and burial depths were determined to be the ones that affected detection distances the most. A transponder in a vertical orientation was found to have as much as 40 % larger range of detection than a transponder in a horizontal orientation (i. e., they could be detected from further away). Additionally, “skip zones” were identified during laboratory and field experiments. These are zones of gaps in the electromagnetic field of the transponder that occur directly over the transponder. These zones were experimentally determined to extend to approximately 10 cm on each side of the transponder. Therefore, by identifying the <b>skip</b> <b>zones,</b> the tracers can be located to a precision of 10 cm; this is an order of magnitude smaller than the published detection limit of the transponder. The precision of detection can also be improved by the reduction of the effects of confounding factors. However, the improvement in the precision of detection is a tradeoff with the ease of detection. A tagging, seeding and tracking protocol is recommended to counter the effects of confounding factors...|$|R
500|$|Heavier {{heavy metals}} {{are not usually}} formed this way since fusion {{reactions}} involving such nuclei would consume rather than release energy. Rather, they are largely synthesised (from elements with a lower atomic number) by neutron capture, with the two main modes of this repetitive capture being the s-process and the r-process. In the s-process ("s" [...] stands for [...] "slow"), singular captures are separated by years or decades, allowing the less stable nuclei to beta decay, while in the r-process ("rapid"), captures happen faster than nuclei can decay. Therefore, the s-process takes {{a more or less}} clear path: for example, stable cadmium-110 nuclei are successively bombarded by free neutrons inside a star until they form cadmium-115 nuclei which are unstable and decay to form indium-115 (which is nearly stable, with a half-life [...] times the age of the universe). These nuclei capture neutrons and form indium-116, which is unstable, and decays to form tin-116, and so on. In contrast, there is no such path in the r-process. The s-process stops at bismuth due to the short half-lives of the next two elements, polonium, and astatine, which decay to bismuth or lead. The r-process is so fast it can <b>skip</b> this <b>zone</b> of instability and go on to create heavier elements such as thorium and uranium.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, {{the bulk}} of UPS' {{competition}} came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations, a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU), for final distribution. This process {{is also known as}} <b>zone</b> <b>skipping,</b> long used by Parcel Consolidators. UPS also has a separate product called [...] "SurePost" [...] which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for [...] "final mile" [...] delivery.|$|R
50|$|At higher latitudes, a {{noticeable}} <b>skip</b> <b>zone</b> sometimes {{appears on the}} band during darkness hours in midwinter, which can {{be as much as}} 300 miles/500 km, rendering communication with some nearby stations impossible. This is not generally a problem at middle or equatorial latitudes, or for large parts of the year anywhere, but it does occasionally limit local wintertime traffic on the band in areas such as Northern Europe, the northern tier of the United States and Canada.|$|E
5000|$|When using {{medium to}} high {{frequency}} radio telecommunication, there are radio waves which travel both {{parallel to the}} ground, and towards the ionosphere, {{referred to as a}} ground wave and sky wave, respectively. A <b>skip</b> <b>zone</b> is an annular region between the farthest points at which the ground wave can be received and the nearest point at which the refracted sky waves can be received. Within this region, no signal can be received because, due to the conditions of the local ionosphere, the relevant sky waves are not reflected but penetrate the ionosphere.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} paper is to examine the problem of short range communications, in particular, communications within the area of the high frequency band commonly known as the <b>skip</b> <b>zone</b> or silent area and to determine the feasibility and extent to which a horizontally polarized antenna could be used to alleviate these problems. A documentation of the problems of short range communications as they affect U. S. Naval operations will be made, including ship to shore, shore to ship, and ship to ship communications. Current methods of communicating within this region will be examined, and a study of the cost effectiveness of the solution will be made to determine if the solution is in fact worth the the investment.

40|$|A unique {{resource}} providing continuous {{observations of}} the critical frequencies since 1935 and layer heights since 1952 {{has been used to}} determine the long-term trends above Tromso in Northern Norway (69 degreesN, 19 degreesE). These, and the recent results of Ulich et al. [Ulich, T., Cliverd, M. A., Rishbeth, H. Determining the long-term change in the ionosphere. EOS Trans. 84 (52), 581 - 585, 2003] have then been used to illustrate the effects of layer height changes on radio system modelling and operation by reference to high frequency ground range and <b>skip</b> <b>zone</b> variations. The analysis ignores the effects of the variations in the underlying E-region and changes in the F 2 layer critical frequencies. Consequently, the system impact is expected to be higher still. It is shown that a 16 kin drop in h(m) F 2 will introduce ground errors of similar to 100 km with higher values under certain circumstances. The Tromso analysis indicate that these ground range errors will not occur until the year 2110, however, the results of Ulich et al. [EOS Trans. 84 (52), 581 - 585, 2003] indicate that this condition occurred in the year 2000. This study demonstrates an urgent need to reach a consensus understanding of long-term ionospheric trends. A reassessment of the CCIR and URSI worldwide maps of ionospheric characteristics is likely necessary. (C) 2004 QinetiQ. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
