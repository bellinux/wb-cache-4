5|$|Chief Justice Morrison Waite died a {{few months}} later, and Cleveland {{nominated}} Melville Fuller to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's nomination to the Civil Service Commission, preferring his Chicago law practice. The <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.|$|E
5|$|During her {{subsequent}} {{testimony before}} the U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee {{as part of the}} confirmation hearings, she refused to answer questions about her view on the constitutionality of some issues such as the death penalty as it was an issue that she might have to vote on if it came before the court.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with his}} two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton {{appointed}} 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive {{a vote in the}} Republican-controlled <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee. In all, 84percent of his nominees were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|After the 1922 elections, Cotillo {{became the}} {{chairman}} of the influential State <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee, a sign of his rising authority. The post helped him to get ready for a next step. In 1924, he was the first Italian-born to become Justice of the New York Supreme Court, First District, where he would he remain until his death. He was elected with the endorsement of the Tammany Hall political machine, many social welfare organizations and organized labor, the Citizen's Union and several bar organizations.|$|E

Hennings, {{offering}} to appear before the <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Constitutional Rights Subcommittee hearings about discrimination in the South.|$|R
50|$|Later in the year, the DICO {{bill was}} merged with other civil union {{proposals}} and the <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee discussed a new draft known as Contratto di Unione Solidale (Contract for Social Unions). Nevertheless, in February 2008, an early election was called, thus dissolving the incumbent Parliament, and all pending legislation died in committee.|$|R
5|$|Attorney General George H. Williams {{administered}} the United States Department of Justice with slackness. There were rumors that Williams was taking bribes {{in exchange for}} declining to prosecute pending trial cases. In 1875, Williams was supposed to prosecute the merchant house Pratt & Boyd for fraudulent customhouse entries. The <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee had found that Williams had dropped the case after his wife had received a $30,000 payoff. When informed of this, Grant forced Williams's resignation. Williams had also indiscreetly used Justice Department funds to pay for carriage and household expenses.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{resigned}} from the Advisory Council on October 25, 1894 {{to run for the}} Senate. He was elected in November 1894 and served continuously through 1904. During his tenure in the Senate, Brown served on the Council of State from June 23, 1895 through 1901, and on the <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary,</b> Coinage, and Foreign Relations committees. In November 1904, though nominated, Brown was not re-elected. There was talk of Brown running again in the general elections of 1906 and 1908, but in 1910 he was re-elected. Cecil Brown effectively retired from the Senate in May 1914.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various {{proposals}} for Reconstruction. Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio. Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.|$|E
50|$|Nething {{was elected}} to the North Dakota State Senate for District 29 as a Republican and served until 2012. He served stints as {{majority}} leader (1975-1985) president pro tempore (1997-98). Towards the end of his Senate career, he served as chairman of the <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee. He did not run for re-election in 2012, opting to retire.|$|R
50|$|Early in his career, Marshall clerked for United States District Judge Barrington D. Parker {{and then}} {{served as a}} Counsel to Senator Edward M. Kennedy with the <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee; Counsel to Senator Ernest F. Hollings and Senator Albert Gore Jr. with the Senate's Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee; and Counsel to Senator Albert Gore Jr. with the Senate's Governmental Affairs Committee.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee also faced {{attempts}} to dislodge the bill. Southern Democrats had long {{acted as a}} voting block to resist or reject legislation to enforce constitutional rights in the South and {{made it difficult for}} proponents of civil rights to add strengthening amendments. After amendments in the Senate, H.R. 8601 was approved by the Senate on April 8, 1960 by a vote of 71-18.|$|R
5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E
5|$|Senators raised {{concerns}} that the Congress could either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal. Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, the Chairman of the <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, a long-time advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until {{he died of a}} heart attack on August 10, 1963. Senator Keating was defeated in the 1964 election, but Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska took up Keating's cause as a new member of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} {{was held up}} by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, {{the chairman of the}} <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee and a committed segregationist. Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed following the death of President Kennedy, and {{the beginning of a new}} congressional term. He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E
50|$|King was {{appointed}} {{to serve on the}} <b>Senate</b> Transportation, <b>Judiciary,</b> and Legislative Audit Committees for the 68th General Assembly.|$|R
50|$|While in law school, Vogt {{remained}} {{involved in}} Homeland and National Security matters.

5000|$|That same year, Saxon spoke {{before the}} Louisiana Constitutional Convention, where a motion {{was made to}} give women equal voting rights. The speech was {{published}} in the June 11, 1879 issue of the New Orleans Times. A moving orator, she also spoke before the U.S. <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee and traveled with women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony on a tour of New England. She quickly developed a national reputation as a poetic and impassioned speaker.|$|R
5|$|Sotomayor {{was thus}} {{nominated}} on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush {{to a seat}} on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker, Jr. <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee. Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee. D'Amato objected strongly; some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.|$|E
5|$|Ulrich {{provided}} {{a statement to}} the <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.|$|E
5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. and NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007.

He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855, Rodgers ran as the American Party ("Know Nothing") {{candidate}} for the Tennessee Senate seat representing Knox and Roane counties, and defeated Democrat and popular Knoxville businessman Joseph A. Mabry in the general election. [...] He served on the <b>senate's</b> <b>judiciary,</b> internal improvements, and public grounds committees. [...] During his term, he obtained funding for the Tennessee School for the Deaf and Dumb in Knoxville, and generally supported state funding for railroad construction.

5000|$|In early 1975, {{soon after}} {{becoming}} Charmian of the <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, Tunney asked the subcommittee staff {{to initiate a}} long-term comprehensive investigation of the technological aspects of surveillance. As noted in the Surveillance Technology Report of 1976 [...] "This investigation of surveillance was the first attempt to organize an immense amount of data in a comprehensive and usable format {{and to provide a}} framework for future analyses and, ultimately, for the creation of institutional mechanisms that will diminish the threats posted by surveillance technology." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Senate</b> Special <b>Judiciary</b> Committee {{serves to}} provide {{legislative}} assistance in all legal aspects of legislation for the Judiciary and Judiciary non-civil Committees {{as well as}} providing any facilitation necessary within the authorized areas.|$|R
5|$|Harlan's {{nomination}} came {{shortly after}} the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. James Eastland (the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary) and several other southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 {{by a vote of}} 71–11. He took seat on March 28, 1955. Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South. He was replaced on the Second Circuit by Joseph Edward Lumbard.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy and {{his wife}} Joan {{separated}} in 1977, although they still staged joint appearances at some public events. He held Health and Scientific Research Subcommittee hearings in March 1977 that led to public revelations of extensive scientific misconduct by contract research organizations, including Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories. Kennedy visited China on a goodwill mission in late December 1977, meeting with leader Deng Xiaoping and eventually gaining permission {{for a number of}} Mainland Chinese nationals to leave the country; in 1978, he also visited the Soviet Union and Brezhnev and dissidents there again. During the 1970s, Kennedy also showed interest in nuclear disarmament, and as part of his efforts in this field even visited Hiroshima in January 1978 and gave a public speech to that effect at Hiroshima University. He became chairman of the <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee in 1978, by which time he had amassed a wide-ranging Senate staff of a hundred.|$|E
5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E
5000|$|On December 19, 2013, seven GOP {{members of}} the United States <b>Senate's</b> House <b>Judiciary</b> Committee called on Attorney General Eric Holder to {{investigate}} Clapper, stating [...] "witnesses cannot be allowed to lie to Congress." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{specializes in}} {{politics}} and crisis management. He recently told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette that he began his foray in politics in 1960 {{at the age of}} 14 speaking on the stump for Louisiana State Senator Speedy O. Long (Long would later become a US Congressman from Louisiana). He followed this by being an advance man for John McKeithen's successful campaign for Louisiana Governor in 1964. Glascock worked as an intern in the governor's office during McKeithen's first term and in 1968 formed his own public relations firm. In 1972 he was appointed Clerk of the Louisiana State <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> B Committee and served in that capacity until 1976.|$|R
2500|$|Building on a 2002 {{tort reform}} bill passed by his predecessor, Barbour also {{introduced}} a new tort reform measure that {{has been described as}} one of the strictest in the nation. Barbour rarely made a speech during his gubernatorial campaign without mentioning this subject and was able to convert political support into law, overcoming the resistance of House Democratic leaders, who argued that further legislation would disenfranchise people with legitimate complaints against corporations. Barbour then embarked on a [...] "tort tour" [...] to encourage other states to follow Mississippi's lead. [...] "We've gone from being labeled as a judicial hellhole and the center of jackpot justice to a state that now has model legislation," [...] commented Charlie Ross, the chair of the Mississippi <b>Senate's</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee.|$|R
