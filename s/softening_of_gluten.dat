40|$|Background: The {{worldwide}} {{prevalence of}} ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) {{during the last}} few years is increasing. The association between diet free <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein and improvement of autistic behaviors is still under questions. Objective: To study the association between the consump 6 tion <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein and the score of Childhood Autistic Rating Scale (CARS) in children with ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder). The study also aimed at understanding mothers’ attitude toward the diet. Methods: This was a cross sectional study on 10 mothers of children suffering from ASD in a clinic in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A dietician measured the consumptions <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein with scored food frequency questionnaire while experts in the clinic measured CARS. In-depth interviews were performed to capture the mothers’ attitude toward the diet. Result: There was a decrease in the mean score <b>of</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein before and after diagnoses of ASD, mean difference of 156. 6 (125. 2; 187. 9), p< 0. 001).

Additionally, rapid determination <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> content and other physicochemical parameters including protein content, acidity, reducing sugar content and total reducing sugar content was performed. The classification performance of the sensor array was assessed by multivariate exploratory techniques. The physicochemical characterization <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> free and regular flours, including gluten content prediction, was obtained by artificial neural networks (ANN) modelling. The reference values <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> content in flour samples were determined by the ELISA method, while reference values of protein content, acidity, reducing sugar content and total reducing sugar content were determined by standard analytical methods. The application of the electronic tongue, combined with ANN, in the differentiation <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> free and regular flour samples resulted in 95. 2 % and 100 % correct classifications, respectively. The developed ANN models for the prediction <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> content in flour samples as well as protein content, acidity, reducing sugar content and total reducing sugar content, showed high potential of the electronic tongue as a simple and rapid technique for the prediction <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> content and other physicochemical parameters <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> free and regular flour samples.

Composite flour of whole grain oat flour, wheat flour, and tapioca starch in the ratio 1 : 1 : 0. 16 was formulated to make oat noodles with the addition <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> at various levels. The influence <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> on pasting and gelling properties of composite flour, and on cooking, textural, and sensory properties of salted oat noodles was evaluated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: PREVENTCD, Prevent Coeliac Disease, is an {{international}} project investigating the hypothesis of possible induction <b>of</b> tolerance to <b>gluten</b> in genetically predisposed children through introducing small quantities <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> {{during the period of}} breastfeeding. AIM: To summarise current knowledge on the possible relationship between early feeding practices and the risk of coeliac disease (CD). METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were searched in May 2011, and the search was updated in January 2012, and again in July 2012. RESULTS: Breastfeeding (BF) and CD: some studies show a protective effect of BF, while others show no effect. No studies have shown a long-term preventive effect. BF at the time <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> introduction and CD: Results from a meta-analysis of five observational case-control studies suggest that BF at gluten introduction is associated with a lower risk of CD compared with formula feeding. It is unclear whether BF provides a permanent protection or only delays the onset of CD. Timing <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> introduction: The data suggest that both early (≤ 4 months) and late (≥ 7 months) introduction <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> may increase the risk of CD. Amount <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> at weaning (and later) and CD: One incident case-referent study documented that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> in large amounts compared with small or medium amounts increased the risk of CD. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of clear evidence, in order to decrease the risk of later coeliac disease, it is reasonable to avoid both early (< 4 months) and late (≥ 7 months) introduction <b>of</b> <b>gluten,</b> and to introduce gluten while the infant is still being breastfed.

The Osborne protein fractions in the gluten fractions were determined.
