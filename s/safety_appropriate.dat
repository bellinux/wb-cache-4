40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{researchers}} have found that some adolescents are being bullied not only by traditional methods but also via electronic communication devices. This study provides an overview of student responses to a survey regarding cyberbullying, and explores the reasons students are often reluctant to report victimisation to adults. It includes both quantitative and qualitative data obtained from self-report surveys developed to measure the prevalence of cyberbullying, the media most frequently used for cyberbullying, the nature and content of offensive communications, the extent of reporting victimisation, and student views on preventing and reducing cyberbullying. A total of 154 students aged 13 to 18 years old from three schools in the Bay of Plenty participated in the study. The results provide some insights into the reasons that adolescents often do not tell an adult about being cyberbullied. The main reasons for not telling appear to be beliefs that peers can help more than an adult as well as a culture in which telling an adult may be considered "ratting". Student views on how schools can best deal with cyberbullying involved issues of confidentiality and <b>safety,</b> <b>appropriate</b> discipline, and ensuring school-wide awareness of anti-bullying procedures.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine changes in knowledge and attitudes of people with DD after participating in a 6 -week Socio-Sexual Education Program. Participants included 10 adults (5 males and 5 females) with mild to moderate DD who were assessed at the beginning and end of the program using four data tools including: (1) a questionnaire; (2) an interview; (3) observations and (4) personal documents. Analysis of questionnaire scores using a paired sample t -test was significant at the. 05 level. That is, participants' scores significantly improved from Time 1 to Time 2. This suggests that participants' knowledge in socio-sexuality improved by participating in the program.

The purpose {{of the project was}} to determine if the staff education program would increase knowledge of adverse drug events due to geriatric polypharmacy. The Orem theory provided the theoretical support for the project, and the Iowa model guided the evidence-based practice change process. Topics covered in the education program included medication <b>safety,</b> <b>appropriate</b> drug usage, medication interactions, and other use issues of commonly prescribed drugs for elderly patients.

While there is a plethora of literature available which has identified factors that contribute to nurses making errors, few studies have reported on factors that may contribute to errors made by nursing students. Design: A grounded theory approach. Methods: In-depth interviews with final year undergraduate nursing students (n= 28) to explore their experiences of administering medication. Constant comparative analysis was used to identify categories from the data. Results: The central category was identified as ‘Shifting levels of Supervision’. This describes the process of supervision students received when administering medication. Four levels were identified: ‘Being with’; ‘Being over’; ‘Being Near’ and ‘Being Absent’. The findings suggest that nursing students do not always receive the level of supervision that is legally required. Less than satisfactory levels of supervision were identified by participants as leading to medication errors or near misses. Conclusion: Apart from ‘Being with’, the levels of supervision described by participants have major implications for the safe administration of medication by nursing students and represent the actual or potential cause of error.

40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Canacomyrica (hitherto not studied) shows that it belongs in Myricaceae, {{although}} it differs from other genera in several respects (axial parenchyma grouped in bands or columns as well as diffuse; Heterogeneous Type I rays; more numerous bars per perforation plate). The latter two features are primitive for the family. The four genera (Canacomyrica. Comptonia, Morella, and Myrica s. s.) differ from each other not only by qualitative features but by quantitative features (feature means in genera mostly non- overl apping). Wood of Comptonia and Myri ca s. s. lacks chambered crystals in axial parenchyma and ray crystals. Wood of Myrica s. s. has tracheids in latewood but fiber-tracheids in earl ywood. Diagnostic generic summaries are presented. Features of Myricaceae such as scalarifom perforation plates, presence of (true) tracheids, ray types, chambered encapsulated crystals in axial parenchyma, and bark anatomy correspond with character states and expressions in Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Corylaceae, Juglandaceae (including Rhoipteleaceae), Ticodendraceae and, to a lesser extent, Fagaceae and Nothofagaceae. This grouping of families can be found as Fagales in recent DNA trees. The predominance of tracheids in basal Fagales such as Myricaceae and Ticodendraceae suggests that origin of vasicentric tracheids which occur in combination with libriform fibers in Fagaceae {{is the product of}} tracheid dimorphism. Low imperforate tracheid length to vessel element length ratios (FN ratios) in Myricaceae are a probable indication of wood primitiveness.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{research}} has explored using Datalog-based languages {{to express a}} distributed system {{as a set of}} logical invariants. Two properties of distributed systems proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system evolves with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which increases the complexity of the language and its interpretation, and forces programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from these previous languages is a notion of time. In this paper we present Dedalus, a foundation language for programming and reasoning about distributed systems. Dedalus reduces to a subset of Datalog with negation, aggregate functions, successor and choice, and adds an explicit notion of logical time to the language. We show that Dedalus provides a declarative foundation for the two signature features of distributed systems: mutable state, and asynchronous processing and communication. Given these two features, we address two important properties of programs in a domain-specific manner: a notion of <b>safety</b> <b>appropriate</b> to non-terminating computations, and stratified monotonic reasoning with negation over time. We also provide conservative syntactic checks for our temporal notions of safety and stratification. Our experience implementing full-featured systems in variants of Datalog suggests that Dedalus is well-suited to the specification of rich distributed services and protocols, and provides both cleaner semantics and richer tests of correctness...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} and analyze farmers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions regarding the adoption of selected sustainable agriculture practices specifically associated with weed control in Iowa. A secondary purpose was to identify the implications to agricultural extension education;The study revealed that farmers use a combination of various weed control methods including chemical control, cultivation, soil fertility management, crop rotation, and crop diversification. Farmers in this study indicated that they were supportive of educational program focused on sustainable agricultural practices. The challenge that faces extension educators is to design educational programs that fit the needs of farmers;Farmers lacked a clear understanding of what agricultural practices are thought to contribute to sustainability of natural resources. The extent to which farmers used soil fertility management and crop rotation indicated that these practices could be useful in controlling weeds;Demographic characteristics of the farmers in the study revealed that adoption of sustainable agriculture practices associated with weed control depends on the age of the farmer, the numbers of years in farming, the number of acres owned, the number of acres rented, the level of education and the level of income earned from farming;Farmers in the study participated in government programs, however, they did not consider government policy incentives as a part of the strategy for implementing sustainable agricultural practices. The study confirmed that farmers considered conservation tillage, long-term consideration for food <b>safety,</b> <b>appropriate</b> pricing of farm products, and the practice of weed scouting as important strategies for implementing sustainable agricultural practices.

40|$|Master of Regional and Community PlanningDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional & Community PlanningHyung Jin KimPlanning {{researchers}} and professionals have recently noted the social, economic, and cultural benefits food truck activity can provide within a community. As a result, {{the proliferation of}} food truck activity has challenged planners to reconsider the role of streets and urban spaces. Food trucks {{have the potential to}} enliven the urban landscape and enrich the quality of public life by serving as revitalization catalysts in urban spaces. While food trucks have become an increasingly visible aspect of street life, few jurisdictions have determined an effective manner to regulate and promote food truck activity. The study recommends how cities can improve current food truck policies in order to enable the revitalization of urban spaces through food truck activity. Using Kansas City, Missouri as a study area, the primary question was explored through three secondary inquires and their related methods. First, a GIS-based spatial analysis identified the spatio-temporal characteristics of food truck locations via social media data mining processes. Second, a survey of food truck vendors and interviews with city staff highlighted stakeholder conflicts that pose barriers to food truck activity. Third, a policy review in key cities {{and the development of a}} policy framework helped determine appropriate policy guidelines that allow food trucks to operate effectively in a city. The cumulative findings of the study informed food truck policy guidelines for Kansas City, Missouri. The policy framework also provides a structure for cities to utilize in order to analyze their own regulations. Sixteen significant policy areas are included in the framework, with the policy areas falling into one of three categories: permitting and enforcement, streets and spaces, or public health and <b>safety.</b> <b>Appropriate</b> policies that balance the needs of stakeholders allow food trucks to operate effectively, thus allowing cities to capitalize on the urban revitalization effects and other benefits that food truck activity provides within urban spaces...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{trailing}} vortices constitute both a kaleidoscope of instructive fluid dynamics phenomena and {{a challenge for}} the sustained development of safety and capacity of the air-transportation industry. The current manuscript gives an overview on the wake vortex issue which commences at its historical roots and concludes with {{the current status of}} knowledge regarding the nature and characteristics, and the modeling of aircraft wakes. The incentive of today's wake vortex research still rests on the empirically motivated separation standards between consecutive aircraft introduced in the 1970 s. These aircraft separations fix the capacity of congested airports in a rapidly growing aeronautical environment. Advanced solutions for dynamically adjusted weather-dependent aircraft separations hold significant economizations without compromising <b>safety.</b> <b>Appropriate</b> separation distances are also crucial for the success of the twin-deck A 380 airliner which will enter service in 2006. On the search for technical answers, applied wake vortex research must always consider its complex operational, political, and business environment and it must be aware of its serious responsability for passenger safety. The extensive introductory survey concludes with a delineation of scientific windows on wake vortex physics, connected chances and limitations, and a list of controversial issues that motivate the author's contributions to the field. The second part of the manuscript guides through these contributions which are detailed in eight integrated journal publications. Four of these papers treat the analysis of wake vortex evolution and decay in the stably stratified, sheared, turbulent, and convective atmospheric boundary layer and lead to a theoretical foundation for the physics of vortex decay. A subgrid-scale closure modification for large eddy simulation with strong streamline curvature is suggested and the accuracy of lidar measurements of wake vortices is assessed. Finally, the devised parametric real-time wake vortex prediction model is introduced. Validations against observation data from five different field deployments indicate that the probabilistic model has reached a high degree of maturity which suggests that the model may enter operational use in the near future. ...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScIt {{is widely}} {{believed}} that hydrogen will within a few tens of years become the means of storing and transporting energy. The reason is the depletion of hydrocarbons and the relatively facile production of hydrogen from various renewable sources of energy. Hydrogen can be combusted in an efficient way in a fuel cell with water as emission product. As concerns over air pollution and global warming increase, the incentive to switch to clean and efficient hydrogen economy becomes greater and the transition may occur well before hydrocarbon reserves are extinct. The overall goal of the project is to develop the knowledge base for solid-state hydrogen storage technology suitable for stationary and mobile applications. In order to accomplish this goal, the project will have a dual focus which includes the synthesis of novel nano-structured hydrogen storage materials and systems that can accurately analyze the materials. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop a novel composite hydrogen storage material with high wt% storage capacity, high intrinsic <b>safety,</b> <b>appropriate</b> thermodynamics, high mechanical strength, reversibility of the system and fast kinetics based on a well known “low temperature” intermetallic alloy (Ti/Fe) as the core. In the course of achieving this objective, the structural, thermal, chemisorptive and physisorptive attributes of this material on a nanoscale have been evaluated considering that nano-structuring is a potentially promising approach for controlling bond strength, kinetics, and sorption temperatures and pressures. By combining different materials with suitable catalytic and thermodynamic properties, a new class of hybrid hydrogen storage material has been developed. More importantly, the focus was to increase the capacity of hydrogen sorption in this material. This goal was achieved with the mechano-chemical pre-treatment of Ti/Fe alloy and surface modification with carbon nanotubes, binary palladium and magnesium metals via a layer-by-layer modification technique. The chemical and mechanical stability of hydrogen storage materials is of great importance because hydrogen storage materials must withstand repeated adsorption and desorption cycles. The layer by layer approach that was used in this project allowed the investigation of the chemical and mechanical stability of the materials as each layer was added. Through this layer by layer approach suitable nano-particles were introduced that are chemically and mechanically stable. The knowledge emanating from this investigation is expected to allow the directed design of new, higher-efficiency, recyclable hydride-based materials in pursuance of the 6. 0 wt% goal set forth by the US Department of Energy.
