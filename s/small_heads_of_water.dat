40|$|SUMMARY. Seepage may be {{prevented}} {{to some extent}} by employing proper methods of irrigation. Overirrigation may {{have a tendency to}} water-log the soil. A <b>small</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> properly used, will irrigate more land and do better work than a large head gone over the land hurriedly. The distance of irrigation ditches should be such that the water may travel between the ditches in about two hours. If land can be irrigated in the fall with the same care that crops are irrigated in the summer, there is an advantage to fall irrigation. If water cannot be properly cared for and this irrigation is uneven, it is a detriment rather than a benefit to the land. It is a disadvantage to ditch the potatoes as deep on the lighter soils as on the heavier soils. With the exception of the first crop it is best to irrigate alfalfa after the hay is cut. Irrigation of the stubble is more easily and more evenly done than the standing crop. The hay will cure more quickly on the dry soil than on previously irrigated soil. There is no material difference in the yields in sugar beets where the soil is plowed from 4 to 20 inches deep. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the soil is of a sandier nature. The plowing under of a second and third crop of alfalfa has not produced as large tonnage of sugar beets as the second and third crops that were plowed under...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{automate}} data collection with a compact infiltrometer under constant head conditions was developed. The infiltrometer {{consists of a}} containment ring with a <b>small</b> quasi-constant <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> (i. e., 2 – 3 mm) that is controlled by a Mariotte reservoir and a data acquisition system based on the open source microcontroller platform Arduino and a differential pressure transducer. The presented design can be easily reproduced and operated. The infiltrometer was tested in a citrus orchard on a sandy loam soil. A simple methodology was applied for accurate data acquisition from the initial stage {{of the process and}} to minimize the disturbance of the soil surface. A new approach to process the data was proposed for determining an accurate cumulative infiltration curve from transducer output. The BEST algorithm by Lassabatère et al. (2006) was applied to determine the hydraulic properties of the soil. A comparison between the automated procedure and the original BEST procedure was made. Automatic data collection increases measurement speed, permits measurement at shorter time intervals, improves measurement precision, and allows for more efficient data handling and analysis. The proposed electronic data acquisition system based on the open source Arduino board has proved to be accurate and reliable, constituting a very cost effective alternative to previous proposed equipment. The very limited cost could represent a step toward a cheaper and widespread application of accurate and automated infiltration rate measurement. This infiltrometer could be used for situations where a large number of readings need to be collected...|$|R

50|$|The {{enclosure}} protection {{types are}} defined {{according to the}} IP codes of EN 60529. The basic versions of most electric actuators are designed to the second highest enclosure protection IP 67. This means they are protected against the ingress <b>of</b> dust and <b>water</b> during immersion (30 min at a max. <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> 1 m). Most actuator manufacturers also supply devices to enclosure protection IP 68 which provides protection against submersion up to a max. <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> 6 m.|$|R
