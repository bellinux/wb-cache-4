40|$|The growing {{interest}} {{in the use of}} recyclable and biodegradable natural materials has become a relevant topic in pharmaceutics. In this work, we suggest the use and valorization of natural horny skeleton of marine sponges (Porifera, Dictyoceratida) as bio-based dressing for topical drug delivery. Biomaterial characterization focusing on morpho-functional traits, swelling behavior, fluid uptake performances, glycosaminoglycans content and composition and microbiological quality assessment was carried out to investigate the collagenic skeleton properties. After grinding and sieving processes, l-cysteine hydrochloride-loaded formulations were designed in form of powder or polymeric film by testing various drug concentrations and different drying parameters. Drug content, SEM analyses and in vitro permeation studies were performed to test the suitability of skeleton-based formulations. To this respect, drying time and temperature are key parameters for skeleton-mediated drug crystallization. Consequently, this behavior seems to influence drug loading and permeation profiles of formulations. The high percentages of drug are found after absorption into <b>sponge</b> <b>powder</b> and in vitro permeation studies demonstrate that cysteine is released more slowly than the pure drug within 1 h. Such a system is attractive because it combines the known healing properties of cysteine with the advantageous potentials of the collagen/proteoglycan network, which can act as biocompatible carrier able to absorb the excess of the wound exudate while releasing the drug. Furthermore, due to its glycosaminoglycans content, natural sponge skeletal scaffold might act as bioactive-biomimetic carrier regulating the wound healing processes...|$|E
40|$|A Fleischmann and Pons type {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} for approximately 3 months in a ten-cell electrochemical system. All the cells were connected in series, and electrolysis was performed in galvanostatic mode at a maximum current of 2. 5 A, corresponding on the average to 500 mA/cm 2. In this experiment, all cathodes were made of palladium, and the anodes were made of platinum. In nine cells out of ten, the cathodes were shaped into parallelepipeds (25 x 5 x 5 mm 3) by high-vacuum sintering according to a previously reported procedure. The starting material for all these electrodes was palladium <b>sponge</b> <b>powder.</b> The tenth cathode was made of 32 short 0. 5 -mm-diam palladium wires, gold welded together at one end. A similar concentration of screw dislocations was produced in each wire. Three different groups of sintered cathodes {{were used in the}} experiment, corresponding to three different sintering procedures. Nine cells contained 0. 2 M LiOD in D 2 O as electrolyte. The tenth cell, containing a sintered cathode, was in 0. 2 M LiOH in H 2 O. Measurements of neutrons, tritium in the solution and in the recombined gases, gamma rays, and electrode temperature were carried out. When the current density reached the highest values, a marked increase of the neutron detector count rate with respect to the background level (2 count/h) was observed. The emissions occurred in bursts. This behavior was observed for approximately 10 days but only when the current density was set at > 320 mA/cm 2. In the first part of that period, an excess of tritium with respect to the expected value calculated for the electrolytic enrichment was found in three cells out of nine (one of the cells was in light water). This excess was about twice the amount expected with respect to the enrichment and about four times the initial tritium content in the heavy water (267 decay/min. ml). The other cells, including the one in light water, did not show any excess tritium, the value of which was in good agreement with the calculated value.

This will however affect the performance of the furnace in the heating aspect. For this work, it is assumed that the effect will be negative. Thus the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how to compensate the loss of effect from the burners, by examining which other parameters have influence on the furnace heating performance of the <b>sponge</b> iron <b>powder</b> transported through the furnace. The investigation is executed by simulating a 1 meter of the furnace in COMSOL multiphysics for 10 min, not including the combustion chambers. The investigated parameters are the packing degree of the powder, surface emissivity of the muffle, process gas velocity, conveyor belt velocity and the heat transfer rate coefficient to muffle from the combustion chambers. Alas, the process gas velocity and conveyor belt velocity only have minor influence on the final result, according to this simulation. However, the simulation exhibited that the surface emissivity of the muffle and the packing degree of the powder has great impact on the heating of the powder and could compensate some of the lost effect from the burners. This could be obtained by using an unpolished and oxidized muffle surface, and use densely packed powder sample...|$|R

The specific {{task is to}} investigate the effect of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen contamination in the furnace atmosphere during sintering.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{towards the}} production of porous silicon nitride originates from the unique combination of light weight, of mechanical and physical properties typical of this class of ceramics that make them attractive for many engineering applications. Although pores are generally believed to deteriorate the mechanical properties of ceramics (the strength of porous ceramics decreases exponentially with an increase of porosity), the recent literature reports that porous silicon nitride can exhibit outstanding mechanical properties even at certain porosity levels, such as heat resistance and chemical resistance, damage tolerance, the thermal shock resistance and the strain tolerance. A study on silicon nitride characterized by high porosity content (more than 70 %) has been carried out, focusing on the comparison of different processing procedures to produce silicon nitride with tailored novel porous structures and a high porosity content.

40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) is {{a technology}} used to manufacture near net shape components for {{an increasing number}} of applications like automobile components, aircraft components, cutting tools, refractory, household appliances, etc. The general PM process comprises of Powder manufacturing/powder tailoring, Compacting, and Sintering. Based on product’s final requirements, optional secondary operations are performed. PM components for automotive application are experiencing a growth coupled with new challenges.   PM´s capability for producing complex net shaped components with desired properties has enabled it to be an alternative to other traditional manufacturing processes. Average U. S. made vehicle in 2010 contained an estimated 41. 6 pounds of PM parts and in Europe, the average per vehicle PM parts in 2010 is estimated 18. 5 pounds [3].   New design goals set by OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) demands for complex shaped components with high mechanical properties. Stupendous developments are done in the field of PM component manufacturing and PM raw material manufacturing, endeavoring to cater the technical and economic needs set by OEMs. Based on the application, unique powder characteristics are demanded which are in turn associated with the quality of powders produced.  Powder production for conventional PM application encompasses reduction or atomization followed by annealing. Reduced <b>powders</b> are called <b>sponge</b> iron <b>powders,</b> used for low density (density of PM component) application and atomized powders are used for relatively high density application. Atomization can be further classified into water atomization and gas atomization. Coarse, irregular shapes are the common features of water atomized powders and fine, spherical shapes are the common features of gas atomized powders. Water atomization is one of the prominent methods used in production of powders for conventional PM application. Oxygen content of the powders produced by water atomization {{plays an important role in}} determining it’s as sintered properties.

40|$|WHILE {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} antihypertensive drugs on rats, the Oppenheimers incidentally demonstrated the carcinogenicity of plastics. The exact method whereby polymers initiate neoplastic change remains obscure but appears related more to the physical form of the polymer than to its chemical composition (Oppenheimer et al., 1958). As a consequence of further investigation {{it has been found}} that plastic in the film form is more carcinogenic than {{in the form of a}} woven textile, <b>powders,</b> <b>sponges</b> or granules; moreover, the greater the surface area of the film the more active the polymer in sarcoma induction (Alexander and Horning, 1959). Bischoff has suggested that a similar form of " smooth-surface phenomenon " is essentially responsible for the carcinogenicity of cholesterol (Bischoff, 1963), which has been extensively investigated in a series of publications by Hieger (Hieger, 1959; Hieger and Orr, 1954). Thus while considering cholesterol carcinogenesis to be virtually a non-specific response, Bischoff regards several oxidation products of cholesterol to be carcinogens of a more specific type. Most notable among these compounds are 6, 3 -hydroperoxycholest- 4 -en- 3 -one, cholest- 4 -ene- 3, 6 -dione and 5 ac, 6 a-epoxycholestan- 3 /?-ol, which compounds share the features of an oxygen linkage of carbon- 6. Whether such steroid compounds produce neoplasms in a fashion similar to that of the unsaturated polycyclic hydrocarbons remains conjecture, but cholest- 5 -en- 3 -one can undergo substitution reactions similar to those exhibited by methylcholanthrene and benzopyrene (Fieser, 1954).

40|$|Environmental {{requirements}} for new pad and disc materials {{are becoming increasingly}} important due to the growing contribution of non-exhaust emissions to vehicle traffic pollution. Copper usage in brake pad formulations has recently become the subject of considerable debate, primarily due to the potentially toxic effects of copper and other heavy metals (including antimony) on human health and environment, specially in water quality. USA legislation {{requires the use of}} copper to be reduced to < 5 % by 2021 and to 0. 5 % by 2025. Although currently no specific regulation within the European Union imposes limitations on the use of copper, the main brake-producing companies are already manufacturing copper-free brake pads in response to the aforementioned USA legislation being the goal to achieve the same brake performance as the one provided by copper. This PhD work was conducted in collaboration with Pometon S. p. A., a metal powder manufacturer, and GAMA S. p. A., organic brake pad manufacturer. In light of copper being eliminated from the brake pads, this project intends to study the possibility of its replacement in low-steel brake pads using different metal powders produced by Pometon. Therefore, in a first approach copper was replaced by Sn <b>powder,</b> <b>sponge</b> Fe <b>powder</b> and Zn powder. Afterwards, Brakealloy powders were design and produced by a mixture of sponge Fe with a low fusion point metals, such as Sn, Zn or Bi. By means of diffusion bonding, the liquid metal enters the sponge Fe creating the Brakealloy powders. Finally, in a last step, the substitution of a 4 % of metal powder by Carbon Fibers (CF) and the addition of high thermal conductivity graphite was carried out. In the present work the study of the influence of copper substitution on the tribo-performance of the friction material is presented, as well as its effect on the formation of the transfer layer formed on the friction surfaces. This transfer layer will be the responsible for the good friction performance and less wear of the pads. Besides, the friction material has to be designed in a way that a constant friction coefficient and good wear resistance could be maintained over a wide range of stressing conditions (pressure, speed, temperature). In order to evaluate the tribological properties of the brake pads they were all tested on the single-ended inertia full-scale brake dynamometer using the SAE J 2522 procedure. This way, the performance properties, such as friction, wear and sensitivity of friction towards load, speed and temperature were studied as per industrial practice. Wear of pads and discs was determined by a thickness change of the material during the friction test. In parallel, the pads manufactured at CEIT were tested in a new tribo-tester, Pin-On-Disk type, which was designed and built as part of this project. On the other hand, the microstructure and the composition of the transfer layer formed during friction were characterized by preparing different cross-sections using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique and using EDS analyses afterwards. For one of the samples, the transfer layer was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) so that, its nanostructure morphology could be determined. The Glancing Incidence X-ray Diffraction technique (GIXRD) and SEM-EDS were also used to characterize the surfaces of the worn pads and disc. The first friction test results showed that the formulation with Zn powder had a good friction behavior, with a stable friction coefficient and less wear of the material, which was related to the presence of zinc oxide and zinc sulfide in the transfer layer acting like lubricants at high temperature. Concurrently, the presence of metal sulfides and intermetallic metal-Sb compounds indicate the high effect that the chemical reactions between constituents have {{in the formation of the}} transfer layer, especially Sb 2 S 3 and metal powders. Those reaction products were also found in the section of the brake pads. In latter tests, the replacement of Cu by Brakealloy powders was observed to provide a higher friction coefficient and less fade resistance than copper base formulation, except for Brakealloy ZC, with Zn and Cu. Moreover, these formulations showed a higher wear of friction material and disk. This behavior was related to a low reactivity of these Brakealloys to react with Sb 2 S 3 due to the intermetallic phases formed in the fabrication of the Brakealloy powders. This, at the same time, is the responsible for a lower metal oxides concentration in the transfer layer coming from the oxidation of the Brakealloy. The replacement of Sb 2 S 3 by a lubricant based on SnS was also carried out in the selected formulations with Zn and Brakealloy Z, creating a more eco-friendly brake pad. Friction materials with SnS showed a better friction behavior at high temperatures, with a higher fade resistance in formulation with Brakealloy Z. No intermetallic compounds were determined when SnS lubricant was used, being this lubricant less reactive with metal powders than Sb 2 S 3. In the last tests, the replacement of Cu powder with alternatives metal powders such as Zn or Brakealloy Z, and addition of Carbon Fibers was successfully achieved. The formulation M 5 Lub 2 FC showed similar friction behaviour to the copper content reference material M 1 *. Moreover, the replacement of Sb 2 S 3 by a solid lubricant based on tin sulfide was successfully carried out overcoming a new legislation concerning Sb compounds. For further study of the chemical reactions between solid lubricants (Sb 2 S 3 and SnS) and metal powders (Cu, Sn, Fe, Zn and Brakealloys) binary mixtures containing same weight ratio of these metal powders and solid lubricants that pads contained, were prepared. This study was carried out by thermal analysis techniques, DSC-TGA. Additionally the binary mixtures were also conducted to different thermal treatments (in air and argon), and characterized by XRD technique afterwards. In general the same reaction products were determined in the brake pads and in the binary mixtures. Finally, one of the formulations designed in this PhD was validated by GAMA for a commercial use, showing good friction behavior and good results in the noise test. El objetivo principal de la presente tesis ha sido el estudio de la sustitución del polvo de cobre en pastillas de freno orgánicas de formulación bajo-metálico para su uso en vehículos. De este modo, se ha querido fabricar una pastilla de freno más respetuosa con el medioambiente de acuerdo a las leyes estadounidenses, que exigen la reducción del cobre de estos materiales a una cantidad menor del 5 % en peso para el 2021 y a 0, 5 % en peso para el 2025. Este trabajo es el resultado de un proyecto de colaboración con GAMA S. p. A., productor de pastillas de freno, Pometon S. p. A., fabricante de polvo metálico y el CEIT. La empresa italiana Pometon, que actualmente fabrica polvo de cobre y bronce para distintas formulaciones de pastillas de freno, ha financiado el proyecto sobre el que se sustenta esta tesis. El material de fricción desarrollado en este trabajo debía cumplir con las exigencias de los consumidores en cuanto a comportamiento en fricción y desgaste se refiere, es decir, proporcionar un coeficiente de fricción estable en un amplio rango de presión, velocidad y temperatura, así como un bajo desgaste de la pastilla y del disco de freno. Estas propiedades, a su vez, están relacionadas con la presencia de una capa de transferencia en la interfaz entre la pastilla y el disco. Dicha capa se forma, en gran medida, debido a la compactación de partículas debris desprendidas durante el frenado y presenta una composición química y una microestructura distinta a la de las pastillas. Así mismo, la capa de transferencia será la responsable de proporcionar un buen comportamiento en fricción y desgaste del material. En el presente trabajo, se presenta el estudio de la sustitución del polvo de cobre por constituyentes alternativos fabricados por Pometon. De este modo, en una primera fase se emplearon polvos de Sn, Fe esponja y Zn. Posteriormente, se diseñaron los polvos Brakealloy, formados por una mezcla de Fe esponja y metales de bajo punto de fusión (Sn, Zn o Bi). Los polvos Brakealloy fueron fabricados a partir de la difusión en estado líquido del Fe esponja con los metales mencionados. Finalmente, en una última fase, se estudió la sustitución del 4 % del polvo metálico por Fibras de Carbono (FC) de elevada estabilidad térmica para las formulaciones con Zn y Brakealloy Z (Fe-Zn), así como la adición de un grafito especial de elevada conductividad térmica. El efecto de la sustitución del cobre en el comportamiento tribológico de la pastilla se ha estudiado empleando el dinamómetro de inercia de acuerdo al test AK-Master SAE J 2522. El desgaste, por su parte, se ha determinado midiendo el cambio de espesores de las pastillas y de los discos tras dicho ensayo. Por otro lado, se ha llevado a cabo una caracterización de la capa de transferencia en cada uno de los discos, relacionando los compuestos determinados en dicha capa con el comportamiento tribológico que presenta el material. Además, se realizó un diseño y puesta en marcha de un dispositivo de ensayos de fricción/desgaste, similar a un Pin-on-disk en el CEIT, pero que permite el ensayo de piezas de mayor superficie, así como el empleo de condiciones de presión y velocidad más exigentes. Para la caracterización de la capa de transferencia se han utilizado las técnicas de difracción con ángulo rasante (GIXRD), perfilómetro y caracterización microestrutural mediante Microscopio Electrónico de Barrido (SEM) y análisis EDS. Además, se han preparado secciones transversales de los discos de freno mediante Focused Ion Beam (FIB) para su posterior caracterización mediante FEG-SEM. Así mismo, para un disco en concreto se preparó una lámina delgada o foil con el objetivo de caracterizar la nanoestrutura de la capa mediante Microscopía Electrónica de Transmisión (TEM). Los primeros ensayos de fricción realizados en el dinamómetro determinaron que la pastilla con polvo de Zn presentaba un buen comportamiento en fricción y el bajo desgaste observado fue atribuido a la presencia de óxido de Zn y sulfuro de Zn en la capa de transferencia, ya que se conoce que actúan como lubricantes a elevadas temperaturas. La formación de sulfuros metálicos y compuestos intermetálicos Metal-Sb, determinó la importancia de las reacciones tribo-químicas que tienen lugar entre los constituyentes de la pastilla, en especial el lubricante Sb 2 S 3 y los polvos metálicos, afectando en gran medida en la formación de la capa de transferencia. Dichas reacciones se observaron también en las secciones de las pastillas de freno. Posteriormente, se observó que la sustitución del Cu por polvos Brakealloy proporcionaba en todo los casos un coeficiente de fricción mayor que la formulación base con Cu, y una menor resistencia al fade, excepto para el Brakealloy ZC con Zn y Cu. Por otro lado, en general, el desgaste de las pastillas y discos fue mayor al emplear polvos Brakealloy. Este comportamiento se ha asociado a la menor reactividad de los polvos Brakealloy con el lubricante Sb 2 S 3, ya que las fases intermetálicas que presentan estos polvos, creadas debido a la difusión de los metales en el Fe esponja, dificultan la reacción con el lubricante disminuyendo, por tanto, la concentración de óxidos metálicos de la capa de transferencia. Además, se estudió la sustitución del Sb 2 S 3 por un lubricante sólido basado en sulfuro de estaño con el fin de reducir el contenido en compuestos de Sb en la pastilla debido a su carácter tóxico. Dicha sustitución se llevó a cabo para las formulaciones con Brakealloy Z y polvo de Zn ultrafino. Los resultados obtenidos mostraron un mejor comportamiento a fricción, en especial a elevadas temperatura, al emplear el lubricante SnS, aumentando la resistencia al fade para la formulación Brakealloy Z y, obteniendo en ambos casos un comportamiento similar al de la formulación base con Cu. En este caso, se determinó una menor reactividad del lubricante SnS con los polvos metálicos, sin que se llegara a formar ningún compuesto intermetálico, al contrario de lo que se había observado anteriormente con el Sb 2 S 3. En una última fase, se sustituyó el 4 % de polvo metálico Zn y Brakealloy Z por FC consiguiendo un coeficiente de fricción menor y más estable. De este modo, la formulación M 5 Lub 2 FC diseñada presentó un comportamiento en fricción muy similar al material de referencia con cobre. Paralelamente, se prepararon mezclas binarias con los lubricantes sólidos (Sb 2 S 3 y SnS) y adición de polvos metálicos (Cu, Fe, Zn, Sn y Brakealloys) para estudiar con detalle la reacción entre los lubricantes y los polvos metálicos. Este estudio se realizó mediante las técnicas de DSC-TGA y por difracción de rayos-X tras someter las mezclas a distintos tratamientos térmicos en aire y argón. En general se determinó que los productos obtenidos mediante estos tratamientos fueron los mismos que se determinaron en la capa de transferencia, a pesar de que las reacciones no se produjeron bajo las mismas condiciones (presión y fricción). Finalmente, GAMA realizó la validación industrial de una de las formulaciones desarrolladas en esta tesis, obteniéndose un buen comportamiento en fricción, incluso superior al demostrado en los ensayos de laboratorio mediante una ligera modificación de la matriz orgánica, tras ajustarla a una formulación comercial suya. Así mismo, el resultado del test de ruido fue satisfactorio...|$|R
