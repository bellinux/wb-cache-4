50|$|For much of {{its history}} the Weald had been slowly <b>subsiding</b> <b>basin,</b> but {{the growth of the}} Alpine Chain to the south during the Cenozoic caused a {{reactivation}} of the Variscan basement basin-bounding faults, the rocks were arched into a broad anticline which stretched across the English Channel to Northern France, the Weald-Artois anticline. Inversion of the basin is closely correlated to compressional events within the Alps and occurred alongside deformation in Hampshire, Dorset and northern France. The basin was compressed between two 'blocks' of basement rocks, with the northward movement of the block against the London Platform; the areas of land that earlier in the Weald's history supplied the sediments. The Anticline has since been eroded down to reveal the pattern of stratigraphy with the oldest rocks in the centre of the anticline forming a low ridge which runs roughly from Crowborough to Battle and onto Boulogne.|$|E

40|$|A global {{overview}} of sediment patterns and accumulation rates, and carbon, stron-tium, and neodymium isotopes confirms that increasing rates of subsidence and up-lift accompanied the dramatic radiation of animal life through the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian interval (ca. 600 to 500 Ma). Peritidal carbonate platforms were drowned, {{to be followed}} in places by phosphorites and black shales, while thick evap-orites accumulated in interior basins. This drowning of cratons during the latest Neoproterozoic-Cambrian could have brought about major taphonomic changes. The shoreward spread of oxygen-depleted and nutrient-enriched waters favored the preservation of thin skeletons by secondary phosphate and chert in peritidal carbon-ates and, later, the occurrence of Burgess Shale–type preservation in deeper-water shales. The burial of event sands in rapidly <b>subsiding</b> <b>basins</b> also allowed the para-doxical preservation of deep-water Nereites ichnofacies in shallow-water sediments.

5000|$|A vast sea {{covered the}} region in early Pennsylvanian time. A basin in the area called Paradox Basin {{subsided}} and a mountain range called the Uncompahgre Mountains was uplifted to the east. Great quantities of seawater were trapped in the <b>subsiding</b> <b>basin</b> and water became increasingly saline in the hot and dry climate. Thousands of feet of evaporites (anhydrite and gypsum then halite) started to build up in the Mid Pennsylvanian and storms occasionally washed sediment from the nearby mountains. Fresh seawater periodically refilled the basin but {{was never able to}} flush out the very salty water there (the new water in fact floated on top of the brine). These beds were later lithified to become the Paradox Formation, which in turn is part of the Hermosa Group. Compressed salt beds from the Paradox started to flow plastically later in the Pennsylvanian and probably continued to move from then {{until the end of the}} Jurassic. Satellite-based measurements indicate that flow of salt and gypsum continues today to cause flexing and faulting of overlying sedimentary layers.|$|E

50|$|Geologists {{and other}} Earth {{scientists}} agree in general {{that the present}} Gulf of Mexico basin originated in Late Triassic time {{as the result of}} rifting within Pangea. The rifting was associated with zones of weakness within Pangea, including sutures where the Laurentia, South American, and African plates collided to create it. First, there was a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical thickness, 35 kilometers, of normal continental crust. It was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the <b>subsiding</b> <b>basin</b> created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the Gulf of Mexico. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of Louann Salt and associated anhydrite evaporites. Initially, during the Late Jurassic, continued rifting widened the Gulf of Mexico and progressed to the point that sea-floor spreading and formation of oceanic crust occurred. At this point, sufficient circulation with the Atlantic Ocean was established that the deposition of Louann Salt ceased.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} sediments associated with earthquake tremor recorded within the sediment succession in the eastern Kathmandu Valley, central Nepal, and to estimate the recurrence time period of large earthquakes. The intensity and recurrence period of paleoearthquakes are generally estimated from the study of geomorphic features such as terraces formed by the uplift and analyses of active faults in trenches (e.g. Nakata, 1989; Wesnousky et al., 1999; Malik and Mathew, 2005; Malik et al., 2010). These methods are not suitable for rapidly <b>subsiding</b> <b>basins,</b> because most geologic and geomorphic records left by earthquakes may have been subsequently buried by sediments or masked by inundations during rapid flooding of lake or sea water. Instead, the analyses of sedimentary successions, particularly soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDs), can be a strong tool for detecting the evidence of past earthquakes (e.g. Seilacher, 1969, 1984; Agnon et al., 2006; Simms, 2007; Rossetti et al., 2011) and estimating the recurrence time of major earthquakes (e.g. Sims, 1973, 1975). Turbidites and debrites have also been used to estimate earthquake recurrence periods in marine and lake basins (Kastens, 1984; Ikehara, 2000).|$|R

40|$|PDR and {{continuous}} seismic profiling surveys in the Sporadhes basin (the {{western part of}} the North Aegean sea trough) reveal active gravity-induced deformation of the postorogenic sedimentary sequence. Different deformational patterns in the uppermost sedimentary layers of the flanks and floor of the basin suggest that the layers are deformed by several gravity-induced processes including slumping, sliding and creep contemporaneous with sediment deposition. Antithetic faulting on the northern flank of the basin (the Thermaicos slope) results from downslope creep of surface layers over deeper tilted bedding planes. This process is a consequence of progressive slope development associated with the evolution of the Sporadhes basin. The morphology of the sea floor and the deformation of the upper layers clearly reflect synsedimentary tectonics in a <b>subsiding</b> <b>basin</b> environment...|$|E

Diagenetic processes in sandstones can be grouped as eodiagenetic, mesodiagenetic, and telodiagenetic. Eodiagenesis {{can be associated with}} Muschelkalk, Keuper, and probably early Jurassic times. Mesodiagenesis is probably related to Jurassic times. Diagenetic chemical reactions suggest a maximum burial less than 1. 5 km and low temperatures (< 120 ºC). Patterns of porosity reduction by compaction and cementation suggest four diagenetic stages: (1) Loss of primary porosity by early mechanical compaction; (2) early cementation (Kfeldspar and dolomite); (3) dissolution of cements; and (4) framework collapse by re-compaction. These stages are manifested by the presence of two types of sandstone. Type I sandstones present high intergranular volume (mean, 30...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Maastrichtian to Tertiary {{sedimentary}} rocks outcrop extensively around {{the periphery of}} the Oman Mountains. They form part of a geologically distinct suite of strata deposited after obduction of the Semail ophiolite and thrusting of the Hawasina and Sumeini mbricates onto the astern edge of the Arabian plate. The lithostratigraphy of Maastrichtian and early Tertiary rocks of the central and northern Oman Mountains is revised and a number of new formations are erected. The proto-Oman Mountains were emergent in the early Maastrichtian and were subject o subaerial erosion a d weathering. NW and W of the mountains, gradual subsidence followed during the Maastrichtian, allowing for formation of a transgressive, onlapping sequence represented by the Qahlah (fluviatile to shallow marine terrigenous clastics) and Simsima (shallow shelf carbonate) Formations.

40|$|Alluvial sediments are an {{integral}} and environmentally sensitive component of the geological record and may be preserved both in <b>subsiding</b> <b>basins</b> and by uplift. This paper examines the Holocene alluvial record of a high-order fluvial discontinuity within {{the mid to late}} Holocene that is evident on all continents except Antarctica. The time-transgressive nature of this discontinuity, even over short distances, is revealed by two similar small-catchments in the UK which have a similar response to arable cultivation but separated in time by approximately 3000 years. It is argued that this anthropogenic discontinuity is likely to be an enduring signal as it exists well outside potentially future-glaciated areas and will be preserved in Holocene river terraces due to recent and future channel incision. This will make a marked lithological and sedimentological difference between this Middle-Late Holocene terrace and Pleistocene terraces which will also include a biological turnover with the appearance of new taxa, largely domesticates and synanthropes. Discussions of the Anthropocene as a geological period will have to accommodate this data and this may have important implications for the status and demarcation of the Anthropocene as a period in Earth System history...|$|R
50|$|The {{transgression}} {{that began}} in the late Albian spread rapidly northward during the Cenomanian. In {{the northern part of the}} Aquitanian Basin, the Cenomanian sea reclaimed nearly the same areas that had been occupied by the Jurassic sea; in the east, however, it only reached the line Brive-Cahors-Agen-Muret-Carcassonne. The region of the later formed North Pyrenean Thrust is a decisive facies boundary at this time: to the north, shelf sedimentation continued but to the south rapidly <b>subsiding</b> <b>basins</b> developed into which flysch sediments (and partially also wildflysch breccias) from the Pyrenean realm were shed. Near Saint-Gaudens, the flysch sediments are even accompanied by volcanic rocks—trachytes, and ultrabasic lavas. The sedimentation in the flysch basins during the Turonian and during the Coniacian is very unsettled. The flysch sedimentation then continues right through the Upper Cretaceous, mainly interbedded sandstones and shales with some carbonaceous layers were laid down. Towards the end of the Upper Cretaceous, there are signs of the start of a regression and the sea then actually retreats before the K/T boundary. In the Subpyrenean Basin near the Petits Pyrénées, the sea lingers on till the lowermost Paleocene (Danian).|$|R

Detailed sequence stratigraphic analysis of the upper Jurassic to lower Cretaceous helps explain the mechanisms by which subtle stratigraphic traps may be created. Deformation in the fold and thrust belt took place from the Campanian to Pliocene, showing three distinct zones.

The islands of Santo and Malekula are probably formed from an uplifted mid-slope basement high while the interarc basin of this particular arc is probably a <b>subsiding</b> <b>basin</b> instead of a basin formed by backarc opening.

30|$|The {{available}} {{data show that}} the Arabian Platform {{was a part of}} the Gondwana super-continent during the Precambrian and early Paleozoic (Stöcklin 1968; Berberian and King 1981).

The Hercynian Orogeny in the late Paleozoic had caused the formation of the N-S trending horsts and grabens (Stöcklin 1968; Murris 1980). From the late Carboniferous to the early Permian, the northeastern margin of intra-continental rifting and seafloor spreading along the Zagros belt formed the new Tethys Ocean and led to the separation of the Iranian and Arabian plates (Alavi 1994; Glennie 2000; Sherkati and Letouzeh 2004; Sepehr and Cosgrove 2004). After entering the middle of the Cretaceous, with the Arabian plate drifting to the north, the plate moved from the passive continental margin into the active continental margin development stage (Alavi 2004) and experienced two periods of tectonic activity.|$|E
