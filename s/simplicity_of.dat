5|$|The series {{received}} generally positive reviews. Critics particularly praised Druckmann's {{writing and}} character development, {{as well as}} the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> Hicks' illustrations. The series was also a commercial success, with some issues requiring reprinting due to high demand.|$|E

40|$|According to Richard Swinburne, the {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> is <b>of</b> {{great importance to}} theory choice scenarios and theoretical changes in the sciences. In particular, he holds that the theory choice criterion of fit with background evidence {{can be reduced to}} the criteria <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> and <b>of</b> yielding the data. We will, however, rebut this reduction thesis and show that three central aspects of theoretical change (confirming power of empirical data, reliability of experimental methods, and truth of new theoretical proposals) cannot be adequately reconstructed if simplicity is regarded as a key criterion of theory choice...|$|R
5|$|Critics {{commented that}} the book seemed to be aimed at fans of The Simpsons rather than a more general audience. Other criticisms {{included}} the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the writing {{and a lack of}} interesting stories. In 2004, Cartwright adapted the book into a one-woman show, which she has performed in the UK and North America, including at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.|$|E
5|$|He {{notes the}} degree of {{artifice}} concealed behind the apparent <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the imagery as everyday moments are captured. A piece of driftwood is tossed and broken by the waves; people stroll along the promenade; a group of dogs gather by the water's edge whilst ducks strut across the frame. A pool of water is shot at night {{with the sounds of}} a storm, and frogs croaking break the stillness.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E

He {{has been compared to}} William Faulkner who also created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humour and compassion the energy of ordinary life. Narayan's short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because of his ability to compress a narrative. However he has also been criticised for the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> his prose.|$|E

5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her {{production}} team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's previous work, and portrays her dancing on a fire-escape and walking on a lonely street. Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace. Critics lauded the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the video, while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Madonna. Gaga has performed the song in award shows, music festivals and her concert tours.|$|E

She travels throughout the city and the Italian countryside, while picking up men from the roadside and having a party on the car. The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the video and labeled it as Madonna's most fun video in years. The song was included on the setlist of The MDNA Tour where she performed it while playing a guitar.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the scene.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E

40|$|Two {{issues are}} {{discussed}} in this paper. The first is whether a formal definition and justification <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> (parsimony) in scientific inference can be found, and whether an optimal level <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> is obtainable. A definition <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> is possible, as are the optimum conditions for the desired degree <b>of</b> <b>simplicity.</b> The model <b>of</b> inference used here relates Bayesian inference to algorithmic information theory. Simplicity is examined {{in the light of}} induction, the Duhem-Quine thesis, and bounded rationality. The second issue relates to the role that simplicity might play in econometric modeling. This is elucidated with some remarks on the 'general to specific' approach to modeling and discussions on the purpose of a model. Copyright 1995 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R

5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 2000s, Pei {{designed}} a variety of buildings, including the Suzhou Museum near his childhood home. He also designed the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar at the request of the Al-Thani Family. Although it was originally planned for the corniche road along Doha Bay, Pei convinced project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009, Ubisoft {{announced}} that it had signed a licensing agreement with ABC Studios to develop a video game based on Grey's Anatomy. Designed for the Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC, Grey's Anatomy: The Video Game was released on March 10, 2009. The game lets the player {{assume the role of}} one of the main characters, making decisions for the character's personal and professional life, and competing in a number of minigames. It has been criticized by reviewers because of the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the mini-games and voice actors who do not play the same characters on the series, with Jason Ocampo of IGN giving it a 6.0/10 overall rating. The Wii release received mixed reviews, and the Windows release received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E

Passages of colorful prose follow one another in such quick succession that the reader is first dazzled and then benumbed. The book seeks {{to deal with the}} fundamentals, the <b>simplicities</b> <b>of</b> life. A less decorative style would have served it better." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century the great Safavid king, Shah Abbas I settled {{a number of}} Zoroastrians {{in a suburb of}} his new capital, Isfahan. The suburb of Isfahan where the Zoroastrians lived was called Gabr-Mahal, Gabristan or Gabrabad, derived from the word Gabr. Europeans who visited his court left {{accounts}} of the 'Gabars' or 'Gabrs', (an insulting term used for Zoroastrians by the Muslims), agree on the poverty and <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> their lives. Fearing desecration by Muslims, Zoroastrians hid the sacred fires, and conversed in a newly invented dialect called Dari. Later Safavid kings were not as tolerant as Shah Abbas. Muhammad Baqir Majlisi persuaded Sultan Husayn (1688–1728 CE) to decree the forcible conversion of Zoroastrians, those who refused were killed.|$|E
5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, as it might be the product of animal sacrifice.|$|E
