50|$|As with <b>standard</b> public <b>transport</b> <b>bus</b> {{services}} in the UK, as of 2008 the responsibility for operation of the buses for park and ride schemes {{is dominated by the}} major transport groups, either in part or full, with FirstGroup involved with 12 locations, Arriva and Stagecoach Group involved in 7, Go-Ahead Group in 6. Despite this, operation by small groups or independent operators forms a significant aspect of UK park and ride operations, such as Johnsons Excelbus (Stratford upon Avon), Bennets Coaches (Cheltenham) and Smith and Sons (Perth). Some municipal bus companies operate their town's service, such as Edinburgh (Lothian Buses), Nottingham (Nottingham City Transport), Swindon (Thamesdown Transport), Reading (Reading Buses), although the November 2008 transfer of the Ipswich operation from Ipswich Buses to First Eastern Counties demonstrated that council owned bus companies are not necessarily given favourable status in the awarding of council park and ride contracts.|$|R
30|$|As a city {{characterized}} by significant informal settlements and relevant socio-economic disparities, Bogotá {{does not guarantee}} equal access to urban opportunities for all its inhabitants. The issues of urban everyday mobility are particularly critical in this sense. For the worst-off strata of the population, public transport is the only modal choice available for medium and long-distance trips (Bocarejo and Oviedo 2012). Moreover, before introducing the celebrated TransMilenio {{the quality of the}} public service was quite low, mainly because of the poor institutional arrangements that defined service routes and <b>standards.</b> <b>Transport</b> companies and <b>bus</b> owners were the de facto controllers of the public transport service and were in competition with each other, so that the offered service was slow (the presence of many lines caused congestion), unclear (there was no integration of fares or routes), and uncomfortable (to compete with each other, service providers kept fares low by saving on vehicle maintenance). To provide a solution to Bogotá’s mobility issues, national and municipal institutions proposed at different times the construction of a subway network, but the proposal is never implemented due to lack of funding (see Ardila-Gómez 2004 for a deep reconstruction of transit planning processes in Bogotá).|$|R
