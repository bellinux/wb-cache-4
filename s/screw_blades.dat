6000|$|To THE EDITOR: Only last week, while {{crossing}} the Equator (W. 26-15), I {{became aware of}} a furious and irregular cannonading some fifteen or twenty knots S. 4 E. Descending to the 500 ft. level, I found a party of Transylvanian tourists engaged in exploding scores of the largest pattern atmospheric bombs (A. B. C. standard) and, in the intervals of their pleasing labours, firing bow and stern smoke-ring swivels. This orgie--I can give it no other name--went on {{for at least two}} hours, and naturally produced violent electric derangements. My compasses, of course, were thrown out, my bow was struck twice, and I received two brisk shocks from the lower platform-rail. On remonstrating, I was told that these [...] "professors" [...] were engaged in scientific experiments. The extent of their [...] "scientific" [...] knowledge, may be judged {{by the fact that they}} expected to produce (I give their own words) [...] "a little blue sky" [...] if [...] "they went on long enough." [...] This in the heart of the Doldrums at 450 feet! I have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place (it can be found at the 4000 level for practically twelve months out of the year), but I submit, with all deference to the educational needs of Transylvania, that [...] "skylarking" [...] in the centre of a main-travelled road where, at the best of times, electricity literally drips off one's stanchions and <b>screw</b> <b>blades,</b> is unnecessary. When my friends had finished, the road was seared, and blown, and pitted with unequal pressure layers, spirals, vortices, and readjustments for at least an hour. I pitched badly twice in an upward rush--solely due to these diabolical throw-downs--that came near to wrecking my propeller. Equatorial work at low levels is trying enough in all conscience without the added terrors of scientific hooliganism in the Doldrums.|$|E

40|$|Screw {{conveyors}} {{are used}} extensively in food, plastics, mineral processing, agriculture and processing industries for elevating and/or transporting bulk materials over {{short to medium}} distances. Despite their apparent simplicity in design, the transportation action is very complex for design and constructors have tended to rely heavily on empirical performance data. Screw conveyor performance is affected by its operating conditions (such as: the rotational speed of the screw, the inclination of the screw conveyor, and its volumetric fill level). In this paper, horizontal, several single-pitch screw conveyors with some geometry variations in screw blade was investigated for mixing action during transport, using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The influence of geometry modifications {{on the performance of}} screw conveyor was examined, different screw designs were compared, and the effects of geometrical variations on mixing performances during transport were explored. During the transport, the particle tumbles down {{from the top of the}} helix to the next free surface and that segment of the path was used for auxiliary mixing action.

However, failure is often observed in osteoporotic patients whereby the lag screw effectively 'cuts out' through the weak bone. Novel anti-migration blades have been developed to be used in combination with a lag screw ('Blade Screw') to improve the fixation strength in osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures. An in-vitro biomechanical study and a retrospective clinical study were performed to evaluate lag screw migration when using the novel <b>Blade</b> <b>Screw</b> and a traditional threaded DHS. The biomechanical study showed both the <b>Blade</b> <b>Screw</b> and DHS displayed excessive migration (≥ 10 mm) before reaching 20, 000 loading cycles in mild osteoporotic bone, but overall migration of the <b>Blade</b> <b>Screw</b> was significantly less (p ≤ 0. 03).

40|$|Due {{to modern}} technology, <b>screw</b> <b>blades</b> are often {{manufactured}} by rolling {{them out of}} one single strip of steel. When simultaneously some blade inclination is applied, less residual stresses and/or larger possible ratios between outer and shaft diameter are claimed by some manufacturers, which seems plausible. However, it is sometimes also claimed that {{the efficiency of the}} conveyors is increased by such an inclined blade. The underlying idea is that the blade will cause extra pressure between the material to be conveyed and the tube of the conveyor. This in turn would delay the angular speed of the material, thus resulting in a steeper upward motion. In order to investigate this phenomenon, previous investigations based upon the conveyance of a single point mass have been modified for an inclined screw blade. It appeared that such a blade has no significant advantages over a normal one, which was confirmed by a series of tests. For completeness, tests were also carried out with a leading screw, resulting in worse results.

40|$|Although {{the screw}} conveyor, {{operating}} on a free surface, {{has been used for}} years as reclaim and storage equipment in mammoth silos, there is no documented knowledge about its spill characteristics. Research at Delft University of Technology together with ESI Eurosilo B. V. on the inclined use of the reclaim screw to achieve homogenization in mammoth silos made this lack of knowledge apparent. This paper presents the results of experiments to gain insight into the spill during reclaiming. Experiments were conducted reclaiming a horizontal surface and up- and downwards along an inclined surface, using a free-flowing bulk material. A relationship was found between the theoretical and effective fill ratio. This relationship shows a certain maximum effective fill ratio and a dependence on the reclaim-depth. As expected, the effective fill ratio drops quickly when reclaiming upwards, mostly due to flow- and throwback: the fill is spilled behind the <b>screw</b> <b>blades</b> and over the axis. Unexpectedly, the effective fill ratio also decreases when reclaiming downwards due to a shift of material towards the non-reclaiming side where it is left behind forming ridges on the surface. It is expected that all three mechanisms will cause less spill when reclaiming a cohesive material. The experiments provide the desired insight into spill mechanisms during reclaiming. Indeed, the inclined use of the reclaim screw to achieve homogenization is thought feasible when reclaiming downwards...|$|E
