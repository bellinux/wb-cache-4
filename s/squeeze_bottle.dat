5000|$|Following the <b>Squeeze</b> <b>Bottle</b> series Mason again reinvented his technique. Big Heads of {{the late}} 1980s achieve the rhythm of his {{previous}} <b>Squeeze</b> <b>Bottle</b> paintings with the raw, cartoon style of his drawings. Mason’s large human heads were filled with walking fish, bugs, flowers, and birds; his deserted entomology degree and world travels to New Guinea and Australia come to life in this series. Mason says of this work [...] "I find {{the interior of a}} human head, metaphysically speaking a fascinating subject." ...|$|E

5000|$|While Mason was {{spending}} such {{a significant amount}} of energy on drawing, he went to friend Robert Sperry’s pottery studio and was given a <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottle</b> to decorate a pot for his mother. [...] "We used this <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottle</b> thing…I liked it because it would go fast and would move with this energy... I gradually became more obsessed with it and more obsessed and then gradually covered the whole surface. So it changed from a drawing into a painting.

25|$|Japanese {{mayonnaise}} {{is typically}} made with {{apple cider vinegar}} or rice vinegar and {{a small amount of}} MSG, which gives it a different flavor from mayonnaise made from distilled vinegar. It is most often sold in soft plastic <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles.</b> Its texture is thicker than most Western commercial mayonnaise in part because only egg yolks and not the entire egg is used when making it.|$|R
50|$|Typically, as with wash {{bottles and}} {{commercial}} resealable containers for many viscous fluids including sauces and adhesives, {{it is the}} main body of the container that is squeezed. While atomizers fit the basic pattern of <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles,</b> they differ from those typical examples in that the squeezed component compresses and propels air, whose interaction with a volatile liquid inside a rigid container then entrains and dispenses a mist of the liquid.|$|R

40|$|Using {{representative}} {{members of}} each of three homologous series of chemicals-ketones, acetates and alcohols-we measured nasal pungency thresholds in anosmics via two stimulus-delivery systems. The first system consists of the fairly commonly used 270 ml, plastic 'squeeze bottles'. The second system consists of 1900 ml, glass vessels with Teflon tubing and nose-pieces. Although bulkier and more susceptible to mechanical breakage, the glass vessels possess advantages that can allow them to provide 'environmentally realistic' chemosensory thresholds, i. e. thresholds closer in absolute values to those that might be obtained under whole-body exposures. Such advantages include a larger volume of the vapor-source to accommodate whole sniffs, and a tight nose-nose-piece connection to avoid stimulus dilution. The outcome revealed that, for every chemical, the glass vessels provided nasal pungency thresholds significantly lower than those provided by the <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles.</b> The difference amounted, on average, to a factor of 4. 6, though the relative potency of the compounds remained the same under both systems. Additionally, when tested with the highest homologues used here, namely, octyl acetate and 1 -octanol, anosmics using the glass vessels {{had little or no}} difficulty achieving the criterion for threshold whereas they did have difficulty when using the <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles...</b>|$|R
50|$|Immediately after World War II, {{the company}} {{expanded}} into synthetic resin glues and, in 1947, the first multipurpose consumer white glue, known as Elmer’s Glue-All, was introduced. The glue was packaged {{in a glass}} bottle with a popsicle stick type wooden applicator attached with a rubber band. Consumer feedback confirmed a need for an easier to use delivery method, which prompted the company to develop easy to <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles</b> featuring a twistable orange cap, introduced in 1962. This innovation remains in use and is a trademark of Elmer's Products.|$|R
50|$|A mysterious sorcerer, {{seeing how}} desperate the two ducks are, shows up {{and tries to}} sell Scrooge a {{shrinking}} potion to use on Flintheart's pile of money, but Scrooge refuses, saying he'll win honestly or won't win at all. Flintheart is thinking about his mother, whose hopes he betrayed when he became dishonest, when the sorcerer shows up trying to sell him the potion. Flintheart agrees to buy five gallons of the potion for five gallons of coins. Flintheart then gets the potion in a sack made of crocodile skin, the only thing besides duck skin that the potion does not affect and is also given crocodile skin <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles</b> to handle the potion out of the sack.|$|R

Huey, Dewey and Louie use judo to stop Flinty and throw {{him back to his}} own pile. Glomgold then tried to throw the <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles</b> and break them on Scrooge's pile, but Huey, Dewey and Louie stopped them with homing rockets. Flintheart then decides to rent a cannon and shoot the sack of potion on Scrooge's pile. Scrooge then uses his scatter gun on the potion, causing it to leak on the cannon, shrinking it. The remaining potion hits Scrooge's top hat.|$|R
50|$|A <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottle</b> {{is a type}} of {{container}} such as {{a bottle}} for dispensing a fluid, that is powered by squeezing the container by exerting pressure with the user's hand. Its fundamental characteristic is that manual pressure applied to a resilient hollow body is harnessed to compress fluid within it and thereby expel the fluid through some form of nozzle.|$|E
50|$|Mason’s travels {{took him}} abroad to many {{different}} countries. Travels to South and Central America translated directly into his large <b>Squeeze</b> <b>Bottle</b> paintings of 1978-1980s. Stylized South American mola and brilliantly colored Huichol Indian yarn paintings from Mexicowere later reinterpreted in paint. Roaming {{the earth to}} mostly indigenous cultures let Mason see elements {{of the world to}} record later in paintings as an extended, personal, travel journal.|$|E
50|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} Mason started {{painting}} with squeeze bottles exclusively; {{it seemed he}} had finally {{found a way to}} combine his drawing with paintings, and the <b>Squeeze</b> <b>Bottle</b> series was born. Using a <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottle</b> and slightly diluted acrylic paint, Mason drew in raised lines and the overall feeling of each work became tapestries of acrylic paint. In some groups, Mason mixed gold, copper, and silver metallic into his colored paints producing canvasses that looked like they were woven together with metallic threads of color. At this time, his travels to Mexico and Central America influenced the iconography of his image with either patch worked blocks of design like a mola, or overall patterns like Mexican rugs. They also incorporated figures from his drawings, be it critters from the Skagit Valley or portraits of his immediate friends and family. After a trip to New York in the 1980s where he saw a large exhibition of Mark Rothko’s work, Mason’s color changed to become darker and more brooding for a short time.|$|E
50|$|Nitrous oxide system - A {{system in}} which the oxygen {{required}} for burning fuel stems from the decomposition of nitrous oxide (N2O) rather than air, which increases an engine's power output by allowing fuel to be burned at a higher-than-normal rate.

50|$|The {{restaurant}} {{is famous for}} attracting hungry patrons {{from all walks of}} life, from poverty-stricken, to working class, to the city's elites. At peak times, customers often find themselves standing in lines that can be ten deep as they wait for waitresses to prepare their meals at one of the serving stations at the restaurant's counter. Meals are served cafeteria-style on paper plates, and customers carry their food on trays to their tables. The egalitarian effect of the restaurant has been noted, as people from various economic strata bump elbows at the long communal tables and ask each other to pass the jars of Philippe's homemade mustard. In 2008 the Los Angeles Department of Public Health ordered the traditional mustard jars and spoons to be removed from the tables as unsanitary; after a brief controversy, the jars were replaced by plastic <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles,</b> and the mustard was restored to the tables.|$|R
50|$|After 5 years operation, in 2010 Putri Naga Komodo's (PNK) permit was compromised. PNK was a {{non-profit}} joint venture company partially {{funded by the}} TNC and the World Bank to operate tourist facilities {{in the hope of}} eventually making the park financially self-sustaining. After that, more illegal fishermen arrived as enforcement declined greatly following the exit of TNC, which had helped fight destructive fishing practices. In early 2012, dive operators and conservationists found many desolate coral sites, reminiscent of grey moonscapes. Illegal fishermen continue to blast sites with 'bombs' in a process known as blast fishing. The fisherman use a mixture of fertilizer and kerosene in beer bottles as explosives, or use <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottles</b> to squirt cyanide into the coral in order to stun and capture fish. In the past two years more than 60 illegal fishermen have been arrested. One of the suspects was shot and killed after he tried to evade capture by throwing fish bombs at the rangers.|$|R
50|$|Dessert sauce {{can be used}} to add {{visual art}} to desserts, by using the sauce to paint designs and imagery on them. A plastic <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottle</b> full of sauce {{can be used to}} aid in decoration.

50|$|Ah-So {{is a line}} of Asian {{sauces and}} {{marinades}} from Allied Old English, Inc., Port Reading, New Jersey. This garlicky, sweet, sticky, brightly red marinade is popular in the Northeast United States. A plastic <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottle</b> version exists. This sauce falls in into the American Chinese cuisine genre of Chinese cooking and aims to replicate the sweet smokey flavor of boneless spareribs found on the menus of most Chinese take-out restaurants. The sauce contains corn syrup, fermented soy beans and garlic.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 Lenthéric, Inc., {{experienced}} {{a decline in}} earnings due to higher wages, advertising expenses, and vast returns of merchandise from retail stores, which trimmed inventories. In 1951 the company hoped to increase sales by introducing {{a new line of}} makeup called Sheer Beauty. It sold for less than $5. The firm also reduced the price of Debo deodorant from $1.35 to $1.00. This was accomplished by making the product in a plastic <b>squeeze</b> <b>bottle</b> rather than a glass bottle with atomizer.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the causes of non-compliance by patients using eyedrops has been undertaken by questionnaire, ability tests, and by tests on eyedrop bottles. The results indicate a high prevalence of non-compliance, compounded by an inability adequately to instill a drop into the eye. About half the patients had difficulty aiming the drop, and other problems including <b>squeezing</b> the <b>bottle,</b> blinking, and seeing {{the tip of the}} bottle. Ability tests included a measurement of the grip strength of patients to complement measurement of the force required to expel a drop from a bottle. Some patients, particularly those with arthritis, could not generate enough force to <b>squeeze</b> a <b>bottle.</b> These same patients also had difficulty with the other movements required to administer drops. While some {{attempts have been made to}} produce devices to assist with eyedrops which can improve the aim of the patient, none give assistance in expelling a drop. An additional problem found was the reluctance of patients to admit to medical staff that they experienced any difficulty with their drops...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} reproducibility {{of water and}} ethanol drop volumes from plastic <b>squeeze</b> dropper <b>bottles,</b> examines the difference in drop volumes between commonly used liquid patch test solutions, and evaluates the volumes of water and ethanol needed to saturate Finn and IQ Chamber filter papers. 2 plastic <b>squeeze</b> dropper <b>bottles</b> recommended for use in patch testing have poor reproducibility compared to other bottles tested. 3 aqueous allergens tested (formaldehyde 1 %, methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone 0. 01 %, and dimethylol dihydroxyethyleneurea 4. 5 %) have drop volumes equivalent to water. Smaller drop volumes are produced by ethanol, hydrocortisone butyrate 1 % in ethanol, cocamidopropyl betaine 1 % aq., and propylene glycol 30 % aq. Filter paper saturation volumes using distilled water are 16 - 19 muL in standard Finn Chambers and 29 - 35 muL in IQ Chambers. Ethanol saturation volumes are slightly lower. Previously recommended volumes of application for aqueous allergens of 15 muL for standard Finn Chambers and 25 muL for IQ Chambers (slightly below the filter paper saturation points) are appropriate. Selection of dropper bottles should consider drop volume reproducibility, differing drop volumes for different allergens, and the patch test chamber system being used...|$|R
