40|$|Economic {{unification}} across Europe {{has been}} the main impetus for the European integration process and this rationale <b>stood</b> <b>also</b> <b>behind</b> the European Union (EU) approach towards its neighbourhood. Since {{the launch of the}} European Neighbourhood Policy (2004), the economic incentives have been the most effective instruments for generating structural change in the neighbourhood, taking into account the fact that EU membership has not been yet considered. Our research will aim at investigating the potential of the European Union to promote economic cooperation in its Eastern vicinity by seeking to include the Eastern Partnership states into a network that shares the same economic principles and values. Among these values, we argue that deep economic engagement through bilateral and multilateral frameworks of trade relations has played a major in enhancing the economic development of the six-Post Soviet states: Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia...|$|R

50|$|Conviction of {{the value}} of the film as art and the need for {{development}} “higher artistic film that would be adaptation of valuable literary works” led to the establishment of Filmový ústav. Filmový ústav was founded by Červenková and Brabec in the second half of 1919, after they left Slaviafilm. It is possible that it was caused also by change of Slaviafilm only to a distribution company. Filmový ústav was a family-character production company. Červenková built workshop, studio and laboratory in her family house in Vinohrady, in the backyard of the house were shot interiors of her movies. Červenková and Brabec did not have a commercial plan with their company, they only wanted to earn money for their next movies. Filmový ústav produced Červenková’s films: Babička (The Grandmother, 1921), Košile šťastného člověka (Happy Man Shirt, 1921), Ty petřínské stráně/ Bludička (The Slopes of Petřín, 1922) and Paličova dcéra (The Arsonist’s Daughter, 1923). The company <b>stood</b> <b>also</b> <b>behind</b> documentaries about national figures and cultural features, for example Havlíček, jeho život a literární význam (Havlíček, His Life and Significance in Literature) and Křest sv. Vladimíra (Baptism of St. Vladimír). Most of the documentaries were shot by Červenková. In Filmový ústav debuted also directors J.T. Shaw (Rytíř bledé růže/ Knight of Light Rose, 1921) and Václav Wasserman (Kam s ním?/ Where to with Him?, 1922).|$|R
5000|$|Two touch {{judges are}} used in a rugby league game. They move along each touch line {{following}} play.

There are two touch judges, one for each touch-line and each holding a different coloured flag.|$|R

50|$|Mark Emmert, NCAA {{president}} {{is opposed to}} paying college athletes because it would encourage universities to bribe athletes. Emmert believes that if student-athletes were paid to play, {{there would be more}} pressure on boosters and agents to bribe student-athletes to play for a certain university and to financially support them while they are playing at the university. Emmert stands by the ideals that student-athletes are students first, and he backs up this ideal by noting student-athletes' graduation rate across all demographics is greater than the non-athletes. Emmert <b>also</b> <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> the ideal that the money student-athletes receive through their scholarships is equal or greater than payments the proponents of pay-for-play advocate for.|$|R

50|$|The {{headquarters}} of the Parliamentarian forces, led by Sir William Brereton, were at the inn during the Civil War. The building was reinforced with earth walls against cannon fire. In 1664, the Lamb was the second-largest inn in Nantwich, after the Crown on the High Street; it had eight hearths. The site was licensed as a public house without interruption from 1693 until the 21st century. From 1691 until the 1850s it also served as the town's post office, and was also {{at one point the}} excise office. From 1737 until 1853, the town's fire engine house <b>also</b> <b>stood</b> immediately <b>behind</b> the inn, and the fire engine presumably made use of the Lamb's horses, with three stables on Church Lane recorded as belonging to the inn in 1794. In the 18th century, the Lamb was one of three inns on Hospital Street and 34 in the town.|$|R
5000|$|The bugchasing/giftgiving {{phenomenon}} gained {{press coverage}} and notoriety after Rolling Stone magazine printed {{an article in}} 2003 by a freelance journalist, Gregory Freeman, entitled [...] "Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+". [...] The article quoted San Francisco health services director Dr. Bob Cabaj as saying {{that as many as}} 25 percent of new HIV infections a year (about ten thousand people) were from men who had contracted it on purpose. [...] Cabaj disputed the quotes attributed to him, but Rolling Stone stands behind the story. [...] Dr. Marshall Forstein, the medical director of mental health and addiction services at Boston's Fenway Community Health, was reported to have said that the clinic regularly saw bug-chasers and warned that it was growing. [...] He called the statements [...] "entirely a fabrication," [...] but Rolling Stone <b>also</b> <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> them. Steven Weinstein, then editor of the New York Blade, an established gay newspaper, called the article [...] "less than truthful" [...] and attributed it to a Rolling Stone editor (whom he did not name) recently recruited from a competing [...] "lad mag" [...] who wished to make a sensation for himself.|$|R
40|$|The {{opportunity}} for a powerful donor country, such as the United States, to use a multilateral financial institution (MFI) strategically {{in order to promote}} its own foreign policy goals has received little attention. The gain to a donor that is able to make the World Bank or other MFIs adapt to this donor’s view on an issue can be substantial. In that case, all the contributions from the other member nations will <b>also</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the MFI’s stance on the particular is sue, and recipients may feel compelled to comply with this massive counterpart. As a result, influencing MFIs may give much more leverage to a donor’s foreign assistance in the foreign policy arena than pursuing the same goals bilaterally with the same amo unt of aid. We present a model where a donor tries to influence a MFI to put pressure on a recipient to comply with the foreign policy interests of the donor. This game-theoretic multi-agent model with one donor, two MFIs and one recipient illustrates the virtue of using the multilateral as an instrument in foreign policy as seen from the powerful donor’s point of view. Similarly, we show how this strategic behavior is damaging for the recipient in particular and for development in general...|$|R
5000|$|The report {{stated that}} on Saturday evening, 4 November 1995, the assassin, Yigal Amir, left {{his home in}} Herzliya and took the bus to Tel Aviv, where he waited in the parking area of the {{building}} where the rally Rabin was attending took place. He mostly leaned {{on the back of}} a gray GMC van, whose driver was in the vehicle, with the door opened, in a spot with a clear view of the stairs leading from the stage to the parking area, but <b>also</b> <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> a large potted plant. At 21:45, Rabin and Shimon Peres started for their cars. Peres passed the assassin, and then Rabin and his entourage walked towards his car. The Prime Minister's security detail comprised five men, most of whom remained unnamed in the commission's report. As Rabin passed the plant near which the assassin was standing, he fired three shots; two of which hit Rabin, and a third which hit the head of the security detail, Yoram Rubin. Immediately after the first shot was fired, a member of the security detail, and a number of special patrol unit officers jumped on the assassin. The report stated that yells of [...] "blank! blank!" [...] were heard, but their source could not be identified.|$|R
