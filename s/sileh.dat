25|$|The most {{important}} extension was {{a connection between}} Afula and Jerusalem. The first 17km section was completed {{at the beginning of}} 1913 and connected Afula with Jenin. Meissner's full plan never bore fruit however, because of the French government's extreme pressure on the Ottoman government to cancel the project, which would compete with the French-owned Jaffa–Jerusalem railway. In the end, only 40km were built from Afula, and terminated near the village Silat ad-Dhahr (<b>Sileh).</b> This extension was later used by Meissner during World War I to continue the railway to Tulkarm and from there via the Eastern Railway to Lydda, where it connected with the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway and railways to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.|$|E

The 100 mi stretch of the railway to Beersheba was opened on 17 October 1915. By May 1916 it had been extended on to Hafir El Auja then south across the Egyptian frontier, to almost reached the Wadi el Arish in December 1916 when the Battle of Magdhaba was fought. German engineers directed the construction of stone Ashlar bridges and culverts along this railway line built to move large numbers of troops long distances quickly and keep them supplied many miles from base.|$|E

5000|$|In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine {{described}} Silat ad-Dhahr as:"a good-sized and flourishing village, {{built on}} a hill slope, with many good stone houses. It is surrounded by fine groves of olives, and owns good lands in the plain. The principal water supply is from a good spring of clear water, {{which appears to be}} perennial. This comes out of the chalk rock on the slope of the hill by the main road above the village on the north-cast. It is called 'Ain <b>Sileh,</b> and is half-a-mile from the houses. The name of the sacred place opposite the village on the north is of special interest : Neby Lawin, signifying the Levite Prophet." ...|$|E
