25|$|In {{the top of}} {{the sixth}} inning, the Cubs {{extended}} their lead to 8-4 when Zobrist, now playing left field, walked and Russell doubled – the ball rolling to the left-field wall right past a sliding Jayson Werth, who lost it in the stadium's lights – to drive Zobrist in. In the bottom of the sixth, the Nationals began to battle back. After getting the first two outs, Chicago reliever Pedro <b>Strop</b> walked Jayson Werth. Mike Montgomery relieved <b>Strop</b> and promptly gave up a double to Bryce Harper that advanced Werth to third. Next, he walked Ryan Zimmerman on a wild pitch that allowed Werth to score – cutting Chicago′s lead to 8-5 – and advanced Harper to third. Daniel Murphy followed with a double that scored Harper and advanced Zimmerman to third. After the Cubs intentionally walked third baseman Anthony Rendon, Montgomery finally got Wieters to end the inning by flying out with the Cubs leading 8-6.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stropping</b> is {{traditionally}} associated with straight razors used for shaving, {{as these are}} the thinnest blades in everyday use, and therefore require frequent <b>stropping.</b> Kitchen knives may be straightened on a honing steel if less sharpness is acceptable. In principle, any blade may be <b>stropped</b> to polish it. Custom <b>strops</b> are made to hone irregularly-shaped tools, such as chisels or gouges, and nearly any piece of smooth leather or heavy fabric infused with abrasive compound {{may be used for}} <b>stropping.</b>|$|R

25|$|On Columbus Day, in {{the first}} postseason game at Wrigley Field since the 2016 World Series, Max Scherzer – {{returning}} from nursing a hamstring tweak he suffered in his final regular-season appearance – started for Washington, while José Quintana took the ball for Chicago {{in the first}} postseason start of his career. Both starters pitched masterful games. Quintana shut out the Nats through 5⅔ innings, allowing only two hits, singles to left fielder Jayson Werth {{in the second inning}} and to center fielder Michael A. Taylor in the third, an inning in which Taylor reached third on throwing errors by Quintana and third baseman Ben Zobrist but did not score. Quintana benefited from better Cubs defense {{in the top of the}} fourth inning, when Werth walked and Nationals catcher Matt Wieters followed with a deep fly ball that center fielder Jon Jay grabbed with a spectacular running catch that probably saved a run. With two outs in the sixth, however, second basemen Daniel Murphy hit a fly ball into the left field corner that Cubs left fielder Kyle Schwarber mishandled, committing two errors that allowed Murphy to reach third base. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Pedro <b>Strop</b> to relieve Quintana – who left having struck out seven Nats and walked only one – but <b>Strop</b> promptly surrendered a double to first baseman Ryan Zimmerman that brought Murphy home and gave the Nationals a 1–0 lead.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2013, Feldman and Steve Clevenger were {{traded to}} the Baltimore Orioles for {{pitchers}} Jake Arrieta and Pedro <b>Strop.</b> [...] There, Feldman reunited with his first big league manager, Buck Showalter. His first start was on July 3, 2013, against the Chicago White Sox, a game the Orioles won 4–2 although Feldman {{did not get the}} decision. Feldman had his best start as an Oriole August 18, and was borderline dominant the entire outing. Through his first six innings, Feldman had allowed just two hits, while not allowing a single run to score. The Orioles took the victory 7–2 against the Rockies. He improved upon that outing by tossing the first complete game shutout of his career on September 6, holding the White Sox to 5 hits.|$|E
50|$|For example, a {{straight}} razor used for shaving is <b>stropped</b> before each use, {{and may be}} <b>stropped</b> part-way through use, while it will be fine sharpened on a stone a few times per year, and re-ground on a rough stone after several years.|$|R

[...] Lance Fiasco from idobi Radio shared that [...] "Take Me Away" [...] and Lavigne's previous single, [...] "Losing Grip", are the harder-edged hair-messers that really showed her grrl badge, demonstrating the once-poisonous sting of Alanis.

2500|$|Polishing and buffing are {{finishing}} {{processes for}} smoothing a workpiece's surface using an abrasive and a work wheel or a leather [...] <b>strop.</b> Technically polishing refers to processes that use an abrasive that is {{glued to the}} work wheel, while buffing uses a loose abrasive applied to the work wheel. Polishing is a more aggressive process while buffing is less harsh, {{which leads to a}} smoother, brighter finish. A common misconception is that a polished surface has a mirror bright finish, however most mirror bright finishes are actually buffed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{relief of}} González, Matt Albers, Sammy Solis, and Ryan Madson kept the Cubs from adding to their {{lead in the}} sixth, seventh, and eighth innings, giving up only a single and a walk and {{striking}} out a Cub, but against Lester, who pitched through the sixth inning and whose two-hit performance was the best postseason outing of his career, and Pedro <b>Strop,</b> who pitched the seventh for Chicago, the Nats managed only one base runner, when <b>Strop</b> hit catcher Matt Wieters with a pitch, the second time Wieters {{had been hit by}} a pitch in the series. Wieters did not advance beyond first. By the time the Nationals came to bat {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inning, they had accumulated only one run and four hits in the first 16 innings of the series, hitting 4-for-52 (.077). Losing 3-1 and with opportunities running out, they faced the prospect of traveling to Chicago for Game 3 down 2-0 in the best-of-five series with a badly slumping offense and needing to win three straight games, two of them on the road, to avoid elimination in the first round of the postseason for the fourth time in six years. After the game, Baker told the press that as the bottom of the eighth began, he was [...] "kind of bewildered" [...] by his team's offensive silence, adding [...] "I just knew in the bottom of my heart that we were going to explode for some numbers, which we've done all year." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 6–1 {{victory over}} the visiting Chicago Cubs, {{defending}} World Series champions, on June 27, the Nationals tied a franchise record for stolen bases in a game with seven, all off the battery of pitcher Jake Arrieta and catcher Miguel Montero. Four of those steals were notched by shortstop Trea Turner, who stole seven bases in the four-game series against the Cubs at Nationals Park before leaving the rubber game on June 29 after being hit in the right wrist by a fastball from reliever Pedro <b>Strop.</b> The team announced after the game, a seesaw 5–4 loss, that Turner had suffered a non-displaced fracture in his wrist, an injury for which the team offered no recovery timetable but which Turner compared to a similar wrist fracture weeks {{earlier in the season}} that had sidelined Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman for an anticipated two months. Turner was placed on the 10-day disabled list and the Nationals selected the contract of infielder Adrián Sánchez from Class-AAA Syracuse to replace him on the roster, moving rehabbing left-handed reliever Sammy Solis to the 60-day disabled list in the process. The injury announcement came just a day after Glover, placed on the disabled list earlier in the month with back stiffness, told reporters he had been experiencing right shoulder pain since late May and was continuing to deal with severe rotator cuff inflammation after initially trying to pitch through the issue. He blamed the back injury, which he said involved a displaced vertebra after he slipped while showering, on [...] "overcompensation" [...] due to the shoulder pain. The Nationals also lost first base coach Davey Lopes during the Cubs series, as he was granted leave from the team due to a family emergency. Outfield and baserunning coordinator Gary Thurman took over Lopes' role in his absence.|$|E

5000|$|In {{computer}} language design, <b>stropping</b> {{is a method}} of explicitly marking letter sequences as having a special property, such as being a keyword, or {{a certain type of}} variable or storage location, and thus inhabiting a different namespace from ordinary names ("identifiers"), in order to avoid clashes. <b>Stropping</b> is not used in most modern languages - instead, keywords are reserved words and cannot be used as identifiers. <b>Stropping</b> allows the same letter sequence to be used both as a keyword and as an identifier, and simplifies parsing in that case - for example allowing a variable named [...] without clashing with the keyword if.|$|R
25|$|All {{implementations}} must recognise {{at least}} POINT, UPPER and RES inside PRAGMAT sections.
