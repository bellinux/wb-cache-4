No subfossil evidence has been found to definitively show that lemurs were its prey; this assumption is based on the diet of the smaller, extant species of fossa. Other possible prey include tenrecs, smaller euplerids, and even young Malagasy hippopotamuses. Its extinction may have changed predation dynamics on Madagascar or because of human hunting. While not known, it is possible that C. spelea went extinct before 1400.|$|E

Ultimately, Bonaime professed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor; [...] "'Space Race, Part II' doesn’t have <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> laughs that the first part featured. By that, I mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana’s puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for {{each member of the}} cast." [...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. [...] "Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'.
