5|$|The {{long-term}} effects of benzodiazepine use can include cognitive impairment as well as affective and behavioural problems. Feelings of turmoil, difficulty in thinking constructively, loss of sex-drive, agoraphobia and <b>social</b> <b>phobia,</b> increasing anxiety and depression, loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests, and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use. Additionally, an altered perception of self, environment and relationships may occur.|$|E
5|$|There are few data on comorbid {{conditions}}, {{but there}} are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD. Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to <b>social</b> <b>phobia,</b> panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} high {{prevalence}} of social anxiety in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. In a recent study, <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> was diagnosed in 50% of Parkinson's disease patients.

25|$|Research {{into the}} causes of social anxiety and <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> is wide-ranging, {{encompassing}} multiple perspectives from neuroscience to sociology. Scientists have yet to pinpoint the exact causes. Studies suggest that genetics can {{play a part in}} combination with environmental factors. <b>Social</b> <b>phobia</b> is not caused by other mental disorders or by substance abuse.|$|E
50|$|A Swedish {{study found}} that females have a higher {{incidence}} than males (26.5 percent for females and 12.4 percent for males). Among adults, 21.2 percent of women and 10.9 percent of men have a single specific phobia, while multiple phobias occur in 5.4 percent of females and 1.5 percent of males. Women are nearly four times as likely as men to have a fear of animals (12.1 percent in women and 3.3 percent in men) — a higher dimorphic than with all specific or generalized <b>phobias</b> or <b>social</b> <b>phobias.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>phobias</b> are more common in girls than in boys, while situational phobia occurs in 17.4 percent of women and 8.5 percent of men.|$|R

5000|$|Phobias {{have a long}} history. The {{concept of}} <b>social</b> <b>phobias</b> was {{referred}} to as long ago as 400 B.C.

25|$|The mean {{onset of}} <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> is 10 to 13 years. Onset after age 25 is rare and is {{typically}} preceded by panic disorder or major depression. Social anxiety disorder occurs {{more often in}} females than males. The prevalence of <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> appears to be increasing among white, married, and well-educated individuals. As a group, those with generalized <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> {{are less likely to}} graduate from high school and are more likely to rely on government financial assistance or have poverty-level salaries. Surveys carried out in 2002 show the youth of England, Scotland, and Wales have a prevalence rate of 0.4 percent, 1.8 percent, and 0.6 percent, respectively. In Canada, the prevalence of self-reported social anxiety for Nova Scotians older than 14 years was 4.2 percent in June 2004 with women (4.6 percent) reporting more than men (3.8 percent). In Australia, <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> is the 8th and 5th leading disease or illness for males and females between 15–24 years of age as of 2003. Because of the difficulty in separating <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> from poor social skills or shyness, some studies have a large range of prevalence. The table also shows higher prevalence in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|While alcohol {{initially}} relieves <b>social</b> <b>phobia,</b> excessive {{alcohol misuse}} can worsen <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> symptoms {{and can cause}} panic disorder to develop or worsen during alcohol intoxication and especially during alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect {{is not unique to}} alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines which are sometimes prescribed as tranquillisers.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{its close}} {{relationship}} and overlapping symptoms, treating people with <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> {{may help to}} understand the underlying connections to other mental disorders. Social anxiety disorder is often linked to bipolar disorder and {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and some believe that they share an underlying cyclothymic-anxious-sensitive disposition. The co-occurrence of ADHD and <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> is very high; especially when SCT symptoms are present.|$|E

In schools, service dogs may help with performing tasks, or trained for individuals with <b>social</b> <b>phobias.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Amisulpride‡- Selective {{dopamine}} antagonist. Higher doses (greater than 400 mg) {{act upon}} post-synaptic dopamine receptors {{resulting in a}} reduction in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as psychosis. Lower doses, however, act upon dopamine autoreceptors, resulting in increased dopamine transmission, improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower doses of amisulpride have also been shown to have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in non-schizophrenic patients, leading to its use in dysthymia and <b>social</b> <b>phobias.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{specific}} phobia is a marked and persistent fear {{of an object}} or situation which brings about an excessive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of, or anticipating, a specific object; the {{specific phobia}}s may also include concerns with losing control, panicking, and fainting which is {{the direct result of}} an encounter with the phobia. Specific phobias are defined in relation to objects or situations whereas <b>social</b> <b>phobias</b> emphasize <b>social</b> fear and the evaluations that might accompany them.|$|R

25|$|While alcohol {{initially}} helps <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> or panic symptoms, {{with longer}} term alcohol misuse can often worsen <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> symptoms {{and can cause}} panic disorder to develop or worsen, during alcohol intoxication and especially during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect {{is not unique to}} alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines, which are sometimes prescribed as tranquillizers to people with alcohol problems. Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> suffer from alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Although the SIAS is used {{widely in}} {{clinical}} psychology, {{it is not}} without its limitations. Because the scale is self report subjects are able to falsify responses in order to be socially desirable. In addition, most items of the scale are scored in the same direction, allowing room for response bias. It is also difficult to discriminate between the fears of someone who experiences social anxiety and the more general worries of a patient with generalized anxiety disorder, as patients who suffer from both disorders score higher on the SIAS than those with just <b>social</b> <b>phobias.</b>|$|R
25|$|ICD-10 defines <b>social</b> <b>phobia</b> as {{a fear of}} {{scrutiny}} by other people leading to avoidance of social situations. The anxiety symptoms may present as a complaint of blushing, hand tremor, nausea or urgency of micturition. Symptoms may progress to panic attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry states, [...] "Persons with <b>social</b> <b>phobias</b> (also called <b>social</b> anxiety disorder) have {{excessive}} {{fears of}} humiliation or embarrassment in various social settings, {{such as in}} speaking in public, urinating in a public rest room (also called shy bladder), and speaking to a date." [...] The Synopsis describes shy bladder as [...] "inability to void in a public bathroom" [...] and notes that relaxation exercises are an application of behavior therapy for dealing with this disorder. Some paruretics experience delayed urination and must wait for their need to void to overcome their anxiety, while others are unable to urinate at all.|$|R
40|$|Synthelabo is {{developing}} befloxatone, a long-acting selective and reversible monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor, {{for the treatment}} of depression, <b>social</b> <b>phobias</b> and panic disorders. Phase III trials have commenced in France for depression. In 1995, phase II trials began in Europe and the US {{for the treatment of}} depression, <b>social</b> <b>phobias</b> and panic disorders. The results of a dose-ranging study conducted in Europe in patients with major depressive disorders confirmed the product's safety. Befloxatone has a good safety profile, lacking sedative, convulsant, anticholinergic and cardiovascular effects [...] particularly important is its negligible tyramine effect. Results from phase I trials suggest that it will be suitable for once-daily oral dosage. It has an elimination half-life of approximately 11 h in man and is rapidly absorbed with a Tmax of around 2. 5 h. In a trial of befloxatone in 12 healthy elderly volunteers, an oral dose of 10 mg was administered and psychomotor and cognitive function were assessed using objective tests such as critical flicker fusion (CFF), body sway and learning memory tasks amongst others and subjective tests such as the visual analog scale and a sleep questionnaire. Using these criteria, the 10 mg dose of befloxatone was shown not to produce any detrimental effects in skilled performance while a significant improvement in long term memory was shown. It appears to have no significant effects on skilled performance, memory or sleep patterns.
