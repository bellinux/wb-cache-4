King's College London School of Medicine has over 2,000 undergraduate students, over 1,400 teachers, four main teaching hospitals – Guy's Hospital, King's College Hospital, St Thomas' Hospital and University Hospital Lewisham – and 17 associated district general hospitals.

40|$|Marketing {{has become}} a staple {{expression}} to distinguish unique and preferable features of {{a great variety of}} products in society. Since the 1980 s this has included tertiary education. Marketing has secured overseas revenue as a signifi cant funding source for the tertiary education sector and the Australian economy. Nursing, as a player in the tertiary education arena, is also engaged in marketing. Marketing was not unknown to Nursing. Prior to education’s move to the tertiary sector, individual <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> would engage in a range of marketing techniques to distinguish themselves. Hospitals found it was critical for the success of recruitment that their education and training programmes were differentiated favourably from those of competitors. Current marketing strategies for <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nursing</b> include the use of web-based profi les. A review of the features of the websites <b>of</b> the Australian <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nursing</b> was undertaken in early 2011. Thirty–eight (38) <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nursing</b> were recognised through the membership of the Council <b>of</b> Deans <b>of</b> <b>Nursing</b> 2 ̆ 6 Midwifery of Australia and New Zealand. All had publically accessible web-sites that performed dual roles of marketing to potential students and servicing existing students. The marketing position of these websites was examined from two perspectives – that of the profi le of high fi delity human patient simulation and the profi le <b>of</b> mental health <b>nursing.</b> The focus was to contrast these two aspects <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>nursing</b> preparation in public portrayal. Were Australian <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nursing</b> seeking to distinguish themselves as a preferable choice to future students by highlighting these features of their curriculum? Were they combining high fi delity human patient simulation with mental health teaching and learning? This paper will present the fi ndings and suggests that mental health nursing might not be ‘swimming between the fl ags’ of marketing approaches favoured by Australian <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nursing...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the {{founding}} of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education. The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nursing</b> in 1903. Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the university in 1927. The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to prepare students for leadership in diplomacy and foreign commerce. The School of Dentistry became independent of the School of Medicine in 1956. The School of Business was separated from the SFS in 1957. In 1998 it was renamed the McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University offers {{undergraduate}} {{degrees in}} forty-eight majors {{in the four}} undergraduate schools, {{as well as the}} opportunity for students to design their courses of study.

Students in the School of Foreign Service can complete select certificates which complement the school's focus on foreign affairs and attain a minor in one of twelve languages but {{do not have access to}} the same minor selection as the other three schools. All courses are on a credit hour system. Georgetown offers many opportunities to study abroad, and about 50% of the undergraduate student body spends time at an institution overseas.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nursing</b> historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
