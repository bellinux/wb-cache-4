50|$|Another {{phenomenon}} of speedruns exists, called segmented speedruns. These differ from <b>single-segment</b> speedruns in that unlike <b>single-segment</b> speedruns, which are played and recorded entirely in one sitting, segmented speedruns are speedruns that are attempted in several non-consecutive pieces or segments from various save points. The advantage of segmented speedruns {{is that one}} can attempt a segment multiple times until it is perfected completely, and group the best segments into the final result. This also allows for one to use dangerous or unreliable tricks that may be otherwise crippling in a single-segmented speedrun. Because of this, segmented speedruns are ranked separately from single-segmented ones. Some segmented speedruns can beat single segment runs quite easily as different routing {{may need to be}} done in single segment runs in order to prevent a game from crashing or causing objects on the screen to disappear.|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} developed a computational approach in a vector space for genome-based virus classification. This approach, called the "Natural Vector (NV) representation", {{which is an}} alignment-free method, allows us to classify <b>single-segmented</b> viruses with high speed and accuracy. For multiple-segmented viruses, typically phylogenetic trees of each segment are reconstructed for discovering viral phylogeny. Consensus tree methods {{may be used to}} combine the phylogenetic trees based on different segments. However, consensus tree methods were not developed for instances where the viruses have different numbers of segments or where their segments do not match well. We propose a novel approach for comparing multiple-segmented viruses globally, even in cases where viruses contain different numbers of segments. Using our method, each virus is represented by a set of vectors in R- 12. The Hausdorff distance is then used to compare different sets of vectors. Phylogenetic trees can be reconstructed based on this distance. The proposed method is used for predicting classification labels of viruses with n-segments (n >= 1). The correctness rates of our predictions based on cross-validation are as high as 96. 5 %, 95. 4 %, 99. 7 %, and 95. 6 % for Baltimore class, family, subfamily, and genus, respectively, which are comparable to the rates for <b>single-segmented</b> viruses only. Our method is not affected by the number or order of segments. We also demonstrate that the natural graphical representation based on the Hausdorff distance is more reasonable than the consensus tree for a recent public health threat, the influenza A (H 7 N 9) viruses.

A second unnamed species of the genus Mickoleitia was only of half this size, and is only known by a single adult specimen from a private fossil collection in Japan. The head of Mickoleitia was provided with large compound eyes and functional mouthparts (preserved are 3-segmented labial palps).

The forelegs are developed as subchelate raptorial devices with a <b>single-segmented</b> tarsus with an unpaired claw. Most likely the abdomen was provided with three caudal filaments (two lateral cerci and the median epiproct) as in modern mayflies and their Permian stem group representatives (Permoplectoptera, e.g. Protereismatidae). Since males of modern mayflies and of Permoplectoptera have gonopods on the 9th abdominal segment that are developed as genital claspers to grip the female for copulation, such a character state and behavior is also likely for Coxoplectoptera, who have an intermediate position as phylogenetic link between these two groups.|$|R

40|$|Some {{strains of}} the {{protozoan}} parasite genus Leishmania are persistently infected with <b>single-segmented</b> double-stranded RNA viruses, which are termed LRV. The function of these cytoplasmic viruses is unknown. In order {{to address the question}} of whether LRV affects the parasite’s phenotype, pairs of isogenic LRV 1 -LRV 2 lines are required. Since the persistent nature of these viruses precludes de novo infection of virus-negative strains, LRV 1 -LRV 2 strains were transformed with a Leishmania expression vector expressing the LRV capsid protein with the aim of determining if LRV 2 promastigotes support capsid assembly and if LRV replication is affected by excess capsid protein. I found that in LRV 2 promastigotes, capsid protein was capable of self-assembly into virus-like capsids and that capsid overexpression in a naturally infected LRV 1 line resulted in a progressive reduction in LRV copy number. Clonal lines derived from an LRV 1 capsid overexpressor had no detectable levels of LRV. These results demonstrate that LRV replication can be inhibited and that a signif-icant reduction of viral copy number has no effect on the parasite’s viability in liquid medium.

Notable plesiomorphies include the retention of frontal retractors of the narrow labrum, a high supraocular index linked to strong development of cranio-mandibular ad- and abductors, and perhaps the unusually short but still coilable (just ca. 1. 5 turns) galeal "tongue. " Notable specializations (probably mostly family autapomorphies) include a complement of large sensilla placodea on the male antennae, an apical attachment of the long dorsal tentorial arm to the cranium, an extreme reduction of the <b>single-segmented</b> labial palps, a particularly strong subgenal bridge and a surface structure of near-parallel ridges on the ommatidial corneae. The presence of sizable saccular mandibular (type 1) glands opening into the adductor apodeme is unexpected, no counterparts being known from neighboring taxa. The same is true for ventral salivarium dilator muscles originating on the prelabium; and tentatively suggested to be homologues of the extrinsic palp flexors (the insertion shift being related to loss of original function due to palp reduction), rather than to the ventral salivarium muscles of more basal insects. A complete "deutocerebral loop"' may or may not be developed, as is true for a mutual appression of the optic lobe and circumoesophageal connective/suboesophageal ganglion, enclosing the anterior tentorial arm between them; a suboesophageal innervation of the retrocerebral complex was not observed.

Results of a survey of Harpalinae Bonelli place Cyphocoleus as a member of Odacanthini based on synapomorphies of the eighth abdominal tergite and the female spermathecal assembly. Cyphocoleus shares with five other generic-level taxa – Homethes Newman, Aeolodermus Andrewes, Stenocheila Laporte, Quammenis Erwin and Diplacanthogaster Liebke – a <b>single-segmented</b> maxillary galea that is appressed to the outer margin of the maxillary lacinia. These six generic-level taxa are newly classified as members of subtribe Homethina subtrib. n. (type genus Homethes).

These subtribes are phylogenetically arranged as: (Actenonycina (Homethina (Pentagonicina + Odacanthina). Area relationships defined within Homethina – (New Caledonia (Australia (South America + Central America))) – support the origin of New Caledonian Cyphocoleus prior to amphiantarctic vicariance between South America and Australia. Consistent with previous molecular dating of 100 – 105 Ma for the origin of Odacanthini, a general vicariance-based hypothesis proposes that New Zealandian Actenonyx and New Caledonian Cyphocoleus were emplaced on Zealandia prior to the completion of rifting between Zealandia and Australia during Late Cretaceous, and that both fragments of Zealandia remained subaerial throughout the Cenozoic. Alternatively, under a very specific time-constrained biogeographic hypothesis ladened with an added assumption of dispersal, the ancestor of Cyphocoleus could have colonized New Caledonia during a 2 – 5 Ma period after its proposed subaerial reemergence at 37 Ma. A clade within Cyphocoleus synapomorphously exhibits an environmental patina: a varnish-like coating to the dorsal body surface that is hypothesized to enable crypsis of the adult beetle.

40|$|Abstract: It seems {{sensible}} {{to assume}} that technological innovation has a positive association with stock market returns. Indeed, Hsu (2009) finds R&D shocks to hold positive and distinct predictive power for U. S. market returns, a pattern also found in international data. However, the association between R&D and excess stock returns is more nuanced in a firm-specific framework. The same consensus view still holds - increased R&D is associated with excess returns - {{but there is an}} unsolved debate regarding the cause of this observation. Some authors suggest the excess returns are due to the mispricing of R&D by investors, while others argue for risk-based compensation. My study's novelty is to include a control group of matched firms that have not significantly increased R&D, allowing me to examine the potential differences in performance between firms that have significantly increased R&D and those that have not. I also test if increased R&D is more valuable for diversified than for <b>single-segment</b> firms, as inadequate R&D is a potent cause for diversification discount. Borrowing the methodology from Eberhart et al. (2004), my sample includes 348 public U. S. companies, each matched with a benchmark firm. I use the period 1974 - 2006 for identifying significant R&D increases in NYSE listed companies, as 1974 is the year when accounting treatment of R&D expense reporting is standardized. Consequently I have chosen a sample containing 5 years of operating and stock performance data for each sample firm. I retrieve the fundamental data from COMPUSTAT and data on stock returns from CRSP. I find R&D increases to be positively associated with excess stock returns, while my results also suggest increased R&D not to be the actual source of excess returns, as a control group of firms that have not increased their R&D experience similar excess returns than those firms that have. Moreover, following their R&D increases, <b>single-segment</b> firms experience higher excess returns than diversified firms. The diversified firms' benchmark firms that have not increased R&D earn higher excess returns, while the <b>single-segment</b> firms' matched firms slightly underperform. These findings propose that there is an industry-specific factor driving the excess stock returns during the time periods when a firm operating in a certain industry significantly increases R&D. This notion is consistent with earlier literature suggesting an extra risk factor associated with R&D not captured by the traditional factor models. Furthermore, the outperformance of <b>single-segment</b> firms over diversified firms could be due to financial constraints that drive the risk and return relation. My findings on the financing behavior of <b>single-segment</b> firms support this explanation, as <b>single-segment</b> firms are more likely to substitute debt for equity than diversified firms...|$|E

The body {{is usually}} short, and the thorax has a rectangular profile, with a well-developed humeral callus. The abdomen is broad and the legs are short. The thorax and abdomen are often light grey, rarely dark, {{but may be}} yellow, green, blue-green, and variably coppery or metallic. The wings are equal in length to the body or slightly longer. Wings have the lower calypter much reduced or absent. The chaetotaxy is well developed, especially on the head. The postvertical orbital bristles on the head are always present and divergent, inner and outer vertical bristles on the head are well developed. They have ocellar bristles, frontal bristles (two to eight pairs of frontal bristles, the lower one to three pairs curve inward, the other pairs backward), vibrissae (in some cases weakly developed), and oral bristles are always present. Interfrontal bristles are absent, but interfrontal setulae are sometimes present. The basal segment of the antennae is very short; the second antennal segment is not grooved. The third antennal segment is always large, usually round (not elongated but sometimes with a sharp point) and usually with swollen, and the almost bare or pubescent arista never is plumose. The face in lateral view is not deeply excavated between the antennae and {{the edge of the}} mouth. The ptilinal suture is clearly defined. The mouthparts are functional. The proboscis is usually short and thick, rarely elongated and geniculated (Ophiomyia). The maxillary palps are <b>single-segmented</b> and porrect. The thorax is without a continuous dorsal suture and without well-defined posterior calli. The thorax has well-developed dorsocentral bristles, postalar bristles, supra-alar bristles, and acrostichal and intra-alar bristles. The scutellum has two to four bristles. On each side of the thorax is a humeral bristle and one or two notopleural bristles. In describing the bristles of the thorax (dorsocentral bristles and acrostichal), a formula is used in which the first number indicates the postsutural ones, and the second number, following a plus (+) or minus (-) sign the presutural. A few bristles are on the legs, but bristles on tibia 2, are of taxonomic significance. Tibiae are without a dorsal preapical bristle. Hind tibiae are without strong bristles in the basal 4/5. The front femora are without a conspicuous spine beneath. The wing venation usually exhibits first and second basal, anal, and discal cells but may lack {{one or more of the}} cells. Wings have a discal cell, or are without a discal cell; without a subapical cell. The anal cell is very short and closed. The costa has one break which is at the end of the subcosta. The subcosta is apparent (faint) and joins vein 1 well short of the costa, or terminates before it (vein Sc is complete or incomplete, apically ending in vein R1 (Agromyzinae) or separate from vein R1, but reduced to a fold that may or may not reach the costa (Phytomyzinae)); [...] Wing vein 4 extends far beyond the end of the first basal cell. Wing vein 6 is present, falling short of the wing margin. Wing venation is shown in the gallery.|$|R
40|$|Diversified {{firms have}} {{different}} values than comparable portfolios of <b>single-segment</b> firms. These value differences must {{be due to}} differences in either future cash flows or future returns. Expected security returns on diversified firms vary systematically with relative value. Discount firms have significantly higher subsequent returns than premium firms. Slightly {{more than half of the}} cross-sectional variation in excess values is due to variation in expected future cash flows, with the remainder due to variation in expected future returns and to covariation between cash flows and returns. The diversification discount: cash flows vs. returns - Page 1 The diversification discount: cash flows vs. returns In recent years, the average diversified firm has been worth less than a portfolio of comparable <b>single-segment</b> firms. A large literature attempts to explain this fact by exploring ways that diversification might affect cash flows. This literature hypothesizes that diversification it [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{industry}} life-cycle stages on within-industry acquisitions and capital expenditures by conglomerates and <b>single-segment</b> firms controlling for endogeneity of organizational form. We find greater differences in acquisitions than in capital expenditures, which are similar across organizational types. In particular, 36 % of the growth recorded by conglomerate segments in growth industries comes from acquisitions, versus 9 % for <b>single-segment</b> firms. In growth industries, {{the effect of}} financial dependence on acquisitions and plant openings is mitigated for conglomerate firms. Plants acquired by conglomerate firms increase in productivity. The results suggest that organizational forms ’ comparative advantages differ across industry conditions. AN INFLUENTIAL BODY OF RESEARCH ARGUES that industries go through life-cycle stages and that these stages are characterized by marked differences in investment and restructuring activity (Gort and Klepper (1982), Jovanovic (1982), Klepper and Grady (1990), Klepper (1996)). The evidence suggests that change...|$|E
