5000|$|Multiple basing {{points is}} a method of {{regional}} pricing in milk marketing orders that would allow more than one basing point, or <b>surplus</b> <b>area,</b> to be used. Surplus areas are administratively defined as areas with low Class I utilization, meaning that a relatively {{small percentage of the}} milk produced in an area is used in that area as Class I (fluid) milk. In a multiple basing point system, the order used as the basing point has the smallest Class I differential (the difference between the Class I price and the Class III price). The Class I differential for other orders is then based on transportation costs to the nearest basing point plus the minimum differential. Pricing now largely reflects the Upper Midwest as the only basing point, even though the northeast and southwest are surplus areas.|$|E

Objective: To identify the determinants of stunting in food <b>surplus</b> <b>areas</b> of West Gojam Zone. Method: A community based cross-sectional survey was conducted on 622 mother-child pairs of 0 - 59 month old children in Mecha and Wenberma Woredas of West Gojam Zone, Northern Ethiopia between May and June 2006. The study investigated the differential impact of demographic and socio-economic factors, health related factors and dietary factors on stunting among under-five children. Both bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis (logistic regression model) were used to identify the determinants of under-five stunting. Results: The analyses revealed that 43. 2 (12. 0 - 17. 6) 95 % CI percent of the children under age five were suffering from chronic malnutrition, 14. 8 (39. 3 - 47. 1) 95 % CI percent were acutely malnourished and 49. 2 (45. 3 - 53. 1) 95 % CI percent were found to be under-weight.

At the root of this problem are high population densities and, therefore, small land holdings, and limited access to markets. As a result of continuous cropping with very little investment in soil fertility replenishment, the soils have become severely depleted. Many poor households in these districts are now caught in a “maize-focused poverty trap”, whereby their first agricultural priority is to provide themselves with maize for home consumption, yet yields are low and returns are insufficient to support investment in either organic soil fertility enhancement technologies or inorganic fertilizers. Thus, despite {{that the majority of}} average household puts large portions of its land under maize during both cropping seasons, it is still unable to feed itself for several months of the year.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concentrates}} {{mainly on the}} estimation of land availability for biomass production and the estimation of sustainable biomass production potential for energy. The feasible surplus land area available for bioenergy plantation is estimated assuming two land availability scenarios (Scenarios 1 and 2) and three biomass demand scenarios (IBD Scenario, SBD Scenario and FBD Scenario). Scenario 1 assumes that 100 % of the <b>surplus</b> <b>area</b> available in base year 1997 will be suitable for plantation without considering population growth and food production and that 75 % of this surplus land is feasible for plantation. Scenario 2 assumes that future food requirement will grow by 20 % and the potential <b>surplus</b> <b>area</b> will be reduced by that amount. The incremental biomass demand scenario (IBD Scenario) assumes that only the incremental demand for biomass in the year 2010 {{with respect to the}} base year 1997 has to be produced from new plantation. The sustainable biomass demand scenario (SBD Scenario) assumes that the total sustainable supply of biomass in 1997 is deducted from the future biomass demand in 2010 and only the balance is to be met by new plantation. The full biomass demand scenario (FBD Scenario) assumes that the entire projected biomass demand of the year 2010 needs to be produced from new plantation. The total feasible land area for the scenarios IBD‐ 1, 1 BD‐ 2, SBD‐ 1, SBD‐ 2, FBD‐ 1 and FBD‐ 2 are approximately 0. 96, 0. 66, 0. 80, 0. 94, 0. 60 and 0. 30 Mha, respectively. Biomass production potential is estimated by selecting appropriate plant species, plantation spacing and productivity level. The results show that the total annual biomass production in the country could vary from 2 to 9. 9 Mt. With the production option (i. e. 1. 5 m X 1. 5 m) spacing plantation with fertilizer application) giving the highest yield, the total biomass production for energy under IBD Scenario would be 9. 9 Mt yr‐ 1 for Scenario 1 and 6. 7 Mt yr ‐ 1 for Scenario 2. Under SBD Scenario, the corresponding values are 8. 2 Mt yr ‐ 1 for Scenario 1 and 5. 0 Mt yr ‐ 1 for scenario 2. Finally, FBD Scenario leads to a total biomass production of 6. 2 Mt yr ‐ 1 for Scenario 1 and 3. 0 Mt yr – 1 for Scenario 2.

40|$|To assess {{tradeoffs}} {{between environmental}} sustainability {{and changes in}} food production on agricultural land in Canada the Unified Livestock Industry and Crop Emissions Estimation System (ULICEES) was developed. It incorporates four livestock specific GHG assessments in a single model. To demonstrate the application of ULICEES, 10 % of beef cattle protein production {{was assumed to be}} displaced with an equivalent amount of pork protein. Without accounting for the loss of soil carbon, this 10 % shift reduced GHG emissions by 2. 5 TgCO 2 e y− 1 . The payback period was defined as the number of years required for a GHG reduction to equal soil carbon lost from the associated land use shift. A payback period that is shorter than 40 years represents a net long term decrease in GHG emissions. Displacing beef cattle with hogs resulted in a <b>surplus</b> <b>area</b> of forage. When this residual land was left in ungrazed perennial forage, the payback periods were less than 4 years and when it was reseeded to annual crops, they were equal to or less than 40 years.

Agricultural GHG mitigation policies will inevitably involve a trade-off between production, land use and GHG emission reduction.

30|$|Recently, bimetal {{composed}} of two noble metals are proposed to improve the catalytic performances because of the synergistic effects between two noble metals. As the literature reported, Ag/Au bimetals {{is the most common}} bimetal among all noble bimetals, owing to the chemical stability and excellent electron trapping performance [16, 17]. Essentially, the work function of Ag is higher than that of Au, then electrons could transfer from Ag to Au, resulting in the electrons <b>surplus</b> <b>area</b> and electrons depletion area in Au and Ag, respectively. These areas on Au and Ag could increase the chances for absorption of the ions or molecules. Thus, this Au/Ag alloyed bimetal could be used for chemical reaction without light irradiation [18]. For example, as reported by the Yan and co-workers, Au–Ag alloy NPs decorated on GO are synthesized successfully for reduction of 4 -nitrophenol to 4 -aminophenol. The reaction rate of Au/Ag/GO is 23.26 and 41.15 times higher than that of Au/GO and Ag/GO, respectively [19]. Furthermore, when these bimetals coupling with semiconductors, such as AgCl, the Schottky barrier is formed between the Au/Ag and AgCl. With the assistant of the Schottky barrier, the photo-excited electrons from AgCl semiconductor are effectively transferred to Ag/Au bimetals by comparing with each mono-metal, because the electron depletion area in Ag NPs existed as electron acceptor could improve the separation of electrons [20]. In addition, after absorbing photons, the produced LSPR and PRET effects of Ag/Au bimetals could promote the semiconductors to produce more charges [21, 22]. Based on these theories, inducing Au/Ag bimetal into semi-conductor AgCl is an effective way for improving the photocatalytic performance of AgCl.|$|E

40|$|Port Arthur, Texas {{has been}} a chronic labor <b>surplus</b> <b>area</b> {{since the end of}} World War II. In this thesis, an effort is made to analyze {{continuing}} high unemployment levels in an area with relatively high wages. There are two factors in the Port Arthur economy that serve to explain this phenomenon. First, the existence of widespread unionization has helped to keep wage levels high not only within organized sectors of employment, but within unorganized sectors as well through the operation of the "umbrella effect. " Second, much of Port Arthur's industry is highly capital-intensive and thus labor receives a relatively high wage because labor costs are not a significant portion of total costs. This is particularly characteristic of the chemicals industry and the petroleum refining industry, two industries which together comprise a large amount of the total employment in Port Arthur. An examination of technological change in one of the large petroleum refineries in Port Arthur showed evidence of much substitution of capital for labor within the refinery. Employment within the Operations and Maintenance Division of this particular refinery was halved in a period of eight years. Union officials indicated that this trend toward complete automation of the refineries shows no sign of slowing down. The situation in the chemicals industry is similar. The chemicals industry in Port Arthur has experienced rapid growth in the past ten years, but has provided relatively few jobs, due to its high level of capital-intensiveness. The Port Arthur employment problem is likely to become very acute in the near future as more and more young persons enter the labor force. The percentage of the population of Port Arthur in 1960 within the 5 to 14 years of age group was high relative'to previous years. This means the mid [...] . 19601 s should experience a significantly large growth in the. Port Arthur labor force. TO find jobs for this increase in the labor force, it is suggested, that labor mobility be increased from Port Arthur to other areas where more job opportunities exist and that new industries, suited to a high-wage industrial community, should be attracted to the Port Arthur area...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 While {{there are}} many people who feel it is {{impossible}} to place a monetary value on a recreation resource, economists argue that not only is it possible to do so but also necessary because so many recreation sites are publicly provided. There have been various methods used to value non-market goods such as a recreation resource, but the methods being used today are still in a changing process. The objective of this thesis is to use and compare two of the most popular means of valuing a recreation site. The two methods are the contingent valuation method (direct questioning of willingness to pay) and the travel cost method. The site to be valued is Cullaby Lake County Park near Astoria, Oregon. Contingent valuation attempts to discover people's willingness to pay for use of the recreation site by "selling" annual passes for use of the site. Through summation of all individual's willingness to pay, a value for the recreation site is calculated. The travel cost method estimates a demand curve by asking users about their travel expenditures and assuming that people would react to an on-site price increase in the same manner as they would to an increase in travel expenditures. The demand curve estimated in this thesis divides users into distance zones and uses zone averages for all the variables. The dependent variable is visits per thousand population for each zone. The independent variables are travel costs (as a price proxy), income, and one-way distance traveled to the site (to represent travel time). The estimate of site value is derived through integration of the consumers' <b>surplus</b> <b>area</b> underneath the demand curve and above the price line. Value estimates derived by the two models show a wide divergence. The travel cost estimate is seven times larger than the contingent valuation estimate. Part of the reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that the methods were estimating values for two different goods. A benefit estimate of a watershed development project on Cullaby Lake was desired. The contingent valuation method is flexible enough to allow estimation of the benefits attributable to only the improvements made on a natural lake. However, the travel cost model does not have this flexibility and will give a value for the lake as well as for the project improvements. While this thesis does not prove that one method is superior to the other, it may be an important contribution to the literature. Which model (if either) should be chosen to estimate recreation benefits may depend on exactly what it is that one is attempting to value...|$|E

The related market integration based on travel time is sensed from the observation that good infrastructure favors transportation and speed of trade flows from production centers to assembly and consumer markets, thereby enabling integration within a market-shed (Fafchamps and Gabre-Madhin 2006). Baulch (1997, p. 477) gives the importance of assessing market integration by linking spatial integration of markets, transmission of price signals from urban food deficit to rural food <b>surplus</b> <b>areas,</b> price volatility, specialization of agricultural producers according to long-term comparative advantage, and gains from trade. Therefore, market integration depends on and expresses the nature of physical and economic linkages (particularly market information) that exist between various production-consumption zones for a selected tradable product. The dynamics are reflected by price movements.|$|R

Interlinking rivers of the subcontinent is possible to achieve water security in the Indian subcontinent with the active cooperation of the countries in the region.|$|R

It is in a {{position}} that can facilitate and launchregional electricity trade {{for the benefit of the}} region also derive significant gains for its own economyfrom energy imports and exports. On the other hand, Afghanistan is endowed with large renewableenergy resources (RERs), which it could exploit not only to satisfy its domestic power demand butalso to earn significant export revenue. This paper firstly explains the methodology and framework forthe power trade and then presents an optimization framework for profit maximization in the short-runtrading and cost minimization in the long-run trading. The proposed methodology is applied to a realcase between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The objective functions, parameters, variables and constraintsare described for both optimization models. System sizing, simulation and optimization are carriedout using genetic algorithm (GA) technique. The results in the short-run model represent optimalityof about 2654 MW electricity export from Afghanistan to Pakistan during summer. Moreover, resultsderived from running long-run model depict that by utilizing its RERs such as solar, wind and hydro,Afghanistan can not only meet its power demand but also can export to Pakistan during its deficitperiods and gain remarkable energy profits...|$|R
