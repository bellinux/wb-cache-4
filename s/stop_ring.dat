40|$|Some X-ray imaging {{applications}} demand {{sensitive areas}} exceeding the active {{area of a}} single sensor. This requires a seamless tessellation of multiple detector modules with edgeless sensors. Our research is aimed at minimising the insensitive periphery that isolates the active area from the edge. Reduction of the edge-defect induced charge injection, caused by the deleterious effects of dicing, is an important step. We report on the electrical characterisation of 300 μm thick edgeless silicon p+-ν-n+ diodes, diced using deep reactive ion etching. Sensors with both n-type and p-type stop rings were fabricated in various edge topologies. Leakage currents in the active area are {{compared with those of}} sensors with a conventional design. As expected, we observe an inverse correlation between leakage-current density and both the edge distance and stop-ring width. From this correlation we determine a minimum acceptable edge distance of 50 μm. We also conclude that structures with a p-type <b>stop</b> <b>ring</b> show lower leakage currents and higher breakdown voltages than the ones with an n-type <b>stop</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Stress-strain {{curves of}} {{some kinds of}} {{materials}} at high strain-rate conditions were able {{to be determined by}} a drop weight experiment system which has only to measure the force-time relation using a load-cell but not to measure directly the deformation or deformation-rate of specimen. To evaluate the strain-rate or the strain of the specimen it had been necessary to measure the motion, i. e. the velocity or the displacement of tup and anvil so far. In this new method the velocity and the displacement of the tup and the anvil which contacted the both end surfaces of specimen were calculated using a personal computer {{on the basis of the}} equations of motion for the tup and the anvil, respectively. The differential equations, in which the measured dynamic-force versus time characteristics were contained, were integrated by Runge-Kutta method using the personal computer. In the differential equation of motion of the anvil, a spring coefficient K for the rubber cushion beneath the anvil is used. For the first approximation of the coefficient K is assumed to be the value determined by the oscillation method of cantilever beam. The spring coefficient K with high accuracy is determined when the computed strain of the specimen on the basis of the method described above is almost equal to the measured strain of it by using a micrometer caliper after the dynamic compression. The coefficient K with the higher accuracy can be obtained the incremental compression experiment using some kinds of hard <b>stop</b> <b>ring</b> in the prescribed height...|$|E

5000|$|The player {{must pay}} close {{attention}} to the damper pedal to play cleanly and avoid multiple notes ringing unintentionally at the same time. Because the notes ring for a significant fraction of a second when struck with the damper pad up, and ringing bars do not <b>stop</b> <b>ringing</b> immediately when contacted by the pad, players use a technique called after pedaling. [...] In this technique, the player presses the damper pedal slightly after striking the bar—shortly enough so the recently struck note continues to ring, but long enough so that the previous note <b>stops</b> <b>ringing.</b>|$|R
