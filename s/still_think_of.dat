25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that people know more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the last}} anti-gay law, Article 200, was {{repealed}} in 2001, societal attitudes towards {{gay and lesbian}} citizens are still quite discriminatory, particularly in rural areas. Many Romanians <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the gay community as [...] "sick" [...] and although a number of associations support the rights of [...] "sexual minorities" [...] important Romanian institutions remain critical. Homosexuals are regarded as strange, and the Romanian Orthodox Church has publicly stated its lack of tolerance on the subject. GayFest pride marches in Bucharest have been met with significant and sometimes violent opposition from far-right groups (particularly Noua Dreaptă), even though police protected pride marchers from harm. Furthermore, Noua Dreaptă has organized [...] "Marches for Normality" [...] {{on the same day}} as the GayFest pride parade, with slogans against gay rights and the recognition of same-sex relationships.|$|E
2500|$|In 1796, Byron {{suffered}} from scarlet fever, {{and his mother}} {{took him to the}} Scottish Highlands to stay in the mountains until his recovery. This experience affected Byron greatly, as he described in his poetry, especially his memory of the mountain of Lochnagar and a girl named Mary. He soon fell in love with another Mary, a cousin, and would <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her until he was 27. On 21 May 1798, the death of Byron's great-uncle, the [...] "wicked" [...] Lord Byron, allowed the 10-year-old to become the 6th Baron Byron; he inherited the Rochdale estate in Lancashire, and Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, coming under the care of his relative, Frederick Howard, Earl of Carlisle. Byron noticed no difference in how he was treated until the first time he was given the title dominus (meaning 'lord') in class; he was struck speechless and burst into tears while the other schoolchildren sat in amazement. However, little money came with the inheritance, as his great-uncle had already squandered most of his fortune; the fifth Lord Byron had sold the Rochdale estate illegally, and more money had to be put into a legal battle to restore Rochdale to Byron.|$|E

2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO.
