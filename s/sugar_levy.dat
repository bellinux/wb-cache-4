40|$|John Howard {{is neither}} a free-trader nor an ‘economic {{rational}}ist’, says Richard Denniss, and rational industry policy is suffering as a result CLAIMS that John Howard is an economic rationalist have been greatly exaggerated. That {{is not to say}} he hasn’t behaved like one from time to time, but it is domestic politics, not ideology, that is the best predictor of his actions. Just think about how he has dealt with the sugar industry {{over the past couple of}} years. We know that as an economic rationalist he hates taxes, especially new taxes. But as a prime minister with elections to win he loves a levy. A levy is, of course, not a tax, because it is spelt quite differently. So when the deregulation of the sugar industry began to cause the prime minister political problems in 2002 he went straight for his bag of levies. Australian consumers are currently paying 3 c a kilo of sugar. The deregulation of the industry was designed to lower costs and increase efficiency. The <b>sugar</b> <b>levy</b> was designed to increase costs. Howard might have found it hard to think of a reason to isolate the sugar industry from the reforms faced by the rest of the economy, but his party strategists made sure that he also thought up a reason to keep sugar-farmers in marginal seats happy all the same. And now he has to worry about the impact of the so-called free-trade agreement on the voting intentions of the sugar-farmers. While his early proclamations on the benefits of an FTA were designed to shore up his credentials as a free-trading economic rationalist, his ultimate decision to press ahead with a deal that gave up on free trade in sugar was based firmly on domestic politics. Much has been made of the importance of United States domestic politics in determining the nature of the Australia-US FTA but it was Australian politics that was the major constraint. There was no real need to wrap up the agreement so quickly. The Australian negotiators took only half the time taken by those of other countries who have negotiated FTAs with the US. The PM is right that such an opportunity comes along only once in a generation, but it was politics, not ideology, that drove him to rush the deal and deliver a disappointing result. But, having failed to extract a price from the US sugar-farmers, Howard is now determined to extract a price from Australian taxpayers. The fact is, someone has to give the Australian sugar farmers some more money or Howard may lose office. The problem for the PM now is that having placed the sugar-farmers on the public teat he cannot remove them before the next election, no matter how much they demand. The hundreds of millions of dollars he made consumers give them via the <b>sugar</b> <b>levy</b> will not deliver him one vote unless he can soothe them after their disappointment with the FTA. The government has already announced that it is willing to consider new forms of sugar-industry assistance, the National Party’s Ron Boswell stating that ‘it’s up to us now to give them a leg up’. Come again? Since when has it been up to Coalition governments to take responsibility for an industry? Before you know it they will be talking about ‘picking winners’ again. Interventionist industry policy can, of course, play an important role in the development of both regions and the economy more generally. But if it is to perform such a role, and not just be used as a mechanism for converting taxpayers’ dollars into votes for the Coalition, it needs to be part of a coherent, open and accountable strategy. There is no doubt that providing further assistance to sugar-farmers will help employment and profits in that industry. But there is no reason to assume that the employment and output impacts of providing more assistance to the sugar industry will be greater than the benefits that would arise if that same assistance was instead given to another industry. The government obviously believes that it has an important role to play in both developing and restructuring Australian industries. Each year it provides billions of dollars to the private health industry, the car industry, and the pharmaceutical industry, to name just a few. But if this money is to be used for the benefit of the Australian economy, rather than for the benefit of the government of the day, industry-assistance policy needs to be much more accountable. Industry assistance and pork-barrelling need not go hand in hand. If the government were to clearly set out what its objectives for industry assistance were, and the criteria that would be used to assess them, individual firms and industries would be able to seek assistance in a public and accountable forum. Only then will taxpayers’ money be allocated in the national interest, rather than marginal industries in marginal seats being the only beneficiaries. Howard has shown himself to be uninterested in both free trade between countries and free markets within them. He failed to get the US to bail out the Australian sugar industry, so instead he will use Australian taxpayers’ money to do it himself. By continuing with the public farce that his government is not interested in assisting industries he has prevented the formation of an open, accountable and efficient mechanism for delivering industry policy.

40|$|Without any tax {{sovereignty}} {{of its own}} and faced with a substantial decline in the volume of "traditional own resources" (customs duties, agricultural <b>levies,</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levies),</b> the European Union is left with a very low level of revenue autonomy. The EU budget is financed primarily from national contributions by the member states. Hence, controversies {{are more and more}} likely to arise over the EU budget and, in the long run, the Union is at risk of being underfinanced. Moreover, there is a growing contradiction between the absence of EU {{tax sovereignty}}, on the one hand, and the intensified pace of European integration, on the other hand. Despite the associated increase of cross-border externalities (mainly environmental damage), no recourse is being taken to taxation at the European level as a steering instrument. Another point worth noting in this context is that EU funds are used to finance a range of "European public goods" and activities with positive cross-border externalities. This holds, in particular, for expenditure for research, education and the transport infrastructure, which is subject to decisions taken at the European level. With a view to fiscal equivalence, it would be appropriate also to collect the taxes required to finance such expenditure at the European level. Apart from that, any attempt to reform the EU's system of own resources should also be aimed at its simplification. EU Finanzrahmen 2006 - 2013 Finanzierung...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine if, in a mild autumn when aphid numbers were high, the recommended aphicide treatments derived from earlier trial results were adequate to control BYDV in autumn-sown barley. Investigations on spring barley at Oak Park, 1990 - 1993, showed Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) can cause reductions in grain yield of up to 1. 4 t/ha. These studies indicated that the risk of infection increased with lateness of sowing date. They also suggested that control of the disease might best be obtained by applying an aphicide at the 4 -leaf stage of growth. The objectives of this investigation were to determine the growth stage at which aphicide should be applied in order to obtain best control of BYDV and to compare the effectiveness of systemic and contact aphicides in controlling the disease. Aphid numbers, species and infectivity with virus yellows were monitored in 20 beet crops between May and July over the period 1990 - 1999. Monitoring was undertaken to provide growers with an aphid-spray warning in order to minimise the risk of virus yellows and to establish aphid-thresholds which if exceeded would necessitate the spraying of crops with insecticide.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{to see whether the}} {{introduction}} of diploid varieties, with their more erect leaf growth, would require any adjustment of the traditional plant spacing and row width recommendations for sugar beet. Five trials were carried out in 1996 - 98 in which the diploid variety Celt was sown at three row widths: 51, 56 and 61 cm. At each row width, seed spacings were adjusted to give four plant densities between 30, 000 and 89, 000 plants/ha. In four of the trials, field establishment was between 75 and 90 %. In these trials, there was a slight increase in sugar yield with population up to 75, 000 plants/ha, and little or no change above this level. There was a slight increase in extractability at higher populations, but not sufficient to {{have a significant effect on}} extractable sugar yield. In one trial where plant establishment was reduced by very cold weather, yield and sugar content continued to increase up to the highest plant count of 65, 000 plants/ha. Over the five trials, there were no yield or quality differences between 51 - and 56 -cm rows. There was a reduction of 3. 5 % in extractable sugar yield in 61 -cm rows, though this reached statistical significance in only one trial. Taking into account the high emergence that is normally achieved with diploid varieties, these results suggest that no change should be made to the seed spacings currently recommended for triploid varieties. For those using 61 -cm rows, a small yield increase could probably be achieved by reducing row width.

40|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that yield of sugar {{is closely related to}} the amount of solar {{radiation}} intercepted by a sugar beet crop. Early sowing increases leaf area from May onwards when radiation is at its maximum and provides a basis for increasing yields. In the past, bolting has been an undesirable consequence of early sowing but some modern cultivars have good bolting resistance and can be sown early with a limited risk of bolting. This study, conducted from 1994 to 1998, compared the performance of two cultivars, Celt and Monofeb, at three sowing dates and three harvest dates. In replicated experiments, plant establishment, crop development, and root yield and quality were assessed. The effect of sowing date on solar radiation interception was studied. Effects of in-furrow pesticide application on pest numbers and plant damage were also measured. Plant establishment was influenced by sowing date with the early sowings generally giving lower plant numbers than the later ones. The cultivar Celt produced higher populations than Monofeb at all sowing dates. Early sowing increased the leaf area index (a measure of the ratio of leaf to land area) and consequently the amount of solar radiation intercepted. This was particularly so in June when solar radiation levels are highest. Early crop establishment provides the opportunity to exploit good weather conditions which may occur in April or May. Pest numbers generally were small at all the sites. Insecticide had a greater effect on pest numbers and plant damage than it had on plant establishment; the beneficial effects of pesticide were slightly more pronounced for the early and mid-season sowings than for later-sown beet. Seedling diseases were not a problem at any time of sowing. Poor emergence, where it occurred, was not associated with pre-emergence disease. Early to mid-March sowings produced significantly higher yields of roots and sugar than the early or late April sowings over the period of the experiment. Even in years when plant populations from the first sowings were much lower than subsequent sowings, yields tended to be at least equal to those of later sowings. Monofeb produced a slightly higher root yield than Celt, but because it had lower sugar contents {{there was no difference in}} sugar yields. Harvesting extended over the period from early October to mid-November and root growth and sugar production increased over that period irrespective of sowing date. Bolting was a problem in 1996 on the early-sown plots, particularly with the cultivar Celt.

40|$|Yield {{of sugar}} {{is closely related}} to the amount of solar {{radiation}} intercepted by the sugar beet crop. Early sowing increases leaf area and radiation interception in May and June, when radiation is at its maximum. In the past, bolting has been an undesirable consequence of early sowing, but some modern cultivars have good bolting resistance and can be sown early with a limited risk of bolting. This study in 1999 - 2000 was a modified continuation of work on early sowing from 1994 - 98. In 1999, a comparison was made between two sowing dates at Oak Park and Davidstown, Co. Wexford, using cultivars Celt and Libra, and sowing on drills or flat. In addition, the effect of inter-row cultivation on crop yield was assessed. In 2000, the effect of seed priming on establishment was measured for two sowing dates and on drills and flat at two sites with the cultivar Celt. Inter-row cultivation was assessed on a commercial crop at Oak Park only. The effect of sowing date on plant establishment was not as clear-cut as in the previous experiments, with no significant differences in 1999 and conflicting results from the two sites in 2000. There was no difference in establishment between Celt and Libra. Seed priming gave faster establishment than untreated seed, particularly at the earlier sowing, but {{there was no difference in}} the final populations. Sowing on the flat usually gave better establishment than on drills. Early sowing always produced significantly higher root yields (average difference over four sites was 6. 5 t/ha) than late March/early April sowing. There was no significant difference in sugar content between sowings, but extractability was slightly higher after the early sowing. Celt gave higher root yields but lower sugar contents and extractabilities than Libra. Seed priming did not improve root yields. Inter-row cultivation had no beneficial effect on root or sugar yields. There was no significant difference in root yield or sugar content between drill and flat sowing, even when plant populations on drills were lower. There were few bolters at either site in 1999, but in 2000 there were more bolters on the early-sown treatment and on those plots sown with unprimed seed. There were more forked roots on these treatments also at Oak Park, but there was no significant difference in Wexford. The main conclusions from the experiments were: 1. early sowing increases root and extractable sugar yields consistently; 2. while primed seed gives more rapid establishment, it has little effect on yield; and 3. inter-row cultivation has no effect on yield.
