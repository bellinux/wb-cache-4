30|$|The {{published}} {{studies have demonstrated}} the superiority of coreflood <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> over the bulk foam <b>stability</b> <b>tests.</b> However, {{it is not possible}} to discard the later altogether because of practical reasons. It is not feasible to screen a large number of surfactants using coreflood which require expensive specialized test equipment and take a few days to conduct a single test vs. bulk foam <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> that use glassware commonly available in laboratories and take only a few hours for a test. Because of the bulk foam <b>stability</b> <b>test’s</b> simplicity and low cost, several screening systems can also run in parallel. Also, some studies show a positive correlation between the two. More studies are needed in an attempt to understand how the bulk foam <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> can be utilized more intuitively, albeit as an initial screening tool. With this aim in mind, the current study looks into different and more in-depth ways of comparing the two methods of screening. It should be re-emphasized here that this study focuses on oil-free conditions only since studies in the past showed a positive correlation between bulk and core tests in the absence of oil while the use of bulk foam <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> for screening surfactants is ambiguous in the presence of oil.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Determining the {{likelihood}} of an avalanche occurring on a given slope is a critical decision faced by both avalanche professionals and backcountry enthusiasts. An important part of that decision-making process is using <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> and interpreting their results. Though a variety of <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> are available, we use the rutschblock and stuffblock tests since they both identify weak layers in the snowpack and, to a limited extent, quantify the stresses necessary for weak layer failure. However, there are several limitations to these <b>stability</b> <b>tests,</b> including site selection and interpretation of results, both of which require experience. While site selection {{may be the most}} important limitation, we focus on the interpretation of results. Such interpretations can be problematic, since those without the benefit of avalanche experience often latch onto <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> values as an absolute indicator of stability. However, our experience indicates that occasionally dangerous avalanche conditions exist when <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> show a stable snowpack and that sometimes the snowpack is more stable than <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> indicate. In order to partially address the difficulties in test interpretation, we have begun to qualitatively define the quality of the shear failure into three separate categories. This paper will focus on combining the interpretation of rutschblock and stuffblock tests, and describing the shear failure quality, thereby giving useful qualitative field information about the avalanche conditions in a given location. In the end, users must realize that <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> do not provide a numerical description of the snow stability, but are instead just a piece of the puzzle for avalanche prediction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{majority}} of fatal snow avalanches, skiers and snowmobilers trigger the avalanche by applying load to the snow cover. The snow cover is often tested to learn information about its stability on surrounding slopes. This testing is normally performed by digging down into the snow cover, isolating a column of snow, dynamically loading {{the top of the}} column and observing fractures that occur in the column due to the loading. Understanding how stress from dynamic surface loads and from loading in common <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> transmit through the snow cover can help people avoid situations in which they can trigger avalanches. Capacitive sensors were used within the mountain snow cover to measure peak stress below dynamic surface loads and in common <b>stability</b> <b>tests.</b> The sensors were used on 21 field days to collect over 1, 605 measurements. We present measured stress data illustrating the effect of isolating a column in <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> compared to skiing and snowmobiling over a largely undisturbed snow cover. We observed that adjusting the depth of <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> to account for the penetration depth of snowmobiles loads the snow cover more similarly to the loading applied by snowmobiling. We found that the stress profile in <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> more closely matched skiing and snowmobiling when the snow cover was softer compared to when the snow cover was harder. Similarly, the differences between the skier and snowmobile loading compared to the <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> loading were increased for a harder snow cover. Finally, in the Extended Column Test, a modern <b>stability</b> <b>test,</b> stress was only measured directly below the loading and not {{on the opposite side of}} the column...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study investigates whether {{collecting}} shear {{quality data}} {{in conjunction with}} <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> results improves snowpack evaluations. Over the past six seasons we have consistently evaluated shear quality when evaluating snowpack stability. Shear quality is subjectively evaluated on a 3 -tiered scale from Q 1 (clean, fast shears) to Q 2 (average shears) to Q 3 (irregular or dirty shears). Our method is a formalization of what ski patrollers {{and others have been}} doing in the U. S. and elsewhere for at least several decades. We used a dataset of nearly 700 individual <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> (rutschblock, stuffblock and compression tests) collected by seven observers on slopes from Alaska to Chile. In addition to <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> results, observers noted whether slopes they felt were similar to their snowpit location had avalanches, or collapsing or cracking snowpacks, on that day. Results suggest that shear quality provides important stability information, especially when <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> results appear to indicate relatively stable conditions, but the shear quality is rated Q 1. This might be because <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> results are often spatially variable, while our experience indicates that shear quality is more homogeneous. Given these results, we believe formally integrating some description of shear characteristics into stability assessments may be important for avalanche workers and backcountry enthusiasts...|$|R
