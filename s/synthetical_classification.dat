40|$|An {{asymmetric}} fused kidney {{is regarded}} as a rare disease. Definition and terminology of it are, however, understood with some confusion. In this paper we reported two cases of asymmetric fused kidney and proposed a <b>synthetical</b> <b>classification</b> off used kidney and renal ectopia. According to presence of fusion, presence of symmetry and run of ureters this classification divides fused kidney and renal ectopia into 5 types. They are (1) horseshoe kidney,(2) non-crossed renal ectopia with fusion,(3) crossed renal ectopia with fusion, (4) crossed renal ectopia without fusion and (5) non-crossed renal ectopia without fusion. And they may be supplemented by characteristic shape or position such as (S-shaped kidney) or (thoracic kidney). According to this classification Case 1 corresponded to non-crossed renal ectopia with fusion (L-shaped kidney) and Case 2 corresponded to crossed renal ectopia with fusion (lump kidney) ...|$|E
