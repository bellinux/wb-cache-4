40|$|Fe,Mn) WO 4 – Mohs Hardness: 4 – 4 ½. Wolframite is an {{important}} ore of tungsten, and is named for its tungsten content, since wolfram means tungsten in German. It’s {{the main source of}} the metal tungsten, a strong and dense material with a high melting temperature used for electric filaments, armor-piercing ammunition, and tungsten-carbide machine tools. Tungsten’s use in the auto industry had primarily been in specialty areas, like <b>studs</b> <b>for</b> <b>tires,</b> and high performance parts in racing cars. China reportedly has the world’s largest supply of tungsten ore with about 60 percent. [URL]...|$|E
50|$|Business life in Jyväskylän maalaiskunta is diversified. In {{addition}} to its conventional agriculture and forestry output, the municipality is home to companies such as Komas Oy, a system supplier of mechanical subassemblies, and Tikka Group, a manufacturer of <b>studs</b> <b>for</b> car winter <b>tires</b> (the situation as of 2006). Historically, Vaajakoski hosted {{a wide range of}} conventional industries up until the 1980s when structural changes in Finland's economy resulted in a shutdown of many long-standing factories and mills also in Jyväskylä's rural sibling. However, still actively operating in Vaajakoski's industrial area is the Panda chocolate and sweets factory, whose products are marketed the world over.|$|R
50|$|The use of studs is {{restricted}} {{in some countries}} due to the increased road wear that they cause, with the notable exception of most Nordic and North American jurisdictions, where they are commonly used in colder areas during the winter season. Norway has implemented fees <b>for</b> using <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> in some urban areas, {{and there are a}} few streets in some of the major cities in Sweden where studs are not allowed. In America, studs are typically never used on heavier vehicles (except for some emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks.), but <b>stud</b> <b>tires</b> <b>for</b> heavy vehicles are commonplace in Scandinavia. Ice resurfacers also use studded tires.The upper tier classes of ice racing and rallying mandates the vehicles be equipped with studded tires.|$|R
5000|$|Ice racing {{tires are}} either studded or non-studded. Studded tires have a stud {{such as a}} screw or bolt to provide better {{traction}} and increased speed. Some studs are sharpened to increase penetration. [...] Tires cannot be purchased with studs, so the pit crew needs to attach the studs to the tire. Through 2008, Menard's Racing in Wisconsin manufactured and sold <b>studded</b> racing <b>tires</b> <b>for</b> cars, and they were required in many ice-racing classes. Cars with studded tires are generally required to contain a roll cage and increased safety equipment since they achieve much more speed with the greater cornering abilities.|$|R
