40|$|While {{not a new}} {{ingredient}} in livestock feed, the volume available and the relative price of DDGS have forced many feed manufacturers into using greater levels than ever before. The use of DDGS has caused feed manufacturing problems at nearly every phase of feed manufacturing. These include railcars that simply won’t <b>unload,</b> <b>feeder</b> screws and supply bins that are wrong for the ingredient, nutrient variation that results in out-of-spec feeds leaving the feed mill, and, of greatest concern, pellet throughput and pellet quality concerns. Nearly all of these problems {{are the result of}} the physical properties of DDGS and of the way a particular ethanol facility might manage their byproducts. There is little doubt that the ethanol industry will continue to grow, displacing feed corn with DDGS and other byproducts.

In the summer of 2006, Edward L. Ryerson was fitted out and put into service following a long-term lay-up that began in 1998. Edward L. Ryerson was often used as a museum boat for tours. She was put back into service {{due to a lack}} of reliable hulls on the Lakes, and a need for more tonnage.

40|$|Europe Combined Terminals is a {{container}} transhipment {{company in the}} port of Rotterdam. Since the establishment in 1966, ECT grew fast. In the mean time ECT became {{the biggest and most}} advanced container transhipment company in Europe. ECT has two locations of transhipment in the port of Rotterdam. The first location is in the 'Eemhaven', the 'Home Terminal'. The second location of transhipment is the 'Maasvlakte', the 'Delta Terminal'. In the 'Eemshaven' the container transhipment takes place in a conventional way with manned equipment. The 'Delta Terminal' contains four terminals. The Delta Multi User terminal is a conventional terminal. The remaining three terminals (the Delta Dedicated North terminal, the Delta Dedicated East terminal and the Delta Dedicated West terminal) use a mainly automatic system. The quay transport and the stack are fully automatic. The landside still uses manned equipment. The partly automatic system that is described above does not always perform at the required level. The performance is expressed in terms like port time of vessels, the quay crane productivity, the waiting time of the truck drivers etcetera. Alternative terminal concepts have to be designed {{in order to be able}} to reach te desired level. The setting during this research is the second 'Maasvlakte'. The improved terminal concept design is studied here from a stacking system point of view. The various stacking systems used in the container transhipment and also new concepts of stacking systems are studied. By means of a multi criteria analysis, three stacking systems are selected. These systems are: the Autmatic Stacking (ASC) Crane System, the Overhead Bridge Crane (OHBC) System and the high bay warehouse. After this a comparison has been made between the ASC-system and the OHBC-system with use of the criteria use of space, transfer capacity, flexibility, reliability and costs. The comparison not only contains the two systems, but also the various lay-outs (particulary the placing of the transferpoints) of the systems. Because of the variety of concepts and the superficial research of these concepts, it was not possible to compare the high bay warehouse with the ASC- and OHBC-system on the same level. A quick scan has been made of the various concepts of the high stacking system. The comparison between the ASC-system and the OHBC-system shows that there is no obvious preference for one of the systems above. Higher cost of ground shows an increasive attractiviness of the OHBC-system. The comparison does show clearly that a stack lay-out with the transferpoints as a transport lane in the stack, offers great benefits in relation to the present lay-out with the transferpoints on top of the stackarea's. The lay-out with the transferpoints in the stacking area, stacks more containers per substack than the present lay-out. The waterside and landside transport takes place with the Automatic Lifting Vehicle (<b>self</b> <b>unloading</b> Automatic Guided Vehicle). Rough it was found that the all the concepts of the high bay warehouse are much more space effective than the ASC- and OHBC-system. If the cost of ground is high, a comprehensive study of the high bay warehouse is strongly recommendedCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} era of {{deregulated}} electricity markets, the power distribution systems have attained {{a very important}} and {{crucial role in the}} industry. A distribution company (referred to as a disco) plays an active and effective role in electricity markets, and can positively impact the market efficiency and make it more reliable, secure and beneficial to customers. Therefore, operation and planning issues of discos in such electricity market environment requires extensive analysis and research in order to improve their operational strategies both in the short-term and long-term. A generic operations framework for a disco operating in a competitive electricity market environment is presented in the thesis. The operations framework is a two-stage hierarchical model in which the first stage deals with disco’s activities in the day-ahead stage, the Day Ahead Operations Model (DAOM). The second stage deals with disco’s activities in real-time and is termed Real-Time Operations Model (RTOM). The DAOM determines the disco’s operational decisions on grid purchase, scheduling of distributed generation (DG) units owned by it, and contracting for interruptible load. These decisions are imposed as boundary constraints in the RTOM and the disco seeks to minimize its short-term costs keeping in mind its day-ahead decisions. A case-study is presented considering the well-known 33 -bus distribution system and three different scenarios are constructed to analyze the disco’s actions and decision-making in this context. The thesis presents a new paradigm for distribution system operation taking into account the presence of DG sources and their goodness factors. The proposed concept of goodness factor of DG units is based on the computation of the incremental contribution of a DG unit to distribution system losses. The incremental contributions of a DG unit to active and reactive power losses in the distribution system are termed as the active / reactive Incremental Loss Indices (ILI). The goodness factors are integrated directly into the distribution system operations model. This model seeks to minimize the disco’s energy costs in the short-term taking into account the contribution (goodness factor) of each DG unit. The analysis was carried out considering an 18 -bus distribution network, considering two different ownership structures of DG units, and a 69 -bus distribution system considering specific characteristics of wind-DG units. The concept of goodness factors is further extended to determine a new set of goodness factors pertaining to a DG’s impact on <b>feeder</b> <b>unloading</b> by virtue of its power injection. A novel long-term planning model has been developed for the disco that considers investments in DG capacity, distribution system feeder addition / expansion and substation transformers capacity addition. The model includes the new set of goodness factors pertaining to both loss reduction and <b>feeder</b> <b>unloading</b> and arrives at an optimal set of new expansion plan, with specified locations, and year of commissioning. The work clearly demonstrates the effectiveness and contribution of DG units in distribution systems both in the short-term and long-term framework...|$|R
40|$|After {{accession}} to the EU in 2004 {{the demand for}} tractors and agricultural implements has grown, followed by increasing supply of them. In 2012, the supply of brand-new agricultural tractors was by 185. 4 % higher than in 2003. In 2012 the value of renovation index of tractor fleet in agriculture was by 149. 3 % higher than in 2003. In spite of significant increase of demand for tractors, their production in 2012 was by 39. 2 % lower than in 2003. The downfall in number of tractors produced in Poland caused that imported tractors achieved more and more important share in supplies on Polish market.
