Taking its roots from the Mattachine Society of Washington's newsletter {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the Blade was conceived {{as a way to}} fill in a perceived gap in the organization of social communications within the gay community of Washington, D.C. The Blade was originally published as a single page and distributed hand-to-hand in a variety of gay bars throughout the city. Afraid of a backlash over the publication, many of the initial authors of writings in the Blade used pen names {{during the early years of}} publishing. The initial publications were entirely created by volunteers from the community with two editors, Nancy Tucker and Bart Wenger, at the helm. Wenger stated the initial goals of the publication were to [...] "...engender a sense of community" [...] and that it was [...] "very important for gays to become acquainted with one another." [...] Published monthly from 1969 to 1973, the newspaper evolved from its original size and shape of a single letter <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> sheet. In June 1972, the Gay Blade published its first multi-page edition which consisted of four pages and in April 1973, the paper expanded to eight pages and was printed on legal <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> sheets, stapled in the middle and folded. As the looks of the paper evolved, so did the news coverage. The Gay Blade began to focus less on being a newsletter used to organize the community and more of a newspaper for the community.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of papers with respect to sizing: unsized (water-leaf), weak sized (slack sized), and strong sized (hard sized). Waterleaf has low water resistance and includes absorbent papers for blotting. Slack <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> is somewhat absorbent and includes newsprint, while hard sized papers have the highest water resistance, such as coated fine papers and liquid packaging board.|$|E

There are different series, as well as several extensions.|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of the new}} rosin sizing method with a rosin emulsion, alum and polyvinylamine (PV Am) on the {{properties}} of the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> were investigated in terms of basis weight, sizing degree, pH value, brightness and folding endurance of the papers. The MIT folding endurances of the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> were much larger than that of the control paper due to the use of PV Am in the sizing. The pH values of papers Nos. 1 to 5 sized at pHs 5 to 8 were in acidic region varying from pH 5. 5 to 5. 8, and the papers lost dramatically their brigthnesses and folding endurances. The pH values of papers Nos. 6 to 10 containing different amounts of CaCO_ 3, varied from pH 7. 9 to 8. 3, and the papers retained their permanence well during the accelerated aging. These results illustrate that although the new sizing method was effective under neutral-alkaline papermaking conditions, the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> were acidic and exhibited poor permanence. The use of CaCO_ 3 in the rosin sizing could make the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> alkaline so that the papers showed good permanence...|$|R
50|$|In past years, {{schematic}} diagrams with mostly {{discrete components}} were fairly readable. However, with the newer high pin-count parts {{and with the}} almost universal use of standard letter or A4 <b>sized</b> <b>paper,</b> schematics have become less so. Many times, {{there will be a}} single large part on a page with nothing but pin reference keys to connect it to other pages.|$|E
50|$|Sheets 17 by 22 in can be {{cut into}} four 8.5 by 11 in sheets, a {{standard}} for business stationery known conventionally as letter <b>sized</b> <b>paper.</b> So, the 17 by 22 in ream became commonly used. The 25 by 38 in book-paper ream developed because such a size can easily be cut into sixteen 6 by 9 in book sized sheets without significant waste.|$|E

The most common fillers are clay and calcium carbonate. Titanium dioxide is a filler but also improves brightness and opacity. Use of calcium carbonate filler is the process called alkaline sizing and uses different chemistry than acid sizing. Alkaline <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> has superior ageing properties.|$|E

50|$|NOTE: If pigment stains paper after printing, repeat step 7 with {{remaining}} <b>sized</b> <b>paper.</b> This is why it’s {{important to make}} notes in the margins or {{on the back of}} your prints. Indicate each step including how many coats, length of baths, and hardening agent for archival and personal purposes. (Other hardening agents not recommended are Glyoxal, Formalin, & formaldehyde.) In this way you can easily trace your steps to find mistakes or places to improve your printing.|$|E
50|$|The Violin Sonata No. 4 of Ludwig van Beethoven in A minor, his Opus 23, was {{composed}} in 1801, published in October that year, and dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries. It followed by one year {{the composition of}} his first symphony, and was originally meant to be published alongside Violin Sonata No. 5, however it was published on different <b>sized</b> <b>paper,</b> so the opus numbers had to be split. Unlike the three first sonatas, Sonata No. 4 received a favourable reception from critics.|$|E
5000|$|Stretching (pre-shrinking) {{paper is}} {{necessary}} {{if you are}} printing more than one color or multiple times with the same color to build up density. If your paper is not sized (most watercolour papers are, though to varying degrees) it’s also advisable to size the paper to help minimize staining. A gelatin size (coating) prevents the unhardened dichromate from permeating the paper fibers. Without stretching, the paper will change shape between layer printings. Make lots of <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> at one time. Label all paper with pencil after sizing.|$|E

50|$|Baby wipes are {{wet wipes}} used to cleanse the {{sensitive}} skin of infants. These are saturated with solutions anywhere from gentle cleansing ingredients to alcohol based 'cleaners'. Baby wipes are typically different pack counts (ranging up to 80 or more sheets per pack), and come with dispensing mechanisms. The origin of baby wipes most likely {{came in the}} mid-1950s as more people were travelling and needed a way to clean up on the go. One of the first companies to produce these was a company called Nice-Pak. They made napkin <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> cloth saturated with a scented skin cleanser. Rockline Industries of Sheboygan, Wisconsin (which has {{a large part of}} the private label wipe market in several segments) went on to be the first to innovate the first baby wipe refill pack and pop-up packs which have become common in the marketplace.|$|E

5000|$|Ink wash {{painting}} is usually done on xuan paper (Chinese) or washi (Japanese paper) {{both of which}} are highly absorbent and unsized. Silk is also used in some forms of ink painting.

50|$|Until December 2007 the {{technology}} behind {{the process of}} preparing each issue was unsatisfactory. Due to lack of funds, each page was prepared by hand; the infrastructure installed in the newspaper's office consisted of a 486 microprocessor-based PC, an inkjet printer and one photocopy machine. Text was written and printed, and then cut in a rectangle shape of physical width matching that of the newspaper's column. All the rectangles assembling the final columns would then be glued to a thin sheet A2 <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> which would be photocopied and become the master copy for that page. The process would be repeated {{for each of the}} four daily pages of the newspaper, which would then be outsourced to a modern printing facility to be photographed and printed using a photo-offset printing method. Because of the use of photocopy paper (as opposed to using a film), the resulting contrast was too poor to allow any detail to be seen in photographs, thus banning them from the final print. After December 2007 and because of the widespread access to technology the newspaper's budget allowed the renewal of the equipment, and it is now being issued using modern digital methods.|$|E
