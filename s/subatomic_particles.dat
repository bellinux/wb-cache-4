These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles.</b> Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the word}} atom {{originally}} denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom {{is composed of}} various <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles.</b> The constituent particles of an atom are the electron, the proton and the neutron; all three are fermions. However, the hydrogen-1 atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles.</b> Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E

5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles</b> and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles</b> to {{be formed}} {{included}} protons, neutrons, and electrons. Though simple atomic nuclei formed {{within the first}} three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first electrically neutral atoms formed. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars or during supernovae.|$|E

Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft.

However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles.</b> There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles.</b> The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Outside a {{protective}} atmosphere and magnetic field, {{there are few}} obstacles to the passage through space of energetic <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles</b> known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 {{was the culmination of}} a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles</b> like the proton and neutron that are held together by the strong nuclear force. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, while {{reviewing the}} station's surveillance tapes, Mulder sees footage of Banton {{staring at the}} floor. After blowing up the frame, Mulder sees the logo for a company called Polarity Magnetics on Banton's jacket. The agents visit Polarity Magnetics, where they meet scientist Christopher Davey (Kevin McNulty). He identifies Banton, a physicist conducting research into dark matter. Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in his laboratory {{in which he was}} locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles.</b> His account is enough for Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion, but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles</b> or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles,</b> including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles</b> which have the {{property}} of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all moving particles—particularly <b>subatomic</b> <b>particles</b> such as electrons—exhibit {{a degree of}} wave-like behavior. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, explored {{whether or not the}} movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. Schrödinger's equation, published in 1926, describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle. For example, it can be refracted like a wave, and has mass like a particle.|$|E
