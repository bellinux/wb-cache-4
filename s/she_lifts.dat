25|$|The {{accompanying}} {{photographs in}} this installation entitled The Labours I-X, show the naked artist bracing as <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> {{each of the}} sculptures. The title refers to the mythical labours of Hercules that he is sentenced to after he kills his own children {{in a fit of}} rage. Chadwick's use of it suggests that attempting to encapsulate personal history is a Herculean task, requiring great strength and courage.|$|E
25|$|In the lair, Christine {{is forced}} to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair and {{attempts}} to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging him to show compassion. The Phantom refuses, and captures Raoul with the Punjab lasso. The Phantom tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees {{to stay with him}} forever, but if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion {{for the first time in}} his life. The Phantom, having experienced kindness at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him, and sets them both free. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom tells Christine he loves her, before she tearfully exits with Raoul. The weeping Phantom huddles on his throne and covers himself with his cloak. The mob, led by Meg, enters the lair. Meg pulls the Phantom's cloak from the throne, finding only his mask on the seat. <b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> the mask up into the light and gazes at in wonder as the curtain falls.|$|E
500|$|The Spectator {{was more}} equivocal in its {{appraisal}} of She. The review described the narrative as [...] "very stirring" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] and of [...] "remarkable imaginative power", adding: [...] "The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, {{and from the}} day when Leo and Holly land {{on the coast of}} Africa, to the day when the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: [...] "To the present writer {{there is a sense of}} the ludicrous in the end of She that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story". Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that [...] "in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> herself up against the Omnipotent. Therefore, at the appointed time she is swept away by It... Vengeance, more heavy because more long delayed, strikes her in her proudest part – her beauty".|$|E
60|$|The silence {{seemed more}} {{complete}} than ever. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> her foot {{and felt the}} white satin slipper. It was perfectly dry, there was no dew, and as yet no rain had fallen. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> the latch of the gate and passed through.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> {{her head}} instantly; her eyes flashed through her tears.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> {{her head}} with joy, then she shook it mistrustfully.|$|R
2500|$|Tenorio Trementina and {{his three}} daughters [...] – [...] Tenorio is a {{malicious}} saloon-keeper and barber in El Puerto. His three daughters perform a black mass and place a curse on Antonio's uncle Lucas Luna. Tenorio detests Ultima because <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> the curse on Lucas and soon after she does so, one of Tenorio’s daughters dies. Hot-tempered and vengeful, Tenorio spends {{the rest of the}} novel plotting Ultima’s death, which he finally achieves by killing her owl familiar, her spiritual guardian. Afterwards, he tries to kill Antonio but is shot by Uncle Pedro.|$|E
2500|$|... 'The {{construction}} of his painting {{turns on the}} orchestration of these geometrical volumes, which shift their position, develop, interweave following the movements in space of the painter himself. Already we can see, {{as a consequence of}} this movement introduced into an art which, we were told, had no relation to movement, a plurality of perspective points. These architectural combinations of cubes supported the image as it appears to the senses, that of a woman whose torso is naked, holding in her left hand a cup while with the other hand <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> a spoon to her lips. It can be easily understood that Metzinger is trying to master chance, he insists that each of the parts of his work must enter into a logical relationship with all the others. Each should, precisely, justify the other, the composition should be an organism as rigorous as possible and anything that looks accidental should be eliminated, or at least kept under control. None of that prevented either the expression of his temperament or the exercise of his imagination.' (Albert Gleizes) ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with most}} major gods and goddesses in Roman mythology, the {{literary}} concept of Venus is mantled in whole-cloth borrowings from the literary Greek mythology of her counterpart, Aphrodite. In some Latin mythology Cupid {{was the son}} of Venus and Mars, the god of war. At other times, or in parallel myths and theologies, Venus was understood to be the consort of Vulcan. Virgil, in compliment to his patron Augustus and the gens Julia, embellished an existing connection between Venus, whom Julius Caesar had adopted as his protectress, and Aeneas. Vergil's Aeneas is guided to Latium by Venus in her heavenly form, the morning star, shining brightly before him in the daylight sky; much later, <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> Caesar's soul to heaven. In Ovid's Fasti Venus came to Rome because she [...] "preferred to be worshipped in the city of her own offspring". In Vergil's poetic account of Octavian's victory at the sea-battle of Actium, the future emperor is allied with Venus, Neptune and Minerva. Octavian's opponents, Antony, Cleopatra and the Egyptians, assisted by bizarre and unhelpful Egyptian deities such as [...] "barking" [...] Anubis, lose the battle.|$|E

50|$|Judy began lifting unofficially against men in {{competitions}} {{coached by}} her husband Gary Glenney. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> in the first official American national women's meet held in 1981 in Waterloo, Iowa, overseen by USA Weightlifting. Competing against 28 other competitors she achieved the title of best lifter and a gold. In the subsequent year <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> a National record snatch.|$|R
60|$|She heard him. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> her feebly declining head. She looked. She knew.|$|R

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> a green paper screw {{of tobacco}} from the debris round [...] the {{armchair}} and taps on the door. It opens. CLARE moves [...] restlessly across the room.|$|E

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> {{the hand}} with the ring until her eyes just show (very prettily) over it. [...] "You'd just like to know," [...] she says slowly, and smiles still more brightly {{with the sense of}} {{successful}} effect.|$|E
6000|$|And now she's at the doctor's door, [...] <b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> the knocker, rap, rap, rap, [...] The {{doctor at}} the {{casement}} shews, [...] His glimmering eyes that peep and doze; [...] And one hand rubs his old night-cap.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> up {{her hands}} and folded them behind the knot of her hair.|$|R
60|$|She {{has reached}} the second balcony. She sweeps it hurriedly. Her {{companion}} raises {{his eyes to the}} same balcony and laughs as he speaks. She colors a little, but smiles as <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> her eyes to the third balcony.|$|E
6000|$|And now she's at the Doctor's door, [...] <b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> the knocker, rap, rap, rap; [...] The Doctor at the {{casement}} shows [...] His glimmering {{eyes that}} peep and doze! [...] 250 [...] And one hand rubs his old night-cap.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, {{that would}} only have made me shut my door. If Dick thought you could laugh!' She goes to the little table. 'I came back for these slips of paper.' <b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> them and presses them to her breast. 'These {{precious}} slips of paper!' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} head; <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> {{her hand and}} pointed {{steadily}} to the envelopes.|$|R
