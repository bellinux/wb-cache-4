5|$|Although {{originally}} anti-Zionist, Stern's views {{changed in}} the 1940s, and by 1942 he was <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> Jewish nationalism. When an Oakland branch of the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism formed in 1944, Stern opposed its creation, even though many members, including its president, were leading members of Temple Sinai. By 1948, however, the congregation had also become supportive of Zionism.|$|E
5|$|Clinton <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> the 2001 U.S. {{military}} action in Afghanistan, saying {{it was a chance}} to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government. Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman countercoup of 1909, Quwatli <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) against Abdul Hamid II. Nevertheless, {{after the}} failed countercoup, the CUP accused Arab provinces of {{supporting}} Abdul Hamid II and initiated {{a policy of}} Turkification, whereby all local officials were substituted by Turkish ones. Soon after, the parliament was dissolved, and the liberal Arab politicians were forced out in the following elections.|$|E

5|$|On the Monday {{following}} the first sit-in, the Baptist Minister's Conference of Nashville, representing 79 congregations, unanimously voted {{to support the}} student movement, thus throwing the weight of Nashville's black religious community behind the students. Local religious leaders called on people of good will to boycott downtown merchants who practiced segregation. Nashville's black community <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> the boycott, causing economic hardship for the merchants.|$|E
5|$|Savage <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> Donald Trump, {{a regular}} guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 {{announcement}} of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election. Trump has {{claimed to be}} a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Since the pigeye shark so {{strongly}} resembles the bull shark, morphology-based phylogenetic studies {{have considered the}} two species to be closely related. Neither this nor any other arrangement is <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> by molecular phylogenetic research, which to date has been inconclusive regarding this shark's evolutionary relationship to other Carcharhinus species.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} successful. Many of the Allied officers, {{including}} the Tsar's aides and the Austrian Chief of Staff Franz von Weyrother, <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> an immediate attack {{and appeared to}} sway Tsar Alexander. Kutuzov's plan to retreat further to the Carpathian region was rejected, and the Allied forces soon fell into Napoleon's trap.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not <b>strongly</b> <b>supported.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fields' {{political}} enemies {{charged him with}} corruption and chastised him for issuing too many pardons. He also drew criticism for appointing his eldest son as state examiner, political supporter James Brown as tax commissioner, and other relatives and political supporters to low-ranking positions in the state government. Although the party <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> Alben Barkley's senatorial bid in 1926, Fields and his allies refused to support 1927 gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham, and the governorship went to Republican Flem D. Sampson.|$|E

5|$|In 1589, Gebhard and {{his wife}} moved to Strasbourg, where he had held a prebendary {{position}} in the Cathedral chapter since 1574, and had maintained concurrently with his position in Cologne. Before his arrival some trouble had arisen in the chapter when three excommunicated canons, refugees from the Cologne strife, persisted in retaining their offices after they had accepted the reformed doctrines. He joined this party, which was <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> in the city, and {{took part in a}} double election to the bishopric in 1592. Despite some opposition, he retained his office until his death in 1601.|$|E
5|$|In March 2003, Huntsman {{resigned}} {{his post}} in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman <b>strongly</b> <b>supported,</b> {{decided not to run}} for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Bush administration. Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah. In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66â€“34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriform origins {{are unclear}} and debated. American {{paleontologist}} Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved {{from one of}} several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> {{due to a lack}} of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.|$|E

5|$|Oliphant {{retired as}} Professor of Particle Physics in 1964, and was {{appointed}} Professor of Ionised Gases. In this chair he produced his first research papers since the 1930s. He was appointed Professor Emeritus in 1967. He was invited by the premier, Don Dunstan, {{to become the}} Governor of South Australia, a position he held from 1971 to 1976. During this period, he caused great concern to Dunstan when he <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> {{the decision of the}} Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.|$|E
5|$|The News-Miner <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> the {{political}} campaign for statehood until 1959, when Alaska became the 49th {{state of the}} United States. On the day the U.S. Congress voted to have Alaska admitted as a state, Snedden arranged for a U.S. Air Force jet to fly copies of the News Miner, the Anchorage Times, and other Alaska newspapers to Washington, D.C. On {{the morning after the}} vote, each Congressman had an Alaska newspaper proclaiming statehood.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, and <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> the Roman Catholic Church. In 1560, they started proselytising the local Koli, Kunbi, Kumbhar population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein. These Christians were referred to by the British as Portuguese Christians, though they were Nestorian Christians who had only recently established ties with the Roman Catholic Church. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} brought after Jeffrey Heffernan, a detective with the Paterson, New Jersey police force, {{went to a}} {{distribution}} center {{and picked up a}} lawn sign for the candidate challenging the city's incumbent mayor in the 2005 election (Heffernan's mother had wanted a sign, so he was getting one for her). While Heffernan did not support the challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign they told senior officers, including the police chief, who <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> the mayor. For his apparent public support of the other candidate, they demoted Heffernan to beat patrol work as a uniformed officer.|$|E
5|$|With about 750 species, Ficus (Moraceae) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{angiosperm}} genera (David Frodin of Chelsea Physic Garden ranked it as the 31st largest genus). Ficus aurea is classified in the subgenus Urostigma (the strangler figs) and the section Americana. Recent molecular phylogenies have shown that subgenus Urostigma is polyphyletic, but have <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> the validity of section Americana as a discrete group (although its exact relationship to section Galoglychia is unclear).|$|E
5|$|Within the United States armed forces, {{according}} to an unscientific survey, the president was <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> in the 2004 presidential elections.

According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.|$|E
