Heirchical agglomerative cluster analysis resulted in a five cluster solution. Subgroups are identified as Positive Development, Loss of <b>Self</b> Love/Identity <b>Diffusion,</b> <b>Self</b> and Object Destructive/Loss of Ideals, Narcissistic/Withdrawn, and Repressed/Self-Idealizing. Empirically derived subgroups were compared on external validity measures including the Parental Bonding Instrument, the Loevinger Sentence Completion Test and the Youth Self-Report. Analysis of Variance was performed on variables of age, grade and ego development. Multiple Analysis of Variance was applied to variables of parental representations and behavioral/emotional problems. Chi Square Analysis was used to determine gender differences. ^ Significant differences were found between subgroups on all criteria except age and grade. In general, results indicate that positive self-representations dominated by images of self-definition, idealistic striving and object loyalty are associated with higher ego development, optimal parental bonding patterns and an absence of significant behavioral/emotional problems. Conversely, negative self-representations with pervasive experiences of demoralization, separation-anxiety, stimulation seeking and/or peer alienation were related to lower ego development, inadequate parental attachments and behavioral/emotional problems. Narcissistic and exploitative patterns were related to the lowest levels of ego development, however, were associated with few behavioral/emotional problems and varied parental representations. These findings indicate that the Inventory of Positions in Adolescence is a useful tool in assessing adolescent self-representation. ^ Results are discussed in terms of limitations and implications for prevention, treatment and future research. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} variable Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM/ 20 K- 700 K) {{was used}} to measure the surface damage patterns of single ion impacts and to study adsorption, structure and melting of the ice bilayer on Pt(111). The first part of the thesis describes the ion impact data. First, the migration of Pt self interstitials is detected by their appearance at the surface. Thus, the onset temperature of the <b>self</b> interstitial <b>diffusion</b> is determined to be 22 K. The diffusion energy is estimated to be about 50 meV consistent with earlier different measurements. Second, single ion impacts are analyzed. Due to the low imaging temperature, the surface damage of single ion impacts can be observed prior to any annealing except the interstitial diffusion. This allows to compare the impact patterns directly with Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS). For this purpose, the surface damage of Ne"+, Ar"+, Kr"+ and Xe"+ (4. 5 keV) -impacts on Pt(111) is analyzed. In particular, the number distribution of adatoms per impact (and thus the adatom yield), the radial distribution of the adatoms and the mean size of adatom and surface vacancy clusters are determined. These data show that an increase of the energy density leads to a change of the adatom production mechanism from a linear cascade mechanism (adatom creation by independent collisions) to a thermal spike mechanism (collective flow of Pt-atoms onto the surface).

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Three {{areas of}} liquid state theory are considered. First, Monte Carlo {{computer}} simulation of a two-dimensional hard disk fluid with an imbedded ellipse was undertaken {{to determine how}} a non-spherical molecule affects intermolecular ordering. The elliptical molecule (with axial ratios of 2, 5 and 10) altered the isotropic distribution of the disks only in the region very close to itself. Furthermore, the disk particles tended to arrange themselves along the least-curved portion of the ellipse. The results compared favorably with the scaled particle theory predictions of She and Evans (J. Chem. Phys. 85, 1513 (1986).). Second, the self-diffusion coefficient, velocity autocorrelation function and distribution of collision times for a two-dimensional non-overlapping Lorentz gas were calculated using molecular dynamics simulation. <b>Self</b> - <b>diffusion</b> coefficients were found to agree at all densities with kinetic theory predictions (A.

The density dependence of the decay of the velocity autocorrelation function was qualitiatively different than that predicted by kinetic theory. Third, dynamics of small alkanes (composed of 4 to 15 methylene units) was investigated using the Rouse-Zimm model, the rotational isomeric state model and Brownian dynamics computer simulation {{in an effort to}} understand the chain length dependence of the rate of ring-closure reactions.
