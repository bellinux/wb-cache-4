Monolayers of intact, chemically unmodified cells were freeze-fractured and examined by one-dimensional SDS PAGE. <b>Silverstained</b> gels revealed all major polypeptides that stain with Coomassie Blue {{as well as all}} bands that stain with periodic acid Schiffs reagent. Both nonglycosylated and glycosylated membrane polypeptides could be detected at concentrations of only a few nanograms per band. Membrane splitting had no effect on the position or number of bands.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the novel expression of proteins at the surface of cells during apoptosis. HeLa, MCF- 7, and HL 60 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis {{by the addition of}} 5 mM 6 -DMAP, 15 nM okadaic acid, and 2 jiM colchicine respectively. After 24 h, up to 50 % of the cell population appeared to be apoptotic and cell membrane preparations from both normal and apoptotic cells were carried out. The detection of novel proteins was approached by two different techniques: (i) subtractive immunization of mice for the generation of mAbs; and (ii) analysis of the whole protein profile from normal and apoptotic cells by 2 D-PAGE. ELISA-tests and flow cytometric analysis showed that {{only a small number of}} mAbs had been produced against apoptotic antigens from MCF- 7 cells but not from HeLa or HL 60 cells. However, <b>silverstained</b> 2 D-gels showed several proteins from all three cell types examined that were detectable in the apoptotic cells but not in the corresponding normal cells...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} an overall {{analysis}} of gene expression during the cell cycle in synchronous suspension cultures of Catharanthus roseus cells. First, the cellular cytoplasmic proteins were fractionated by {{two-dimensional gel electrophoresis}} and visualized by staining with silver. Seventeen polypeptides showed qualitative or quantitative changes during the cell cycle. Second, the rates of synthesis of cytoplasmic proteins were also investigated by autoradiography by labeling cells with [35 S]methionine at each phase of the cell cycle. The rates of synthesis of 13 polypeptides were found to vary during the cell cycle. The <b>silverstained</b> electrophoretic pattern of proteins in the G 2 phase in particular showed characteristic changes in levels of polypeptides, while the rates of synthesis of polypeptides synthesized during the G 2 phase did not show such phase-specific changes. This result suggests that posttranslational processing of polypeptides occurs during or prior to the G 2 phase. In the G 1 and S phases and during cytokinesis, several other polypeptides were specifically synthesized. Finally, the variation of mRNAs was analyzed from the autoradiograms of in vitro translation products of poly(A) + RNA isolated at each phase. Three poly(A) + RNAs increased in amount from the G 1 to the S phase and one poly (A) + RNA increased preferentially from the G 2 phase to cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson´s disease (PD) is a frequent, age {{dependent}} {{neurodegenerative disease}} that is characterised by loss of monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons {{in the central}} nervous system. Loss-of-function mutations in the parkin gene cause 50 % of autosomal recessive cases. We examined proteome alterations in ventral midbrain (M) and cerebrum (C) of 129 /Sv mice (n= 10) due to knockout of exon 3 of the parkin gene, performing two dimensional large-gel electrophoresis and <b>silverstaining,</b> using image processing software and mass spectrometry. For statistical analysis we applied the Wilcoxon test. Proteome analysis showed decreased spot volume of antioxidant and mitochondrial proteins (peroxiredoxin 1, C, p= 0, 008, M, p= 0, 037; peroxiredoxin 2, M, p= 0, 037; glyoxalase 1, C, p= 0, 047; cytochromeC oxidase subunit Vb, M, p= 0, 025). Moreover, we found changes in synaptic proteins and and proteins located in the perisynaptic compartment: increased spot volume of complexin 2 (C, p= 0, 037) and decreased spot volume of Lasp- 1 (M, p= 0, 028). Whereas deficits in the antioxidant and mitochondrial systems reproduce well-known features of PD pathogenesis, the discovery of (peri-) synaptic protein changes leads to new insights: So far, synaptic changes have been discussed as a late, compensatory process after major loss of dopaminergic neurons. Since parkin k. o. mice show only slight motor deficits and no histological pathology, we suspect early alterations of synaptic function. Complexin 2 seems {{to be involved in}} glutamatergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis; Lasp- 1 might play a role in synaptic plasticity. Parkin protein shows ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro, but none of its in-vitro substrates were found to show altered spot volumes in k. o. mice. Nevertheless, our results implicate that parkin, via unknown mechanisms, influences the antioxidative, mitochondrial and synaptic function. The latter seems to involve complexin 2 and Lasp- 1 and, as demonstrated in different parkin knockout models, leads to altered motor and learning behaviour of the mouse. The results of this trial are expected to be relevant not only to parkin related disease, but to idiopathic PD (IPD), as well. Firstly, the model seems to be valid because it reproduces the most prominent features of IPD pathogenesis: alterations of the antioxidant and mitochondrial systems. Secondly, parkin function is influenced by oxidative modification, so that early oxidative stress in IPD can lead to similar consequences as parkin knockout...|$|R
40|$|Damage to joints predisposes to osteoarthritis. The {{mechanism}} by which injury to cartilage might lead to net matrix loss and cartilage degeneration remains unknown. Following experimental sharp injury to porcine articular cartilage (dissection from, or scoring of the articular surface), our group has previously shown rapid activation of the 3 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in cartilage. Activation of ERK, and probably also p 38 MAPK, is due to release of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) from the matrix after injury. However, despite a long search, the cause of JNK activation following sharp injury remains unknown. I investigated the extent and regulation of inflammatory signalling after cartilage injury and whether it was sufficient to cause expression of inflammatory response genes. In this work, I show {{that a number of}} intracellular signalling pathways including PI 3 kinase and IκB kinase (IKK) (which leads to activation of NFκB) are activated by sharp injury to cartilage. The signalling following injury was sufficient to induce a wide range of inflammatory response mRNAs, including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 6, COX- 2 and proteinases such as MMP- 1 and ADAMTS- 4 in a pattern which was not entirely IL- 1 -like. Pharmacological inhibition experiments suggested that the production by injured cartilage of an inflammatory response gene which could be assayed at the protein level, activin A, was regulated by FGF-mediated pathways (ERK) as well as by NFκB and tyrosine kinases (src family kinases). Given these findings, the role of tyrosine kinases in the early response of cartilage to injury was explored. By phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and purification from injured cartilage lysates, FAK and its substrate paxillin were identified from <b>silverstained</b> gels by mass spectrometry. The phosphorylation of these src substrates accounted for rapidly inducible bands seen on phosphotyrosine western blotting of injured cartilage lysates. However, no evidence of a role for src kinases in the regulation of MAPK/IKK signalling upon injury was found. In contrast, blockade of another tyrosine kinase, the FGF receptor, led to partial inhibition not only of the ERK pathway following sharp injury, but also the other MAPKs and IKK. Whilst activation of the same pathways was also seen following injury to synovium, FGF receptor inhibition had no effect on this signalling. This suggested that FGF may have a pro-inflammatory action following injury in vivo which is a particular feature of cartilage. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the succesful {{development}} of clinical organ transplantation, more patients have become eligible for transplantation and there is now a severe shortage of human organs suitable for grafting. Xenotransplantation, i. e. transplantation of cells, tissue or organs between individuals of different species, may be a solution to this problem. For different reasons, the pig is now generally considered to be the most suitable donor species for xenografting to humans. However, all humans have naturally occuring antibodies against carbohydrate structures present on the cell surface of pig cells, e. g. the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. These antibodies {{are one of the most}} essential of various factors that cause the immediate, hyperacute, rejection of transplanted porcine organs. The aim of this study was to identify and characterise the antigenic carbohydrate structures on porcine endothelial cells and to localise them subcellularly. Methods to remove the anti-pig antibodies from a presumptive recipient has also been studied. Glycolipids were prepared and isolated from pig aorta. Structural characterisation was achieved by mass spectrometry and 1 H NMR spectroscopy on native and derivatised compounds. Monoclonal antibodies and carbohydrate specific lectins were used for immunostaining of glycolipids on thin layer chromatography plates. A cell-EIA assay with a primary cell culture was established for the study of antibody reactivity to pig aortic endothelial cells (PAEC). The binding of serum antibodies to PAEC and pig lymphocytes was also investigated by e. g. flow cytometry and lymphocytotoxicity tests. To localise a certain carbohydrate structure subcellularly we used lectin-gold <b>silverstaining</b> on cryosections from pig aorta. The sections were studied by both light and electron microscopy. Carbohydrate structures with a terminal galactose in an a linkage to a second galactose (Gala 1, 3 Gal) has been shown to be the major target for human anti-pig antibodies. We have shown that pig aorta contain two glycolipid structures with that determinant - Gala 1, 3 neolacto-tetraosylceramide and Gala 1, 3 Lewisx. The presence of longer carbohydrate structures with the same terminal saccharides can not be excluded. These epitopes are mainly found on endothelial cells and are located to the apical side. Further, we have shown that the anti-pig antibodies in patients who have undergone repeated plasmapheresis treatments is reduced to very low levels, but return to the original level in a week or two. The binding of the anti-pig antibodies can also be inhibited by soluble Gala 1, 3 Gal saccharide. A combination of these two methods might be a way to temporarily reduce the anti-pig antibodies to reach a state where the graft is tolerated despite the subsequent return of the antibodies. This phenomenon is called accommodation, but the mechanisms for its origin is not yet fully understood...|$|R
40|$|The aerobic {{metabolic}} rate may increase up to 10 -fold during physical exercise, enhancing leakage of oxygen radicals from the mitochondria to the cytosol. This rise in {{oxygen free radical}} concentration could exceed the protective capacity of cell antioxidant defence systems and cause oxidative changes of lipid membranes and membrane skeletons. Structural changes in red blood cell (RBC) membrane skeletons have been observed with scanning electron microscopy after a marathon race. Endurance exercise {{has also been shown}} to increase Malondialdehyd (MDA) concentration, a breakdown product of oxidative damaged polyunsaturated membrane lipids. After endurance exercise RBC´s show decreased osmotic resistances and are more susceptible to mechanical stress. We tested the hypothesis, that hemolysis in endurance exercise is associated with structural changes of RBC membrane skeletons and lipids and investigated the effect of workload intensity even in frequently performed types of endurance training Ten healthy, endurance trained male triathletes were subjected to two 35 min constant workloads at moderate and heavy bicycle ergometry. Immediately before and after ergometry blood samples were collected from antecubital vein. Plasma haptoglobulin (HP) concentration was measured by a radial immunodiffusion assay as an indicator of hemolysis. Malondialdehyd (MDA) concentration was measured by a flurescencephotometric method using thiobarbituric acid as reactant and tetraethioxypropan as a standard. For detection of erythrocyte membrane proteins the erythrocyte were washed and hemolyzed, membrane proteins were sedimented by centrifugation, denaturated and subjected to horizontal SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein pattern obtained in the gels was visualised by <b>silverstaining.</b> Every 2. 5 minute during ergometry venous capillary blood samples were collected from the earlobe. This samples were used to measure lactate concentration by a enzymatic method using laktatdehydrogenase. Moderate bicycle ergometry (58. 7 ± 4. 5 % of VO 2 peak) : Lactate concentration increase during erometry was below 1 mmol/l indicating a steady state. No significant changes were observed in MDA and HP concentration. MDA concentration did not correlate with Lactate concentration. Membrane proteins exhibited the normal patterns. Heavy bicycle ergometry (73. 3 ± 8. 9 % of VO 2 peak) : Mean Lactate concentration increase was 3. 3 ± 1. 0 mmol/l indicating a intensity above the steady state. MDA concentration increased (p < 0. 05) by 5. 7 ± 6. 5 %. MDA concentration correlated with Lactate concentration. HP decreased (p < 0. 05) by 16. 0 ± 10. 6 %. Preexercice membrane proteins exhibited the normal gel electrophoresis patterns, postexercice membrane proteins showed in 50 % of the gels distinctly diminished Spectrin bands. After moderate bicycle ergometry the measured indicators for oxidative red cell membrane alterations showed no significant changes. After heavy bicycle ergometry the haptglobolin concentration decreased, indicating a hemolysis during exercise. The MDA concentration increased and correlated with the break-off lactate, indicating peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids and suggests a connection with increasing exercise intensity. The diminished Spectrin bands in the postexercise gels could be due protein oxidation and enhanced susceptibility to proteoytic degradation following oxidative denaturation. The observed diminishment of the spectrin - bands could be due to proteolytic modification ex vivo. Thus, the hemolysis in heavy bicycle ergometry may be related to increased chemical and physical susceptibility following oxidative alterations in RBC membrane lipids and membrane. Thus, 35 minute intensive endurance training seems to be a physiological stress sufficient for alterations of lipids and proteins of the RBC membrane. The latter changes may be related to increased susceptibility to chemical and physical stress and may contribute to hemolysis in endurance exercise...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} almost all MS {{patients}} receive some kind of immunomodulatory therapy, possible misdiagnoses should be avoided at all means. Therefore the German treatment consensus group insists that the diagnosis of MS should include both MRI and testing for oligoclonal bands (OB) in the cerebrospinal fluid. With modern isoelectric focusing (IEF) techniques OB can be detected in 95 - 100 % of patients with clinically definite MS. The literature on MS cases with negative OB is scarce and inconclusive. Most investigations {{have been carried out}} with inadequate methods and/ or insufficient sensitivity. Our objective was to define the frequency of OB negative MS patients in larger case material and to further analyse the differences concerning age at onset, gender, disease course, progression and disability after follow-up between OB negative and OB positive MS patients. Methods: The MS data bank MUSIS of the Jewish hospital in Berlin was reviewed for MS patients, whose CSF and serum had been analysed for oligoclonal IgG bands by IEF between 1995 and 2003. 1827 patients with a diagnosis of MS were identified. CSF analysis of the 70 OB negative MS patients had been performed at N= 24 different laboratories. Gender, age at onset, duration of disease, course of disease and severity (expanded disability status scale, EDSS) were extracted from the data base. Patient follow-up was assessed up to October 2003 and ranged from 1 year to 51 years (mean 14. 8, ± 8. 4 SD). Further we compared two matched groups of patients - 70 OB negative MS patients versus 70 OB positive MS patients. Matching was performed in the following manner. For each OB negative case we identified a OB positive MS patient of the same gender, age at onset, duration of disease, and of the same diagnostic category. Matching of the RRMS (relapsing and remitting MS) patients to SPMS (secondary progressive MS) was permitted. The patient closest to the index case was selected. Results: In 151 / 1827 (8. 3 %) patients with a tentative diagnosis of MS no OBs were found. Among these 62 had possible MS, six turned out to have an alternative diagnosis (cerebral vasculitis, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), Polyneuritis and Myelitis, hydrocephalus internus due to aqueduct stenosis, Morbus Wilson and autoimmun triggered polyneuropathy) and 13 patients had changed to OB positive on a repeat lumbar puncture, leaving 70 patients with definite MS and no OBs (3. 8 %). Differences between the 70 OB negative and 70 positive MS patients were found regarding EDSS (2. 7 versus 3. 8, p< 0. 00001) and progression index (0. 30 versus 0. 43, p< 0. 01). Discussion: We find that clinical definite MS without OB is rare (3. 8 %), and should be diagnosed with caution (only 46. 4 % of all OB negative MS patients were definite MS patients). Despite the problems of a retrospective data collection concerning selection bias and incomplete documentation in medical records, the matched group of positive MS patients represents a good selection of all OB positive MS patients. MS patients in the OB negative group were significantly less disabled than the matched OB positive MS patients (EDSS 2. 7 vs. 3. 8 p 95 % positive OB results for definite MS patients are acceptable. According to this criterion all the data (except Bergamanschi et al., 2004 and Zeman et al., 1996) in table 1 have to be considered as inadequate. The considerable difficulties associated with the alleged absence of OB are vividly illustrated in the report of Zeman et al. Initially 34 / 290 (11. 7 %) were found to be OB negative, but subsequent reinspection of the foils led to a revision from negative to positive in 14 patients. For eight other patients a new diagnosis was established and 3 / 6 patients with a repeat lumbar puncture showed OBs on the second occasion. Altogether only 9 / 290 (3. 1 %) remained with trustful negative OB. OBs may sometimes be absent in a small percentage of patients at initial presentation such as optic neuritis (Söderström et al., 1998) or in children (Sindern et al., 1992) and become positive {{in the course of the}} disease. The conversion from negative to positive OB was also observed by us for 13 definite MS patients who underwent a second lumbar puncture. However, in most of the cases the change in the OB rating may be explained by a better performance of the second laboratory (11 / 11 reexamined at the neurochemical laboratory of the medical school Hannover were found to be positive), rather than by the development of an intrathecal IgG response. The minimum number of OB chosen as cut-off may also influence the percentage of MS patients with negative OB. Most authors demand 2 - 3 OB for a positive rating. The disappointingly low frequency of only 76 % OB positive MS patients (Pirttilla et al., 1995) may be explained by the unusually high cut-off of 5 OB. Conversely patients with only 1 OB are negative by definition, but show an increased propensity to develop a complete oligoclonal pattern on a repeat lumbar puncture (Davies et al., 2003). Interestingly 4 of the 13 MS patients (30. 8 %) without OB who were investigated at the Medical School Hannover displayed one OB. Information on the remaining 57 OB negative MS patients was not available from the other laboratories. Despite the drawback that the results for OB had to be assembled from N= 24 different laboratories, the proportion of definite MS patients with negative OB was remarkably low with only 70 / 1827 (3. 8 %). Thus OB negative CDMS is rare and should be diagnosed with caution. In six patients the absence of OB prompted reconsideration of the initial diagnosis of MS which was substituted by cerebral vasculitis, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), polyneuritis and myelitis, hydrocephalus internus due to aqueduct stenosis, Morbus Wilson and autoimmun triggered polyneuropathy. If OBs are lacking it is recommended to repeat the laboratory investigations because (1) a false negative result may probably have been reported by a laboratory with suboptimal performance, or (2) an alternative diagnosis should be considered, or (3) OB may develop with time in patients with a short course of suspected MS. Our study supports the conclusion of previous studies [Stendahl-Brodin et al., 1980; Zeman et al., 1996] that the prognosis of true OB negative MS patients is relatively benign. Different neuropathological patterns have recently be defined in MS (Lucchinetti et al., 2000) and it remains to be seen, if MS patients without OBs can be allocated to a certain subgroup. Subanalysis: CSF analysis in 205 patients with multiple sclerosis. Relevance of the number of oligoclonal bands, interrelation of CSF variables and correlation with clinical data Background: Currently investigations of the CSF of patients with MS are gaining renewed interest. While modern methods of CSF analysis are indispensable for making an early and secure diagnosis, they may also turn out to be of value in predicting clinical disease course and response towards different therapies. However, it is rarely recognized that common CSF parameters may show a considerable degree of interrelation. The recently suggested parameter "number of oligoclonal bands" was tested for such dependencies and the correlation of common CSF variables with clinical data was investigated. Methods: In a retrospective analysis the clinical data for 205 patients with definite MS and positive oligoclonal bands (OB) were extracted from the MUSIS data bank at the Jewish Hospital Berlin. Identification of the oligoclonal band pattern was carried out by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels with <b>silverstaining</b> in one laboratory. Counting of bands was always performed by the same person (U. W.). Results: Mean age of the 144 women and 61 men at the time of lumbar puncture was 41. 2 (SD: 11. 6) years. Mean cell count amounted to 4. 9 /µl with 65 / 174 (37. 4 %) showing more than 4 cells/µl. EDSS score at follow-up correlated negatively with the number of cells (r = - 0. 292), but not with the number of OB. The CSF/serum quotient for albumin (blood-CSF-barrier) showed a significant correlation with EDSS (r = 0. 234, p = 000. 1) and was higer in men than in women (p = 0. 017). The mean number of CSF restricted OB was 15. 2 (SD: 7. 8), with a minimum of 2 (set cut-off) and a maximum of 34 OB. Only 7 / 205 (3. 4 %) had less than 4 OB. Additional identical OB in serum (oligoclonal pattern type 3) were encountered in 69 / 205 (33. 7 %), but only 25 / 205 (12. 2 %) displayed at least 4 or more identical OB. The mean IgG index was 0. 943 and in 119 / 205 (58 %) it was higher than the usual limit of 0. 700. The number of OB correlated closely with the IgG index (r = 0. 671, p< 0. 0001) and more weakly with the cell count (r = 0. 292). It showed a slight decrease with age (r = - 0. 192). Conclusion: Comparisons between different methods must consider that the number of OB depends (i) on the resolution of the gels and (ii) on the amount of intrathecally synthesized IgG. CSF analysis has the potential to assist in prognosis and therapy, but a multifactorial approach must be used, including parameters for demyelination, neuronal and axonal damage...|$|R
