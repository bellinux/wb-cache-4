40|$|Depuis {{longtemps}} on est à la recherche d'un substitut à la grève traditionnelle qui sauvegarderait le recours à l'utilisation de pressions économiques dans les négociations collectives et en même temps éviterait les inconvénients dont souffrent les consommateurs. Cette étude a pour but d'étudier l'origine, la nature, les avantages et les inconvénients d'une formule qui a été préconisée : la grève-sans-arrêt-de-travail (statutory strike). The {{search for}} a means to eliminate {{the impact of a}} strike on the public without weakening the bargaining power of both management and union at the bargaining table gave rise to the <b>statutory</b> strike <b>formula,</b> also known as the non-stoppage strike formula. ORIGINThe idea was first suggested in 1949 by two Harvard professors : LeRoy Marceau and Richard A. Musgrave. (1) The following year, Professor George W. Goble (2) defined a concrete way to use the idea and in 1953, Neil W. Chamberlain (3), the well-known Yale economist, approved the principles of the formula, defining his personal view on the way to use it. In 1959, David B. McCalmont (4) published several articles on the subject without knowing at that time that the idea was not a new one. NATUREDespite these different approaches, one can draw up a profile of the Non-Stoppage Strike Formula, taking into account the four given sources :— there is no work stoppage;— the public does not have to suffer any production or service interruption;— the parties are supposed {{to be in the same}} relative bargaining positions as if the workers had walked out;— the parties are supposed to impose on each other the same economic burden as if they were involved in a regular strike. The basic hypothesis of that formula is as follows :« Aside from the inconvenience which the public suffers, the only direct result of a strike is to inflict an economic loss on both the company and the workers. It costs them both money » ( [...] .) « If therefore a system could be devised which would permit the union to inflict the identical loss upon the company without a work stoppage, the bargaining function of the strike would be preserved, yet the conflict with the public interest would be avoided.  » (5) ELEMENTSSetting up of the FormulaMarceau and Musgrave as well as Chamberlain propose the use of the formula when a conflict between management and the union is judged by the State as being an emergency dispute. The law would then force the parties to use the non-stoppage strike formula. Goble suggests the existence of a law defining the method of application of the system, available on a voluntary basis to the parties involved in the conflict. Finally, McCalmont thinks that there is no need for any legislation concerning the non-stoppage strike formula. The system could be used following the will of the parties. However, the State or any public intervention would be avoided except where agreed upon by the parties. It would be more appropriate to name the first case « statutory strike » and the two others, « non-stoppage strike ». We will use that latter term. Economic PenaltiesDuring a work stoppage, the workers are willing to give up their income in order to force the employer to accept their demands. The strike without work stoppage takes that fact into account. The workers keep on working though they receive only a part of their income. On the other hand, the employer gives up a part of the company's earnings. They negotiate under that pressure until they reach an agreement. There is no work stoppage. The same economic pressure as in a regular work stoppage forces the parties towards an agreement. How can it be done ?Marceau and Musgrave recommend requiring the company « to pay out (for all work performed) at a rate so high that the company would stand in the same profit and loss position in which it would have stood, had the work stoppage gone ahead » and the workers would receive « a rate so low that, in actual fact, they would be under the same economic pressure that a strike would exert ». (6) Since they keep on working, they must receive a little more than that if one is to avoid placing the parties in a worse position than if the workers had really walked out. Goble would prefer to retain 25 per cent of the workers' income and 25 per cent of the managers' income plus the net profits of the company operating during a non-stoppage strike. In order to maintain the relative bargaining power of the parties, Chamberlain proposes the retention of 50 per cent of the workers' income and 50 per cent of the fixed costs of the company during the non-stoppage strike. Taking into account the fact that the employer does not lose his market and that the workers have no equal advantage, another penalty would be added to the employer by retaining all his net profits. The penalties suggested by McCalmont are much alike those of Marceau and Musgrave. They would be as follows : 50 per cent of the owner's income and 50 per cent of the difference between the company's income with and without a work stoppage ; the latter amount being defined in the expired collective agreement to avoid the problems of setting it up. Use of the Trust Fund ReceiptsOn this specific point, Marceau and Musgrave, Chamberlain, and McCalmont suggest that these amounts be retained each week during the non-stoppage strike negotiations until the agreement is reached. Goble adds the possibility of the parties recovering all the money withheld if they settle within 90 days. If not, another period of the same length with the same penalties would begin until the agreement is reached. Musgrave, Chamberlain and McCalmont would use these amounts to finance public services in the community or to help finance the general needs of the government (strike tax). Marceau suggests using the money withheld to pay retroactive payments to the parties, hoping that this will bring them to agree upon the formula. EXPERIENCESAs far as we have been able to determine, there is only one collective agreement which includes a non-stoppage strike clause. It was signed by Dunbar Furniture Corporation (Indiana) and Local 222 of the Upholsterers International Union (AFL-CIO) on May 1, 1964. It can be described as follows :« The strike-work provisions are activated on receipt of written notice of a strike or lockout. The provisions immediately ban such action; reinstate the terms of the basic contract (whose expiration is a condition for a strike or lockout); and stipulate that the ban will continue during the first twelve payroll weeks after the notice is received. Until a settlement is reached within this period, if it is, half of the weekly earnings of bargaining unit employees (including holiday and vacation pay that may become due) is withheld by the company. This money is placed in a 'strike work trust fund', for which the First Bank of Berne is the fiduciary. The company also turns over to the fund an amount equal to the total withheld from the employees' pay ». When the basic contract dispute is settled, the company and its employees can regain the money turned over to the trust according to the following schedule :Settlement during the       proportion of money returned   first 6 weeks                         100 %    7 th — 9 th week                      75 %    10 th — 11 th week                  50 %    12 th week                         25 %   After the 12 th week               noneIf the twelfth week ends without a settlement, the basic contract can be terminated on written notice and a regular strike or lockout can begin. If such notice is not received by the end of the first following week (the thirteenth), the contract is renewed automatically and without change. In this case the contract is not terminable until a year from its original, pre-notice expiration date. (7) Since their agreement on that formula, the parties have renegotiated their contract but without having to use the strike-work provisions. There is another experience of non-stoppage strike which took place in Miami, Florida. It was not part of the agreement but was a decision taken by the parties after three days of regular strike. (8) The Miami Transit Company and its striking employees agreed to provide free bus service for the city. The bus drivers agreed to provide their services free and the employer was to pay for fuel and maintenance of the buses. The drivers were not to receive any subsidies during the period other than those payments authorized by the union. The system worked for only three days and ended because the bus company president charged that his investigators had found some drivers accepting tips from riders. They returned to a formal strike. (9) This case is so particular that it could not be extended to other sectors of our economy. It is presented for its originality rather than for its possible application elsewhere. PLAN ADVANTAGES AS ESTIMATED BY THE PROMOTORSThe great winner with the formula is the public because it does not have to change its practices as there is no work stoppage. However, in the opinion of the proposers, both the workers and management gain with the formula. Let us now turn to the advantages for them. (10) For the workers :— they receive a bigger pay during the non-stoppage strike than if they had walked out;— the demoralization which comes from being idle, as required by the regular strike, is not present;— the bad feeling and dangers of the picket line are eliminated;— the risk of the company beating the strike by employing strike breakers is avoided;— the bargaining power of the union is not weakened since they are supposed to maintain the same economic pressure as if they had gone on strike;— It is an excellent occasion for the union to improve its public image. For the employer :— the damage to property, which sometimes results from a picket line, are eliminated;— all expenses incidental to a shut down are eliminated;— the disruption which comes to the operation of the business, to its market|$|R

5000|$|With the Supreme Court having vastly {{expanded}} {{the use of}} arbitration through Byrd, McMahon, Rodriguez and other decisions, the issue of manifest disregard returned, with some courts taking a more skeptical view of the concept entirely. The Eleventh Circuit said in another securities-fraud case it had never adopted it, primarily because [...] "the standard would likely never be met when the arbitrator provides no reasons for its award (which is typically the case)." [...] Richard Posner, chief judge of the Seventh Circuit, criticized it strongly in a 1994 case, Bavarati v.

It originated in Wilko v. Swan—a case the Supreme Court first criticized for its mistrust of arbitration and confined to its narrowest possible holding, then overruled. Created ex nihilo to be a nonstatutory ground for setting aside arbitral awards, the Wilko formula reflects precisely that mistrust of arbitration for which the Court in its two Shearson/American opinions criticized Wilko. We can understand neither the need for the formula nor the role that it plays in judicial review of arbitration (we suspect none—that it is just words). If it is meant to smuggle review for clear error in by the back door, it is inconsistent with the entire modern law of arbitration. If it is intended to be synonymous with the <b>statutory</b> <b>formula</b> that it most nearly resembles—whether the arbitrators [...] "exceeded their powers"—it is superfluous and confusing.

To help states maintain their Medicaid programs and provide states with general fiscal relief, the Recovery Act temporarily increased the federal share of Medicaid funding for states. The federal funding states receive for Medicaid is determined by a <b>statutory</b> <b>formula</b> [...] the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The Recovery Act also required GAO to study options for providing a temporary increased FMAP in response to future recessions. GAO reviewed how past recessions affected states' ability to fund Medicaid, examined the responsiveness of past increased FMAP assistance to state needs, and identified options for adjusting the increased FMAP formula for use during future recessions. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed its previous reports on recessions and the increased FMAP and similar work from other organizations. GAO analyzed federal Medicaid data and enrollment data provided by state Medicaid directors. GAO also analyzed labor market data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, state revenue data from the Census Bureau, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Coincident Indexes to assess states' ability to fund Medicaid during economic downturns. GAO identifies options for Congress to consider but does not make recommendations in this report. ...|$|E
40|$|The Supreme Court's Guidelines of Dec. 16, 1987 {{encourage}} {{to examine}} once again some basic {{questions concerning the}} duty of alimony between the divorced spouses. The analysis of the Guidelines is preceded by the presentation of main views expressed in Polish legal writings with respect to ex-spouses' support obligations. Thus, the author distinguishes four groups of problems: 1) Attention should {{be focused on the}} question about the source of support obligations between the ex-spouses. Some authors maintain that such a source should be seen in the very fact of divorce. However, the author subscribes to a prevailing view that the source of the divorced spouses' duty of alimony is their former marriage. The Guidelines support the latter view. 2) Related to the above is the question whether there exists a marital duty of support during the marriage. The author answers in the affirmative. He analyses the marital duty of contribution to the support of the family, (Art. 27 of the Family and Guardianship Code) referring frequently to other views expressed in legal writings. 3) According to Art. 60 of the Family and Guardianship Code, a distinction should be made between a regular and qualified duty of support. A qualified duty of support (Art. 60 § 2 of the Family and Guardianship Code) is vested in a spouse considered to be solely guilty of the breakdown of marriage. The author analyses the premises of a qualified duty of support. In his opinion, the Guidelines have shed light on some important matters. The most important was the explanation of the <b>statutory</b> <b>formula</b> that the innocent spouse, whose material situation deteriorated considerably in consequence of the divorce, may demand that the solely guilty spouse should contribute to the satisfaction of the justified needs of the innocent spouse, even though the latter is not in poverty. 4) In the last part of his article the author considers the premisses of prolonging the 5 -year-period of the duty of alimony between innocent spouses (Art. 60 § 3 of the Family and Guardianship Code). 3 Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
