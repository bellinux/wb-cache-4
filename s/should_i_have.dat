Sneezing, as it is written: His sneezings flash forth light.15 Perspiration, as it is written, In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.16 Open bowels, as it is written: If lie that is bent down hasteneth to be loosed, he shall not go down dying to the pit.17 Seminal emission, as it is written: Seeing seed, he will prolong his days.18 Sleep, as it is written: I should have slept, then <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been at rest.19 A dream, as it is written: Thou didst cause me to dream and make me to live.20 ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 February 1923 Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik {{met again}} {{and went for}} several days to Petrograd together. In her 1956 book of memoirs Brik remembered:I came to the railway station and found him on the platform, waiting for me on the wagon steps. As the train started, Volodya, leaning on the door read me the poem About That. Having finished, he burst into tears, immensely relieved. Now, {{in the course of}} those two months I often had pangs of consciousness. Volodya was {{suffering}} there alone, while I lived an ordinary life, was seeing people, visiting places. Now I felt happy. For the poem that I've just heard wouldn't have been written <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not chosen Volodya as my personal ideal and an impersonation of an ideal human being." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "For me, {{there will}} be days when I write a little poem in a little book, or make a little voice memo in my iPhone. For me, I need to be sitting at an {{instrument}} and be overwhelmed. I've tried {{to look back and}} see if a song just came out of a sunny day. [...] "Oh, today I'm going to write a song." [...] That's never been the case for me. It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably <b>should.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, I sit down, the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{question}} suddenly dissipated the girl's strange, studied, wilful coldness; {{she broke}} out, {{with a quick}} flash of passion,--a passion that, for the moment, was predominantly anger, [...] "Why else, in Heaven's name, <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done what I have done?

6000|$|... "No, I don't say that. I {{dare say}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> tried {{the same if}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard that any English or Irish girl was shut up here. I am sure <b>I</b> <b>should</b> if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen you beforehand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} married her," [...] {{the young man}} continued, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been happy. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my eye on a villa--not too near her parents--and I saw my way to a little {{increase}} of salary. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> taken to gardening, to walks in the Park, with an occasional theatre, and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> thoroughly enjoyed a fortnight every summer at Skegness or Sutton-on-Sea.
