25|$|When HSV {{particles}} {{are exposed to}} doses of a DNA damaging agent that would be lethal in single infections, but are then allowed to undergo multiple infection (i.e. two or more viruses per host cell), MR is observed. Enhanced survival of HSV-1 due to MR occurs upon exposure to different DNA damaging agents, including methyl methanesulfonate, trimethylpsoralen (which causes inter-strand DNA cross-links), and UV light. After treatment of genetically marked HSV with trimethylpsoralen, recombination between the marked viruses increases, suggesting that trimethylpsoralen damage stimulates recombination. MR of HSV appears to partially depend on the host cell recombinational repair machinery since <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblast</b> cells defective in a component of this machinery (i.e. cells from Bloom’s syndrome patients) are deficient in MR. These observations suggest that MR in HSV infections involves genetic recombination between damaged viral genomes resulting in production of viable progeny viruses. HSV-1, upon infecting host cells, induces inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus {{it appears that the}} HSV genome may be subjected to oxidative DNA damage during infection, and that MR may enhance viral survival and virulence under these conditions.|$|E

In order to unravel the molecular mechanism involved in the alteration of energy metabolism under oxidative stress, we treated normal human <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> (CCD- 966 SK cells) with sub-lethal doses of H 2 O 2. The results showed that several glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase type II (HK II), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) were up-regulated in H 2 O 2 -treated normal <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblasts.</b> In addition, the glycolytic flux of <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> was increased by H 2 O 2 in a dose-dependent manner through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and phosphorylation of its downstream target, phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK 2).

By treatment of the cells with glycolysis inhibitors, an AMPK inhibitor or genetic knockdown of AMPK, respectively, the H 2 O 2 -induced increase of NADPH was abrogated leading to the overproduction of intracellular ROS and cell death. Significantly, we showed that phosphorylation levels of AMPK and glycolysis were up-regulated to confer an advantage of survival for MERRF <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblasts.</b> Taken together, our findings suggest that the increased production of NADPH by AMPK-mediated increase of the glycolytic flux contributes to the adaptation of MERRF <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> and H 2 O 2 -treated normal <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> to oxidative stress...|$|R

By contrast, the expression of collagen, type I, alpha 2 (COL 1 A 2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) were first reduced and subsequently upregulated in denatured dermis tissues and <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblast</b> cells after thermal injury. We further identified COL 1 A 2 as a novel target of miR- 29 a, which is involved in type I collagen synthesis, and showed that miR- 29 a negatively regulated the expression level of COL 1 A 2 in <b>skin</b> <b>fibroblast</b> cells.
