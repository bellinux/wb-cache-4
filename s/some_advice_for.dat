Most researches concerned aim at minimizing project makespan or project cost according to different decision criterions. However, few works considered resource constraint, which initially appeared in deterministic resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) and reflects the reality of a project. In this paper, RCPSP with uncertain activity durations, or uncertain RCPSP (URCPSP), is explored. Our aim is to minimize project makespan with certain belief degree. A corresponding uncertain model is built based on chance-constrained programming. To solve the model, a hybrid intelligent algorithm integrating genetic algorithm and an uncertain serial schedule generation scheme is designed and tested in some numerical examples. This work may provide <b>some</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> the risk-averse project manager.|$|R
