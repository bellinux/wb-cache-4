40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an economic}} {{model of the}} international uranium enrichment supply market. With information from planned and operating enrichment facilities, we estimate econometric models of construction cost and labor requirements as exponential functions of facility size. These models are used to estimate <b>Separative</b> <b>Working</b> Unit (SWU) costs of all major enrichers. This allows the tracing of the international SWU supply curve. In a competitive market, the highest cost producer sets the market price. When inefficient gaseous diffusion plants are retired, the SWU price should decline. This could reduce profits for all suppliers and might decrease incentives for future investment in this industry. However, higher prices could encourage potential enrichers to enter the international market. Therefore, to discourage proliferation of enrichment technology, some form of international market intervention might be necessary to control SWU prices, in addition to political interventions under discussion in the internationa...|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{improvements}} in gas centrifuge {{technology in the}} 2000s, replacing former gaseous diffusion plants, cheaper <b>separative</b> <b>work</b> units have enabled the economic production of more enriched uranium from a given amount of natural uranium, by re-enriching tails ultimately leaving a depleted uranium tail of lower enrichment.

50|$|In March 2010, USEC began {{operating}} a new test cascade of commercial-ready AC100 centrifuge machines. USEC has been demonstrating AC100 cascade operations since then.

The NRC licensed USEC to construct and operate the commercial American Centrifuge Plant at the Portsmouth site in April 2007, and construction began in May 2007. Construction was demobilized in August 2009 due to the delay in receiving a loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. USEC currently awaits approval of this $2 billion loan guarantee before it can remobilize the construction, which will create nearly 8,000 jobs in the United States.

50|$|The {{value of}} the process is in two {{components:}} the LEU Feed (feed component of natural uranium) and the work involved in the conversion process, measured as <b>separative</b> <b>work</b> units (SWU). Both have separate commercial values. Early disagreements on interpretations {{of the terms of}} the governmental and commercial agreements on this issue led to controversy and some delays. Although each shipment contains LEU, the commercial nature of the global uranium market defines the uranium and the enrichment components as separate commercial values and costs. The solution reached was for USEC to continue payments for the SWU component it purchased and also to transfer the equivalent of the LEU feed component to the Russian side. In March 1999, Minatom and the US Department of Energy signed the Agreement Concerning the Transfer of Source Material to the Russian Federation (the Transfer Agreement), {{and at the same time}} TENEX signed a Contract with a Group of Western Companies (Cameco, Canada; Cogema, France; Nukem, Germany/US) regarding the purchase of the LEU Feed.

40|$|The burnup {{neutronics}} {{of uniform}} PWR lattices are examined {{with respect to}} reduction of uranium ore requirements {{with an emphasis on}} variation of the fuel-to-moderator ratio (lattice pitch at constant fuel pin diameter) and the use of thorium. Fuel cycles using all combinations of the major fissile (U- 235, U- 233, Pu) and fertile (U- 238, Th) species are examined. The LEOPARD code and prescriptions developed from a linear reactivity model are used to determine initial core and annual makeup fissile requirements for input into an in-house, simple, systems model, MASFLO- 2, which calculates ore (and <b>separative</b> <b>work)</b> requirements per GWeyr for growing, declining, or finite-life nuclear electric systems. For low growth scenarios drier lattices are favored, and the thorium fuel cycle requires as much as 23 % less ore than a comparably optimized uranium cycle with full recycle. For unmodified lattices, the thorium fuel cycle with full recycle exhibits long term uranium ore savings of 17 % over the comparable uranium cycle with full recycle. For rapidly growing systems, drier lattices, and those using thorium, are less attractive because of their high startup inventories. Thus the introduction of thorium may increase ore and <b>separative</b> <b>work</b> requirements in the short term but will more than repay the ore investment in the very long term. Very little improvement was achieved by varying fuel pin diameter at a given fuel-to-moderator ratio, but itwas found to be slightly advantageous to recycle plutonium (or U- 233) into dedicated reactors having individually optimized lattices: a strategy which may also be attractive for safeguards purposes.

It was foreseen at the time of publication that the results of this examination would need to be updated at intervals, and in December 1967 a second report, "Uranium Resources, Revised Estimates" was published. In order to enlarge the geographical coverage of the study, and to receive the advice of experts from uranium-producing countries outside the OECD area, this revision was made jointly with the International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna. During 1968 a joint ENEA/IAEA Working Party prepared a first report on "Uranium Production and Short Term Demand", in an attempt to relate information on uranium production supplied by the members of the Working Party, with a prediction of the probable demand over the next ten years. The report was published in January 1969. In September 1970 a report on "Uranium Resources, Production and Demand" was published jointly by ENEA and the IAEA. This report contained an updating of the uranium resources position since 1967 which was again carried out by the joint ENEA/IAEA Working Party on Uranium Resources. In addition, the Secretariat had prepared estimates of uranium and <b>separative</b> <b>work</b> requirements which were annexed to the report. The present report is essentially similar to the previous one, in that it contains updated information on uranium resources, production and demand. Part II on Uranium Resources and Production was prepared in the framework of the joint NEA*/IAEA Working Party on Uranium Resources, {{as was the case in}} the three foregoing reports* The estimates of requirements for natural and enriched uranium, contained in Part III of the Report, have been prepared by a "Working Party on Uranium Demand", with an international membership set up for this purpose in spring 1972 by the NEA Study Group on the Long-Term Role of Nuclear Energy.
