40|$|Fluid {{shear stress}} greatly {{influences}} {{the biology of}} vascular endothelial cells and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Endothelial cells undergo profound shape change and reorientation in response to physiological levels of fluid shear stress. These morphological changes influence cell function; however, the processes that produce them are poorly understood. We have examined how actin assembly is related to shear-induced endothelial cell shape change. To do so, we imposed physiological levels of shear stress on cultured endothelium for up to 96 hours and then permeabilized the cells and exposed them briefly to fluorescently labeled monomeric actin at various time points to assess actin assembly. Alternatively, monomeric actin was microinjected into cells to allow continuous monitoring of actin distribution. Actin assembly occurred primarily {{at the ends of}} stress fibers, which simultaneously reoriented to the <b>shear</b> <b>axis,</b> frequently fused with neighboring stress fibers, and ultimately drove the poles of the cells in the upstream and/or downstream directions. Actin polymerization occurred where stress fibers inserted into focal adhesion complexes, but usually only {{at one end of the}} stress fiber. Neither the upstream nor downstream focal adhesion complex was preferred. Changes in actin organization were accompanied by translocation and remodeling of cell-substrate adhesion complexes and transient formation of punctate cell-cell adherens junctions.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a detailed investigation of effect of load height on buckling resistance of steel beams. Shapes that {{are intended to}} be used primarily as a beam are generally proportioned so that moment of inertia about the principal axis is considerably larger than that about minor axis. Hence monosymmetric sections are preferable. The lateral stability of beam subjected to transverse loading is very complicated in monosymmetric sections. The distance of transverse load from <b>shear</b> centre <b>axis</b> may significantly affect the buckling resistance of a simply supported beam. When transverse concentrated load W acts at (Yq-Yo) below the shear centre and moves with the beam it acts as an additional torque W(Yq-Yo) about shear centre which opposes twist and increases resistance to buckling. Conversely, when load above shear centre, additional torque increases the twist rotation and reduces buckling resistance of beam. To verify the effect of load height on buckling resistance, a simply supported beam subjected to concentrated and uniformly distributed load is considered. The effect of load height on buckling resistance has been plotted...|$|R

The SANS pattern recorded on a two-dimensional detector was {{a function of the}} shear rate; at zero shear, the SANS pattern had radial symmetry around the direction of the beam. The radial average of the SANS pattern consisted of a broad intensity maximum superimposed on a decay. The intensity maximum at q = 0. 1 Å(- 1) supercript stop was attributed to isotropically oriented self-associated complexes of the tetrameric oxygen transport protein hemoglobin inside the erythrocytes. A flow curve of the cell suspension was used to identify at what shear rate a suspension of uniaxially oriented ellipsoidal cells is produced. The radial symmetry of the SANS patterns persisted until the shear rate was sufficient to produce a suspension of uniaxially oriented ellipsoidal cells.

40|$|A {{modification}} to {{the traditional}} bead-spring model of polymers is proposed, which properly accounts for the full hydrodynamic interactions between the beads. The new model uses the Stokesian dynamics simulation technique to calculate far-field, many-body effects as well as near-field lubrication and excluded-volume effects. No preaveraging of the interactions is required. In addition to the xF, "spring" contribution to the stress, the Stokesian dynamics model calculates hydrodynamic and direct Brownian contributions to the stress. Orientations and stresses obtained from the Stokesian dynamics dumbbell were compared to predictions of the Rouse dumbbell (no hydrodynamic interaction) and the Zimm dumbbell (Rotne-Prager hydrodynamic interaction). Infinite-dilution behaviors were examined in steady, simple shear and oscillatory shear flows. In steady shear the Stokesian dynamics model provides no improvement over the Zimm model. Both give qualitatively similar results for shear and normal stresses. The hydrodynamic stress is constant and equal to the Einstein viscosity contribution from each bead. The Brownian stress is negligible. The analysis reveals how hydrodynamic interaction causes shear thinning. The interaction between the beads tilts the dumbbell towards the <b>shear</b> <b>axis,</b> reducing the xF contribution to the shear stress. The oscillatory-shear results {{are similar to the}} steady-shear results, except that the hydrodynamic stress results in a non-zero high-frequency viscosity. Hydrodynamic and Brownian stresses will provide greater contributions to the rheology of multibead chains, in which many-body effects are more important. This is true of both steady shear and oscillatory shear. Simulations of non-dilute suspensions of Stokesian dynamics dumbbells were compared with results for suspensions of spheres at the same volume fractions. The xF stress reaches a maximum at a bead volume fraction of 0. 15, above which hydrodynamic forces dominate the solution rheology. The interparticle forces have little effect on the magnitudes of the hydrodynamic and Brownian stresses. The interparticle forces become very dependent upon initial configuration at high volume fractions. It is hypothesized that there exists a critical volume fraction, above which the polymer distribution function will always be dependent upon the initial configuration and the shear history. </p...|$|E

It is desirable to test small specimens to make efficient use of the small volumes available in test and commercial reactor cores and also because small specimens are less affected by the sometimes steep flux gradients experienced in reactor cores and the sometimes large temperature gradients developed in the specimens from gamma heating. Previous work has shown that shear yield and maximum strengths (#tau#_s_y and #tau#_s_m) obtained by shear punch test methods (a blanking operation on diameter 3 mm transmission electron microscope disks) can be respectively correlated empirically to tensile yield and ultimate strengths (#sigma#_y and #sigma#_U_T_S) of metallic specimens.

40|$|Hollow fiber {{membranes}} {{offer the}} opportunity to dramatically reduce the energy required to perform gas separations in the chemical industry. The membranes are fabricated from highly non-Newtonian precursor materials, including concentrated polymer solutions that sometimes also contain dispersed particles. These materials are susceptible to shear-induced microstructural changes during processing, which can affect {{the characteristics of the}} resulting membrane. This thesis explores several shear-related effects using materials and flow conditions that are relevant for fiber spinning. The findings are discussed as they relate to membrane processing, and also from the standpoint of enhancing our fundamental understanding of the underlying phenomena. First, the effect of shear on polymeric dope solutions was investigated. Shear-induced demixing—a phenomenon not previously studied in membrane materials—was found to occur in membrane dopes. Phase separation experiments also showed that shear-induced demixing promotes macrovoid formation. The demixing process was found to depend not only on the instantaneous shear conditions, but also on the shear history of the solution. This suggests that low-shear flow processes that occur in the upstream tubing and channels used for fiber spinning can affect macrovoid formation. The effect of viscoelastic media on dispersed particles was also explored. Shear-small-angle light scattering results showed that particles suspended in membrane dope solutions formed aggregated, vorticity-oriented structures when shear rates in the shear-thinning regime of the polymer solution were applied. Shear rates well below the shear-thinning regime did not produce any structure. In fact, the application of a Newtonian shear rate to a sample already containing the vorticity structure caused the sample to return to isotropy. Measurements using a highly elastic, constant-viscosity Boger fluid showed that strong normal forces alone are not sufficient to form the vorticity structures, but that shear thinning is also required. Lastly, a study was conducted examining cross-stream migration of particles dispersed in viscoelastic media. Fluids exhibiting varying degrees of shear thinning and normal forces were found to have different effects on the particle distribution along the <b>shear</b> gradient <b>axis</b> in Poiseuille flow. Shear thinning was found to promote migration toward the channel center, while normal stresses tended to cause migration toward the channel walls. In addition to hollow fiber spinning, many other industrially relevant applications involve polymer solutions and suspensions of particles in viscoelastic media. Often, the properties and performance of the material depend strongly on the internal microstructure.

40|$|New {{extensions}} {{of a model}} for the growth and coalescence of ellipsoidal voids based on the Gurson formalism are proposed in order to treat problems involving <b>shear</b> and/or voids <b>axis</b> not necessarily aligned with the main loading direction, under plane strain loading conditions. These extensions are motivated and validated using 3 D finite element void cell calculations with overall plane strain enforced in one direction. The starting point is the Gologanu model dealing with spheroidal void shape. A void rotation law based on homogenization theory is coupled to this damage model. The predictions of the model closely agree with the 3 D cell calculations, capturing the effect of the initial void shape and orientation on the void rotation rate. An empirical correction is also introduced for the change of the void aspect ratio in the plane transverse to the main axis of the void departing from its initially circular shape. This correction is needed for an accurate prediction of the onset of coalescence. Next, a new approach is proposed to take strain hardening into account within the Thomason criterion for internal necking, avoiding the use of strain hardening-dependent fitting parameters. The coalescence criterion is generalized to any possible direction of the coalescence plane and void orientation. Finally, the model is supplemented by a mathematical description of the final drop of the stress carrying capacity during coalescence. The entire model is developed for plane strain conditions, setting the path to a 3 D extension. After validation of the model, a parametric study addresses the effect of shear on the ductility of metallic alloys for a range of microstructural and flow parameters, under different stress states. In general, the presence of shear, for identical stress triaxiality, decreases the ductility, partly explaining recent experimental results obtained in the low stress triaxiality regime.

40|$|For {{the present}} study, a {{mathematical}} model AMRA was created to simulate the aeroelastic behaviour of a rotor during autorotation. Our model: Aeroelastic Model of a Rotor in Autorotation (AMRA) captures transverse bending and teeter, torsional twist and lag-wise motion of the rotor blade and hence {{it is used to}} investigate couplings between blade flapping, torsion and rotor speed. Lagrange’s method was used for the modelling of blade flapping and chord-wise bending. Torsional twist of the rotor blade was modelled with the aid of finite element method (FEM), and blade transverse bending could also be modelled in FEM. The model can switch between using a full FEM model for bending and torsion, or a FEM model for torsion and simple blade teeter, depending on the complexity that the user requires. The AMRA model was verified against experimental data obtained during a CAA sponsored flight test programme of the G-UNIV autogyro. Published results of modal analysis of helicopter rotor blades and other data published in open literature were used to validate the FEM model of the rotor blade. The first torsional natural frequency of the ’McCutcheon’ rotor blades was measured with the aid of high-speed camera and used for validation of the FEM model of blade torsional twist. As a further verification of the modelling method, Aérospatiale Puma helicopter rotor blade data were compared on a Southwell plot showing comparison between experimental results and AMRA estimation. The aeromechanical behaviour of the rotor during both axial flight and forward flight in autorotation was investigated. A significant part of the research was focused on investigation of the effect of different values of torsional and flexural stiffness, and the relative positions of blade <b>shear</b> centre/elastic <b>axis</b> and centre of mass of the blade on stability during the autorotation. The results obtained with the aid of the model demonstrate the interesting, and unique, characteristics of the autorotative regime - with instabilities possible in bending and torsion, but also in rotorspeed. Coupled rotor speed/flap/twist oscillations (flutter and divergence) occur if the torsional stiffness of the blade is lower than a critical value, or if the blade centre of mass is significantly aft of the blade twisting axis, {{as is the case in}} helicopter pitch-flap flutter. The instability shown here, however, is specific to the autogyro, or autorotating rotor, as it is coupled with rotorspeed, and so differs from both helicopter rotor flutter and fixed-wing flutter. The coupling with rotorspeed allows a combined flutter and divergence instability, where the rotor begins to flutter in rotorspeed, teeter angle and torsional twist and, once the rotorspeed had dropped below a critical value, then moves into divergence in flap and rotorspeed. It was found that the aeroelastic behaviour of a rotor in autorotation is significantly affected by the strong coupling of blade bending stiffness and teeter angle with rotorspeed, and the strong coupling between blade aeroelastic twist and rotor torque. </p...|$|R
