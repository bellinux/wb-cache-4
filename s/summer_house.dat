The bath house is ruined, but the two-storey <b>summer</b> <b>house</b> survives intact. It comprises a groin-vaulted lower room, with an upper chamber, containing the only surviving example of the castle’s carved-oak wall panelling.

Saxby attempts to kill Bond outside the <b>summer</b> <b>house,</b> but is fatally shot during the ensuring gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case.

With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.|$|E

5|$|Kingswear Castle is an {{artillery}} fort, built to protect Dartmouth harbour in Devon, England.

By the end of the 16th century, however, improvements in the range of artillery weapons had reduced the utility of the castle. It took part in the English Civil War and continued to be armed until the early 18th century, but fell into ruin. Restored as a <b>summer</b> <b>house</b> in 1855, in the 21st century it is managed by the Landmark Trust as a holiday let.|$|E
5|$|My father... was {{the richest}} man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a <b>summer</b> <b>house</b> in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E
