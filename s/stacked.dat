50|$|<b>Stacks</b> are the {{underlying}} structure of algebraic <b>stacks</b> (also called Artin <b>stacks)</b> and Deligne-Mumford <b>stacks,</b> which generalize schemes and algebraic spaces {{and which are}} particularly useful in studying moduli spaces. There are inclusions: schemes ⊆ algebraic spaces ⊆ Deligne-Mumford <b>stacks</b> ⊆ algebraic <b>stacks</b> (Artin <b>stacks)</b> ⊆ <b>stacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Stack</b> {{pointers}} may {{point to}} the origin of a <b>stack</b> or to a limited range of addresses either above or below the origin (depending on {{the direction in which}} the <b>stack</b> grows); however, the <b>stack</b> pointer cannot cross the origin of the <b>stack.</b> In other words, if the origin of the <b>stack</b> is at address 1000 and the <b>stack</b> grows downwards (towards addresses 999, 998, and so on), the <b>stack</b> pointer must never be incremented beyond 1000 (to 1001, 1002, etc.). If a pop operation on the <b>stack</b> causes the <b>stack</b> pointer to move past the origin of the <b>stack,</b> a <b>stack</b> underflow occurs. If a push operation causes the <b>stack</b> pointer to increment or decrement beyond the maximum extent of the <b>stack,</b> a <b>stack</b> overflow occurs.|$|R
50|$|The {{notion is}} of {{fundamental}} {{importance in the}} study of stacks: a <b>stack</b> that arises in nature is often either a quotient <b>stack</b> itself or admits a stratification by quotient <b>stacks</b> (e.g., a Deligne-Mumford <b>stack.)</b> A quotient <b>stack</b> is also used to construct other <b>stacks</b> like classifying <b>stacks</b> or toric <b>stacks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Charcoal {{can be made}} by slow {{pyrolysis}} of wood by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln.

5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two <b>stacked</b> forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the <b>stacked</b> structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site-specific binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E
50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current <b>stack</b> and generates the next state, the <b>stacks</b> to be pushed and popped onto the embedded <b>stack,</b> the pushing and popping of the current <b>stack,</b> and the <b>stacks</b> to be considered the current <b>stacks</b> in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded <b>stack</b> is pushed and popped, the current <b>stack</b> is optionally pushed back onto the embedded <b>stack,</b> and any other <b>stacks</b> one would like are pushed on top of that, with the last <b>stack</b> being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, <b>stacks</b> can be pushed both {{above and below the}} current <b>stack.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, a call <b>stack</b> is a <b>stack</b> {{data structure}} that stores {{information about the}} active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of <b>stack</b> {{is also known as}} an execution <b>stack,</b> program <b>stack,</b> control <b>stack,</b> run-time <b>stack,</b> or machine <b>stack,</b> and is often shortened to just [...] "the stack". Although maintenance of the call <b>stack</b> is important for the proper functioning of most software, the details are normally hidden and automatic in high-level programming languages. Many computer instruction sets provide special instructions for manipulating <b>stacks.</b>|$|R

5|$|In Birkenau, Vrba had {{encountered}} an acquaintance from Trnava, Alfréd Wetzler (prisoner no.29162), {{who was working}} in the mortuary.

5|$|In {{junctions}} with symmetrical sequences, the branchpoint is {{mobile and}} can migrate {{in a random}} walk process. The rate of branch migration varies dramatically with ion concentration, with single-step times increasing from 0.3−0.4 ms with no ions to 270−300 ms with 10 mM Mg2+. The change in rate is correlated {{with the formation of}} the <b>stacked</b> versus the unstacked structures.|$|E
5000|$|In automata theory, a nested <b>stack</b> {{automaton}} is {{a finite}} automaton {{that can make}} use of a <b>stack</b> containing data which can be additional <b>stacks.</b> [...] Like a <b>stack</b> automaton, a nested <b>stack</b> automaton may step up or down in the <b>stack,</b> and read the current symbol; in addition, it may at any place create a new <b>stack,</b> operate on that one, eventually destroy it, and continue operating on the old <b>stack.</b> This way, <b>stacks</b> can be nested recursively to an arbitrary depth; however, the automaton always operates on the innermost <b>stack</b> only.|$|R

5|$|Silicon carbide {{exists in}} about 250 {{crystalline}} forms. The polymorphism of SiC {{is characterized by}} a large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes.

5|$|The two {{possible}} <b>stacked</b> forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are <b>stacked</b> with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E

Any mobile <b>stack</b> of height n (with n > 0) can be moved (in a straight line) {{in any one of}} the 6 directions by exactly n spaces by the player controlling it, if it lands on another <b>stack.</b> Jumping over empty spaces is allowed, as long as the tower does not land on an empty space. Single DVONN pieces can not be moved, but they can be once {{they are part of a}} <b>stack.</b> After each move all <b>stacks</b> which are not connected via a chain of neighboring <b>stacks</b> to any <b>stack</b> containing a DVONN piece are removed from the board.|$|R
