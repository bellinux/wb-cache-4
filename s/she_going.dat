500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Nich Maragos and David Smith of 1UP.com ranked Ibuki as {{the sixth}} overall best ninja {{character}} in video games, calling her [...] "{{one of the}} coolest-looking characters" [...] in Street Fighter III but [...] "also {{one of the least}} capable in competition." [...] That same year, Aubrey Sitterson of UGO featured her on a list of the 25 [...] "foxiest fighting females to ever be pixelated" [...] and commented that Ibuki is [...] "not only super-hot, but she's also a ninja, which is like a 'chocolate in my peanut butter' situation." [...] UGO's Paul Furfari further stated that she [...] "set the new standard in female fighters," [...] adding, [...] "forget Chun-Li". GameZone included the [...] "amazing" [...] Ibuki in their 2011 list of [...] "best video game ninjas" [...] and stated: [...] "We’re glad she’s still a staple in this series to this very day – but when is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to come over to Marvel vs. Capcom territory?" [...] Márcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's Game Hall placed her at tenth spot of his 2014 list of top kunoichi characters in games, opining that she is [...] "far from having such status as Chun-Li, but has her charm, especially if you like Japanese schoolgirls." [...] Joe Pring from WhatCulture.com placed Ibuki at 19th spot on his 2015 list of the greatest female fighting game characters of all time: [...] "Ninja's are always cool, but Ibuki takes that awesome factor to a whole new level." [...] In 2016, Steven Hanson from Destructoid described her as [...] "everybody's favorite schoolgirl ninja." [...] A poll for the most erotic girl in the history of fighting games conducted by Japanese web portal Goo had Ibuki and Ayane, a schoolgirl female ninja from Dead or Alive, share the 11th/12th place (out of 50 contesters) in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|In Midnight Frolic of 1919, Dolores {{played the}} part of The White Peacock in the Tropical Birds number. She wore a [...] high peacock costume {{designed}} by Pascaud of Paris which Marjorie Farnsworth described as [...] "one of the loveliest costumes ever seen on Broadway". According to one reviewer, {{a member of the}} audience asked another, [...] "Is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to dance?" [...] to which the reply came, [...] "A woman who can stand and walk like that doesn't have to dance." [...] The idea of a peacock costume was not new as Anna Held had worn one in Follow Me in 1916 but it was Dolores who made it her own. Gertrude Hoffmann wore a similar costume in 1920.|$|E
2500|$|JR is {{eventually}} informed of Babe's one-night stand with Josh {{by her father}} (David Hayward). Not believing it, even when Josh confirms the encounter, viewers saw JR try {{to move on with}} his life and be happy with Babe. Once his suspicion gets the better of him, however, he confronts Babe about the matter. Babe tells the truth, and, in a dramatic fashion, JR later throws himself out a two-story window while drunk. While recovering, he insists that he no longer loves Babe. To add further conflict, Babe is written as thoroughly determined to win JR back; she undermines his wishes not to live with her. [...] "Babe is at the Chandler mansion. JR is home from the hospital and Babe isn't letting up," [...] said Havins. [...] "She's very dedicated to getting through to him. She's not saying, 'Let's get back together and forget anything ever happened.' It's more like, 'Let's try to move forward.' They aren't having an 'I love you' moment or anything like that, but she breaks the ice a little bit." [...] In addition, Babe's refusal to let JR go is happening during a serial killer arc, where Babe's life is in danger and one of her good friends (Erin Lavery) has just been murdered by the killer. In a moment where Babe confides to JR about this, viewers again witnessed the couple's star-crossed theme. [...] "He's sleeping and she is crying at his bedside and says, 'I need you so much.' Not only is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> through this, but she doesn't have her rock and best friend to lean on," [...] stated Havins. [...] "It's a lonely place to be. He opens his eyes and almost makes the move to connect — but then he doesn't." ...|$|E

[...] "And with that goes learning the independence of what <b>she's</b> <b>going</b> to do — with or without a relationship.

Furthermore, she wrote, [...] "The song seems like it's taking the message from her {{previously}} released track, 'Alive,' and giving it a boost. Instead of just surviving, <b>she's</b> <b>going</b> to prove to people that <b>she's</b> <b>going</b> to succeed, and <b>she's</b> <b>going</b> to look good doing it." [...] Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called the song [...] "triumphant", with a [...] "fist-pumping, wall-smashing" [...] chorus. Stereogum's Tom Breiham, who wrote about the song after its debut but before This Is Acting release, guessed that Sia wrote [...] "Unstoppable" [...] with a recording artist like Katy Perry in mind.
