5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} signal house, which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. The roof is made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and <b>steel</b> <b>base,</b> a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|E
5|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>base</b> metal is iron, {{which is}} able to take on two {{crystalline}} forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one {{at the center of}} each of the six faces of the cube.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first step}} towards the {{electric}} piano was by Harold Rhodes who developed various prototypes using parts from B-17 aircraft {{that were being}} scrapped. [...] Harold received a medal since the resulting keyboard was used as therapy for people rehabilitating from injuries from WW2. (It is small enough to set on a stand over a patient's bed in a hospital, looking something like a miniature grand piano in shape.) Instructions were made and people built this [...] "pre-piano" [...] which amplifies the signals generated in a pickup from the vibration of Stainless Steel rods tapered near the <b>steel</b> <b>base</b> they are driven into holes in. Piano type wooden hammers are used to strike them. It was a three octave (E to F for 38 notes) instrument. A tube amplifier drove a speaker pointing out the bottom.|$|E
2500|$|Examples of {{contemporary}} uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants {{or on the}} inside of engagement- and wedding rings to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy. [...] Another application of modern engraving is found in the printing industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto rotogravure cylinders, typically a <b>steel</b> <b>base</b> with a copper layer of about 0.1mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed printing presses. [...] Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.|$|E

2500|$|The American-style cabinet saws {{generally}} {{follow the}} model of the Delta Unisaw, a design that has evolved since 1939. Saws of this general type are made in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, and China. These saws are characterized by a cast iron top on a full-length <b>steel</b> <b>base,</b> square in section, with radiused corners. Two 3/8" [...] deep by 3/4" [...] wide miter slots are located parallel to the blade, one {{to the left of the}} blade and one to the right. The most common type of rip fence mounted to this type of saw is characterized by the standard model made by Biesemeyer (now a subsidiary of Delta). It has a sturdy, steel T-type fence mounted to a steel rail at the front of the saw. It has replaceable laminate faces. American cabinet saws are normally designed to accept a [...] " [...] wide stacked dado blade in addition to a standard saw blade. The most common size of blade is 10" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of [...] ", but 12" [...] or 14" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of 1" [...] are found in commercial/industrial sites. American saws normally include an anti-kickback device that incorporates a splitter, toothed anti-kickback pawls and a clear plastic blade cover. American style saws have an easily replaceable insert around the blade in the table top. This allows the use of zero-clearance inserts, which greatly reduce tear out on the bottom of the workpiece. It is common for this type of saw to be equipped with a table extension that increases ripping capacity for sheet goods to 50". The saw blade can tilt to either the left side or right side of the saw, depending on {{the model of}} saw. The original Delta Unisaw and early cabinet saws based on it were all right-tilt units while newer Delta Unisaws and many competitive cabinet saws made after 2000 are left-tilt saws. The switch to left-tilt design is due to a lower perceived propensity for the cut piece to become trapped between the rip fence and blade and kick back when the blade tilts away from the rip fence (left tilt saw) versus towards the rip fence (right tilt saw.) While conceptually simple in design, these saws are highly evolved and are capable of efficient, high volume, precision work.|$|E
