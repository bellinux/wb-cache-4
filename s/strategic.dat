5|$|Hansell {{played a}} key and largely unsung role in the <b>strategic</b> {{planning}} of air operations by the United States. This included drafting both the <b>strategic</b> air war plans (AWPD-1 and AWPD-42) and the plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive in Europe; obtaining a base {{of operations for the}} B-29 Superfortress in the Mariana Islands; and devising the command structure of the Twentieth Air Force, the first global <b>strategic</b> air force and forerunner of the <b>Strategic</b> Air Command. He made precision air attack, as both the most humane and effective means of achieving military success, a lifelong personal crusade that eventually became the key tenet of American airpower employment.|$|E

This paper defines two alternative organizational modes (corporate-based/network-based) that serve to conceptualize diversity in <b>strategics</b> of leadership, production, and exchange. Collective mechanisms of integration arc central to corporate <b>strategics,</b> while network-based organization is heavily rooted in the personal connections and material accumulations of individuals.

5|$|<b>Strategic</b> management: Due to the {{increasing}} importance of design as a differentiator and its supporting role in brand equity, design management deals with <b>strategic</b> design issues and supports the <b>strategic</b> direction of the business or enterprise. The debate on design thinking suggests the integration of design thinking into <b>strategic</b> management. Design thinking and <b>strategic</b> thinking have some commonalities in their characteristics, both are synthetic, adductive, hypothesis-driven, opportunistic, dialectical, enquiring and value-driven.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} greening—strategic, quasi-strategic, or tactical—dictates what {{activities}} should be undertaken by a company. <b>Strategic</b> greening {{in one area}} {{may or may not}} be leveraged effectively in others.

So although <b>strategic</b> greening is not necessarily strategically integrated into all marketing activities, it is nevertheless <b>strategic</b> in the product area.|$|E

5|$|For the Germans, {{the battle}} was the final <b>strategic</b> {{offensive}} {{that they were able}} to launch on the Eastern Front. As the Allied invasion of Sicily began Adolf Hitler was forced to divert troops training in France to meet the Allied threats in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a <b>strategic</b> reserve for the Eastern Front. Germany's extensive loss of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the <b>strategic</b> initiative for the remainder of the war.|$|E
5|$|From a <b>strategic</b> {{point of}} view, battle was not {{necessary}} for either side; the main <b>strategic</b> theatre was mainland Greece itself. Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in a}} clear <b>strategic</b> advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any <b>strategic</b> considerations. The Persians, seeing little to gain in battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians, sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the Air War College. He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The <b>Strategic</b> Air War Against Japan (1980), and <b>Strategic</b> Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the <b>Strategic</b> Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E

40|$|Background: Clinical {{placement}} is {{an essential}} component of training in health sciences because it is where theory and practice interface. Objective: To explore experiences of health sciences students during clinical placement in terms of supervision, challenges and coping <b>strategics.</b> Design: It was a cross sectional survey. Setting: University ofZimbabwe, College of 1 lealth Sciences. Participants: 179 multidisciplinary health science students. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. Ethical clearance was obtained. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Main Outcome Measures: These were perceptions of students with regard to supervision, challenges faced during clinical placement and coping <b>strategics</b> used. Results: 179 participants responded to the questionnaires. Participants enjoyed linking theory to practice. Perceptions on supervision were both positive and negative. Inadequate supervision and inappropriate behaviours by supervisors were some of the challenges faced. Almost 89 % used stress-relieving strategies such as focusing on why they were doing the clinical placement and the importance of successful completion. Ninety-one per cent had never used cannabis/mbanje but 41 % had engaged in sexual activity to cope with challenges. Conclusion: This study found that the perceptions of health sciences students about supervision clinical placement, challenges faced and the coping <b>strategics</b> arc almost the same as those found elsewhere. It is therefore important to plan clinical placement with the involvement of clinical educators. Recommendations:. Supervisors' workshops should be held to create a forum to discuss clinical placement issues. Follow-up of students by academics is recommended. Students should be empowered to cope with challenges...|$|R
