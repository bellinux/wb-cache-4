5|$|The film {{opens with}} a sexually charged, flirtatious online chat between 14-year-old Hayley Stark and Jeff Kohlver, a 32-year-old photographer. Jeff and Hayley meet at a coffeehouse, and he takes her back to his house. Hayley makes them both <b>screwdrivers</b> and asks him to take photographs. Before he can, Jeff gets dizzy, his vision blurs, and he {{falls to the floor}} unconscious.|$|E

25|$|The Doctor keeps framed {{pictures}} of his wife, River Song, and granddaughter, Susan Foreman, on his desk, along {{with a collection of}} his sonic <b>screwdrivers</b> from both the classic and revival series.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 {{the company}} {{manufactured}} {{a new product}} {{in the form of}} the Eleventh Doctor's Sonic <b>Screwdriver,</b> later in 2013 the Tenth Doctor's Sonic <b>Screwdriver</b> was released. A 3D Scan was taken of David Tennant's Sonic <b>Screwdriver</b> (which is the last remaining screen used prop from that series) to create the body of the Tenth Doctor's Sonic <b>Screwdriver.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1976, Western Forge shipped its 100 millionth Craftsman <b>screwdriver.</b> In 2008, {{the company}} {{produced}} its billionth <b>screwdriver</b> overall.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "The Sound of Drums", the Master {{reveals his}} laser <b>screwdriver.</b> Unlike the sonic <b>screwdriver,</b> {{it is used}} as a weapon that can kill as well as artificially age its target, using {{technology}} developed by Lazarus Laboratories originally seen in [...] "The Lazarus Experiment". It includes isomorphic controls, allowing only the Master to use the device. The design of the prop was meant to imply that the Master constructed it on Earth, and it was deliberately made larger than the Doctor's sonic <b>screwdriver.</b> Like the Doctor's <b>screwdriver</b> and Sarah Jane's lipstick, the Master's laser <b>screwdriver</b> was also created as a children's toy with sound effects. The laser <b>screwdriver</b> reappears in The Doctor Falls when the Master encounters his later female incarnation, Missy. Again, his <b>screwdriver</b> acts as a weapon, the Master using it to destroy a Cyberman and to kill Missy, shooting her in the back after she stabbed him in the back.|$|R
25|$|After the incident, rumors {{spread that}} Goetz had been {{threatened}} with sharpened <b>screwdrivers.</b> This rumor was published as fact by some newspapers including The New York Times; however, neither Goetz nor the men made any such claim. During his subsequent {{statement to the}} police, Goetz expressed a belief {{that none of the}} young men had been armed. Paramedics and police did find a total of three <b>screwdrivers</b> on two of the men; when Canty testified at Goetz's criminal trial, he said they were to be used to break into video arcade change boxes and not as weapons.|$|E
25|$|The Phillips-head screw is a {{crosshead}} screw design lying in its self-centering property, useful on automated production lines that use power <b>screwdrivers.</b> The Phillips-head screw was invented and patented by Henry F. Phillips in 1936.|$|E
25|$|Law 1: A tool {{must not}} be unsafe to use. Hammers have handles and <b>screwdrivers</b> have hilts to help {{increase}} grip. It is of course possible {{for a person to}} injure himself with one of these tools, but that injury would only be due to his incompetence, not the design of the tool.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>screwdriver</b> tips are magnetic, so {{that the}} screw (unless non-magnetic) remains {{attached}} to the <b>screwdriver</b> without requiring external force. This is particularly useful in small screws, which are otherwise difficult to handle. Many <b>screwdriver</b> designs have a handle with detachable tip (the part of the <b>screwdriver</b> that engages the screw), called bits as with drill bits. This provides a set of one handle and several bits that can drive a variety of screw sizes and types.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Magician's Apprentice" [...] {{shows that}} the sonic <b>screwdriver</b> can create [...] "an {{acoustic}} corridor" [...] so that the Twelfth Doctor can communicate with a boy trapped in an extraterrestrial mine field. [...] However, when the Doctor discovers that the boy is actually a young Davros, he abandons the boy, leaving the <b>screwdriver</b> behind, though it is revealed that he did save young Davros after all. Davros is shown to have kept the <b>screwdriver</b> in his possession ever since, and the Doctor tells Clara {{that he no longer}} has a <b>screwdriver.</b> By that time, the <b>screwdriver</b> had been withered and damaged by time and was seemingly useless.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>screwdriver</b> is {{classified}} by its tip, which is shaped {{to fit the}} driving surfaces—slots, grooves, recesses, etc.—on the corresponding screw head. Proper use requires that the <b>screwdriver's</b> tip engage {{the head of a}} screw of the same size and type designation as the <b>screwdriver</b> tip. <b>Screwdriver</b> tips are available {{in a wide variety of}} types and sizes (List of screw drives). The two most common are the simple 'blade'-type for slotted screws, and Phillips®, generically referred to as [...] "cross-recess".|$|R
25|$|It {{featured}} {{regularly in}} season 16 during the Key to Time saga. The Doctor's Time Lady companion Romana constructed a sonic screwdriver {{of her own}} similar to the Doctor's. It is depicted as being smaller and sleeker than the Doctor's, and he was sufficiently impressed with her design that he attempted to swap <b>screwdrivers</b> with her in Horns of Nimon. By season 18, both script editor Christopher H Bidmead and producer John Nathan-Turner were eager to downplay the device as much as possible.|$|E
25|$|Polishing {{operations}} for {{items such as}} chisels, hammers, <b>screwdrivers,</b> wrenches, etc., are given a fine finish but not plated. In order to achieve this finish four operations are required: roughing, dry fining, greasing, and coloring. Note that roughing is usually done on a solid grinding wheel and for an extra fine polish the greasing operation may be broken up into two operations: rough greasing and fine greasing. However, for inexpensive items money is saved by only performing the first two operations.|$|E
25|$|Air {{components}} are officially non-user-replaceable, though third-parties do sell upgrade kits for the SSDs. The flash memory and battery are enclosed within the casing, with RAM soldered onto the motherboard. The flash memory, difficult to access, has a 128MB cache and a mSATA connection (updated to a proprietary PCIe interface) to the motherboard. The battery {{can be replaced}} using normal <b>screwdrivers,</b> though {{it is unclear whether}} this process does void warranty. As part of the warranty service, Apple can replace the battery for a fee.|$|E

40|$|Penetrating heart {{injuries}} cause {{wounds in}} the cardiac chambers. Most {{of them are}} due to gunshot or stabbing by knives. <b>Screwdriver</b> is an uncommon weapon. Authors report a case of stab wound by <b>screwdriver,</b> treated at cardiovascular center in Dakar. This is a 16 -year-old boy who experienced physical aggression. He was assaulted with a <b>screwdriver</b> and had stab wound on the anterior wall of the chest. Physical examination showed a <b>screwdriver</b> penetrating the sternum bone over a right angle. He had a mild pericardial blood effusion and a right ventricle wound 5 [*]mm in diameter with transection of the right coronary vein. The <b>screwdriver</b> was removed without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the ventricle wound repaired by direct suture of stitches reinforced with Teflon pledgets. The right coronary artery was ligated. Postoperative period was free of events. <b>Screwdriver</b> is uncommonly used as a weapon. It is a dangerous device because of its rigid structure and narrow tip...|$|R
25|$|On 2 April 2010 he {{was stopped}} by police in West Bridgford, Nottingham {{following}} a party and was arrested after providing a positive breath test. He was charged in June, {{to appear in court}} in August, and initially told court that {{he was on his way}} to purchase <b>screwdrivers</b> in order to rescue his cat from under the floorboards. Due to his cricketing commitments, the trial had several adjournments before he was cleared in February 2011, on the grounds that the blood sample could not be used as evidence.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{inconsistency}} as {{to whether}} the Doctor can recognise his own future incarnations. In the original series, the Doctors usually have no difficulty recognising one another (in The Three Doctors, the First, Second, and Third Doctors all know one another on sight. However, in The Five Doctors, the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced by the Fifth as his fourth regeneration. In Time Crash, after the TARDIS is at different points in its own timeline merge due to downed shields, the Fifth Doctor spends much of the mini-episode believing that the Tenth was merely a fan who had somehow gotten into his TARDIS, having somehow altered the 'desktop theme'; the Tenth Doctor constantly tries to convince his younger self that he is his future self, only doing so by using a predestination paradox to cancel out a universe-destroying black hole with a supernova by blowing up the TARDIS. When the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor meet each other in The Day Of The Doctor, the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their respective sonic <b>screwdrivers.</b> The War Doctor on the other hand is initially completely oblivious to meet two of his future regenerations (initially mistaking them for future companions), again being convinced by their sonic <b>screwdrivers.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 24 September 1980, Bonham {{was picked}} up by Led Zeppelin {{assistant}} Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios for a tour of North America, to begin 17 October in Montreal, Quebec – the band's first since 1977. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he drank four quadruple vodka <b>Screwdrivers</b> (16 shots between 400–560 ml, also equivalent to 9-13 American standard drinks). He then continued to drink heavily after arriving at rehearsals. The band stopped rehearsing late in the evening and then went to Page's house, the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight on Thursday, 25 September, Bonham fell asleep; someone took him to bed and placed him on his side. Led Zeppelin tour manager Benji LeFevre and John Paul Jones found him unresponsive the next afternoon. Bonham was later pronounced dead at 32 years old.|$|E

2500|$|The sonic <b>screwdriver</b> {{is unable}} to open a [...] "deadlock seal", used as a plot device to prevent an easy solution. Russell T Davies once {{mentioned}} {{that he would never}} make the sonic <b>screwdriver</b> the solution to an episode. In [...] "Silence in the Library", while trying to open a wooden door, the Doctor tells Donna that the sonic <b>screwdriver</b> won't work because the door is made of wood, a fact later restated in [...] "The Hungry Earth"; when Rory complains about this, the Doctor counters to not [...] "diss the sonic." [...] The sonic <b>screwdriver's</b> inability to work on wood is clarified in [...] "In the Forest of the Night", when the Doctor states that the sonic <b>screwdriver</b> works by manipulating the moving parts in various machinery: since plant tissue lacks said moving parts, it is unaffected by the sonic <b>screwdriver</b> (though this claim is slightly inconsistent with its visible ability to repair human tissue). In [...] "The Parting of the Ways", the Doctor mentions that when Emergency Program One was activated, the sonic <b>screwdriver</b> would receive a signal from the TARDIS. In [...] "Forest of the Dead", he claims that a few hair-dryers can interfere with the device, though he states that he is [...] "working on that".|$|R
2500|$|The Wand Company {{released}} a universal remote control styled on the Eleventh Doctor's sonic <b>screwdriver</b> on the 3rd August 2012.

500|$|In 2006, Children's BBC {{expressed}} an interest in producing a Doctor Who spin-off. Their initial idea was [...] "a drama based on the idea of a young Doctor Who", but Russell T Davies vetoed this. [...] "Somehow, the idea of a fourteen year old Doctor, on Gallifrey inventing sonic <b>screwdrivers,</b> takes away from the mystery and intrigue of who he is and where he came from," [...] said Davies. He suggested instead a series based on the Doctor's former companion Sarah Jane Smith.|$|E
500|$|Tennant {{had been}} offered the role when he was {{watching}} a pre-transmission copy of Doctor Who with Davies and Gardner. Tennant initially believed the offer was a joke, but after he realised they were serious, he accepted the role and made his first appearance in the dénouement of [...] "The Parting of the Ways", the final episode of the first series. Doctor Who continued {{to be one of}} BBC's flagship programmes throughout Davies' tenure, and resulted in record sales of the show's official magazine, an increase in spin-off novels, and the launch of the children's magazine Doctor Who Adventures and toy sonic <b>screwdrivers</b> and Daleks. The show's popularity ultimately led to a resurgence in family-orientated Saturday night drama; the ITV science-fiction series Primeval and the BBC historical dramas Robin Hood and Merlin were specifically designed for an early Saturday evening timeslot. Davies was also approached by the BBC to produce several spin-off series, eventually creating two: Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures.|$|E

50|$|The {{test light}} is an {{electric}} lamp connected {{with one or}} two insulated wire leads. Often, it {{takes the form of a}} <b>screwdriver</b> with the lamp connected between the tip of the <b>screwdriver</b> and a single lead that projects out the back of the <b>screwdriver.</b> By connecting the flying lead to an earth (ground) reference and touching the <b>screwdriver</b> tip to various points in the circuit, the presence or absence of voltage at each point can be determined, allowing simple faults to be detected and traced to their root cause. For higher voltages, a statiscope consisting of a neon glow tube mounted on a long insulating handle can be used to detect AC voltages of 2000 volts or more.|$|R
