5|$|Flemish {{metallurgist}} and alchemist P. M. de Respour {{reported that}} he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, Étienne François Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted. In Britain, John Lane is said to have carried out experiments to <b>smelt</b> zinc, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1890s, the lead-silver <b>smelting</b> {{industry}} {{continued to}} struggle. There {{were too many}} smelters and too few lead-silver ore reserves nationally. Eventually, the independent minded <b>smelting</b> owners were forced to merge, creating in 1899 a large entity called the American <b>Smelting</b> & Refining Company (today known as ASARCO). At its formation, American <b>Smelting</b> owned 2/3 of the <b>smelting</b> trusts in the nation, making them a critical player in the ore and mining industry. In 1901, the Guggenheims <b>smelting</b> and refining assets were added to American <b>Smelting.</b> At that time, the Guggenheims obtained a majority of American <b>Smelting</b> shares and began their dominance of the company.|$|R

5|$|The ore {{from the}} Marcellus varied in thickness, {{becoming}} unworkably thin, and even disappearing altogether in places between the workable beds. The {{quality of the}} ore also varied, {{and it was not}} always profitable to <b>smelt,</b> as several furnaces built near iron ore mines in the Marcellus were abandoned before the ore and timber resources used to fuel them became scarce.|$|E
5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they <b>smelt</b> and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set up {{the first of several}} iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and <b>smelt</b> ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest iron content) was exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These allowed it to access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1623 as {{the village of}} Nytva with three households. In 1756, a copper <b>smelting</b> plant was built in Nytva. In 1768, the plant switched from <b>smelting</b> of copper to <b>smelting</b> of cast iron. Within twenty years, cast iron <b>smelting</b> also stopped and the plant become an ironworks.|$|R
25|$|The blowing house {{method of}} <b>smelting</b> tin was {{probably}} introduced {{early in the}} 14th century to replace the earliest method of <b>smelting</b> {{which had to be}} done in two stages – a first <b>smelting</b> probably took place near to the tinworks and the roughly <b>smelted</b> metal was taken to a stannary town to be <b>smelted</b> again to produce the final refined product. Each of these smeltings was taxed separately until 1303 when they were replaced by a single tax on the finished product. It is likely that this tax change was due to the improved <b>smelting</b> process provided by the blowing houses.|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{the heating}} {{behaviour}} of composite pellets <b>smelted</b> in single-vessel bath <b>smelting</b> reactors {{is complicated by}} simultaneous multiple reactions within the pellets {{and a lack of}} knowledge of relevant heat-transfer data. Limited heat-transfer analysis has been performed for the <b>smelting</b> of composite organic and ferrous wastes. The <b>smelting</b> process was modelled in two stages [...] -a falling-pellet-gas region and an in-slag <b>smelting</b> region. The temperature profile generated within the composite pellet in the falling-pellet–gas region was determined by use of an exact solution for transient heating and a computer program was written to solve two-phase, moving-boundary, heat-transfer equations to determine the <b>smelting</b> time in the in-slag <b>smelting</b> region. Modelling established that significant volumes of the composite pellet are heated to reaction temperatures in the falling-pellet–gas region and that formation of a slag immersion crust is unlikely. <b>Smelting</b> times predicted by the heat-transfer model were validated experimentally...|$|R
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and <b>smelt</b> mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle State Park has two {{distinct}} fishing zones. Lake Erie {{is home to}} perch, trout, walleye, bass, and steelhead.

Trout fishing is also allowed in the two waterworks basins, which are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Hunting is prohibited at Presque Isle State Park with the exception of controlled duck and goose hunting seasons in designated blinds.|$|E
5|$|The Beaker culture arrived around 2,500BC, {{introducing}} {{drinking and}} food vessels constructed from clay, {{as well as}} vessels used as reduction pots to <b>smelt</b> copper ores. It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs, advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields), {{as well as the}} production of more effective weapons.|$|E

40|$|Twenty {{heavy metals}} {{in the ground}} surface dust and {{agricultural}} soil in three different areas, i. e., a former artisanal zinc <b>smelting</b> area, a medium-scale zinc <b>smelting</b> area, and a control area, in Guizhou province southwest China, were investigated to reveal the pollution status of these heavy metals. The {{results showed that the}} pollution was most serious in the artisanal zinc <b>smelting</b> area, followed by the medium-scale zinc <b>smelting</b> area, while the control area was relatively clean. Zinc <b>smelting</b> activities had caused environmental contamination for elements such as Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Hg, In, Pb, Sb, Sn, Zn. Whereas, Co, Cr, Ga, Mo, Ni, Sc, Th, Tl, V were in the natural levels, hinting they were irrelevant to the zinc <b>smelting</b> activities. Concentrations of most heavy metals that come from the zinc <b>smelting</b> were obviously higher in the ground surface dust than that in the agricultural soil. And Cd, Pb, Zn, Ag were the four elements that affected by the zinc <b>smelting</b> activities most...|$|R
5|$|The first iron {{production}} {{started in}} the Middle Bronze Age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700BC. The Hittites established an empire in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. They {{appear to be the}} first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. The Hittites began to <b>smelt</b> iron between 1500 and 1200BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180BC. The subsequent period is called the Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow <b>smelt,</b> tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to produce their {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones {{are used to}} make pig iron bars and <b>smelt</b> it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|E
50|$|Ferrous and {{non-ferrous}} <b>smelting</b> processes produce different slags. The <b>smelting</b> {{of copper}} and lead in non-ferrous <b>smelting,</b> for instance, {{is designed to}} remove the iron and silica that often occurs with those ores, and separates them as iron-silicate-based slags. Slag from steel mills in ferrous <b>smelting,</b> on the other hand, is designed to minimize iron loss and so mainly contains oxides of calcium, silicon, magnesium, and aluminium. Any sandy component or quartz component of the original ore automatically carries through the <b>smelting</b> process as silicon dioxide.|$|R
50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, most ores were {{concentrated}} before <b>smelting.</b> <b>Smelting</b> was initially undertaken using sinter plants and blast furnaces, or with roasters and reverberatory furnaces. Roasting and reverberatory furnace <b>smelting</b> dominated primary copper production until the 1960s.|$|R

5|$|The Burnley {{board had}} planned {{a tour of}} Spain to take place {{during the summer of}} 1921 after the {{culmination}} of the league campaign. However, the trip had to be cancelled when the club received notice from the Spanish Football Federation that one of their intended opponents, Barcelona, had been suspended from all matches. Further tours of Norway and France were then arranged, but these also had to be abandoned after the Football Association refused to grant permission. At {{the end of the season}} five players were given free transfers by the club; Len <b>Smelt</b> and Frank Birchenough, who had both played for Burnley during the campaign, and three reserve players. Moreover, two players–Bert Freeman and George Thompson–were placed on the transfer list by the manager.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} from Narooma in {{southern}} New South Wales {{north to the}} Rocky River in Cape York, though it is uncommon in eastern Cape York. It lives in small, generally slow moving, streams to estuaries, as well as dune lagoons and salt marshes. It {{is also found in}} brackish and marine waters on some Queensland offshore islands such as Hinchinbrook Island, Lizard Island, Low Island and Dunk Island. It has been recorded as far as 300km (185mi) upstream in the Mary and Dawson Rivers in Queensland. Numbers can be prolific in some locations, such as the Mary River. Conversely it is uncommon in the Elliott and Kolan Rivers. Fish species it is commonly found with include Marjorie's hardyhead (Craterocephalus marjoriae), crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi), Australian <b>smelt</b> (Retropinna semoni) and western carp gudgeon (Hypseleotris klunzingeri).|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the Burnley team {{remained}} unchanged from the previous campaign. Eight new players signed for the club, and eleven left during the season. New signings included goalkeeper Frank Birchenough from West Ham United and defender Bob McGrory from Dumbarton. Also brought in were George Richardson from non-league side Horden Athletic and Tom Brophy from St Helens Town. West Bromwich Albion's Len Moorwood was also signed in October 1920 to provide further goalkeeping backup. Attackers Richard Cragg, Billy Clarkson and Patrick Norris were among those who left the club in pre-season. Defender Tom Bamford, who had not played a match for Burnley since before the First World War thanks {{to the emergence of}} Len <b>Smelt,</b> also left the club and joined Rochdale in September 1920.|$|E

5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been <b>smelt</b> elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod is {{the apex}} aquatic {{predator}} in the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin, and will eat almost anything smaller than itself and anything in its way, including finned fishes such as smaller Murray cod, golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, western carp gudgeon, and Australian <b>smelt</b> and introduced fish such as carp, goldfish, and redfin (English perch), {{as well as}} crustaceans such as yabbies, freshwater shrimp, and Murray crayfish. Fish compose {{the majority of the}} diet of mature Murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats, and that Murray cod are apex predators in these habitats. Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, freshwater turtles, water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray cod are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.|$|E
