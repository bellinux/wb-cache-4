50|$|The African Yellow House Bat (Scotophilus dinganii) {{is larger}} than the Lesser Asiatic Yellow House Bat but smaller than the Giant Yellow House Bat. The average body length is 130 mm and the weight is about 27 grams. The African Yellow House Bat’s face looks similar to that of a dog. The wings can be shades of either olive, grey or red. The back is covered with soft, <b>short</b> <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> a hint of brown, and the abdomen is covered with bright yellow fur. The color of the interfemoral {{membrane}} is brown and transparent (Siyabona Africa Travel).|$|E
5000|$|G. bursarius [...] has <b>short</b> <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> brown {{to black}} {{coloration}} over {{the upper body}} and lighter brown or tan fur on the underparts. Whitish hairs cover {{the tops of the}} feet, while the short, tapered tail is nearly naked. Fossorial adaptations include small eyes, short, naked ears, and large fore feet with heavy claws. Zygomatic arches are widely flared, providing ample room for muscle attachment, although, unlike other pocket gophers, this species does not use the curved incisors to assist the feet in digging. The external cheek pouches, which distinguish this family from other mammals, can be turned inside-out for grooming purposes. They are used for carrying food up to 7 cm in length and have a forward opening.|$|E
50|$|The Indian wolf {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to the European wolf, but is smaller, more slightly built, and has <b>shorter</b> <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> little to no underfur. Like the Arabian wolf, it has <b>short,</b> thin <b>fur</b> in summer, though {{the hair on the}} back remains long even in summer, an adaptation thought to be against solar radiation. The fur is generally greyish-red to reddish-white with grey tones. The hairs are grizzled with black, particularly on the back, which sports a dark V-shaped patch around the shoulders. The limbs are paler than the body, and the underparts are almost completely white. Pups are born sooty-brown, with a milk-white patch on the chest that fades with age. Black specimens are rare, but have been recorded in India's Solapur district and two regions of Iran. In the latter country, the mutation was found to be naturally occurring, unlike in North American grey wolves, which have inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs.|$|R
50|$|Southern long-nosed bats are {{of average}} size for leaf-nosed bats, being {{intermediate}} in size between their close relatives, the greater and lesser long-nosed bats. They have <b>short,</b> greyish-brown <b>fur,</b> <b>with</b> a long, narrow snout, relatively short ears, and a small, triangular nose-leaf. The tongue {{is long and}} easily extended to lap up nectar, a task made easier {{by the presence of}} hook-like papillae on the tip.|$|R
50|$|The {{visual effects}} budget was around 7 or 8 million dollars, {{much lower than}} a feature film of the time. Tim Haines {{attributed}} this to solid planning. The fur coats and moving parts of mammals made the creatures in Beasts more challenging to animate than the scaly reptiles of Walking <b>with</b> Dinosaurs. <b>Short</b> <b>fur</b> was animated <b>with</b> tricks, and long shaggy coats (like the woolly mammoth's) <b>with</b> <b>fur</b> shaders.|$|R
5000|$|Marine otters are {{relatively}} small, and among otters, only the {{oriental small-clawed otter}} is smaller. However the latter species inhabits freshwater sites; thus the marine otter is the smallest exclusively marine mammal on Earth. Lengths range from 83 to 113 cm, not counting the tail of 30 to 36 cm. Weights can range from 3 to 5.8 kg. Their fur is dark brown {{on the back and}} light brown on belly. The guard hairs cover <b>short</b> insulating <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> a grayish color. The fur is coarser and tougher than in sea otters.|$|R
50|$|The giant genet has a {{yellowish}} white <b>short</b> {{and thick}} <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> numerous black spots. It is whitish {{on top of}} the muzzle and between the eyes. From behind the ears two dark bands run backwards, and a black stripe runs along the spine. Its long bushy tail has broad black and six narrower white rings and is black on the tip.|$|R
50|$|The grayish mouse opossum is {{an unusually}} small opossum, {{measuring}} 20 to 35 cm in total length, including an 11- to 16-cm (4.3- to 6.3-in) tail. Adults weigh from 38 to 60 g. The body {{is covered in}} <b>short,</b> soft <b>fur,</b> <b>with</b> a slightly woolly texture. As the common name suggests, the fur is pale to brownish grey in colour, fading to white or near-white on the under parts and legs. In addition, clearly visible rings of black hair occur around the eyes, and, on females, patches of orange fur in the groin region, sometimes extending to the thighs and up the midline almost to the throat.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{marsupial mole}} is small in size, {{with a head}} and body length varying from 121 to 159 mm, a tail length of 21-26 mm and a weight of 40-70 g. The body is covered <b>with</b> <b>short,</b> dense, silky <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> a pale cream to white color often tinted by the iron oxides from the soil which gives it a reddish chestnut brown tint. It has a light brownish pink nose and mouth and no vibrissae.|$|R
5000|$|Myotis fimbriatus is {{a species}} of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae.It is found only in China. Its also called the [...] "Fringed Long-Footed Myotis". The Fringed Long-Footed Myotis is {{described}} as having <b>short,</b> thick, brown <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> pale whitish <b>fur</b> ventrally. A captured female was measured with ears that were 14.4mm long, a forearm 42.2mm long, and weights 9.9 grams.Myotis fimbriatus is listed as being of Least Concern" [...] by the IUCN as of 2008. In 2000, Myotis fimbriatus was listed as being [...] "Lower Risk/Near Threatened" [...] (LR/nt).|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian {{water shrew}} (Neomys fodiens), {{known in the}} United Kingdom as the water shrew, is a {{relatively}} large shrew, up to 10 cm long, with a tail up to three-quarters as long again. It has <b>short,</b> dark <b>fur,</b> often <b>with</b> a few white tufts, a white belly, and a few stiff hairs around the feet and tail. It lives close to fresh water, hunting aquatic prey {{in the water and}} nearby. Its fur traps bubbles of air in the water which greatly aids its buoyancy, but requires it to anchor itself to remain underwater for more than the briefest of dives.|$|R
500|$|Standing 1ft 4 in (0.4m) tall, Pikachu {{were the}} first [...] "Electric-type" [...] Pokémon created, their design {{intended}} to revolve around the concept of electricity. They appear as Pika-like creatures that have <b>short,</b> yellow <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; a female Pikachu now has an indent {{at the end of}} its tail, giving it a heart-shaped appearance. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets. Within the context of the franchise, a Pikachu can transform, or [...] "evolve" [...] into a Raichu when exposed to a [...] "Thunderstone". In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named [...] "Pichu", which evolves into a Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer.|$|R
5000|$|Galanos {{was also}} {{famous for his}} {{exquisite}} furs. He used mainly mink, sable, lynx and broadtail and handled the furs imaginatively, {{as if they were}} fabric. He smocked and quilted the surfaces, nipped the waistlines and used drawstrings, ruffles and capelets to give a strong fashion slant to all that opulence. He often designed for Peter Dion, the furrier who made sure that the quality of the pelts and the workmanship supported the innovative design. At the top of the line were coats made of lynx bellies, so soft and fluffy they looked airborne. The short style was selling for $200,000, the long one - for $300,000. The fitted coat was a Galanos specialty, successful in almost any fur, including fox. As he did with his ready-to-wear, Galanos also made the hats and other accessories, which included <b>short</b> <b>fur</b> scarves <b>with</b> mink tails hanging from the ends. He showed his coats over stretch tights and bodysuits with satin surfaces. There were unexpected styles as well, like <b>fur</b> <b>shorts,</b> gathered down the sides. Many sleeves featured the smock quilting that became a Galanos signature. He also had a special feeling for broadtail, the tissue-thin <b>fur</b> <b>with</b> a sleek, elegant surface. But Galanos could also make soft mink coats look lean, willowy and graceful by the way he shaped the skins in the back or carved the hemline in a back-dipping curve. According to Bernardine Morris of the New York Times, Galanos' [...] "best design is a slender coat with the skins worked vertically through the bodice and horizontally for the skirt, an example of elegant proportioning." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Minskin is a {{breed of}} cat derived from {{crossing}} the Munchkin with the Sphynx. In 1998 Paul McSorley began {{the development of}} the Minskin in Boston, Massachusetts. Just as the Siamese has color restricted to the points/extremities, Paul McSorley envisioned a cat <b>with</b> <b>short</b> legs and <b>fur</b> restricted to the points (fur-points). To accomplish his goal, he crossed his already established Munchkin cats <b>with</b> <b>short</b> legs and <b>fur,</b> <b>with</b> 'fuzzy' Sphynx for the hairless characteristic where fur can occur on the extremities, making for a healthier immune system. He also used his International Award Winning Burmese cats and Devon Rex in the development of his Minskin breeding program. The first cat that met his goal was [...] "TRT I Am Minskin Hear Me Roar" [...] 'Rory' was born in July, 2000. By early 2005 about 50 cats meeting the Minskin vision existed and were registered by The International Cat Association. In 2008 the Minskin became recognized as a Preliminary New Breed and is currently in TICA's program that monitors the development of new breeds.|$|R

40|$|The African ice rat Otomys sloggetti robertsi {{is a small}} rodent {{confined}} to cold, alpine habitats. It does not hibernate and is poorly adapted physiologically to low temperatures. We predicted and showed that its fur is denser than its congeners from warmer habitats, but it had <b>shorter</b> <b>fur</b> than expected. Dense fur would provide insulation and piloerection of <b>short</b> <b>fur</b> would facilitate heat gain from solar radiation during sun basking. These traits, {{in addition to other}} behavioural and morphological traits, would assist O. s. robertsi in meeting its thermoregulatory requirements in response to low temperatures...|$|R
