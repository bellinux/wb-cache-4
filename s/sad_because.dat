25|$|In April 1947, he met Adela ("Eta"), {{one of the}} {{youngest}} of three daughters of Russian Jewish immigrants Isaac and Esther Jusid. They were married after only a few weeks of courtship. Adela was 11 years younger than Miguel. They had two daughters Mirta (b. 1948) and Liliana (b. 1952), and a miscarried son in between. Liliana was long resentful of the fact that her father was abroad when she was born, and didn't see her until she was four months old. She describes her father as a mixture of extremes: violent temper but compassionate and loving, selfish at times but also generous to a fault, jovial and bon vivant but also <b>sad</b> <b>because</b> of the terrible losses of the Holocaust.|$|E

500|$|During {{the filming}} of the episode, which took place before a studio {{audience}} at BBC Television Centre, Rowan Atkinson described sharing his character's dread of impending death and feeling a [...] "knot {{in the pit of}} my stomach", something that he had never experienced. Hugh Laurie said that filming was <b>sad</b> <b>because</b> [...] "even for comic effect, we were representing the deaths {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people". Regarding guest star Geoffrey Palmer, the producer John Lloyd said [...] " [...] probably could have given [...] more attention", calling him [...] "a wonderful actor" [...] who is [...] "really just delivering three or four plot lines [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Isabelle Eberhardt was a joint French and Australian project. The Film Finance Corporation Australia {{invested}} $1.9 million {{towards the}} film's production. It was shot on 35 mm film and filmed in Algiers, Paris and Geneva. Ian Pringle said he {{read about the}} life of Isabelle Eberhardt about ten years prior to filming, and was fascinated and intrigued by her. Pringle said for him production was both exciting and sad. Exciting because he was finally telling her story, though <b>sad</b> <b>because</b> as filming progressed he realised no film about her life would do her justice. Salacious sex scenes which [...] "read like erotic fiction" [...] in the script were shot but not used in the final cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{suggested}} that Pauline's presence in EastEnders was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike. In a report for BBC News, one viewer commented [...] "it's so <b>sad,</b> <b>because</b> I've watched her for 20 years. She's such a large character", and another said [...] "If she goes then I think EastEnders is finished." [...] BBC controller of continuing drama, John Yorke, commented Richard [...] "occupies a huge place in people's hearts", and executive producer Kate Harwood said, [...] "For many years Wendy simply was EastEnders for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the EastEnders spirit... We thank her for everything she has done for the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Royal Highness is not enraged at SpongeBob and Patrick for popping the bubble, {{telling him}} that the one they popped was just a prop for the tourists. He then shows them the real oldest living bubble, which Patrick then takes a picture of, causing it to pop. Angered, Lord Royal Highness summons the Atlantean Royal Guards to attack, but the gang manage to escape. Just when they escape outside, Plankton comes in and tries to destroy them with the tank he found, but much to his dismay, it showers the group with ice cream. Lord Royal Highness captures Plankton, and says that [...] "a talking speck" [...] would be a fantastic {{replacement}} for the bubble. SpongeBob and friends go home, but Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are all <b>sad</b> <b>because</b> {{they want to stay}} in Atlantis, even though SpongeBob does not.|$|E

500|$|Nhu's agents soon {{reported}} Có's {{activities to}} the palace. When the Ngô brothers confronted Đính with what occurred in Mỹ Tho, Đính feigned astonishment at his deputy's behaviour. He began crying and said [...] "This is my fault, {{because you have}} suspected me. I have not really gone {{to work for the}} last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I am not against you. I was <b>sad</b> <b>because</b> I thought I was discredited with you. So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble." [...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E
500|$|Golder {{identified}} [...] "Esther’s scarily casual death" [...] {{as one of}} the gripping {{points of}} what he felt to be an underwhelming finale. The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller referred to her exit as [...] "being a genuine, and saddening shock." [...] Jeffrey praised the character's death as a [...] "well-handled shocker", noting that all signs had indicated Rex would die instead. He felt it was [...] "cruel trick on the writers' part to off lovely Agent Drummond" [...] and [...] "all the crueler to keep viewings hanging until that first glimpse of her funeral." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "this kind of emotional sucker-punch" [...] is something Torchwood has always excelled at. Neela Debnath of The Independent commented that her death was <b>sad</b> <b>because</b> the [...] "character went through so much" [...] and that [...] "there would have been room for more growth in subsequent series." [...] Conversely, Los Angeles Times correspondent Todd VanDerWerff opined that it was hard to invest in Esther, in addition to Rex and Oswald, and though her death was intended as the [...] "one big, emotional moment of the finale" [...] it came across to him as [...] "kind of a dud". He felt that throughout the fourth series Esther was used as [...] "simply a plot device, someone the writers used when they needed something to go wrong or when they needed the story to move in a certain direction." [...] Blair Marnell of CraveOnline also notes in his review of the series finale that [...] "Rex and Esther never really caught on as leading characters" [...] and felt {{that it would have been}} better had the characters departed in symmetry.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Marie Simpson, {{voiced by}} Yeardley Smith, is the eldest {{daughter}} and middle {{child of the}} family. She is an extremely intelligent eight-year-old girl, {{one of the most}} intelligent characters on the show. Lisa's political convictions are generally socially liberal. She is a vegetarian, and a supporter of the Free Tibet movement, and while still supportive of the Christian church in which she was raised, Lisa became a practicing Buddhist following her decision to follow the Noble Eightfold Path. She is musically proficient on the saxophone; besides the occasional riff during the opening credit sequence Carole King's Jazzman and Gerry Rafferty's Baker Street have been prominently placed during episodes. In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was more of a [...] "female Bart" [...] and was equally mischievous. As the series progressed, Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional character with [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] being one of the first episodes where her true intelligence is fully shown. When she was a baby, Bart started out not liking her, although he became nicer to her after Marge pointed out that Lisa loves him. Her first word was [...] "Bart", with Bart happily teaching her more names. Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, the first one being [...] "Moaning Lisa". The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks, who had wanted to do an emotional episode where Lisa is <b>sad</b> <b>because</b> the show had done a lot of [...] "jokey episodes". In 2001 Lisa received a special [...] "Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award" [...] at the Environmental Media Awards. [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", an episode from the seventh season, won both an Environmental Media Award for [...] "Best Television Episodic Comedy" [...] and a Genesis Award for [...] "Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing Commitment". In Japan, the broadcasters of the series found they were able to turn the apparent viewer dislike of the series around by focusing marketing attention on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and city struck a chord with the Japanese.|$|E

6000|$|It is a {{very sad}} thing for any human being {{to have to say}} to himself,--with an earnest belief in his own assertion,--that all the joy of this world is over for him; and is the <b>sadder</b> <b>because</b> such {{conviction}} is apt to exclude the hope of other joy. This woman had said so to herself very often during the last two years, and had certainly been sincere. What was there in store for her? She was banished from the society of all those she liked. She bore a name that was hateful to her. She loved a man whom she could never see. She was troubled about money. Nothing in life had any taste for her. All the joys of the world were over,--and had been lost by her own fault. Then Phineas Finn had come to her at Dresden, and now her husband was dead! ...|$|R

2500|$|After {{the main}} filming over 1967–68 in India and the United States, {{financial}} and technical problems interrupted production on Raga. According to Worth's recollection, the original financier for the project, whom {{he describes as}} [...] "Ravi's manager", was forced to back out, having been committed to a psychiatric ward. In Raga Mala, Shankar says that he financed the film himself, adding: [...] "which was rather <b>sad</b> <b>because</b> it cost a large amount and I only realised this later!" ...|$|E

50|$|Thuraisingham, {{while at}} Cambridge, married Ethel Mary Huggins in December 1920 {{and they had}} twin girls, Rani and Joan.
