5|$|After he was honorably {{discharged}} in 1946, O'Neill {{studied for}} an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics at Swarthmore College.

However, {{he did not see}} space <b>science</b> <b>as</b> an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics. In 1950 he graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at Cornell University {{with the help of an}} Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics in 1954.|$|E

5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic <b>science</b> <b>as</b> it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E

5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian <b>science,</b> <b>as</b> he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E

5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} {{subdivision}} rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into {{smaller and smaller}} pieces. Subdivision rules in a sense are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, and computer <b>science,</b> <b>as</b> well as in the study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.|$|E

5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} {{rates and}} mechanisms {{are affected by}} a variety of factors including the strength of the surface-adparticle bond, orientation of the surface lattice, attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients. It is an important concept in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous catalysis, and other topics in surface <b>science.</b> <b>As</b> such, the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries. Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver halide salts used in photographic film.|$|E

The {{size and shape of}} viruses, and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface, is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials <b>science</b> <b>as</b> scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.|$|E
