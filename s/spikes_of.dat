5|$|Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson {{pointed out}} {{additional}} differences with two very closely related forms. The frill <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than the <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Achelousaurus are nevertheless less {{directed to the}} outside than the comparable <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Pachyrhinosaurus. Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear. Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish Achelousaurus from {{other members of the}} Centrosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Banksia flower spikes are {{important}} sources of nectar for mammals, insects and birds, particularly honeyeaters. Animals recorded foraging among the flower <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> B.canei include the yellow-tufted honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops), and bees, wasps and ants.|$|E
5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough {{to allow it to}} keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to the tail base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Stegosaurus, the thinner <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E

30|$|In {{terrestrial}} ecotoxicological tests, {{the availability}} and ecotoxicity of solid nanomaterials may depend on the application technique. We compared five spiking procedures using solid uncoated TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles in standardized OECD tests with earthworms, plants and soil microflora: dry <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> soil by applying soil or silica sand as a carrier; dry <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> food without a carrier; and wet <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> soil and food with an aqueous nanoparticle dispersion.|$|R

5|$|Typically for a stegosaur, Kentrosaurus had {{extensive}} osteoderm (bony {{structures in the}} skin) covering, including small plates (probably located on the neck and anterior trunk), and <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> various shapes. The <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Kentrosaurus are very elongated, with one specimen having a bone core length of 731 millimetres. The plates have a thickened section in the middle, {{as if they were}} modified spines. The spikes and plates were likely covered by horn. Aside from a few exceptions they were not found in close association with other skeletal remains. Thus, the exact position of most osteoderms is uncertain. A pair of closely spaced spikes was found articulated with a tail tip, and a number of spikes were found apparently regularly spaced in pairs along the path of an articulated tail.|$|E
5|$|Jonah Bevan (Oliver Ferriman) {{is walking}} home across the Cardiff Bay Barrage when a mysterious bright light appears. He vanishes. Seven months later, at the {{instigation}} {{of her former}} police colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Torchwood agent Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is investigating Jonah's disappearance. After Jonah's mother Nikki (Ruth Jones) starts {{a support group for}} relatives of missing people in the Cardiff area, Gwen realises that there are more cases resembling Jonah's disappearance. Gwen collates a chart of the missing people and her colleague Toshiko (Naoko Mori) discovers that all the disappearances occurred during negative <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> activity from the Cardiff space-time rift. The two women postulate the implications of this: that the rift can take people away and discard them elsewhere. Gwen confronts her boss Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) with her research but he informs her that nothing can be done and orders her to stop the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The flower <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> B. paludosa {{are unable}} to self-pollinate and require pollinators to set seed. A 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of outcrossing; pollen from one plant is well-mixed among other plants in the locale. Nonflying mammals are {{important}} pollinators in heathland habitat, with the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) a frequent visitor to flower spikes. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) is another mammal pollinator. Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-eared honeyeater (L. leucotis), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants.|$|E

5|$|The police {{discover}} Michael's {{location and}} surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes inside {{to try to}} reason with Michael. Inside, he finds Laurie, who is hallucinating a younger Michael holding her down, and tries telling her {{that no one is}} restraining her. Just then, Deborah instructs the older Michael {{that it is time to}} go home; Michael attacks Loomis and kills him. Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis' body, Michael is shot twice by Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Brad Dourif), and falls into the <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> some farming equipment. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then stabs him repeatedly. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael's mask. Later, Laurie sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning at a vision of Deborah.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plants are}} {{immediately}} evident to the visitor. Banyan (Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris) {{is a remarkable}} tree with a buttressed trunk and pendulous aerial roots: {{it can be seen}} on the track to Clear Place and near Ned's Beach. Pandanus tree (Pandanus forsteri) has spectacular teepee-like prop roots and pineapple-like fruits that are orange-red when mature, the tough leaves being used for basketry. It occurs in damp areas like creek beds and fine specimens can be seen along the Boat Harbour track. There are ten species of orchid on the island, the most noticeable being the bush orchid (Dendrobium macropus subsp. howeanum) on lowland trees and rocks, bearing cream flowers from August to September. Other prominent flowering plants in the summer include, on the mountain slopes, the whiskery red flowers of mountain rose (Metrosideros nervulosa and Metrosideros sclerocarpa), the massed small yellow flowers of corokia (Corokia carpodetoides), orange plump flowers of pumpkin tree (Negria rhabdothamnoides), and white <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Fitzgerald tree (Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii). The kava bush has large, aromatic, heart-shaped leaves. After heavy rain the endemic glowing mushrooms Mycena chlorophanos and Omphalotus nidiformis {{can be found in the}} palm forests.|$|E
25|$|Other {{assumptions}} {{may help}} to explain this resistance to FCoV infections by kittens. In the first weeks of life, APN could be immature because highly manno-glycosylated. The <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> CoV could then not be bound. Factors in breastmilk may inhibit the synthesis of fANP by enterocytes, as already described with fructose or sucrose.|$|E

25|$|B.subg. Isostylis {{shares with}} B.ser. Dryandra the {{property}} of having compact, dome-shaped flower heads. Structurally, however, Isostylis flower heads are quite {{different from those of}} B.ser. Dryandra, having more in common with the erect flower <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> other Banksia taxa. Specifically, Isostylis flower heads have an ovoid axis, suggestive of a greatly reduced flower spike, whereas Dryandra flower heads emerge from a flat receptable. Furthermore, Isostylis has thick follicles with a woolly coating, whereas Dryandra follicles are thin and hairless; and the involucral, common and floral bracts of Isostylis are unlike those of Dryandra.|$|E
25|$|Hemispheric {{asynchrony}} in {{ice sheet}} behavior {{has been observed}} by linking short-term <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> methane in Greenland ice cores and Antarctic ice cores. During Dansgaard–Oeschger events, the northern hemisphere warmed considerably, dramatically increasing the release of methane from wetlands, that were otherwise tundra during glacial times. This methane quickly distributes evenly across the globe, becoming incorporated in Antarctic and Greenland ice. With this tie, paleoclimatologists {{have been able to}} say that the ice sheets on Greenland only began to warm after the Antarctic ice sheet had been warming for several thousand years. Why this pattern occurs is still open for debate.|$|E

McGreavy violently killed Samantha {{and then the other}} two children, each in a different manner. Eight-month-old Samantha died from a fractured skull, 2-year-old Dawn had her throat slit and 4-year-old Paul was strangled. After killing the three children, McGreavy went down to the basement and retrieved a pickaxe. He further mutilated their bodies with the pickaxe before impaling the three bodies on the <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> a wrought iron fence in a neighbour's yard. He then left the home.|$|E

500|$|The frill of Achelousaurus had two {{conspicuous}} large spikes {{that were}} directed backwards and curved {{to the sides}} away from each other. During the 1990s, it was increasingly understood that such spikes on the parietals were not random growths but specific traits {{that could be used}} to determine the evolution of horned dinosaurs, if only it could be analyzed how they corresponded among species. Sampson, in the paper describing Achelousaurus in 1995, therefore introduced a generalized numbering system for such parietal processes, counting them from the midline to the side of the frill. This was applied to the Centrosaurinae as a whole in 1997. The large <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Achelousaurus correspond to [...] "Process 3" [...] <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> other centrosaurines and were similar to those of Einiosaurus, though curved more to the sides, similar to Pachyrhinosaurus. They were shorter and thinner than the corresponding <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Styracosaurus. Between these spikes, on both sides of the central frill notch, were two small tab-like processes ("Process 2") that were directed towards the midline. Innermost [...] "Process 1" [...] spikes, as present in Centrosaurus, are lacking with Achelousaurus. The frill had two large paired openings, the parietal fenestrae, with a midline parietal bar between them. A linear row of rounded swellings ran along the top of the parietal bar, which may be homologous to the spikes and horns in the same area of some Pachyrhinosaurus specimens. A row of relatively small processes ran along the parietal shield margin from the [...] "Process 3" [...] spikes outwards. These lower processes appear to have been capped by epoccipitals, bones that lined the frills of ceratopsids. In Achelousaurus these epoccipitals, which start as separate skin ossifications or osteoderms, fuse with the underlying frill bone to form spikes, at least in the third position.|$|E

[...] Watson custom-built a fuzzbox for Kirk's guitar, producing a unique timbre.
