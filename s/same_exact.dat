25|$|For the 2011 season, the car's {{splitter}} {{and nose}} configuration were redesigned: the splitter's braces were removed, and the splitter was made nonadjustable. The nose {{as a whole}} was given a cleaner, rounder look that resembled that of NASCAR's previous model (now dubbed the fourth-generation car) and manufacturers were given free rein to construct the lower grille area to reflect that of their NASCAR models' production-car counterparts. In the past, all cars were required to run the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> grille arrangement, allowing for very little, if any, real differentiation between them.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} an immunocontraceptive to be {{palatable}} for human use, {{it would need}} to meet or exceed the efficacy rates of currently popular forms of contraception. Currently the maximum reduction of fertility due to sperm vaccines in laboratory experiments with mice is ~75%. The lack of efficacy is due to variability of immunogenicity from one animal to another. Even when exposed to the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> vaccine, some animals will produce abundant antibody titers to the vaccine's antigen, while others produce relatively low antibody titers. In the Eppin trial that attained 100% infertility, a small sample size (only 9 monkeys) was used, and even among this small sample 2 monkeys were dropped from the study because they failed to produce sufficiently high antibody titers.|$|E
25|$|The reverse parking {{procedure}} is virtually {{identical to the}} parallel parking procedure. The driver approaches the parking space, moving forward and turning, positioning the car in place for backing into the reverse parking spot. The vehicle rear has to be facing the reverse parking spot, allowing the backup camera to 'see' the parking area. Shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the driver selects the reverse park guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen (the grid appears with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing {{the corner of the}} parking spot, and adjustment arrows; reverse parking adds rotation selection). After checking the parking space and engaging the reverse park procedure, the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> parking process occurs as the car reverse parks into the spot.|$|E

Tom held everyone to the <b>same</b> <b>exacting</b> standards as he held himself.

25|$|His father, brother, and a {{neighbour}} {{came out}} to look and Joseph immediately said he too could see the apparition although the adults saw nothing. The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing. The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked {{into the night sky}} and began describing Our Lady in the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E
25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} that increase accuracy of NGS platforms such as barcoding techniques and circle sequencing method. The data generated by these methods the same as NGS platforms originate from single strand of DNA and therefore the errors that are introduced during PCR amplification, tissue processing or DNA extraction can still be distinguished as a true variant. Duplex sequencing method solve this problem {{by taking advantage of}} complementary nature of two strands of DNA and confirming only variants that are present in both strands of DNA. Since the probability of two errors happening at the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> base pair in both strands and resulting in a complementary basepair is very low, duplex sequencing increases the accuracy of sequencing significantly.|$|E
25|$|Anna's {{fighting}} {{style is}} based on Hapkido, a martial art that {{is known for its}} efficient joint locks, throws, and pressure point strikes and timed defensive tactics. Despite this, she and Nina have both incorporated other fighting arts into their personal styles. She begins sharing mostly the same moveset with Nina, but has developed her own moveset overtime to the point that as of Tekken 5, she only shares several moves with Nina and even then they have different properties. Anna's grappling moves have also changed over the series, reflecting less of her bone breaking martial arts. In Tekken 3, Anna only appears as a playable character in the console version; in the arcade version, she is just an alternate costume for Nina, and therefore has the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> moveset as her sister.|$|E

Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic as well as guest conductor throughout Europe and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the <b>same</b> <b>exacting</b> standards. Paur's programs emphasized the classical repertoire and included {{a heavy dose of}} Johannes Brahms, whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the Orchestra's musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians. Paur remained {{at the head of the}} Orchestra until it disbanded in 1910.|$|R

Henry Caldwell of the Marines who died March 12, 1812 at Charlestown, Massachusetts. Caldwell was on the Little Belt during the Little Belt Affair, an event that is {{regarded as one of the}} causes of the War of 1812, and he testified during the Court of Inquiry on the Little Belt Affair which convened in New York in September 1811. Lucy was a descendant of Gov. William Bradford (1590-1657) of the Mayflower and Jonathan Rudd who was married, in a legendary ceremony, at Bride Brook in what is now East Lyme, Connecticut in December 1646. Burbeck was the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> age as Lucy's father Daniel Rudd, Jr., both being born on June 10, 1754. At the time of his marriage to Lucy, Burbeck was 29 years her senior.|$|E
25|$|Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral {{museum is}} a crypt museum at the St. Georges Greek Orthodox Cathedral on Nejme Square. It is a {{relatively}} small museum that reveals layers of Christian heritage belonging {{to a series of}} seven churches built on the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> site starting 2000 years ago. The current cathedral stands on layers of relics where at every stage of its existence its people attempted to enlarge and beautify it, adding more murals and icons. The museum is a crypt underneath the cathedral where oil lamps, pipes, clay and terracotta pots, miniature statues, and crosses found in various digs are displayed. Glass panels cover some of the crypt's relics and a glass partition separates the crypt from the church's altar directly above it. A narrow metal walkway leads visitors through the twelve stops of the crypt displaying tombstones, mosaics, burial chambers, engravings on stones and columns, well-preserved skeletons, a covered canal, and part of an ancient paved road. The ruins and findings were excavated by Lebanese archaeologists before the cathedral underwent restoration; they aimed at locating the Byzantine church Anastasis, which according to ancient texts is believed to be near Beirut's famous law school before it was leveled by the 551 Beirut earthquake.|$|E

500|$|The main {{differences}} between the Volt and the Ampera are in their styling. The Ampera has a distinctive front and rear fascia, with a large cut-out in the rear bumper. The Opel Ampera features more stylized alloy wheels as standard, and the side skirts are body-colored rather than black. In the inside there are only minor differences and both versions share the <b>same</b> <b>exact</b> powertrain and battery pack. A key operational difference was that the Ampera has four drive modes, one more than the 2011/12 model year Volt. The additional option is [...] "City Mode", which adapts battery management {{to the needs of}} commuter travel.

[...] However, Hilo, located between these heavily impacted districts, recorded a relatively modest 1.77 inches of rain on July 23 and 24. [...] After passing over the Big Island, Darby proceeded northwestward via the Kauai Channel, while resulting in heavy rains over southern slope of Haleakala on Maui. These rains forced the closure of Highway 11, as well as parts of Interstate H-1 and the Kamehameha Highway. Island-wide, a peak 24-hour rainfall total, , was measured in Wailuaiki. In Oahu, rainfall, sometimes at rates of [...] per hour, caused flash flooding in several areas within the urban core of Honolulu and along windward slopes. A stream in Kalihi inundated several properties and spilled over a bridge located further downstream. Several sewage spills occurred on Oahu due to the heavy rain, including 42,000gallons (160,000litres) at the Kailua Wastewater Treatment Plant and 4,100gallons (15,500litres) from a private residence on Liliha Street. This resulted in the issuance of a brown water advisory. In all, peak storm totals on Oahu during the night of July24 exceeded , including [...] in Kaneohe.
