5|$|Ikata {{is a small}} town, with a {{population}} of 10,637 as of March 31, 2014. The total land area of the town is 94.37km2, making the population density 113 persons per km2. However, much of the land on the peninsula is quite mountainous and not suited for development; the population density of the individual settlements, which are <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the small bay areas {{in the foothills of the}} mountains, is much higher. Extrapolating from data based on the most recent land survey, only 3.21% of the town's land is inhabited; this puts the population density at a much higher 3,510 persons/kilometer-squared.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of IK Pegasi B may be composed wholly of carbon and oxygen; alternatively, if its progenitor underwent carbon burning, {{it may have}} a core of oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle enriched with carbon and oxygen. In either case, the exterior of IK Pegasi B is covered by an atmosphere of almost pure hydrogen, which gives this star its stellar classification of DA. Due to higher atomic mass, any helium in the envelope will have sunk beneath the hydrogen layer. The entire mass of the star is supported by electron degeneracy pressureâ€”a quantum mechanical effect that limits the amount of matter that can be <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> a given volume.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr. became {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited Berkeley to look at Lawrence's calutrons, and met with Oppenheimer, who gave him a report on bomb design on 8 October. Groves was interested in Oppenheimer's proposal to establish a separate bomb design laboratory. When they met again in Chicago a week later, he invited Oppenheimer to discuss the issue. Groves had to catch a train to New York, so he asked Oppenheimer to accompany him {{so that they could}} continue the discussion. Groves, Oppenheimer, and Colonel James C. Marshall and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols all <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> a single compartment where they talked about how a bomb laboratory could be created, and how it would function. Groves subsequently had Oppenheimer come to Washington, D.C., where the matter was discussed with Vannevar Bush, the {{director of}} the OSRD, and James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). On 19 October, Groves approved the establishment of a bomb laboratory.|$|E

5|$|The aerial {{operation}} had {{a considerable}} effect in strangling Axis logistics. The supplies reaching Axis units dwindled, and the Axis armies and air units remaining in Tunisia gradually {{ran out of}} fuel, ammunition and other supplies. Having lost most of its airbases, the Luftwaffe also evacuated most of its units. By early May 1943, only the Italian fighter units, and one German Gruppe (I. JG 77), remained as the Axis held on to a narrow strip of African coastline near Tunis. Allied air superiority was so overwhelming, that Luftwaffe personnel climbed into fighter fuselages, or <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the cockpits of Bf 109s alongside the pilot rather than risk flying in transport aircraft. Most ground crew and pilots attempted to escape this way. Flying large numbers of personnel in one go and by transport was too dangerous; 16 personnel {{were killed in a}} crash on 29 or 30 April. The last transport missions were flown on 4 May, in which 117 tons of fuel and ammunition was brought in. Some supply drops were attempted (by II./Kampfgeschwader 1), but most of the remaining signals, FlaK, transport and administrative staff left were captured when the campaign ended on 13 May 1943.|$|E
5|$|Giovinazzi quickly caught Marciello and overtook him (with {{the help}} of DRS and drafting) {{at the start of}} lap 18 to take over the lead. Giovinazzi began to pull away from Maricello. The safety car was {{deployed}} for the fourth (and final) time after Nato attempted to pass teammate King around the inside and retired from the race having been <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the turn three barrier by him. The area was cleared of Nato's damaged car over the next five laps which meant the race would finish under a time limit. Giovinazzi accelerated as late as possible to limit the slipstream effect and remained the leader at the lap-25 restart despite locking-up his tyres heading into the first turn. King retired from the race following contact with Eriksson. Giovinazzi remained the leader for the remaining two laps to clinch his first, and his team's maiden, victory in the GP2 Series. Siroktin overtook Rowland for third place and clinched second position from Marciello by drafting behind him on the start/finish straight. Rowland finished in fourth place, ahead of Evans and Matsushita whom he defended from in the final two laps. Gelael, de Jong, Ghiotto, and Malja rounded out the point-scoring positions. Eriksson and King were the last of the classified finishers. The attrition race was high, with ten drivers reaching the end of the race.|$|E
25|$|In a type II superconductor, {{electric}} charges condense into Cooper pairs. As a result, {{magnetic flux}} is <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> tubes. In the dual superconductor {{picture of the}} QCD vacuum, chromomagnetic monopoles condense into dual Cooper pairs, causing chromoelectric flux to be <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> tubes. As a result, confinement and the string picture of hadrons follows. This dual superconductor picture is due to Gerard 't Hooft and Stanley Mandelstam. 't Hooft showed further that an Abelian projection of a non-Abelian gauge theory contains magnetic monopoles.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} in pressure between {{the surface and}} the diver can be so great that if the air line is cut at the surface {{and there is no}} non-return valve, the diver would be partly <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the helmet by the external pressure, and injured or possibly killed.|$|E
25|$|In pennate muscles, {{segments}} {{with higher}} pennation angles put out less force per shortening muscle fiber. Therefore, the architectural gear ratio of a pennate muscle {{is higher than}} the architectural gear ratio of spindle like muscles (e.g. fusiform). A smaller fiber length neutralizes this higher architectural gear ratio if the muscle fibers must be <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the same space.|$|E

25|$|The label {{consists}} of a molecule called ubiquitin. This fastens to the protein to be destroyed, accompanies it to the proteasome where it is recognised as the key in a lock, and signals that a protein {{is on the way}} for disassembly. Shortly before the protein is <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the proteasome, its ubiquitin label is disconnected for re-use. Examples of processes governed by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation are cell division, DNA repair, quality control of newly produced proteins, and important parts of the immune defence.|$|E
25|$|The paleontological {{evidence}} {{consists of}} changes in the geographical distribution of fossils. During a glacial period cold-adapted organisms spread into lower latitudes, and organisms that prefer warmer conditions become extinct or are <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> lower latitudes. This evidence is also difficult to interpret because it requires (1) sequences of sediments covering a long period of time, over a wide range of latitudes and which are easily correlated; (2) ancient organisms which survive for several million years without change and whose temperature preferences are easily diagnosed; and (3) the finding of the relevant fossils.|$|E

25|$|No {{suitable}} engines {{were available}} to give a sufficient advantage over the British Napier Lion, so the simplest possible chassis was constructed and three war-surplus Liberty aero engines were <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> it. The vehicle was simple, with no clutch or gearbox and only a single fixed ratio. Once running by a push start, it had to keep rolling. Driver comforts were minimal: the forward engine was sheathed in a crude attempt at streamlining, the two side-by-side behind it were bare, with the driver perched {{between them and the}} one in front.|$|E
25|$|A liquid, like a gas, {{displays}} {{the properties of}} a fluid. A liquid can flow, assume {{the shape of a}} container, and, if placed in a sealed container, will distribute applied pressure evenly to every surface in the container. If liquid is placed in a bag, it can be <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> any shape. Unlike a gas, a liquid is nearly incompressible, it occupies nearly a constant volume over a wide range of pressures; it does not generally expand to fill available space in a container but forms its own surface, and it may not always mix readily with another liquid. These properties make a liquid suitable for applications such as hydraulics.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{part of the}} {{standard}} is still under review. It will define a compact coding system for clothes sizes. This was originally intended primarily for industry use in databases and {{as a part of}} stock-keeping identifiers and catalogue ordering numbers, but later users have also expressed a desire to use compact codes for customer communication. Writing out all the centimetre figures of all the primary and secondary measures from EN 13402-2 can â€“ in some cases â€“ require up to 12 digits. The full list of centimetre figures on the pictogram contains a lot of redundancy and the same information can be <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> fewer characters with lookup tables. EN 13402-4 will define such tables.|$|E
50|$|Essential to {{complete}} {{many parts of}} the game is the Remote Robot, known in Japan as Mecha Tails (Meka Teiruzu). The Remote Robot is a tiny, all-terrain robot modeled on Tails that can <b>squeeze</b> <b>into</b> a lot of places Tails himself can't. When using Remote Robot, Tails stands in place while player control is switched to the vehicle. The Remote Robot can walk, jump, fly, and <b>squeeze</b> <b>into</b> tiny passageways, and is not damaged by most enemies or spikes, but if it is hit by a special type of blue laser or falls off-screen, it will automatically return to Tails. Many of the game's puzzles involve maneuvering the robot to open the path for Tails himself.|$|R

25|$|First, {{each foot}} would be soaked {{in a warm}} mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was {{intended}} to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut {{back as far as}} possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, 3m long and 5cm wide (10ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the sole of the foot until the toes broke.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of this transition, a {{historic}} night awaited the North Stars. On January 7, 1980, Minnesota was scheduled to play the Philadelphia Flyers, who came to Bloomington sporting the NHL's (and major league sports') longest undefeated streak, a 35-game run which included 25 wins and 10 ties. An all-time record Met Center crowd of 15,962 <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the arena, which was the largest crowd to ever witness a hockey game in Minnesota to that time, and would remain the highest total in all 26 seasons of the North Stars franchise. Minnesota ended the Flyers' streak with a 7-1 win, with two North Stars posting hat tricks. In the quarter-final round 1980 Stanley Cup playoffs, the North Stars upset the four-time defending champion Montreal Canadiens in seven games before ultimately bowing out to Philadelphia in the following round.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} tire inflation {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds <b>squeezed</b> <b>into</b> the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 {{pounds per square inch}} that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.|$|E
