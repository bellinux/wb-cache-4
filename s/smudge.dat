5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on <b>smudge</b> marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E
5|$|Rusty, a house cat, {{runs into}} a ThunderClan apprentice, Graypaw, {{in the forest}} in his backyard. Rusty, however, does not run away, but fights back. Bluestar and Lionheart, Graypaw's mentor, having watched the confrontation, invite Rusty to join ThunderClan. Rusty asks to think it over, and after talking it over with his best friend and {{neighbor}} <b>Smudge,</b> decides {{to go with the}} Clan cats. Lionheart and Whitestorm meet him the next day and lead him to the camp. Due to his house cat past, some members of the Clan are hostile towards Rusty. This hostility eventually leads Rusty to attack Longtail, losing his collar in the ensuing fight. Bluestar then ends the fight and announces that Rusty has earned his Clan name, Firepaw. He forms a strong bond with Graypaw, and with Ravenpaw, an apprentice to the ambitious warrior Tigerclaw.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} galaxies that lie near it. M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy <b>smudge,</b> M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf spheroidal galaxy or simply a generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E

50|$|Colored dye or <b>smudges</b> {{can affect}} the {{perceived}} color of a gem. Historically, some jewelers' diamonds were mis-graded due to <b>smudges</b> on the girdle, or dye on the culet. Current practice is to thoroughly clean a gem before grading its color as well as clarity.|$|R
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale <b>smudge.</b> A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E

25|$|As oranges are {{sensitive}} to frost, there are different methods to prevent frost damage to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected. A common process is to spray the trees with water so as to cover them with {{a thin layer of}} ice that will stay just at the freezing point, insulating them even if air temperatures drop far lower. This is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is, and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees. This practice, however, offers protection only for a very short time. Another procedure is burning fuel oil in <b>smudge</b> pots put between the trees. These devices burn {{with a great deal of}} particulate emission, so condensation of water vapour on the particulate soot prevents condensation on plants and raises the air temperature very slightly. <b>Smudge</b> pots were developed for the first time after a disastrous freeze in Southern California in January 1913 destroyed a whole crop.|$|E
25|$|László Bíró, a Hungarian {{newspaper}} editor {{frustrated by the}} amount of time that he wasted filling up fountain pens and cleaning up smudged pages, noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and <b>smudge</b> free. He decided to create a pen using the same type of ink. Bíró enlisted the help of his brother György, a chemist, to develop viscous ink formulae for new ballpoint designs.|$|E

25|$|Plant-based paste {{tends to}} dry {{more quickly than}} silk-based pastes because the plant extract does not hold onto the oil as tightly as silk. Depending on the paper used, plant pastes can dry in 10 to 15 minutes. The more {{absorbent}} the paper is, the faster it dries as the paper absorbs most of the oil. Also, plant pastes tend to <b>smudge</b> more easily than silk pastes due to the loose binding agent.|$|E
25|$|Reles {{became known}} as a {{particularly}} cold-blooded and psychopathic murderer. On one occasion, in broad daylight, he attacked a worker at a car wash for failing to clean a <b>smudge</b> from the fender of his car. Another time, Reles killed a parking lot attendant for failing to fetch his car fast enough. On another occasion, he brought a guest to his mother-in-law's home for supper. When his mother-in-law retired after the meal, Reles and another gang member murdered the guest and then removed the body.|$|E
25|$|When {{the seal}} is pressed onto the {{printing}} surface, the procedure differs according to plant or silk based paste. For silk based paste, the user applies pressure, {{often with a}} specially made soft, flat surface beneath the paper. For plant based paste, the user simply applies light pressure. As lifting the seal vertically away from its imprint may rip or damage paper, the seal is usually lifted off one side at a time, as if bent off from the page. After this, the image may be blotted {{with a piece of}} paper to make it dry faster, although this may <b>smudge</b> it. Usually {{there needs to be a}} pile of soft felt or paper under the paper to be imprinted for a clear seal impression.|$|E

25|$|California {{is a very}} geologically diverse {{region and}} varies greatly {{in the range of}} climates and terroirs that can be found. Most of the state's wine regions are found between the Pacific coast and the Central Valley. The Pacific Ocean and large bays, like San Francisco Bay, serve as {{tempering}} influences to the wine regions nearby providing cool winds and fog that balance the heat and sunshine. While drought can be a vinicultural hazard, most areas of California receive sufficient amounts of rainfall with the annual rainfall of wine regions north of San Francisco between 24-45inches (615–1150mm) and the more southern regions receiving 13-20inches. Winters are mild with little threat of frost damage though springtime. To curb the threat of frost, vineyard owners will often employ the use of wind machines, sprinklers and <b>smudge</b> pots to protect the vines.|$|E

[...] The President's participation in the controversy attested to its magnitude, however; as one observer wrote, [...] "From an insignificant <b>smudge</b> [...] has become a roaring blaze and its sparks are kindling throughout the land." ...|$|E

First, users capture images of real media, including examples of isolated strokes, pairs of overlapping strokes, and <b>smudged</b> strokes. Online, the user inputs a new stroke path, and our system synthesizes its 2 D texture appearance with optional smearing or <b>smudging</b> when strokes overlap. We demonstrate high-fidelity paintings that closely resemble the captured media style, and also quantitatively evaluate our synthesis quality via user studies...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1960s, {{technological}} advances in frost protection introduced preventive measures, such as <b>smudge</b> pots and aspersion irrigation to the region. <b>Smudge</b> pots work by providing direct heat to the vines while aspersion involves spraying the vines with water {{as soon as}} temperatures hit [...] and maintaining persistent coverage. The water freezes on the vine, shielding it with a protective layer of ice that functions igloo-style, retaining heat within the vine. While cost {{is a factor in}} using <b>smudge</b> pots, there is a risk to the aspersion method if the constant sprinkling of water is interrupted of causing worse damage to the vine. There is no such protection against hail, which in 2016 caused serious difficulties for some Chablis vignerons.|$|E
