5000|$|Modern <b>shave</b> <b>brushes</b> {{are similar}} in appearance, {{composition}} and function to their centuries-old predecessors. Although {{a variety of different}} materials are still used to fashion <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> <b>handles,</b> synthetic handles of nylon, urethane or plastic are the most common even by the most expensive <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> manufacturers. Benefits of synthetic handles include a lesser chance of breakage and resistance to damage by moisture. [...] A limited number of consumers [...] prefer natural materials such as wood or exotic materials such as tortoise shell. A <b>shave</b> <b>brush's</b> <b>handle,</b> regardless of its material composition, rarely affects the overall performance of the brush.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> or <b>shaving</b> <b>brush</b> {{is a small}} <b>brush</b> with a <b>handle</b> {{parallel}} to the bristles used to apply shaving soap or shaving cream to the face when <b>shaving.</b> <b>Shave</b> <b>brushes</b> are often decorative; antique handles are often made from materials such as ivory or even gold, though the bristle load may be composed of any number of natural or synthetic materials. The <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> is used most often today by [...] "wet shavers" [...] in tandem with a double-edged safety razor or a straight razor. However, {{this is not always}} the case, as shavers of all varieties may employ the tool.|$|R
50|$|Bringing a <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> across one's skin {{produces}} a mild exfoliation. Because a <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> {{is most often}} used with a shave soap, this effect often replaces the pre-shave routine of washing and applying lotion to the face.|$|R
40|$|During the First World War, anthrax {{cases in}} the United States and England {{increased}} greatly {{and seemed to be}} associated with use of new <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes.</b> Further investigation revealed that the source material and origin of <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> had changed during the war. Cheap brushes of imported horsehair were being made to look like the preferred badger-hair brushes. Unfortunately, some of these brushes were not effectively disinfected and brought with them a nasty stowaway: Bacillus anthracis. A review of outbreak summaries, surveillance data, and case reports indicated that these cases originated from the use of ineffectively disinfected animal-hair <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes.</b> This historical information is relevant to current public health practice because renewed interest in vintage and animal-hair <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> has been seen in popular culture. This information should help healthcare providers and public health officials answer questions on this topic. 28418302 PMC 540302...|$|R
5000|$|The modern <b>shaving</b> <b>brush</b> may {{be traced}} to France during the 1750s. The French call a <b>shaving</b> <b>brush</b> blaireau or [...] "badger." [...] Quality of these brushes {{differed}} greatly, as materials used to fashion the handles varied from the common to the exotic. It was not uncommon for handles {{to be made of}} ivory, gold, silver, tortoise shell, crystal, or porcelain. The more expensive brushes used badger hair, with cheaper ones using boar's or horse's hair. In the 1800s when the folding-handle straight razor design made it practical for men to shave themselves rather than visit a barber, a <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> became a status symbol, and an expensive or eccentric brush was a way of asserting one's personality or even affluence. The recent rapid rise in the popularity of [...] "wet shaving" [...] has raised demand for high quality and custom <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Synthetic <b>shave</b> <b>brushes,</b> {{most often}} made using nylon bristles, are {{available}} {{in a range of}} prices and gradations in quality. Comparable to traditional <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes,</b> synthetic fiber brushes can quickly create a rich lather using relatively little shaving soap or cream. The synthetic fibers dry faster than natural hair and are less sensitive to everyday use.|$|R

50|$|A <b>shave</b> <b>brush's</b> {{price is}} usually {{determined}} more by its bristle load {{than any other}} factor except for brushes with very exotic handles. The most expensive brushes often use exotic materials in the handle. The bristles are fixed together into a knot that is installed into the handle. The best quality brushes are hand knotted. Badger and boar brushes are the most commonly found animals used for <b>shaving</b> <b>brush</b> fibers. Badger species include the eurasian badger and the hog badger. Badger brushes and {{often referred to as}} two band, or three band. Perhaps all badger hair fibers have three bands, but those used in the brushes conceal the lighter bottom band. Nonetheless, both types of bristle make desirable <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes.</b> Lower-quality brushes are often machine made and the bristles may be trimmed, resulting in sharp, prickly tips.|$|R

50|$|The hair of the European badger {{has been}} used for centuries for making sporrans and high end <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes.</b> Sporrans are {{traditionally}} worn as part of male Scottish highland dress. They form a bag or pocket made from a pelt and a badger or other animal's mask may be used as a flap. Compared to the fur of other animals, badger's hair is ideal for <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> because it retains the hot water that needs to be applied to the skin while wet <b>shaving.</b> Although some <b>brushes</b> are made from wild badger hair, most hair is sourced from China where badgers are farmed for this purpose. The pelt was also formerly used for pistol furniture.|$|R
40|$|The Eurasian badger (Meles meles) is {{included}} in Appendix III of the Bern Convention and protected by national laws in many European countries. Badger hair is used to manufacture luxury <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes,</b> although it is frequently argued that the hog badger (Arctonyx collaris), which in Europe is an introduced and unprotected species, is {{the origin of the}} hair used. We applied an extraction protocol to recover DNA from the unrooted hair of <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> obtained from commercial companies in The Netherlands and Spain. The tested brushes originated from The Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom where the Eurasian badger is a protected species. We sequenced 191 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region and 170 bp of the cytochrome b gene and compared the sequences obtained with Eurasian badger and hog badger reference sequences of the same mitochondrial DNA regions obtained in our laboratory and from GenBank. Sequences obtained from four <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> were clearly hog badger sequences, whereas four sequences clustered with Eurasian badger sequences of both European and Asian origins. One of the <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> made of Eurasian badger was produced in France, where it is legal to capture or trade the species under certain conditions. The remaining three brushes originated from The Netherlands, where it is illegal to possess, sell, transport or use for commercial purposes dead Eurasian badgers or products derived from them.

50|$|A hard {{shaving soap}} is {{used with a}} <b>shaving</b> <b>brush</b> to create lather for shaving.

50|$|In use, the <b>shaving</b> <b>brush</b> is dunked {{into the}} wide spout, {{allowing}} it to soak {{into the water and}} heat up. The soap is placed in the soap holder.

This allows conservation of water and soap, whilst retaining enough heat to ensure a long shave.|$|R
