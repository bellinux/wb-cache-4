40|$|The kinetic {{studies of}} some {{substituted}} phenols in their reactions with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> in chlorobenzene and at 25 °C {{showed that the}} clectrophile involved is molecular <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> (Cl + -SO - 2 -Cl). In the poly methyl phenol studied, {{the magnitude of the}} effect of -CH 3 groups on the reactivity of the phenol molecule in this reaction suggested that the mechanism involves heterolytic attack of molecular <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> on the benzenoid nucleus. The kinetic study of 3, 5 -dimethyl anisole was done in benzene and showed similar effects. The reaction in all the phenols and anisole was found to be bimolecular and of second order. The ether and the phenols were activated towards electrophilic attack particularly in the para position. This was supported by the analysis of the products formed in the reaction which also helped to trace the mechanism via which the electrophile substitutes a hydrogen of the benzenoid nucleus. The compounds studied were: 2. 4 -xylenol. 2, 6 -xylenol. 3. 5 -xylenol. 2, 3, 5 -trimethyl phenol. 2, 3, 6 -trimethyl phenol. 3. 5 -ditertiary butyl phenol. 3. 5 -dimethyl anisole. The kinetic study of 3, 5 -xylenol was studied in great detail and was extended to three solvents: benzene, chloro-benzene and o-dichlorobenzene. In all the three cases a considerable change in second order rate constant was observed and indicated that the reaction was heterolytic in nature. The increase in the rate constant was also observed with the increase in the concentration of 3, 5 -xylenol in the reaction mixture and was explained due to the formation of a pi-complex between xylenol or its chlorinated products (4 -chloro, 3, 5 -xylenol and 2, 4 -dichloro, 3, 3 -xylenol) and <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and its high reactivity. With the increase in xylenol concentration more pi-complex was suggested to be formed thereby affecting the rate of reaction. Kinetics of 3, 5 -xylenol was also compared with 2, 4, 6 -D 3 - 3 s 5 -xylenol and O-deutero- 3, 5 -xylenol to understand the other factors affecting the mechanism and to establish the rate determining step. Different quantities of 3, 5 -xylenol was also reacted with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> in different mixture of solvents (benzene and chlorobenzene) to illustrate the effect of polarity of the solvent and the concentration of xylenol content on the rate of reaction. The explained behaviour of the pi-complex formed between 4 -chloro, 3, 5 -xylenol and <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> was justified by the increase in second order rate constant of 3, 5 -dimethyl anisole, when reacted in presence of 4 -chloro xylenol, with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> This study was extended to pi-complexes of 2, 4 -dichloro, 3, 5 -xyleno 1, 4 -chloro, 3, 5 -dimethyl anisole and 3, 5 -ditertiary butyl phenol formed with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> The nature and structure of T -complexes was also studied by u. v. and n. m. r. spectroscopy. The reactivity of the phenols can be described in the order: 2, 3, 5 -Me 3 -phenol > 3, 5 -xylenol > 2, 3, 6 -Me 3 -phenol and 3, 5 -dimethyl anisole > 2, 4 -xylenol > 2, 6 -xylenol > 3, 5 -ditertiary butyl phenol. <p...|$|E

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is concerned with {{an investigation into the}} role and behaviour of odd-electron transition metal complexes in promoting organic reactions. The metathesis reaction between cyclo­hexane and tetrachloromethane {{in the presence of a}} series of transition metal carbonyl-containing complexes has been studied and shown to afford chlorocyclohexane and trichloromethane in good yield. A detailed kinetic study of such a reaction was undertaken using [Re[sub] 2 (CO) [sub] 10] as the metal complex. This study indicated that the reaction followed a free-radical chain mechanism in which the metal complex acted solely as an initiator. A survey has been made of the relative efficiencies of other metal carbonyl complexes in initiating this reaction and these findings have been compared with the known behaviour and thermal stabilities of the complexes. The scope of the reaction has also been investigated using a number of different halogenating agents and various saturated and alkyl aromatic substrates. An investigation has also been made into the role of transition metal complexes in promoting the reaction between toluene and <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> A study of the reaction in the presence of a series of transition metal carbonyl-containing complexes shows that the predominant reaction leads to formation of chlorotoluenes via an even-electron (ionic) mechanism. Conversely, when the same reaction is performed in the presence of the platinum and palladium complexes [M(PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 4] and [MCl[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2] (M = Pt or Pd), the predominant product is benzyl chloride formed via an odd-electron (radical) mechanism. Under the reaction conditions the zerovalent complexes are rapidly oxidised to [MCl[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2] and it is proposed that these species are primarily responsible for radical chain initiation. The [RuCl[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 3]-mediated reaction between toluene and <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> proves to be equally selective but promotes formation of chlorotoluenes. A study of the effect of <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> on the metal complexes utilised in the above reactions has shown that <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> is a very effective mild chlorinating agent for dinuclear or coordinatively unsaturated metal complexes. Thus the reaction between [M[sub] 2 (CO) [sub] 10] (M = Mn or Re) and <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> affords almost quantitative yields of [M(CO) [sub] 5 Cl] (M= Mn or Re) in a considerably more convenient procedure than previously reported. Moreover, reaction with [Re[sub] 2 (CO) [sub] 8 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2] produces both the cis- and trans-isomers of [ReCl(CO) [sub] 4 PPh[sub] 3], the latter being hitherto unknown. Treatment of [Pt(PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 4] with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> similarly affords cis- and trans-[PtCI[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2]. The halogenation of toluene with di-chlorine in the presence of a number of transition metal complexes has also been studied. At elevated temperatures in the presence of [M(PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 4] and [MCl[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2]] (M = Pt or Pd) the reaction is essentially identical to the analogous reaction with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> At 0 [sup]o C however, this free radical reaction is supressed and only chlorotoluenes were formed via an ionic mechanism involving higher oxidation state complexes of platinum and palladium...|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} of <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{with a number}} of anilides in nitromethane at 25 C has been studied kinetically. It was concluded that although molecular <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> is the major electrophile molecular chlorine also contributes as the attacking electrophile. [equation] was found; the reaction is kinetically first order with respect to each of the reactants. The effect of the substituents, (p=- 5) shows that a heterolyticelectrophilic process is involved. The effect of solvents, which increase the rate of the reaction in the order nitromethane > o-dichlorobenzene> chlorobenzene > benzene, is also evidence for a heterolytic process. The {{reaction of}} <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> with anthracene and some of its derivatives, and also with some derivatives of pyrene in chlorobenzene at 25 °C has been studied. The stoichiometry of the reaction is [equation]. The only effective electrophile was found to be molecular sulphurylchloride which attacks the ring in the rate determining step. This step is second order, first order with respect to each of the reactants. The magnitude of reaction constant (p - 1. 73) for anthracenes and p= about - 2 for pyrenes indicates that the transition states in these heterolytic processes have acquired some positive charge. The effect of solvent on the rate (o-dichlorobenzene faster than chlorobenzene, which is faster than benzene) also confirms this deduction. The substituent effects show an electrophilic process in which electronic effects appear to be propogated by -electron interactions. <p...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of atom {{transfer}} {{reactions of}} amino acid derivatives {{are described in}} this thesis. Reaction of N-benzoylvaline methyl ester (29 a) with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> gave the β-chlorovaline derivative (30 a) and lesser amounts of diastereoisomers of the r-chlorovaline derivative (31 a). Studies of reactions of the valine derivatives (29 a-c) with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> and of the photolyses of the corresponding N-chlorovaline derivatives (39 a-c) {{have shown that the}} reaction of (29 a) with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and the photolysis of (39 a) involve regioselective intermolecular transfer of the respective β-valinyl hydrogens. There is no evidence of reaction at the corresponding a-positions. These reactions establish the chemical validity of a regiospecific hydrogen atom transfer proposed in penicillin biosynthesis and in the β-hydroxylation of valine residues in peptides. Factors affecting the production of amidocarboxy-substituted radicals have been investigated by examining reactions of derivatives of valine, alanine and glycine with a number of reagents. The variation in the regioselectivity of reactions of these compounds is typified by the reactions of (29 a) with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and N-bromosuccinimide. Whereas the reaction of (29 a) with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> involves hydrogen atom abstraction from the β-position of (29 a) with subsequent chlorine atom incorporation to give (30 a), the reaction with Nbromosuccinimide proceeds via hydrogen atom abstraction from the α-position of (29 a) and yields the dibromovaline derivative (76). The studies indicate that amidocarboxy-substituted radicals such as (34 a) are considerably more stable than, for example, the tertiary alkyl radical (32 a), but hydrogen atom transfer reactions may afford the less stable products if electrophilic radicals are involved in the hydrogen atom abstraction and if there is little development of radical character in the transition state of the reaction. The preferential reactivity of glycine residues in free radical reactions of proteins, peptides and other amino acid derivatives has been investigated by examination of reactions of derivatives of valine, alanine, glycine, methyl pyroglutamate and proline with NBS. The previously unexplained reactivity of glycine derivatives has been rationalised in terms of steric interactions and their effect on the conformation of the amidocarboxy-substituted captodative radical (41). The selective reactivity of glycine derivatives has been exploited synthetically. Reaction of the α-bromoglycine derivative (112 a), prepared by reaction of the glycine derivative (93 a) with NBS, with hexabutylditin under strictly anhydrous conditions gave the diasteroisomers of the glycine dimer (131). Otherwise the major products were the ethers (132 a) and (132 b). Selective functionalisation of the dipeptide (126 a) at the α-glycyl position was achieved by reaction with NBS. The regioselectively labelled dipeptide (126 b) was synthesised by reaction of the bromide (127) with triphenyltin deuteride...|$|E

It is suggested that when the aryl radical is of very different electronegativity from that of the solvent, it can be stabilised by formation of a pi-complex with the solvent. These pi-complexes can collapse into sigma-complexes, followed by their subsequent dimerisation and disproportionation. It is also proposed that fluorinated sigma-complexes can be defluorinated by elimination of a molecule of hydrogen fluoride between a sigma-complex resulting from substitution at a fluorine bearing carbon atom and a hydrogen substituted sigma-complex.

Xenon difluoride reacts violently with tungsten thiotetrafluoride in the solid state to yield tungsten hexafluoride, xenon and fluorides of sulphur. When the reaction is conducted in <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> fluoride at low-temperature a red-brown solution is formed. This has been shown to consist of tungsten hexafluoride and the radical cation, S 8 +. by n. m. r. and e. s. r. spectroscopy. The standard enthalpy of formation of tungsten thiotetrafluoride has been determined by hydrolysis in alkaline media...|$|E

(a) Reactions of Sulphanuric Halides The replacement of chlorine and fluorine in the sulphanuric halides (NSOCl) (_ 3) and (NSOF) (_ 3) by aliphatic, aromatic, amino and thioalkoxy groups has been investigated. The bromination and iodination of (NSOCl) (_ 3) was attempted, and the following new compounds were identified: (NS 0) (_ 3) Cl(_ 2) Me, (NS 0) (_ 3) Cl(C(_ 6) H(_ 3) Cl(_ 2)) (_ 2), (NS 0) (_ 3) F(Net(_ 2)) (_ 2), (NSO) (_ 3) F(NC(_ 8) H(_ 18)) (_ 2). Evidence was found {{for the existence of}} (NSONMe(_ 2)) (_ 3), (NSO) (_ 3) (SEt) (_n) Cl(_ 3 -n), (NSOBr) (_n), (NSOl) (_n) and (NSO) (_ 3) Ph(_ 2) (o-C(_ 6) H(_ 2) Cl(_ 3). The mass spectral fragmentation pattern of (NS 0) (_ 3) Ph(_ 2) F was investigated. (b) Reactions of (NSCl) (_ 3), S(_ 3) N(_ 2) Cl(_ 2) and their derivatives The investigation of the reactions of (NSCl) (_ 3) with epoxides and nitriles commenced by Dr. G. G. Alange (Ph. D. Thesis, University of Durham, August 1969) was continued, and extended to other strained and unsaturated systems, namely episulphides and isocyanates. The reaction with nitriles yielded products of the type S(_ 2) N(_ 2) CClR where R is phenyl, t-butyl and trichloromethyl. This system, S(_ 2) N(_ 2) CClR is compared with that of 1, 2, 5 -thiadiazoles and S(_ 3) N(_ 2) Cl(_ 2). A study of the reaction of S(_ 3) N(_ 2) C 1 (_ 2) with <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> led to a convenient new synthesis of trithiazyl trichloride. The reactions of S(_ 3) N(_ 2) C 1 (_ 2) with thionyl chloride and trichloromethylacetonitrile were also investigated. The reaction of epichlorohydrin with "(NSC 1) (_ 3) " - prepared by rapid chlorination by chlorine gas of S(_ 4) N(_ 4) - was investigated. Results of both sections are generally discussed and an appendix covers the use of the chlorine isotope pattern for identifying fragments in the mass spectrum...|$|E

40|$|Histochemical {{techniques}} {{suitable for}} fluorescence microscopy {{have been developed}} for the detection of the principal chemical groupings and substances likely to be present in tissue sections. The mechanisms and specificities of the chosen reactions were confirmed wherever possible. The following methods were found to be the most satisfactory for the detection of: Amines An extremely intense green fluorescent product was produced in sites of proteins in tissue sections treated witha methanolic solution of pyridine containing a few drops of aqueous cyanogen bromide solution (the König-Sassi reaction). Treatment of sections with an alkaline solution of salicylaldehyde gave a thermolabile, green fluorescent conjugate. Tryptophane residues gave a characteristic purple fluorescence after reaction with a solution of dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in hydrochloric acid. The complex formed by mixing solutions of Solochrome dyes and alum fluoresced red after adsorption onto acidophilic primary and polymethyl amino groups. Chloraraine T oxidised the primary amine groups of α-amino-acid residues to aldehydes which were subsequently demonstrated as their blue fluorescent salicyloylhydrasones. The specificity of the preceding reactions were confirmed by the following deamination experiments. The diazotisation of amine groups with a cold solution of sodium nitrite and sulphuric acid, followed by diazotisation with warm ethanol was usually effective, out took some time to accomplish. Oxidative deamination with a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite within the pH range 5. 5 - 7. 0 worked very efficiently and rapidly. Stable aldehydes were produced predominantly in nuclear sites provided the excess hypochlorite in the sections was destroyed by washing them in a neutral solution of ammonia containing a trace of copper sulphate. Cytophasmic proteins were probably converted to ketoacids. If sodium thiosulphate was used for destroying the excess hypochlorite, the induced aldehydes were destroyed. Instead strongly besophillc groupings, probably derivatives of sulphonic acids, were formed in both protoplasmic and nuclear proteins. Many of the reagents suggested by Danielli (1950) for blocking amine groups were found to be ineffective. Thiols Thiols condensed with N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) selectively to give a product containing an unconjugated ketone group. The zinc complex of the non-fluorescent hydrazone of the NEM-thiol conjugate derived from salicyloyl hydrazide fluoresced bluish-green. When all the basophilic substances and compounds containing hydroxyl groups were extracted from tissue sections by treating them with methanolic hydrochloric acid at 60 Â°- 90 Â° for several hours (drastic methylation), {{it was found that the}} remaining thiol groups could be converted to basophilic thiosulphonic acids by exposing dry sections afterwards to <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> vapour. These acid groups exhibited an anomalous bright blue fluorescence after the treated section had been stained in dilute solutions of auramine O or acridine yellow. Disulphides Oxidation with peracids yielded basophilic sulphinic acids which were unique in resisting methylation. Subsequent staining with coriphosphine gave an intense red fluorescence in the oxidised sites. Previous blocking of other basophilic materials with methanolic thionyl chloride and of thiols with iodoacetate was essential. Phenols Indirect method. Acidified solutions of 1 -nitroso- 2 -naphthol containing a trace of sodium nitrite coupled with tyrosine-rich sites to form an unstable green fluorescent conjugate. This test relied on the activating influence of the phenolic group on the ortho- and para- positions in the aromatic nucleus. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by iodinating these positions. Direct method. Dinitrofluorobenzene reacted only with phenols and thiols (but not amines) at a pH below 5. 5. By blocking the latter with iodoacetate, only the former reacted. The nitro groups of the conjugate were reduced to amines, but unfortunately attempts to demonstrate these groups by fluorescent methods (1) were unsuccessful. Carboxylic acids C-terminal carboxyl groups have been converted to methyl ketones by treating them with a mixture of acetic anhydride and pyridine at 60 Â°. The ketones thus formed were demonstrated as the Blue fluorescent zinc complexes of their salicyloyl hydrazones. This, and other experimental evidence, vitiated the hypothesis put forward by Karnovsky and Fasman (1960) that the principal reaction here was the conversion of the side-chain carboxyl groups to mixed acid anhydrides. Sites containing side-chain carboxyl groups were detected by the changes in the colour of their fluorescence from blue to green in tissue sections stained with 0. 01 % solutions of coriphosphine at pH 2 - 3 and at PH 5. The interference of the C- terminal carboxyl groups was eliminated by previously converting then to their methyl ketones (5 a). RNA was also extracted beforehand with hot perchloric acid. Nucleic acids Zirconium ions had en affinity for the phosphate groups of both types of nucleic acid which were subsequently demonstrated as their greenish-yellow fluorescent complex with morin. DNA yielded an aldehyde after brief (Feulgen) hydrolysis which was subsequently detectable as its blue fluorescent salicyloyl hydrazone. Sulphates No direct chemical methods have been found, but the presence of this group (in acid mucopolysaccharides) was inferred from the following tests: Their basophilia (towards coriphosphine) when counterstained with the acid dye, thiazol yellow. Acid mucopolysaccharides, containing only acid groups, exhibited the brown or red fluorescence of coriphosphine, while the nucleic acids and proteins fluoresced a light yellow or blue as a result of the very strong interaction between their basic amino groups and the acid dye. Their basophilia (towards coriphosphine) after selective extraction of nucleic acids. Methylation and reduction of tissue sections with lithium aluminium hydride in hot dioxane removed phosphate groups selectively. Uronic acid groups and some protein carboxyl groups were reduced to primary alcohols. Subsequent saponification and staining showed a reddish-brown fluorescence in sites containing acid mucopolysaccharides which contrasted with the weak green fluorescence of the remainder of the section. Hot perchloric acid has been used for the selective extraction of RNA. Other mineral acids and nucleases were found to be unsatisfactory for the selective extraction of nucleic fields because acid mucopolysaccharides were removed at the same time. Mild methods of methylation (using methanolic thionyl chlorine or diazomethane) have been successfully used for both the temporary and permanent blocking of sulphate and other basophilic groups. The normal technique for methylating tissues, using hot methanolic solutions of hydrochloric acid (Fisher and Lillie, 195 U) were found to be unsatisfactory; much of the reactive material was extracted from tissue sections instead of being methylated. Sulphated acid mucopolysaccharides were desulphated to a limited extent by this reagent. Using published methods based upon iron mordants (Hicks and Mathaei, 1958; Hale, 1946), it was found that acid mucopolysaccharides did not always take up ferric ions whereas nucleic acids did. Experimental evidence has been collected to show that the results published previously were fortuitously successful and were not strictly specific. Uronic acids Sections were reduced with lithium aluminium hydride (7 b) to show that the non-fluorescent dye alcian blue had a selective affinity for this group. When sections were stained with coriphosphine, they were first stained with alcian blue so as to quench the potential fluorescence of coriphosphine adsorbed onto acid mucopolysaccharides which otherwise would have been difficult to distinguish from that of nuclei. An intense blue fluorescence and a visible purple colour was observed in sites known to contain uronic acid groups after immersing sections in concentrated sulphuric acid at 60 - 75 Â°. vic-Glycols 1, 2 -glycols were cleaved to "dialdehydes" by periodic acid. Those in neutral mucopolysaccharides and glycogen were oxidised completely within 10 minutes. Those in acid mucopolysaccharide required 24 hours or longer before they were oxidised significantly. The engendered dialdehydes have been conjugated with: solutions of homo- and heterocyclic amines (particularly aminoacridine dyes) containing dissolved sulphur dioxide (pseudo-Schiff reagents). Preliminary blocking with methanolic thionyl chloride of the basophilic substance initially present in tissue sections was essential for the observation of specific staining of the engendered dialdehydes. Protein thiol groups nevertheless still interfered with the specificity of the reaction for glycols. Evidence has been accumulated in favour of the following mechanism for this type of reaction which differs from that suggested by Kasten (1958); the engendered dialdehydes take up sulphur dioxide from the dye solution to form sulphenic acids which subsequently combine with the basic dye in a salt-like linkage. Apart from p-aminosalicylic acid, no potentially fluorescent amine has been found to condense with engendered aldehydes in situ, contrary to what Kasten (1958) conjectured and to the numerous reports of fluorescent anil formation of aldehydes in solution. Recent chemical work (Guthrie and Honeyman 1959) has indicated that hydrazines and hydrazides always react with engendered dialdehydes whereas Schiff-type reagents may not, particularly if the dialdehydes are converted to hemiacetal or hemialdol forms. This fact has been confirmed histochemically: salicyloyl hydrazide formed intensely blue fluorescent complexes reliably and more extensively with engendered dialdehydes than do pseudo-Schiff reagents. Moreover, salicyloyl hydrazides did not form any fluorescent artefacts with protein thiol groups after oxidation in periodic acid (Cf. 9 a). The phenylhydrazones of the dialdehydes formed in situ, unlike those in vitro, did not form formazans except with diazotised aniline in pyrnine. Hydroxyl groups The basophilic properties (towards azure A or coriphosphine) of this group after it had been sulphated were studied. The sulphating efficiencies of various Lewis base complexes of sulphur trioxide were investigated in both acid end basic media. The dioxan-sulphur trioxide dissolved in the weak base dimethylformamide (DMF) or sulphur trioxide dissolved in DMF were very efficient sulphating reagents, even for glycogen which could not be sulphated by acidic sulphating reagents. The amine groups of proteins were sulphated simultaneously by the DMF-sulphur trioxide complex. However, the N-sulphate groups, unlike O- sulphate groups, were easily hydrolysed off by methanolic hydrochloric acid at room temperature. If the amine groups were protected beforehand with suitable blocking reagents, the access of the sulphating complex to hydroxyl groups was completely hindered. Although glycogen in tissue sections can be sulphated normally by <b>sulphuryl</b> <b>chloride</b> vapour, the hydroxyl groups of neutral mucopolysaccharides were not sulphated in the same way: it is Relieved that in the latter, non-basophilic cyclic sulphate groups were formed. Primary hydroxyl groups The selective sulphation and subsequent basophilia (towards azure A or coriphosphine) of this group by the pyridine-sulphur trioxide complex in the DMF was investigated. Lipids Unsaturated lipids were oxidised by peracetic acid to aldehydes and subsequently condensed with salicyloyl hydrazide to form a blue fluorescent hydrazone. Lipids emitted a reddish-pink fluorescence when sections were stained with an acidified solution of protoporphyrin IX. Ketosteroids formed blue fluorescent salicyloyl hydrazones, most of whom, unlike aldehydo -salicyloylhydrazones, were stable towards alkalis. The interfering aldehydes originating from the autooxidation of lipids were blocked with sulphanilic acid. </ol...|$|E
