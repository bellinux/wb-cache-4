In 2017, during his second spell with the club, Milanič won his fifth title with Maribor. Olimpija has won four titles, all in successive years between 1992 and 1995. In addition, Olimpija is the only Slovenian football champion no longer in existence, having been dissolved {{by the end of}} the 2004–05 season when they filed for bankruptcy. Tied with four championships is Gorica who won their first title in 1996 and an additional three in successive years between 2004 and 2006.

However, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, the team that advanced farthest in the UEFA competitions that season. Maribor have the best top-flight record in history, having finished below fourth place only once.

40|$|Aim To develop Croatian and <b>Slovenian</b> <b>versions</b> of the 14 -item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) Questionnaire. Methods The English {{original}} {{version of the}} OHIP questionnaire was translated into Croatian (OHIP-CRO 14) and Slovenian (OHIPSVN 14) language by a forward-backward translation method. The {{psychometric properties of the}} OHIP-CRO 14 and OHIP-SVN 14 were tested. Concurrent validity was tested on 623 subjects (193 Croatian and 430 Slovenian), test-retest reliability on 115 subjects (55 Croatian and 60 Slovenian), internal consistency on 678 subjects (218 Croatian and 460 Slovenian), and responsiveness on 51 patients (21 Croatian and 30 Slovenian) in demand of treatment (toothache). Results Concurrent validity was confirmed by the association between the OHIP summary scores and self-reported oral health (correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 40 to 0. 60, P< 0. 001). Test-retest reliability showed high intraclass correlation (correlation coefficients, 0. 79 - 0. 94). Internal consistency showed high Cronbach α (0. 77 - 0. 91). Responsiveness was confirmed by {{a significant difference between the}} mean OHIP score at baseline and follow-up (P< 0. 001 for both Croatian and Slovenian patients) and high effect size in Croatian and Slovenian patients in demand of treatment (3. 00 and 0. 57, respectively). Conclusion Psychometric properties of OHIP-CRO 14 and OHIPSVN 14 render these instruments suitable for the assessment of Oral Health Related Quality of Life in Croatia and Slovenia...|$|R

40|$|Research into {{cognitive}} {{aspects of}} survey response has indicated unfamiliar terms {{as one of}} the psycholinguistic determinants of question comprehensibility problems. In this paper the estimates of wording familiarity based on text corpora for the English and Slovenian languages were used to detect potentially incomprehensible wordings in two web survey questionnaires for international exchange students at the University of Ljubljana, one for incoming (English) and the other for outgoing students (<b>Slovenian).</b> Two <b>versions</b> of the questionnaire were developed for each language, one with low-frequency (complex) and the other with high-frequency (improved) wordings, and compared in a split-ballot experiment.

40|$|The MA {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} topic of the language aptitude – a complex of basic abilities that facilitate foreign language learning – of Year 5 students in Slovenia and in the Slovenian minority in the Gorizia’s province in Italy. The theoretical part defines the concept of language aptitude, its important role in the school context and some different examples of tests that measure learners’ language aptitude. Furthermore, the differences between the second and the third language acquisition are described. The phenomenon of multilingualism is defined and its important advantages of the third language learning process. The empirical part investigates the language aptitude of Year 5 students. In the research study, 234 Slovenian and Slovene minority students from the Gorizia’s province in Italy were tested using the <b>Slovenian</b> elementary <b>version</b> of the Modern Language Aptitude Test (SloMLAT-E). They also filled in the attitude and motivational scale for learning English as a foreign language and took an English language proficiency test. The results show that the average level of language aptitude of year 5 students varies, but is generally quite high. The correlation between the level of the measured language aptitude and the results on the English proficiency test is statistically significant and moderate positive. On the other hand, the results show a statistically significant but weak positive relation between the level of the measured language aptitude and the learners’ motivation to learn English. This may prove that the language aptitude is an individual difference – which influences the process of language learning but is not strongly connected with the foreign language learning motivation. The results also show statistically significant differences between learners with a different mother tongue in different subcomponents of language aptitude (in the vocabulary knowledge and in the sound-symbol association, in the grammatical sensitivity and in the ability to hear and make distinction between speech sounds) and in the relationship between the language aptitude and English language proficiency. Finally, it may be assumed that the formal learning of a foreign language is positively correlated to formal learning of other foreign languages...|$|R

40|$|EXTENDED ABSTRACT: On January 19 th 2012 Apple {{launched}} iBooks® 2 for iPad® - a {{new application}} for downloading digital content to the iPad - {{and the new}} software (iBooks Author®) which allows creating and publishing digital content using the. iba digital format and all-new iTunes® application offering access {{to a variety of}} digitised educational content. Our aim was to test the attractiveness of the new Apple releases and the effect of a relatively easy access to the world market of digital content on the promotion of Slovenian cultural heritage. We added three books to the iTunes digital collection which might be of interest to the general public: a re-edition of a scientific monograph by Andrej Pleterski: Mythical Reality of the Carintian Dukes' Stones (Mitska stvarnost knežjega kamna) in <b>Slovenian</b> and German <b>version</b> and a non-fiction iBook by Benjamin Štular: Ljubljana in the Middle Ages. Archaeological Research (Srednjeveška Ljubljana. Arheološke raziskave). The digital version of the Andrej Pleterski's book was chosen for the actuality of the topic in Slovenia and Austria. People and politicians in Carinthia were annoyed by the book contents as it was published by the Regional Museum in Klagenfurt in December 2011. While the science in this book is sound it has been abused to meet the current needs of some of the Carinthian politicians. The incident was polemically reflected in the main Slovenian newspapers, too. The non-fiction iBook was selected because of the attractiveness of the theme, besides a lot of multimedia content had already been created and could be easily published to Apple's iBookstore. All three iBooks were posted to iTunes® less than three weeks after the release of the iBooks Author application to create digital content. We wish to present our experience with the applicability of the new medium, users' feedback and access statistics. Guidelines for Apple licenses are presented. The applicability of the new medium {{and its impact on the}} popularisation of the Slovenian cultural heritage was evaluated on the basis of the usage statistics in the first two months. </p...|$|R
