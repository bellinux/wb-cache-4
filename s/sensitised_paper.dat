He brought it out to us in the drawing-room. I glanced at it first. It was a curious countenance, slightly wanting in definiteness, and not unlike those [...] "composite photographs" [...] which Mr. Galton produces by exposing two negatives on the same <b>sensitised</b> <b>paper</b> for ten seconds or so consecutively. Yet it struck me at once as containing something of Colonel Clay in every one of his many representations. The little curate, in real life, did not recall the Seer; nor did Elihu Quackenboss suggest Count von Lebenstein or Professor Schleiermacher. Yet in this compound face, produced only from photographs of David Granton and Medhurst, I could distinctly trace a certain underlying likeness to every one of the forms which the impostor had assumed for us. In other words, though he could make up so as to mask the likeness to his other characters, he could not make up so as to mask the likeness to his own personality. He could not wholly get rid of his native build and his genuine features.|$|E
50|$|The fultograph was an early, {{clockwork}} image-receiving device, {{similar in}} function to fax machines. It took {{signals from the}} loudspeaker socket of a radio receiver and used an electrochemical process to darken areas of <b>sensitised</b> <b>paper</b> wrapped on a rotating drum. Invented by Otho Fulton, the system was used briefly in the late 1920s to broadcast images to homes by radio. The machines themselves were expensive (£22 15s 0d in 1928) and required a good receiver to operate.|$|E
50|$|When Jane Martha St. John finally {{acquired}} a camera {{of her own}} {{some time in the}} 1850s, she sent her photos to friends and family. Some {{can be seen in the}} album of her cousin Emma Thomasina's daughter, Emma Charlotte (1837-1929), now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was not until the late 1850s that Jane made a family album of her own which she used for the photos she received from others as well as those she took herself. In the late 1850s Jane and Edward had set off equipped with a camera and <b>sensitised</b> <b>paper</b> on a journey through France to Italy, where more than one hundred times she positioned her camera to record the scenes that she liked most, to be dwelt upon when she got home. Her album of that tour containing one hundred and six of these Italian views is now in the J. Paul Getty Museum.|$|E
5000|$|Talbot {{made his}} first {{successful}} camera photographs in 1835 using <b>paper</b> <b>sensitised</b> with silver chloride, which darkened in proportion to its exposure to light. This early [...] "photogenic drawing" [...] process was a printing-out process, i.e., the paper had to be exposed in the camera until the image was fully visible. A very long exposure—typically an hour or more—was required to produce an acceptable negative.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{were made}} on the {{abnormal}} characteristics of streamer figures along the organic 	membrane， and considering from the arc resistance characteristics of electrical insulating 	materials， the authors elucidated the essential meaning there of. 	It is pointed out that this sparking figure is a peculiar one for the high potential arc 	showing one of the aspects of high potential arc damages. Hence， by studying closely the 	previous burning damage together with this abnormal figure， the outline of damages of 	insulating materials can be cleared out. 	Here， <b>sensitised</b> <b>paper</b> serves {{as a sort of}} measuring instrument...|$|E
