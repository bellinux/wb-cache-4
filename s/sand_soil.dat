5|$|Cullacabardee {{is located}} over an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound, a major supplier of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution Control Area under the Water Authority Act 1984 and a Priority 1 drinking water source by the Department of Water. A survey of soils {{in the area in}} April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean <b>Sand</b> <b>soil</b> association, and is a leached white siliceous sand of mineral quartz, with negligible phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered jarrah.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus are eurychoric; {{they have}} a {{widespread}} geographic distribution in many different climates, but they are usually found in dry and mesic habitats. They {{are referred to as}} a tropical genus, but the type specimen was collected from temperate Sydney. They are found in sclerophyll woodland and forests, eucalypt woodland, Casuarina forests, mallee, hillsides, beaches and urban areas. These ants are arboreal ants and nests are located in bark, logs, rotten wood, <b>sand,</b> <b>soil,</b> under rocks and stones, tree stumps and twigs or branches. In urban areas, colonies are found under cracked paths, inside house walls or in patio areas. Some species are considered pests, and they forage into pastures and houses where they show a preference for fluids and sweets. Ochetellus flavipes nesting habits are unique among Australian ants, and they construct small runways across the ground. These nests are structurally similar to nests built by some Polyrhachis ants, which construct platforms woven from plants that house the Hemiptera insects they attend to.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{researches}} {{have been}} {{focusing on the}} roles of fines in liquefaction resistance of <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils</b> (<b>sand</b> dominant <b>soil</b> that contains little presenting fines). It {{has been reported that}} the presence of plastic fines would either imposed additional liquefaction resistance of <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils</b> or caused reduction to the liquefaction resistance. This paper aims to present the liquefaction resistance of <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils</b> with respect to different fines content based on the results from cyclic tests using triaxial testing system. The <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils</b> were reconstituted by mixing the plastic fines (kaolin and bentonite) to the clean sand at seven different percentages by weight. Results showed that liquefaction resistance of <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils</b> decreases with an increase of fines content until a minimal value and increases thereafter. It was identified that the presence of fine contents to give the minimum liquefaction resistance were 20 % for sand-bentonite mixtures and 25 % for sand-kaolin mixtures. These values represent the threshold fines content for respective mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{roots are}} very {{effective}} in controlling concentrated flow erosion. Several studies quantified the erosion-reducing effects of plants with different root traits. This is useful for practitioners who want to evaluate suitable plant species to improve slope stability. So far, most research on the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots focused on silt loam soils whereas no or little research exists for <b>sand</b> <b>soils.</b> These soils are common and are also very prone to incisive erosion processes resulting {{in the formation of}} e. g. large gullies. At present, no specific relationship between root variables and their erosion-reducing potential exists to reliably assess the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots in <b>sand</b> <b>soils.</b> Therefore the first objective {{of this study was to}} assess the erosion-reducing potential of grass and carrot roots in <b>soils</b> with a <b>sand</b> content of 94 % through concentrated flow experiments. Our second objective was to compare the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots in sand and silt loam <b>soils.</b> For <b>sand</b> <b>soils,</b> the results show a strong erosion-reducing effect for fibrous roots while this effect was less pronounced for tap roots. This results in a negative root diameter effect showing that thicker tap roots are less effective in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates compared to thin tap roots and fibrous roots. New relationships were established between the root variables root density (RD) and root length density (RLD) and the erosion-reducing potential expressed as a soil detachment ratio of the root-permeated soil sample compared to a bare reference sample (SDR). Soil texture plays a significant role in this relationship as revealed by comparing results for sand and silt loam soils. The nature of this soil texture effect is root-architecture dependent. Fibrous roots are much more effective in <b>sand</b> <b>soils</b> compared to silt loam soils while this effect is opposite for tap roots which are less effective in <b>sand</b> <b>soils.</b> The latter can be attributed to more pronounced vortex erosion around the thicker tap roots in <b>sand</b> <b>soils.</b> These results can be used by practitioners to assess the likely erosion-reducing effect of plant species based on root characteristics (i. e. root (length) density and diameter) and soil texture. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Natural sand does always contain {{significant}} amounts of fine particles, known as <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils.</b> The development of critical state for sand and clay are both well established. However, limited researchers focused on the <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils.</b> This paper discusses the effect of fines content on the critical state parameters of <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils.</b> Two types of plastic fines with different plasticity (kaolin and bentonite) were mixed into poorly graded Johor clean sand at different percentages to form the <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils.</b> The critical state {{was obtained from the}} strain controlled triaxial compression test. All tested soils had been isotropically consolidated to four different effective confining pressures and sheared under consolidated undrained condition until the critical state was ascertained. The critical state line was plotted for each <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils</b> on space and compression spaces. Based on linear regression analysis, the critical state parameters, M, λ and Γ were obtained and the ranges are from 0. 807 to 1. 102, 0. 062 to 0. 160 and 1. 732 to 2. 431, respectively. The trend of the critical state lines of <b>sand</b> matrix <b>soils</b> in both stress and compression space coincides with the concept of threshold fines content. The threshold fines content identified for sand-kaolin mixtures is 25 % kaolin while it is 20 % bentonite for sand-bentonite mixtures...|$|R
