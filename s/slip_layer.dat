One of the important groups of these findings is the moldmade bowls, familiarly known as the Megarian bowls from the Hellenistic period (330 - 30 B. C.). In a frame of an archaeometry project work, these artifacts were characterized with different analytical techniques. Wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to study chemical and mineralogical composition of the bodies.

A {{model of}} {{creation}} a streaming potential U {{as a result}} of colloidal particle movement in flow in a capillary has been described previously (Zawada 1996) as well as the systems for measurement (Zawada 1990, 1991). The lling of capillary with a solution of liposomes results in a labile adsor-bance of liposomes on a capillary glass and changes the measured streaming po-tential. In order to minimalize these adverse eects, the capillary was covered with phospholipid layer of dierent composition. Some concentrations of stearylamine as a component of the phospholipid layer may fully compensate the surface charge of the glass capillary and can reduce the liposomes adsorption. The streaming po-tential of the liposomes solution depends on the ionic strength of the electrolyte and is smaller than the potential for similar liposomes. This suggests that only a part of ions of the liposome ion atmosphere participate in creating of the streaming potential. These are the ions from the hydrodynamic <b>slipping</b> <b>layer.</b> The regression analysis of the relationships between streaming potential U and concentration of liposomes and next ionic strength of the electrolyte gave the value of the surface potential Ψ 0 and the thickness of the hydrodynamic <b>slipping</b> <b>layer</b> d, that is inde-pendent of the ionic strength...|$|R

Both the drag-induced splane Couetted and pressure-induced scapillary and slitd flows generate the same dependencies of the wall-slip velocity on the wall shear stress.

The aim of the study was identifying the true provenance of the finds, defining technological level and clarifying trade relations between Egnazia and the Mediterranean Basin. Morpho–mineralogical investigation has been performed by polarized–light Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) and chemical analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP–MS). Multivariate statistical techniques, such as Principal Components Analysis and Clustering Analysis, have been used for treating the compositional data matrix, in order to compare chemical and morpho–mineralogical features with stylistic and typological ones. The analytical results on the ceramic bodies allow us to correctly classify the finds, shedding light on the use of different raw materials compatible with a provenance from North Africa – Northern and Central Tunisia – and Egnatia respectively. Moreover, morpho–mineralogical analysis on surfaces of the import oil lamps has highlighted two different production technologies: most import items have shown no clayey slip, so the brightness is due to a superficial polish process before firing; a few import samples show a superficial <b>slip</b> <b>layer,</b> probably obtained by refining the clay used for the body.

The Midorigaoka 4 -chome (Midorigaoka # 4) subdivision {{in the southern part}} of Sendai City sprawled across the flatland stretching between the terrace and valley floor. The large landslides, the Midorigaoka # 4 landslide, occurred in the widening fills of the lower part of this subdivision. The fills consist of soft and loose mixed bedrock material, sand, clay, and sandy silt with gravel. The humid top soil of original ground surface was found at the boundary of the fill and bedrock. The ground water level was very shallow - 0. 5 m to 1. 1 m below the ground surface - indicating that the fills were nearly saturated by ground water. Measurements on ground inclination using borehole inclinometers, and pore water pressure changes were made from June 2011 with high precision time interval of 100 Hz. Surface seismic velocity was observed at the head of the landslide in 200 Hz. The longtime slow landslide movements including bedrocks were observed from the beginning of the observations until December 2011 to January 2012 as the after effect of the main shock. The inclination rate at the top soils was greater than two times of the rate at the bedrock. The contrast in strength between the fill and bedrock is clear, and soft top soils exist at the boundary. Thus the major landslide is thought to move along the bottom of the fill, and the top soils should be considered as the <b>slip</b> <b>layer</b> of the landslide. The largest seismic response of inclination was found at the weak layers, at the top soils of the base of fills and at the fragile lignite layer of bedrocks. In contrast, the reduction of response at the upper part of fills was remarkable in case that the weak layers developed at the lower. These results indicate the self-dumping at the weak layers in ground structure. The effects of self-dumping varied depend on the thickness of weak layers and distance from epicenters. Excess pore water pressure in the landslide increased in direct proportion to horizontal PGV during earthquakes. This relation suggests that the landslide was initiated by the fully loss of shear strength of <b>slip</b> <b>layer</b> caused by increase of excess pore water pressure during the strong seismic motion over 80 cm/s of PGV of the main shock. The failure process at the <b>slip</b> <b>layer</b> of landslide developed from small local failures to landslide movement was found by chance.

Concrete pressure gradient over the hose length (dp/dx) and flow rate were measured to quantify pumpability. The rheological properties of the pumped mortars were measured with a ConTec BML viscometer. Finally, the rheological properties of the <b>slip</b> <b>layer</b> that occurs in vicinity of {{the wall of the}} hose during pumping was studyed as matrix phase (paste and filler < 0. 125 mm) in a parallel plate rheometer. Five different concrete mixes were investigated showing that slump flow is not suitable for differentiating pumpability. Interpretation of rheological data was, moreover, complicated since the measured values of plastic viscosity and yield stress were altered simultaneously from mix to mix. The data imply that both yield stress and plastic viscosity govern pumpability. Increased plastic viscosity of mortar and paste was found to correlate with decreased mortar pumpability. No clear trends could be found for mortar yield stress. Increased paste yield stress was, however surprisingly, related to increased pumpability. The plastic viscosity seemed, however, to dominate yield stress when the two factors varied simultaneously within the given workability range. These parameters should, therefore, not be studied independently. Increased hysteresis area calculated from the paste measurements correlated well with reduced pump flow, also indicating a relation to the rheology of the <b>slip</b> <b>layer.</b> The predicted pressure losses were 5 - 7 times higher than the measured values. This indicates that {{one or more of the}} premises of the Buckingham-Reiner equation are erroneous in these tests, like inhomogeneous fluid and slippage. The existence of a plug is due to yield stress which was observed in both matrix and mortar. The combination of instrumented steady state pumping, concentric viscometre, parallel plate viscometer and visualized boundary flow rate were used to estimate <b>slip</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. The modified Buckingham Reiner equation resulted in slip zone thickness in the order of 0. 6 – 1 mm. The thicknesses were not sensitive to variations in matrix yield stress, whereas plastic viscosity had a major effect as shown in plots of slip zone viscosity vs slip zone thickness. At the slip zone thickness corresponding to the matrix rheology, the calculated specific viscosities (Pa•s/m) were all similar to the lowest values reported by Kaplan (2001). The average rates of shear in the thinnest slip zone were estimated to be as high as 1000 [s- 1]. This is much higher than those used in the parallel plate viscometer [100 s- 1] and future parallel plate viscometre test made in conjunction with studies of this kind should be carried out to 1000 [s- 1]. Based on a few flow profile calculations and comparison with visualized profiles it seems reasonable to assume that the rheological properties of the concrete are not constant, but vary over the cross section of the tube and possibly also along the tube due to factors such as tixotropic behaviour, possibly shear thickening, stiffening, wall effects and/or segregation under shear. Some investigations of effect of pumping on compressive strength were made by measuring strength on cubes made from concrete before and after pumping. These showed negligible effects of pumping on strength. Further research recommendations are given. © Copyright SINTEF Building and Infrastructure 201...|$|E

30|$|While {{particle}} collisions {{in highly}} sheared and/or highly concentrated zones enforce particles to migrate from these zones, it is counterbalanced {{by the local}} increase in concrete viscosity resulting from this migration (i.e. in the bulk). The shear induced particle migration (Choi et al. 2013 a) {{is due to the}} competition between gradients in particle collision frequency and gradients in the viscosity of concrete within a pipe. When cement particles migrate, they encounter a high viscosity of bulk concrete, in which sand and gravel particles have already migrated and should be prevented from migrating inside the bulk. Therefore, the migration of small particles like cement particles can be neglected, compared to the migration of large particles, such as sand and gravel particles.

Neglecting contributions from third neighbour layers and beyond to differences in total energy, it is concluded that 19 stacking models of kaolin layers are prime candidates for the lowest enthalpy under moderate pressure. Ab initio compression of those models up to 60 GPa shows that, although several of the above models come close to kaolinite in enthalpy, kaolinite probably survives compression up to ~ 12 GPa. Beyond this pressure, a new family of kaolin polytypes with lower enthalpy than kaolinite, resulting from a different <b>layer</b> <b>slipping</b> mechanism, is spontaneously produced by ab initio compression. The silicon coordination transforms gradually from tetrahedra to triangular dipyramids with no drastic change to layer architecture. Corresponding distinguishable transformations between adjacent layers resulting from this new coordination are translations -a/ 3 and (a+b) / 3, which are not possible translations at zero pressure. Numerous low enthalpy new polytypes based on those translations are possible. Compression to 20 GPa of two kaolin polytypes among the 19 models created above have spontaneously resulted, one into the repeated (a+b) / 3 polytype with symmetry Cm, and the other one into the repeated -a/ 3 polytype with symmetry P 1. As both models derive from kaolinite by a <b>layer</b> <b>slipping</b> mechanism and have very similar enthalpies, both considerably lower than that of kaolinite, those phases and the polytypes from the same family are prime candidates for post-kaolinite phases beyond ~ 12 GPa.

25|$|The {{principle}} of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger <b>layer</b> cannot <b>slip</b> beneath a <b>layer</b> previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers {{to be viewed as}} a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.|$|R
40|$|In nanostructured {{metallic}} multilayers, hardness {{and strength}} are greatly enhanced {{compared to their}} microstructured counterparts. As layer thickness is decreased, three different regions are frequently observed: the first region shows Hall-Petch behavior; the second region shows an even greater dependence on layer thickness; and the third region exhibits a plateau or softening of hardness and strength. The second and third regions are studied using our discrete dislocation simulation method. This method includes the effects of stress due to lattice mismatch, misfit dislocation substructure, and applied stress on multilayer strength. To do so, we study the propagation of existing threading and interfacial dislocations as the applied stress is increased to the macroyield point. Our results show that in region 2, dislocation propagation is confined to individual layers initially. This "confined <b>layer</b> <b>slip</b> " builds up interfacial content and redistributes stress so that ultimately, the structure can no longer confine slip. The associated macroyield stress in this region depends strongly on layer thickness. In region 3, layers are so thin that confined <b>layer</b> <b>slip</b> is not possible and the macroyield stress reaches a plateau that is independent of layer thickness...|$|R
