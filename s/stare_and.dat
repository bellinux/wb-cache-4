25|$|It can {{sometimes}} be difficult to distinguish between eye symptoms due to hyperthyroidism and those due to Graves' antibodies, {{not in the least}} because the two often occur coincidently. What can make things particularly difficult, is that many patients with hyperthyroidism have lid retraction, which leads to <b>stare</b> <b>and</b> lid lag (due to contraction of the levator palpebrae muscles of the eyelids). This stare may then give the appearance of protruding eyeballs (proptosis), when none in fact exists. This subsides when the hyperthyroidism is treated.|$|E
500|$|Fearing {{that her}} mother was {{becoming}} too ill to cope, in 2005 (at age 17) Manning returned to the United States. She moved in with her father in Oklahoma City, where he was living with his second wife and her child. Manning got a job as a developer with a software company, Zoto, and was apparently happy for a time, but was let go after four months. Her boss told The Washington Post that on a few occasions Manning had [...] "just locked up" [...] and would simply sit and <b>stare,</b> <b>and</b> in the end communication became too difficult. The boss told the newspaper that [...] "nobody's been taking care of this kid for a really long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Its {{influence}} {{can be seen in}} the dismissive <b>stare</b> <b>and</b> overwhelming {{physical presence}} of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, [...] "Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her [...] "massive, monumental presence". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, [...] "That's Madame Bertin!" ...|$|E

500|$|The common {{starling}} {{was first}} described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 under its current binomial name. Sturnus and vulgaris {{are derived from}} the Latin for [...] "starling" [...] and [...] "common" [...] respectively. The Old English staer, later <b>stare,</b> <b>and</b> the Latin sturnus are both derived from an unknown Indo-European root {{dating back to the}} second millennium BC. [...] "Starling" [...] was first recorded in the 11th century, when it referred to the juvenile of the species, but by the 16th century it had already largely supplanted [...] "stare" [...] to refer to birds of all ages. The older name is referenced in William Butler Yeats' poem [...] "The Stare's Nest by My Window". The International Ornithological Congress' preferred English vernacular name is common starling.|$|E

You lose the body; you get softer shoulders, you slump, you create a little gut." [...] He is almost there. [...] "Then you extend the neck and you do a little duck walk." [...] He walks across the room. Add ill-fitting clothes, mop-top hair, a pair of {{oversize}} glasses and a cold <b>stare,</b> <b>and</b> the impersonation is complete.|$|E
2500|$|Both the Doctor and the Master {{have been}} shown to be skilled hypnotists, {{although}} the Master's capacity to dominate – even by <b>stare</b> <b>and</b> voice alone – has been shown to be far more pronounced. In Logopolis the Doctor said of the Master, [...] "He's a Time Lord. In many ways, we have the same mind." [...] The Master is often able to anticipate the Doctor's moves, as seen in stories such as Castrovalva, The Keeper of Traken, Time-Flight, and The King's Demons, where he plans elaborate traps for the Doctor, only revealing his presence at the key moment. In The Deadly Assassin, the Master was able to send a false premonition as a telepathic message to the Doctor, but it is unclear whether he performed this through innate psychic ability, or was aided technologically.|$|E

2500|$|The Stewarts {{attempted}} {{to sell their}} house, but with no success. [...] In 1886, they began renting Stewart's Castle, fully furnished, to the Chinese Legation for $10,000 a year. [...] When Stewart was reelected to the Senate in 1887, the family rented a house on H Street. [...] Although Chinese diplomats had been in Washington, D.C. for several years, they still drew curious looks from locals. [...] Nearby residents found {{the activities of the}} Chinese diplomatic corps to be peculiar, including staff doing laundry in what was now called Dupont Circle and playing hide-and-seek at night. [...] When staff went out on the balconies of Stewart's Castle, onlookers would <b>stare</b> <b>and</b> police would eventually ask the public to move. [...] Staff would sometimes use the large ballroom as a place to smoke opium.|$|E
2500|$|Madame Vigée Le Brun also {{describes}} the empress at a gala: [...] "The double doors {{opened and the}} Empress appeared. I have {{said that she was}} quite small, and yet on the days when she made her public appearances, with her head held high, her eagle-like <b>stare</b> <b>and</b> a countenance accustomed to command, all this gave her such an air of majesty that to me she might have been Queen of the World; she wore the sashes of three orders, and her costume was both simple and regal; it consisted of a muslin tunic embroidered with gold fastened by a diamond belt, and the full sleeves were folded back in the Asiatic style. Over this tunic she wore a red velvet dolman with very short sleeves. The bonnet which held her white hair was not decorated with ribbons, but with the most beautiful diamonds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{perception}} of the supermodel as an industry has been frequent {{inside and outside the}} fashion press, from complaints that women desiring this status become unhealthily thin to charges of racism, where the [...] "supermodel" [...] generally has to conform to a Northern European standard of beauty {{in the first decade of}} the twenty-first century. According to fashion writer Guy Trebay of The New York Times, in 2007, the [...] "android" [...] look was popular, a vacant <b>stare</b> <b>and</b> thin body serving, according to some fashion industry conventions, to set off the couture. This had not always been the case. In the 1970s, black, heavier and [...] "ethnic" [...] models dominated the runways but social changes in the 1980s to the early 2000s persuaded the power players in the fashion industry to shun suggestions of [...] "otherness". There have been high-profile suicides by models linked to pressure from the fashion industry or depression such as the case of Ruslana Korshunova and Daul Kim.|$|E
