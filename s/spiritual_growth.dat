5|$|Sthiti (the {{duration}} of the karmic bond) – The karmic bond remains latent and bound to the consciousness up to the time it is activated. Although latent karma {{does not affect the}} soul directly, its existence limits the <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth</b> of the soul. Jain texts provide the minimum and the maximum duration for which such karma is bound before it matures.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often {{taught about}} the Raëlian {{perspective}} {{of the body and}} sexuality. She discussed these topics from a biological perspective, arguing that humans are essentially robots because they can be reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the freedom to choose from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit of femininity as a method of <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth.</b> The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as a role model.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2013–14 Big East season, Dunham was named to the All-Big East Second Team. Despite his improvements, Butler had a lackluster season, finishing with a 14–17 overall record and bowing out to Seton Hall in the Big East Tournament. Dunham finished the season seventh in the Big East in scoring with a 16.4 points per game average to go along with 4 rebounds per game. Dunham shot 39 percent from the field and 35.5 from 3-point range. He hit a 3-pointer in 29 of the team's 31 games.

Athletes in Action is a Christian group that helps athletes use sports for <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Office of Mission and Ministry, Global Outreach (GO!) operates as a cultural immersion and service program where students learn about various issues of social, economic, political, and environmental injustice while living a simple lifestyle that fosters communal and <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth.</b> Teams consist of approximately 10 students, one student leader, and one chaperone to live, work, and learn with partnering organizations. Building on the Jesuit tenets of Men and Women for Others, Magis, and Contemplatives in Action, GO! has grown {{over the years to}} include more than 30 projects throughout the United States and countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. GO!'s roots stretch back to the 1950s, when Fordham students were participating in various service and immersion projects. In the 1970s and '80s it became known as the Mexico project, with students coining the term Global Outreach in 1988.|$|E

25|$|Evil is {{sometimes}} {{seen as a}} test or trial for humans. Irenaeus of Lyons and more recently John Hick have argued that evil and suffering are necessary for <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth.</b> This is often combined with the free will argument by arguing that such <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth</b> requires free will decisions. A problem with this is that many evils {{do not seem to}} cause any kind of <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth,</b> or even permit it, as when a child is abused from birth and becomes, seemingly inevitably, a brutal adult.|$|E
25|$|Sin is not {{viewed by}} the Orthodox as a stain on the soul {{that needs to be}} wiped out, or a legal {{transgression}} that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth</b> and development. An act of Penance (epitemia), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing {{a deeper understanding of the}} mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth</b> remains the same.|$|E

25|$|Physicist and philosopher Peter Russell elaborates {{a similar}} view, and {{stresses}} the importance of personal <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth,</b> in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism.

25|$|Worried {{about this}} {{unfavorable}} situation, Master Yin Shun decided {{to reverse the}} trend. The society, including the Buddhist sangha, of that time saw women as inferior to men.

25|$|Dnyaneshwar's moral {{philosophy}} {{comes out in}} his exposition of the 13th of Bhagavad Gita, in his commentary on the book Dnyaneshwari. He considers humility; non–injury in action, thought and words; forbearance {{in the face of}} adversity; dispassion towards sensory pleasures; purity of heart and mind; love of solitude and devotion towards one's Guru and God as virtues; and their corresponding moral opposites as vices. A pessimistic view of one's life is considered as a necessary condition for <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth</b> in Dnyaneshwari. Dnyaneshwar writes that saints do not perceive distinctions and are humble because they identify all objects, animate or inanimate, with their own Self.|$|E

25|$|In 1830, Ballou aligned {{himself with}} the Restorationists, who were upset with the views among some Universalists, that {{complete}} salvation and no punishment would follow death. Although Ballou served the Unitarian church, 1831–1842, Ballou continued to identify himself as a Restorationist. The Restorationists believed that the <b>spiritual</b> <b>growth</b> of sinners could be acclaimed only through God's justice, in the afterlife, before they could be restored to God's grace. As a Restorationist, Ballou agreed to edit and publish the Independent Messenger. Ballou's views led {{to the loss of}} his pulpit in Milford, Massachusetts. In 1831, Ballou, along with seven other ministers, established the Massachusetts Association of Universal Restorationists.|$|E
