5|$|As {{could be}} expected, {{immediately}} {{after he was}} inaugurated, Reitz contacted {{the government of the}} <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties. Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free State and the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom. Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow. Even earlier, in January 1889, the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British <b>South</b> <b>African</b> colonies and the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Republic. On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in Bloemfontein which led to an agreement between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former. The economic benefits grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and Bloemfontein (1890) and between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg (1892), directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy. For Reitz the development of a unified <b>South</b> <b>African</b> railway system was also a political goal: the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and mutual understanding between the white population of South Africa.|$|E

Representative samples {{of black and white}} <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> were surveyed annually. Respondents were asked about their objective circumstances and their (dis) satisfaction with their personal situation and the situation of the group with which they identified most strongly. Black <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> reported higher levels of personal grievance in comparison with white <b>South</b> <b>Africans,</b> but white <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> reported higher levels of group grievance in comparison with black <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> Respondents’ race and class predicted their levels of satisfaction, but over the 7 years of the study, race became a less important predictor and class became a more important predictor. However, grievances—at the individual and the group level—are mostly determined by comparisons, especially comparisons with others that people perceive to be in a better position...|$|R
