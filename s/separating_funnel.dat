50|$|A {{separatory}} funnel, {{also known}} as separation funnel, <b>separating</b> <b>funnel,</b> or colloquially sep funnel, {{is a piece of}} laboratory glassware used in liquid-liquid extractions to separate (partition) the components of a mixture into two immiscible solvent phases of different densities. Typically, one of the phases will be aqueous, and the other a lipophilic organic solvent such as ether, MTBE, dichloromethane, chloroform, or ethyl acetate. All of these solvents form a clear delineation between the two liquids. The more dense liquid, typically the aqueous phase unless the organic phase is halogenated, sinks and can be drained out through a valve away from the less dense liquid, which remains in the separatory funnel.|$|E

50|$|Vittorio Veneto has a {{displacement}} of 7,500 tons standard and 8,850 tons fully loaded. Unlike the Andrea Dorias, which had <b>separate</b> <b>funnels,</b> {{it has two}} combination mast/funnels. The second major difference in design is {{the location of the}} helicopter facilities. Vittorio Veneto has a raised read deck to accommodate a hangar beneath the helicopter platform, rather than a frigate/destroyer style hangar in the superstructure. There are two elevators to transfer the helicopters between the hangar and the deck.|$|R
5000|$|For the wet method, a slurry is {{prepared}} of the eluent with the stationary phase powder and then carefully {{poured into the}} column. Care {{must be taken to}} avoid air bubbles. A solution of the organic material is pipetted on top of the stationary phase. This layer is usually topped with a small layer of sand or with cotton or glass wool to protect the shape of the organic layer from the velocity of newly added eluent. Eluent is slowly passed through the column to advance the organic material. Often a spherical eluent reservoir or an eluent-filled and stoppered <b>separating</b> <b>funnel</b> is put on top of the column.|$|E
50|$|A <b>separating</b> <b>funnel</b> {{takes the}} shape of a cone with a {{hemispherical}} end. It has a stopper at the top and stopcock (tap), at the bottom. Separating funnels used in laboratories are typically made from borosilicate glass and their stopcocks are made from glass or PTFE. Typical sizes are between 30 mL and 3 L. In industrial chemistry they can be much bigger and for much larger volumes centrifuges are used. The sloping sides are designed to facilitate the identification of the layers. The stopcock-controlled outlet is designed to drain the liquid out of the funnel. On top of the funnel there is a standard taper joint which fits with a ground glass or Teflon stopper.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{the mixture}} is {{dissolved}} in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether (ether), and poured into a <b>separating</b> <b>funnel.</b> An aqueous solution of the acid or base is added, and the pH of the aqueous phase is adjusted to bring the compound of interest into its required form. After shaking and allowing for phase separation, the phase containing the compound of interest is collected. The procedure is then repeated with this phase at the opposite pH range. The order of the step is not important and the process can be repeated to increase the separation. However, it is often convenient to have the compound dissolved in the organic phase after the last step, so that the evaporation of the solvent yields the product.|$|E
5000|$|In naval architecture, a Mack is a {{structure}} which combines the radar MAsts and the exhaust stACK of a surface ship, thereby saving {{the upper deck}} space used for <b>separate</b> <b>funnels</b> and the increasingly large lattice masts used to carry heavy radar aerials. The word is a composite (portmanteau) of [...] "mast" [...] and [...] "stack". It is a common design feature on postwar warships, (e.g. the rebuilt Baltimore class cruisers), and on some cruise ships.|$|R
5000|$|The term ‘megaphone’ {{was first}} {{associated}} with Thomas Edison’s instrument 200 years later. In 1878, Edison developed a device {{similar to the}} speaking trumpet in hopes of benefiting the deaf and hard of hearing. His variation included three <b>separate</b> <b>funnels</b> lined up in a row. The two outer funnels, which were six feet and eight inches long, were made of paper and connected to a tube inserted in each ear. The middle funnel was similar to Morland’s speaking trumpet, but had a larger slot to insert a user’s mouth.|$|R
40|$|The energy {{landscapes of}} ion clouds {{confined}} in isotropic quadrupolar and octupolar traps are characterized for several representative cluster sizes. All clusters exhibit stable multishell structures {{that belong to}} <b>separate</b> <b>funnels.</b> Quadrupolar confinement leads to more homogeneous clusters and denser distributions of isomers than octupolar confinement. Statistical analysis of the transition states indicates that the barriers associated with intrashell motion are lower but more asymmetric and more cooperative compared to intershell motion. The relaxation between low-energy funnels with different arrangements of shells mostly exhibits Arrhenius kinetics, with a weak variation of the activation energy at higher temperatures.

50|$|To use a {{separatory}} funnel, the {{two phases}} and {{the mixture to}} be separated in solution are added through the top with the stopcock at the bottom closed. The funnel is then closed and shaken gently by inverting the funnel multiple times; if the two solutions are mixed together too vigorously emulsions will form. The funnel is then inverted and the tap carefully opened to release excess vapor pressure. The <b>separating</b> <b>funnel</b> is set aside {{to allow for the}} complete separation of the phases. The top and the bottom tap are then opened and the lower phase is released by gravitation. The top must be opened while releasing the lower phase to allow pressure equalization between the inside of the funnel and the atmosphere. When the bottom layer has been removed, the stopcock is closed and the upper layer is poured out through the top into another container.|$|E
5000|$|In Odisha about 200 kilos of Rooh Kewda are {{prepared}} each {{year at a}} cost of $7000 per kilo as compared to $1500-$1800 for a fine attar. The attar contains, on the average about 3-5% essence of Kewda with the rest being sandalwood oil. When Rooh Kewda is being prepared 5 different stills are charged with 600 flowers each. Three distillations are done on one batch of flowers. It means that three receivers are assigned to each deg. The first distillate(Agari) yields 10-12 kilos of aromatic water, the second distillate(Pichari) yields the same. In the third(Tigari) liquid parafin is sometimes kept to prepare a cheap quality [...] "attar" [...] or only the distillate is kept for making an inexpensive hydrosol. Only the first two distillates(Agari and Pichari) are kept for making the rooh. These are cooled down and in the evening the aromatic water is poured into one deg. It is immediately sealed and the bamboo pipe is connected to the receiver. Very gentle heat is given to the deg and about 5-6 kilos of distillate is collected in the receiver. During this time the receiver must be kept very cool and it is constantly rotated while fresh water is added four to five times.It takes about 1 hour to produce 5-6 kilos of distillate. The receiver is then hung horizontally on a wooden stand. The water is separated and the oil is collected by a special <b>separating</b> <b>funnel.</b> All of the remaining hydrosol is used in making the next batch of ruh which commences on the next day. About a thousand flowers(about 370 lbs) of flowers produces 1 ounce of Rooh Kewda. The Ruh is very very potent. It contains some of the most precious top notes of the oil which cannot even be captured effectively in an absolute.|$|E

Like former Swedish destroyers, the ship had no proper superstructure on the bow, but had only a protective skirt wall for the command bridge, {{though there was a}} small superstructure on the stern. The propulsion machinery consisted of four steam boilers which delivered steam to two steam turbines. The machine generated an output of 11,500 horsepower, giving a maximum speed of 34 knots. Each boiler had a <b>separate</b> <b>funnel,</b> which led to the common four stack arrangement of the time.

40|$|Equations were {{developed}} to model equilibrium in the binary rare earth solvent extraction system; (Gd-Tb) CI 3 -HCI-HEHEHP-Shellsol D 70. The mathematical relationship described the equilibrium rare earth concentration in the organic phase {{as a function of}} the total rare earth concentration, acidity and mole fraction of one earth in the aqueous phase. The equations were derived from step-by-step regression analysis of data from 36 equilibrium shake-out tests in which variables were measured over the following feed solution ranges: total rare earth concentration 0. 2 - 1. 0 M, acidity 0. 05 - 0. 80 M, mole fraction of Gd 0. 005 - 0. 995. All experiments were carried out at an organic /aqueous phase ratio of 1 using 1. 5 M ethylhexyl phosphinic acid mono- 2 -ethlyhexyl ester (HEH(EHP)) in Shellsol D 70. The average difference between the experimental and calculated values was less that < 4 %. These models can be used to study the extraction behaviour, and to simulate multi-stage extraction and separation of the rare earths. To verify the model, a 14 -stage counter-current extraction circuit was experimentally simulated using <b>separating</b> <b>funnels.</b> Excellent agreement was found between the simulation and stage-wise calculations using a computer program written by BGRINM which takes account of changes in acidity that accompanying rare earth extraction and the organic concentration of rare earths as predicted by the mathematical model. Separation of gadolinium and terbium was also demonstrated in a small mixer-settlers circuit comprising of 10 extraction stages and 5 scrubbing stages. The feed solution contained 75 % Gd and 25 % Tb. The mixer settler circuit was operated for 45 hours to ensure equilibrium was established. The rare earth mass balances agreed within 3 %. The product streams comprised a raffinate containing 93. 6 % Gd and an organic containing 90. 4 % Tb. Both parties are slightly lower than predicted by the stage-wise calculation and the simulation experiments using separation funnels. The discrepancies were mainly attributed to the fact that stage efficiencies were less than 100 %, and/or the fact that a different organic-phase diluent was used in the mixer settler experiment. The good agreement between the calculated and experimented results (especially in the separation funnel experiments where the stage efficiency was 100 %) indicates that the model accurately describes the equilibrium conditions over the wide range of concentrations and acidities within a counter-current solvent extraction circuit...|$|R
