40|$|Dioxins and furans, PCDD/Fs, {{are highly}} toxic {{substances}} formed in post combustion zones in furnaces. PCDD/F emissions are regulated by a waste incineration directive which relates also to co-incineration plants. Several observations of dioxin and furan enhancements in wet scrub- bers {{have been reported}} previously. This {{is thought to be}} due to the so-called "memory effect" which occurs when dioxins and furans absorb into plastic material in scrubbers and desorb when ambient circumstances alter significantly. At the co-incineration plant involved, dioxins and furans are controlled with a wet scrubber, the tower packing of which is made of plastic in which activated carbon particles are dispersed. This should avoid the memory effect and act as a dioxin and furan sink since dioxins and furans are absorbed irreversibly into the packing ma- terial. In this case, the tower packing in the scrubber is covered with a white layer that {{has been found to be}} mainly aluminium. The aim of this thesis was to determine the aluminium balance and the dioxin and furan behaviour in the scrubber and, thus, the impacts that the foul- ing has on dioxin and furan removal. The source of aluminium, reasons for fouling and further actions to minimize its impacts on dioxin and furan removal were also to be discovered. Measurements in various media around the scrubber and in fuels were made and a profile analysis of PCDD/F and mass balance calculations were carried out. PCDD/F content de- creased in the scrubber. The reduced PCDD/F was not discharged into <b>scrubbing</b> <b>water.</b> The removal mechanism seems to work in spite of the fouling, at least with low PCDD/F loads. Most of the PCDD/F in excess water originates from the Kymijoki River which is used as feeding water in the scrubber. Fouling turned out to consist mainly of aluminium hydroxides. Sludge combusted in the furnace was found to be a significant source of aluminium. Ways to minimize the fouling would be adjustment of pH to a proper lever, installation of a mechanical filter to catch the loose material from the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>water</b> and affecting the aluminium content of the sludge...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} study it was concluded, based on {{literature}} and interviews, that biotrickling filters might be responsible for airborne transmission of Legionella bacteria.

Under the right conditions, temperatures supportive for Legionella growth might be found in the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>water.</b> In order to investigate this risk, measurements were done at 36 animal houses where biotrickling filters were operated for exhaust air treatment. The investigation was performed in August and September because in several years the number of reports of Legionnaires’ disease significantly increased during this period in the Netherlands; during summer warming up of the water by ambient temperature is likely. In none of the samples Legionella was found. In only a few biotrickling filters the measured temperature was at such a level that growth of Legionella would be possible.

40|$|Biogas {{upgrading}} by <b>water</b> <b>scrubbing</b> {{followed by}} biomethane compression is an environmentally benign process. It may be achieved using various plant configurations characterised by various power requirements with associated effects on biomethane sustainability. Therefore, {{the current study}} has been undertaken to systematically investigate the power requirements {{of a range of}} <b>water</b> <b>scrubbing</b> options. Two groups of <b>water</b> <b>scrubbing</b> are analysed: (1) high pressure <b>water</b> <b>scrubbing</b> (HPWS) and (2) near-atmospheric pressure <b>water</b> <b>scrubbing</b> (NAPWS). A <b>water</b> <b>scrubbing</b> plant model is constructed, experimentally validated and simulated for seven upgrading plant configurations. Simulation results show that the power requirement of biogas upgrading in HPWS plants is mainly associated with biogas compression. In contrast, in NAPWS plants the main power is required for water pumping. In both plants the compression of the biomethane from atmosphereic pressure to 20 MPa also contributes remarkably. It is observed that the lowest specific power requirement can be obtained for a NAPWS plant without water regeneration (0. 24 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas) but this plant requires cheap water supply, e. g. outlet water from a sewage treatment plant or river. The second is HPWS without flash (0. 29 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas). All other HPWS with flash and NAPWS with water regeneration plants have specific power requirements between 0. 30 and 0. 33 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas. Biogas compression without upgrading requires about 0. 29 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas. The thermodynamic efficiency of biogas upgrading is between 2. 2 % and 9. 8 % depending on the plant configuration while biomethane compression efficiency is higher, about 55 %. This result implies that the upgrading process has a remarkable potential for improvement whereas compression is very close to its thermodynamic limit. The potential for minimising energy dissipation in the state-of-the-art HPWS upgrading plant with flash by applying a rotary hydraulic pumping device is evaluated at about 0. 036 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas meaning the specific power requirement reduction of 10 %.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the thermal hydraulic issues in the Containment Filtered Venting System (CFVS) for a long operating time using the MELCOR computer code. The modeling of the CFVS, including the models for pool scrubbing and the filter, {{was added to the}} input file for the OPR- 1000, and a Station Blackout (SBO) was chosen as an accident scenario. Although depressurization in the containment building as a primary objective of the CFVS was successful, the decontamination feature by scrubbing and filtering in the CFVS for a long operating time could fail by the continuous evaporation of the scrubbing solution. After the operation of the CFVS, the atmosphere temperature in the CFVS became slightly above the water saturation temperature owing to the release of an amount of steam with high temperature from the containment building to the scrubbing solution. Reduced pipe diameters at the inlet and outlet of the CFVS vessel mitigated the evaporation of <b>scrubbing</b> <b>water</b> by controlling the amount of high-temperature steam and the water saturation temperature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{preparation}} of the alpha form of calcium sulphate hemihydrate is technically relatively complicated. The idea is to allow 1. 5 molecules of water contained in gypsum to leave through dehydration in liquid form. This can only be achieved under hydrothermal conditions, namely in an autoclave or by increasing the boiling point of the solution in which the gypsum is located during dehydration. The paper deals with the dehydration of gypsum in a calcium chloride solution. The influence of the concentration and temperature of the selected solution on the dehydration time of the gypsum was monitored. Methodology The dehydration time of the gypsum in the CaCl 2 solution was monitored on a device that was developed during a long-term survey of sulphate binders at the Institute of Construction Materials and Components. This concerns a single-chamber drier where the raw material together with a dehydrating solution is placed in a dehydrating chamber, and throughout the production of plaster is maintained in suspension by the mixing device.

40|$|Liquid {{sprays of}} water are {{frequently}} used in {{air pollution control}} for gas cooling purposes and for gas cleaning. Twin-fluid nozzles with internal mixing are often used for these purposes {{because of the small}} size of the drops produced. In these nozzles the liquid is dispersed by compressed air or another pressurized gas. In high efficiency scrubbers for particle separation, several nozzles are operated in parallel because {{of the size of the}} cross section. In such scrubbers, the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>water</b> has to be re-circulated. Precipitation of some solid material can occur in the liquid circuit, caused by chemical reactions. When such precipitations are detached from the place of formation, they can partly or totally block the liquid flow to a nozzle. Due to the resulting unbalanced supply of the nozzles with water and gas, the efficiency of separation decreases. Thus, the nozzles have to be cleaned if a certain fraction of blockages is reached. The aim of this study was to provide a tool for continuously monitoring the status of the nozzles of a scrubber based on the available operation data (water flow, air flow, water pressure and air pressure). The difference between the air pressure and the water pressure is not well suited for this purpose, because the difference is quite small and therefore very exact calibration of the pressure measurement would be required. Therefore, an equation for the reference air flow of a nozzle at the actual water flow and operation pressure was derived. This flow can be compared with the actual air flow for assessment of the status of the nozzles...|$|E

40|$|Salty {{food waste}} is {{difficult}} to manage with previous methods such as composting, anaerobic digestion, and incineration, due to the hindrance of salt and the additional burden to handle high concentrations of organic wastewater produced when raw materials are cleaned. This study presents a possibility of recycling food waste as fuel without the burden of treatment washing with water by pyrolyzing and scrubbing. For this purpose, salty food waste with 3 % NaCl was made using 10 materials and pyrolysis was conducted at temperature range between 200 – 400 °C. The result was drawn from elementary analysis (EA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) analysis, water quality analysis and calorific value analysis of char, washed char, and washing water. The result of the EA showed that NaCl in food waste could be volatilized at a low pyrolysis temperature of 200 – 300 °C {{and it could be}} concentrated and fixed in char at a high pyrolysis temperature of 300 – 400 °C. The XPS analysis result showed that NaCl existed in form of chloride. Through the Na content result of the AAS analysis, NaCl remaining in char after water scrubbing was determined to be less than 2 %. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of <b>scrubbing</b> <b>water</b> decreased rapidly, but the total phosphorus and nitrogen contents decreased gradually. The cleaned pyrolysis char showed an increase of higher heating value (HHV) approximately 3667 – 9920 J/g due to the removal of salt from the char and, especially at 300 – 400 °C, showed a similar HHV with normal fossil fuels. In conclusion, salty food waste, which is pyrolyzed at a temperature of 300 – 400 °C and cleaned by water, can be utilized as high-energy refuse derived fuel (RDF), without adverse effects, due to the volatilization of Cl and an additional process of contaminated water...|$|E
40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{incineration}} plants equipped with wet flue gas scrubbing generate process solutions like acid flue gas <b>scrubbing</b> <b>water</b> containing heavy metals such as Hg(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), and Fe(II/III). The specification of these heavy metals does usualy prevent a utilization. Hence a special solvent extraction process has been developed for the removal and the recovery of Hg(II) from acid flue gas scrubbing solutions. The process is based upon extraction of chloromercurat complexes {{by means of the}} anionexchanger Aliquat 336 solved in a mixture of n-paraffins and 1 -decanole. After multiple washing stages the mercury is stripped using an aqueous ethylenediamine solution. The process was tested on a semi-technical scale for feed solutions containing hydrochloric acid in a concentration range of 0. 5 - 5 mole/l. Model solutions as well as flue gas scrubbing solutions from the TAMARA test incinerator for municipal solid waste have been used. The mercury can easily be recovered out of the stripping phase by electrolysis. The described solvent extraction process can also be applied to the recovery of cadmium and zinc. (orig.)

Aus der ueblichen Abwasserbehandlung erhaelt man die Schwermetalle nur als nicht verwertbaren Rueckstand. Deswegen wurde speziell fuer die Abtrennung und die Gewinnung von Quecksilber aus dem sauren Rauchgaswaschwasser ein Fluessig-Fluessig-Extraktionsverfahren entwickelt. Der Prozess zur Hg(II) -Abtrennung basiert auf der Extraktion mit dem Anionenaustauscher Aliquat 336, geloest in einem Gemisch aus n-Paraffinen und 1 -Decanol.
