40|$|Emotional {{self-regulation}} (ESR) {{challenges are}} well {{documented in the}} developmental profiles of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); however, less {{is known about the}} development of ESR and the role of parents in ESR development for this population. This study explored the associations between diagnostically significant characteristics of children with ASD (i. e., social communication profile and sensory processing abilities) and parent behaviors associated with development of a child’s ESR. ^ Participants were 37 children previously diagnosed with ASD and their parents recruited throughout Southern New England. The children’s ages ranged between 30 - 48 months. The study was a cross sectional design involving observations of parent-child dyads in their home environment during naturalistic routines: free play, social communication assessment, and snack. Observations were video recorded for subsequent coding using combined event/ time sampling procedures. Parent behaviors included physical engaging and helping, language-based engaging and helping, redirection/distraction, vocal comfort, physical comfort, language-based comfort, emotional following, and active ignoring. Children’s social communication abilities were assessed using the Communication Symbolic Behavior Scales- Developmental Profile (Wetherby 2 ̆ 6 Prizant, 2002) and their sensory processing abilities were assessed using the Sensory Processing Measure – Preschool Home form (Ecker 2 ̆ 6 Parham, 2010). A demographic questionnaire was also completed by the parent. ^ Results indicate that parents engaged in all of the behaviors hypothesized to be associated with ESR development during the observations but to varying degrees. Parents most frequently used physical engaging and helping, and language engaging and helping behaviors, while behaviors associated with comfort were infrequent and active ignoring was rare. Children’s social communicative abilities were associated with parent engagement such that children with high levels of social communication had parents who used more parent language engaging and helping and less physical engaging and helping, redirection/distraction, and physical comfort. Overall, no parent behaviors were associated with child sensory processing abilities. These findings were fairly consistent across activities studied in the research protocol although some variations were noted. ^ Future research should explore additional aspects of the interactions by examining the transactions between child emotional state and parent behavior response. Delineation of specific parent behaviors could also serve to further the understanding of the particular qualities of parent behaviors that are most supportive of child ESR development. Understanding the interactive processes between parents and children with ASD has implications for the development of targeted parent-based interventions that increase child ESR capabilities and in turn decrease the <b>secondary</b> <b>burdens</b> and long term difficulties posed by ESR challenges for this population. ...|$|R

50|$|The burden in a CT {{metering}} circuit is the largely resistive impedance presented to its <b>secondary</b> winding. Typical <b>burden</b> ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5 VA, 3 VA, 5 VA, 10 VA, 15 VA, 20 VA, 30 VA, 45 VA and 60 VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 can tolerate an impedance {{of up to}} 0.2 Ω on the secondary circuit before its accuracy falls outside of its specification. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and phase angle error scales at the CT's rated burden. Items {{that contribute to the}} burden of a current measurement circuit are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate conductors. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the meter and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices.|$|R

This study was aimed at identifying the pattern of psychosocial adjustment in a group of relatively secluded and under-reached totally blind people in Ilorin, thus sensitizing eye doctors to psychosocial morbidity and care in the blind. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study using 20 -item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) and a pro forma designed by the authors to assess the psychosocial problems and risk factors in some blind people in Ilorin metropolis. Result: The study revealed that most of the blind people were reasonably adjusted in key areas of social interaction, marriage, and family. Majority were considered to be poorly adjusted in the areas of education, vocational training, employment, and mobility. Many were also considered to be psychologically maladjusted based on the high rate of probable psychological disorder of 51 &#x 0025;, as determined by SRQ. Factors identified as risk factors of probable psychological disorder were poor educational background and the presence of another medical disorder. Conclusion: Most of the blind had no access to formal education or rehabilitation system, which may have contributed to their maladjustment in the domains identified. Although their prevailing psychosocial situation would have been better prevented yet, real opportunity still exists to help this group of people in the area of social and physical rehabilitation, meeting medical needs, preventive psychiatry, preventive ophthalmology, and community health.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into three essays. In the first essay, a two-by-two model is {{formulated}} in which changes in price are caused by technological progress that takes place in one sector. It is found that the factor used intensively in the sector where technology advances will be better off in terms of both goods if the proportionate decrease in the price of that good is less than the proportionate increase in productivity; the other factor, although it suffers from the change in factor intensity, may still be better off due to the improvement in productivity. The second essay deals with technology that is accessible to every one in the economy. Since technology is a public good, it pays to devote more resources in the creation of new technology if the population size is larger; productivity increases as the investments for new technology increase. The optimal level of population is reached when the positive effect of increased productivity is balanced by the negative effect of the increased labor size. The third essay discusses two topics: first, the optimal level of technology acquisition; second, the international indebtedness. Productivity will increase because of the acquired technology; however, the <b>secondary</b> <b>burden</b> of the royalty payments will turn the terms of trade against the adopting country. The optimal level of technology acquisition is then reached when the gains from the acquired technology are balanced by the losses from the worsening terms of trade. In {{the second part of the}} third essay, the advanced country temporarily falls behind in the creation of technology but expects to regain the leading margin in productivity. Both countries can be better off if the advanced country now borrows from the backward country and pays the loan back with interest when the leading margin in technology of the advanced country is reestablished in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{causes and}} {{implications}} of the developing country debt crisis - {{as well as its}} solution - all have an important fiscal dimension. The crisis was triggered by the widespread perception that the public sectors in many heavily indebted countries were effectively insolvent in the international environment of the early 1980 s. The actual fiscal response to the resulting liquidity crisis involved increased reliance on domestic financing, the inflation tax, and the curtailment of public investment. This created adverse adjustment incentives for policymakers and resulted in credit rationing, capital flight, assumption of private external claims by the public sector, and poor domestic investment performance. Solutions involve restoring fiscal health through a combination of debt relief and efficient fiscal adjustment, aimed at mitigating the burden associated with public sector debt service and minimizing the liquidity problems facing the indebted public sector. The debt and debt-service reduction (DDSR) programs implemented so far under the Brady Plan have provided only partial solutions, closing without eliminating the gap between the face value of the external debt and the present value of prospective public sector debt service. They have done so partly by reducing the former and partly by increasing the latter. Their contribution toward easing the immediate liquidity problems of the debtors has not been encouraging. The amount of debt relief embodied in Brady Plan programs enacted so far has not in itself been sufficient to restore fiscal solvency. Better-quality fiscal adjustment could greatly help improve the situation. The most important potential contribution of such programs, then, may have been the reduction - through the policy conditionality associated with resources provided by the international financial institutions - of the <b>secondary</b> <b>burden</b> associated with the internal transfer of resources to the public sector.

40|$|The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Model is used {{to analyze}} the {{possible}} impacts of Japan’s FDI in Asia in a multi-country, multi-sector, general equilibrium framework. The majority of existing anti-FDI arguments are either non-economic such as the “nationalist” and “dependence ” approaches, or economic but short-term, partial-equilibrium arguments such as the “exporting employment”, and “balance of payments ” stories that focus on the flow aspects of FDI. FDI, as a micro phenomenon, should not be blamed for negative macro outcomes such as a worsening trade balance that in principle is a reflection of a country’s savings-investment imbalance. By focusing, instead, on the analysis of medium- to long-term general equilibrium impacts (stock impacts) of FDI, this paper tries to capture the growth and welfare impacts of Japan’s FDI in Asia. Stock impacts analyzed in this paper are: 1) a capacity and output expansion in the recipient economies in Asia, matched by a reduced capital stock in Japan (stock effects); 2) an increase in productivity through technology transfer and spillover (technology effects); and 3) an increase in domestic investment driven by a higher expected rate of return on investment and larger domestic savings (cofinance effects). Following the existing dichotomy in the theories of FDI—those that assume perfect markets and the others based on imperfect markets—simulations are conducted under both industrial structures. Simulation results replicate the traditional transfer problem in real resources, and show that FDI is a positive-sum game. Larger gains are observed in the existence of scale economies. The results suggest the importance of two-way FDI flows for Japan in order to benefit from this game. The results also suggest that if FDI capital and technology are augmented by local investment (and savings), a possible <b>secondary</b> <b>burden</b> of transfer in real resources can be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Polyester, polyacetate and {{polyamide}} fibres are {{the kinds}} most frequently used at present to produce synthetic textiles. The dyeing of these fibre types is predominantly carried out with disperse dyes. Despite {{the high degree of}} absorption (95 - 98 %) of the water-insoluble dyes, relatively large quantities remain in solution and must be disposed of with the waste water. This work examined the degradation of the disperse dyes by chemical and electro-chemical reduction. To this end, three representative disperse dyes (Disperse Blue 79 : 1, Disperse Orange 62, Disperse Red 60) were selected in agreement with the company DyStar. For analysis of the degradation products, LC-MS and GCxGC-(TOF) MS were used along with UV-VIS methods. In some cases solid-phase extraction proved unsuitable for concentrating the dye solutions because the dispersing agents contained in the solutions prevented the degradation products from being adsorbed on the stationary phase. Liquid/liquid extraction procedures were therefore developed, which made the concentration of relatively nonpolar products possible. By such extraction, followed by GCxGC-(TOF) MS, the degradation product 2, 6 -dichloro- 4 -aminoaniline was identified, which is formed during the chemical and electro-chemical reduction of the azodye Disperse Orange 62. Further degradation products could be identified by precision mass measurements. As expected, the reductive treatment of azodyes yielded aromatic amines as main degradation products. Aromatic amines also resulted from reduction of nitro or amide groups. It was shown in addition that the use of larger quantities of reducing agents and/or longer electrolysis times did not lead to increased degradation of the aromatic amines to harmless compounds. Since many of these amines are suspected of being genotoxic, it is urged that past practice be reconsidered, for it includes reductive degradation for decolourisation, either as a component of the dyeing method (reductive after-clearing) or as an anaerobic step during the waste water purification. The goal must be largely eliminating and destroying aromatic amines, as is possible by oxidative procedures. To investigate the chemical reduction of the disperse dyes, sodium dithionite, sodium borohydride and zinc/hydrochloric acid were used. The degradation products were analysed {{as a function of the}} quantity of reducing agent, so that the course of the reaction could be examined more closely. The chemical reduction clearly ran faster than the electro-chemical reduction. The disperse dyes in the form of the commercial products in water could be converted electro-chemically only with the assistance of a mediator system. If the dye press-cake (containing no dispersing agents) was dispersed with cationic tensides, then degradation could also be observed. Neither of these procedures, however, is suitable for a technical application. The conversion of the dye into a truly dissolved condition gave the best turnover rates in the electro-chemical treatment. Nevertheless, even at a relatively low dye concentration (0. 1 g/L), it was necessary to add about 50 percent by volume of an organic solvent. The resulting <b>secondary</b> <b>burden</b> of pollutants also eliminates this method as a treatment procedure. From the relatively low conversion rate of the electro-chemical reduction in purely aqueous systems, it can be concluded that the particle character of the incompletely dissolved disperse dye and the negatively charged dispersing agents, which coat and/or shield the dye, are unfavourable for the transmission of electrons at the cathode surface. The electro-chemical treatment of real waste water led likewise to insufficient decolourisation, although the measured particle sizes were clearly smaller (factor 30) than those in the freshly dispersed solution before the dyeing process. This suggests that the dispersing agent, which is not consumed during the dyeing process and is thus present in the real waste water in a large excess over the dye, probably has a substantial effect on the conversion rate. On the whole, the electro-chemical reduction as primary step of the degradation of water-insoluble dyes and pigments does not have the desired efficiency. Surprisingly, the concentrations of both the disperse dyes and the vat dyes, to the extent that these were present in the waste water from the dyeing plant, could be lowered by ozonisation. The ozone consumption here was greater than what is necessary to degrade water-soluble dyes; this can be explained by the presence of ozone-degradable dispersing agents. While the fineness of the disperse after the dyeing, when the relationship of dye to dispersing agent is approximately 1 : 100 (before the dyeing this relationship is 50 : 50), makes electro-chemical reduction rather difficult, this relationship seems on the contrary even to be favourable for an oxidative treatment. It is thus conceivable that this established procedure for water-soluble dyes can also be used economically in disperse and vat dyeing...|$|E

Causes may be secondary to malignancy, congenital anomalies or other infrequent events such as external compression. We present a case of external compression of the IVC leading to extensive thrombus <b>burden</b> <b>secondary</b> to a benign hepatic cyst. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 72 year old African American female presented to the emergency department with new onset shortness of breath, right lower extremity weakness and swelling. CT imaging demonstrated multiple hepatic cysts compressing the IVC, leading to extensive clot burden. Treatment with heparin drip was initiated without resolution of her symptoms. Transcatheter mechanical thrombectomy and tPA infusion was performed. After 24 h, swelling and weakness were nearly resolved. The patient was bridged to therapeutic low molecular weight heparin in preparation for surgery. DISCUSSIONManagement of IVC thrombosis has typically been with a heparin drip and transition to oral anticoagulants. Thrombolysis {{has been shown to}} promote complete clot lysis more often than compared to standard anticoagulant therapy. In addition, venous patency was better maintained. CONCLUSIONWe feel that the added benefit of short term effects of improved venous patency and long term benefits of less post thrombotic syndrome, catheter based tPA administration and mechanical thrombectomy for thrombus offers an adjuvant treatment in the setting of large clot burden refractory to standard treatment...|$|R

Methods: Extensive batteries of neuropsychological tests and psychiatric questionnaires were administered to DYT 11 gene mutation-carrying (MC) M-D patients (n= 31), non-mutation-carrying (NMC) M-D patients (n= 20) and a healthy control group (n= 36). Results: MC M-D patients demonstrated mild impairments in executive functions. On the contrary, {{with the exception of one}} type of verbal fluency, no evident cognitive impairments were found in NMC M-D patients. Further, increased rates of anxiety disorders were found only in MC M-D patients, whereas increased rates of depressive symptoms were observed in both M-D groups. Correlation analyses yielded modest associations between severity of myoclonus and executive functions. No relationships were found between neuropsychological test performance and scores on the psychiatric assessments. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that anxiety disorders and executive dysfunctions may be part of the phenotype of M-D patients with a DYT 11 mutation, whereas depressive symptoms and semantic fluency impairments may be secondary to suffering from a chronic movement disorder, regardless of DYT 11 gene mutation...|$|R

However, the ambu-latory {{health care system in}} Germany contains a lot of “interface problems ” and is not optimized for the future challenges. Innovative concepts like regional networks in dementia care exist on a project level and need to be tested for efficacy to encourage implementation. The goal of the study is the scientific evaluation of an already existing regional dementia net-work. Methods: Prospective randomized controlled trial of 235 community-living elderly with dementia and their family caregivers of network treatment (n= 117) compared to usual care (n= 118) in a predominantly rural region. The allocation to intervention or control group was based on network membership of their General Practitioner. Intervention patients re-ceived diagnostic evaluation and subsequent treatment according to network guidelines. Main outcome measures were the early contact with a neurologic or psychiatric specialist and dementia-specific medication as well as quality of life of the patients, and as <b>secondary</b> outcomes caregiver <b>burden</b> and caregiver health-related quality of life. Results: Network pa-tients were more likely to receive antidementive drugs (50. 5 % vs. 35. 8 %; p= 0. 035) and had more often contact to a neu-rologist (18. 6 % vs. 2. 8 %; p< 0. 001). No group differences were found on patient’s quality of life nor overall effects or treatment by time effects. Intervention caregivers reported no significant improvements in health related quality of lif...|$|R
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), {{the most}} common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, represents a major burden to patients and health care systems through its sequelae of heart failure and stroke. Its age-dependent increase in prevalence has led to worrisome predictions of an expanding <b>burden</b> <b>secondary</b> to our aging population. This growing epidemic is further exacerbated by a current lack of highly effective therapies for the arrhythmia stemming from our incomplete understanding of its complex pathophysiology. Recent genetic studies, triggered in part by evidence of a hereditary component of AF, have begun to identify predisposing genes and offer further insights into the mechanisms of lone AF. A variety of ion channels and most recently a circulating hormone have been implicated. The apparent genetic diversity underlying the arrhythmia has served to emphasize the heterogeneity of factors that govern its initiation and maintenance. The different causative genes seem to predispose to AF through distinct putative mechanisms, including enhanced and delayed atrial action potential repolarization, cellular hyperexcitability, and conduction velocity heterogeneity. Classification of lone AF into mechanistic subgroups serves to emphasize its heterogeneity and {{has the potential to}} guide developmental and clinical treatment strategies. The frequent recalcitrant nature of the arrhythmia to contemporary pharmacological and invasive therapies may be overcome through an ability to identify, through genetics, the mechanistic subclass of AF for an individual patient. Proper identification of the culprit pathophysiology may permit administration of a targeted form of therapy that carries maximal efficacy and minimal risk {{in a manner consistent with}} the vision of pharmacogenomics...|$|R

The main aim of this work is to verify European formation of the common single market throughout European tax policy in other words, through the convergence of the tax <b>burden.</b> <b>Secondary</b> aim is focused on the question of what impact do convergence of tax mixes and tax competition have on the convergence of the taxation in the EU. For this purposes data from the years of 1965 - 2011 in combination with methods of Beta Convergence, Sigma Convergence and panel regression analysis with fixed effects are used. Results confirm the tax systems convergence and its speed not only in the area of total tax burden but also in tax mixes, implicit tax rates and some statutory tax rates. Panel regression analysis with fixed effects subsequently confirmed the positive impact of the convergence of nearly all tax mixes parts and tax competiton on the total tax burden convergence. The highest impact on the tax convergence was verified at the tax competition and property taxes. All models accomplish diagnostic tests and are econometrically robust.

40|$|Background: Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD) is a {{significant}} cause of health and economic <b>burden.</b> <b>Secondary</b> prevention programs play {{a pivotal role in}} the treatment and management of those affected by CHD although participation rates are poor due to patient, provider, health system and societal-level barriers. As such, {{there is a need to}} develop innovative secondary prevention programs to address the treatment gap. Telephone-delivered care is convenient, flexible and has been shown to improve behavioural and clinical outcomes following myocardial infarction (MI). This paper presents the design of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a six-month telephone-delivered secondary prevention program for MI patients (ProActive Heart). Methods: 550 adult MI patients have been recruited over a 14 month period (December 2007 to January 2009) through two Brisbane metropolitan hospitals, and randomised to an intervention or control group (n = 225 per group). The intervention commences within two weeks of hospital discharge delivered by study-trained health professionals ('health coaches') during up to 10 × 30 minute scripted telephone health coaching sessions. Participants also receive a ProActive Heart handbook and an educational resource to use during the health coaching sessions. The intervention focuses on appropriate modification of CHD risk factors, compliance with pharmacological management, and management of psychosocial issues. Data collection occurs at baseline or prior to commencement of the intervention (Time 1), six months follow-up or the completion of the intervention (Time 2), and at 12 months follow-up for longer term outcomes (Time 3). Primary outcome measures include quality of life (Short Form- 36) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey). A cost-effective analysis of the costs and outcomes for patients in the intervention and control groups is being conducted from the perspective of health care costs to the government. Discussion: The results of this study will provide valuable new information about an innovative telephone-delivered cost-effective secondary prevention program for MI patients...|$|R
40|$|Aim. This study aims at {{describing}} {{an intervention}} based on informal caregivers’ skills when {{taking care of}} older people after a stroke (InCARE). Background. Most informal caregivers feel unprepared to deliver assistance in {{activities of daily living}} at home. This lack of preparedness can lead to misconceptions, burden and affect their health, which, consequently, may imply hospital readmissions or early institutionalization of the older adults. Design. A single blinded randomised trial. Methods. This study will recruit 198 dyads, comprising old stroke survivors and their caregivers, who will be divided into two groups: intervention and control (protocol approved in May 2013). Inclusion criteria: (informal caregivers) absence of cognitive impairment; resident in the Cavado Region; to return the informed consent (older people) are over 65 years of age; have had a first stroke and; be dependent on {{at least one of the}} self-care activities post hospital discharge. Primary outcome: informal caregivers’ skills. <b>Secondary</b> outcomes: include <b>burden</b> and Health Quality of Life in informal caregivers; functionality, hospital readmission and institutionalization of older people stroke survivors, measured 1 and 3 months after InCARE programme. Discussion. The InCARE programme will highlight new ways to understand the feasibility of a large trial, which supports caregivers who take care of older people after a stroke. It will be expected that the level of burden decreases, thus helping informal caregivers enhance their quality of life. Also, it is expected that older people’s functionality will be improved and that hospital readmission or institutionalization may be avoided.

40|$|A unified tropospheric chemistry-aerosol model {{within the}} Goddard Institute for Space Studies general {{circulation}} model II {{is applied to}} simulate an equilibrium CO 2 -forced climate in the year 2100 {{to examine the effects}} of climate change on global distributions of tropospheric ozone and sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, primary organic carbon, secondary organic carbon, sea salt, and mineral dust aerosols. The year 2100 CO 2 concentration as well as the anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors and aerosols/aerosol precursors are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A 2. Year 2100 global O 3 and aerosol burdens predicted with changes in both climate and emissions are generally 5 - 20 % lower than those simulated with changes in emissions alone; as exceptions, the nitrate burden is 38 % lower, and the <b>secondary</b> organic aerosol <b>burden</b> is 17 % higher. Although the CO 2 -driven climate change alone is predicted to reduce the global O 3 concentrations over or near populated and biomass burning areas because of slower transport, enhanced biogenic hydrocarbon emissions, decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate at higher temperatures, and the increase of O 3 production by increased water vapor at high NOx levels. The warmer climate influences aerosol burdens by increasing aerosol wet deposition, altering climate-sensitive emissions, and shifting aerosol thermodynamic equilibrium. Climate change affects the estimates of the year 2100 direct radiative forcing as a result of the climate-induced changes in burdens and different climatological conditions; with full gas-aerosol coupling and accounting for ozone and direct radiative forcings by the O 2, sulfate, nitrate, black carbon, and organic carbon are predicted to be + 0. 93, - 0. 72, - 1. 0, + 1. 26, and - 0. 56 W m(exp - 2), respectively, using present-day climate and year 2100 emissions, while they are predicted to be + 0. 76, - 0. 72, 0. 74, + 0. 97, and - 0. 58 W m(exp - 2), respectively, with year 2100 climate and emissions...|$|R
