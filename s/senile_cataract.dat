40|$|Background: <b>Senile</b> <b>{{cataract}}</b> is {{the most}} common type of cataract characterized by gradual progressive thickening of the lens of the eye. Previously, many studies investigated the association between genetic polymorphism and <b>senile</b> <b>cataract.</b> Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) I/D polymorphism is the potential risk factor for many eye-related diseases such as retinopathy and glaucoma. CYP 46 A 1 enzyme converts cholesterol to 24 S-hydroxycholesterol; human lens' membranes contain the highest cholesterol content. Defects in enzymes of cholesterol metabolism can be associated with cataracts. Hence, the present study was carried out to investigate the association of ACE and CYP 46 A 1 genes polymorphism with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases and controls. Materials and Methods: ACE (rs 4646994) and CYP 46 A 1 (rs 754203) genes polymorphism in cases and controls were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: This study included 103 <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases (55 were males and 48 were females) and 102 controls (53 were males and 49 were females). Mean age of cases in this study was 52. 02 ± 12. 11 years while in control group 53. 74 ± 11. 87 years. Frequencies of ACE ID, DD, and II genotypes in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases were 64. 07 %, 4. 85 %, and 31. 06 % and controls were 61. 76 %, 26. 47 %, and 11. 76 %, respectively. The CYP 46 A 1 gene CT, CC, and TT genotype frequencies were 48. 54 %, 8. 73 %, and 42. 71 % in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases and 28. 43 %, 3. 92 %, and 67. 64 % in healthy controls, respectively. ACE DD and II genotypes (P < 0. 001,P = 0. 0008) and CYP 46 A 1 CT and TT genotypes (P = 0. 003,P = 0. 0003) were significantly associated with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> cases compared to the controls. Conclusion: Findings of this study suggest that ACE and CYP 46 A 1 genes polymorphism may be a predictive marker for early identification of population at risk of <b>senile</b> <b>cataract.</b> This potential role of ACE and CYP 46 A 1 genes polymorphism as a marker of susceptibility to <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> needs further validation in studies involving larger number of patients from different regions...|$|E
40|$|Many {{factors such}} as aging, changes in blood {{electrolytes}} levels, and possibly family history are involved in <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> formation.

Methods: A total of 295 patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> {{were divided into}} two groups according to lens maturation: 105 patients with mature <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> comprised Group 1 (study group) and the remaining 190 with non-mature <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> comprised Group 2 (control group). Prior to surgery, ophthalmological examination was undertaken. Patients&rsquo; best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure were measured and a slit-lamp examination and funduscopy performed. All examination data were recorded and any capsule-related problems during surgery were also recorded. Patient files were reviewed retrospectively and compared between groups. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was used in the statistical analysis. Results: In Group 1, the capsule-related problems found were: inability to complete capsulorhexis (seven eyes [6. 6 %]), posterior capsular perforation (three eyes [2. 8 %]), and conversion to extracapsular surgery (one eye [0. 9 %]). A posterior capsular perforation was seen in one eye (1 %) in the control group. An intraocular lens was inserted into the sulcus in six eyes (5. 7 %) and one anterior chamber (0. 9 %) in Group 1 and into the sulcus in one eye (0. 5 %) of Group 2.

Catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) are some of the antioxidant enzymes that protect the body from oxidative damage. The present study investigates the activities of erythrocyte catalase, GPX, and SOD with respect to <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> (non-diabetic cataract) and osmotic cataract (diabetic cataract) in a Sri Lankan population. One hundred and two non-diabetic subjects (50 with cataract and 52 non-cataract) and 106 diabetic subjects (56 with cataract and 50 non-cataract) were recruited into the study. Erythrocyte catalase, GPX, and SOD activities were assayed and the data were analysed by t-test (p < 0. 05 for significance). In the non-diabetic group, significantly low levels of catalase, GPX, and SOD activities were associated with cataract when compared with non-cataract. No significant changes in catalase, GPX, and SOD activities were observed in the diabetic group between cataract and non-cataract. <b>Senile</b> <b>cataract</b> (non-diabetic cataract) was associated with significantly low levels of erythrocyte catalase, GPX, and SOD when compared with osmotic cataract (diabetic cataract).

40|$|<b>Senile</b> <b>cataracts</b> are {{associated}} with progressive oxidation, fragmentation, cross-linking, insolubilization, and yellow pigmentation of lens crystallins. We hypothesized that the Maillard reaction, which leads browning and aroma development during the baking of foods, would occur between the lens proteins and the highly reactive oxidation products of vitamin C. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a mouse that selectively overexpresses the human vitamin C transporter SVCT 2 in the lens. Consequently, lenticular levels of vitamin C and its oxidation products were 5 - to 15 -fold elevated, resulting in a highly compressed aging process and accelerated formation of several protein-bound advanced Maillard reaction products identical with those of aging human lens proteins.

40|$|AIM: To {{discuss the}} role of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in the {{development}} of inflammatory glaucoma by detecting the IL- 6 levels in serum and aqueous humor of inflammatory glaucoma patients. METHODS: Totally 20 patients(20 eyes) with inflammatory glaucoma were selected as experimental group, 20 patients(20 eyes) with primary chronic glaucoma(primary chronic angle-closure glaucoma and primary chronic open angle glaucoma) as the high intraocular pressure control group, and 20 <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> patients(20 eyes) as the normal control group. Three specimens of serum, aqueous humor in three groups were collected and aqueous IL- 6 levels were measured through electrochemiluminescence. RESULTS: The serum IL- 6 levels in Inflammatory glaucoma group, primary chronic glaucoma group, <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> group were 3. 26 ± 2. 10, 4. 20 ± 1. 94 and 3. 50 ± 2. 24 pg/mL, respectively, which doesn't demonstrate statistically significant differences(F = 1. 080, P = 0. 345). The aqueous IL- 6 levels in the Inflammatory glaucoma group, primary chronic glaucoma group and <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> group aqueous were 293. 77 ± 38. 72, 135. 27 ± 32. 72 and 115. 80 ± 29. 97 pg/mL, respectively, demonstrating statistically significant differences(F = 164. 86, P = 0. 000). The Inflammatory glaucoma group was found to be significantly higher than that in the primary chronic glaucoma and <b>senile</b> <b>cataract</b> group(P P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: High expression of IL- 6 levels in aqueous humor of inflammatory glaucoma patients is closely associated with inflammation, but it has no significant correlation with high intraocular pressure...|$|E
40|$|Mildly {{denaturing}} conditions induce bovine α-crystallin, {{the major}} structural lens protein, to self-assemble into fibrillar structures in vitro. The natural dipeptide l-carnosine {{has been shown}} to have potential protective and therapeutic significance in many diseases. Carnosine derivatives have been proposed as potent agents for ophthalmic therapies of <b>senile</b> <b>cataracts</b> and diabetic ocular complications. Here we report the inhibitory effect induced by the peptide (l- and d-enantiomeric form) on α-crystallin fibrillation and the almost complete restoration of the chaperone activity lost after denaturant and/or heat stress. Scanning force microscopy (SFM), thioflavin T, and a turbidimetry assay have been used to determine the morphology of α-crystallin aggregates in the presence and absence of carnosine. DSC and a near-UV CD assay evidenced that the structural precursors of amyloid fibrils are polypeptide chain segments that lack stable structural elements. Moreover, we have found a disassembling effect of carnosine on α-crystallin amyloid fibrils. Finally, we show the ability of carnosine to restore most of the lens transparency in organ-cultured rat lenses exposed to similar denaturing conditions that were used for the in vitro experiments...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} social {{characteristics and}} expectations of individuals seen during a community project {{for the treatment of}} <b>senile</b> <b>cataracts.</b> Expected results from their eye surgery and its consequences to their quality of life were studied as well. METHODOLOGY: Cataract patients (visual acuity equal to or lower than 0. 2 in the more superior eye) aged 50 years or over, were surveyed by means of interviews held during their visit at the Cataract Project in São Paulo city, State of São Paulo, Brazil, in 1999. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 331 subjects of low socioeconomic level ranging in age from 50 to 97 years (average = 71. 8 years). Expectation of total recovery from the cataract condition by means of surgery was declared by 80. 0 % of the respondents, with no significant differences between male and female subjects (P < 0. 1723). Hope to resume manual activities was expressed by 59. 8 %. CONCLUSION: A predominance of expectations of resuming normal activity and achieving a better quality of life after cataract surgery were identified...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} cataract type and severity in eyes with pure types of age-related lens opacities on visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity in the presence and absence of glare conditions. Methods: Sixty patients with <b>senile</b> <b>cataracts</b> aged 40 years or older with no other ocular pathologies were evaluated for VA and contrast sensitivity with and without glare. Lens opacities were classified according to the Lens Opacities Classification System (LOCS) III. VA was measured using the Snellen chart. Contrast sensitivity was measured with the Vector Vision CSV- 1000 E chart in the presence and absence of glare by calculating the area under log contrast sensitivity (log CS) function (AULCSF). Results: Cataracts were posterior subcapsular in 26 eyes, cortical in 19 eyes and nuclear in 15 eyes. VA significantly decreased with increasing cataract severity and there was significant loss of contrast sensitivity at all spatial frequencies with increasing cataract severity. AULCSF significantly decreased with increasing cataract severity in the presence and absence of glare conditions. Contrast sensitivity was significantly reduced at high spatial frequency (18 cpd) in cortical cataracts in th...|$|R
