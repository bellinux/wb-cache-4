40|$|Osteonecrosis of {{the capital}} femoral {{epiphysis}} is a significant late toxicity of treatment for childhood leukemia and lymphoma. We determined clinical and imaging risk factors predicting clinical joint outcomes of femoral head osteonecrosis in pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma. Patients and Methods We reviewed retrospectively medical records and magnetic resonance imaging scans of 80 patients with osteonecrosis {{of the capital}} femoral epiphysis. Logistic regression {{was used to examine}} relationships between risk factors and outcomes of joint <b>surface</b> <b>collapse</b> and arthro-plasty. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves to display the time to joint <b>surface</b> <b>collapse</b> and arthroplasty based on selected predictors. Results Median time between primary diagnosis and diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the hip was 1. 7 years (range, 0. 1 to 17. 5 years). Twenty-three patients (29 %) underwent arthroplasty in 36 hips at a mean of 1. 3 years (range, 0. 5 to 8. 6 years) after diagnosis of osteonecrosis. Median age at time of first arthroplasty was 20. 1 years (range, 15. 1 to 35. 4 years). Joint outcome of osteonecrosis was predicted solely by lesion size at diagnosis of osteonecrosis. The worst prognosis was associated with lesions occupying more than 30 % of the femoral head volume; 80 % of hips with these lesions collapsed within 2 years of diagnosis and 50 % required arthroplasty. Conclusion Lesion size of osteonecrosis is the best predictor of clinical joint outcome of hip osteonecrosis in survivors of pediatric hematologic malignancy. Lesions occupying more than 30 % of the femoral head have high likelihood of joint deterioration necessitating arthroplasty at a young age.

Association with volcanic landforms such as pit craters clearly suggests interconnection between tectonic and magmatic processes. A Martian rift evolution model is proposed {{on the basis}} of new geomorphological and structural interpretations of imagery, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), scaled experimental modeling and three-dimensional boundary element modeling of magmatic and tectonic processes, and a comparison with terrestrial rifts. The DEMs were obtained from Mars Observer Laser Altimeter, Viking Orbiter stereo images, or a combination of both. Comparison of terrestrial rifts included Afar, Iceland, and the East Pacific Rise. The ambient extensional stress field induced by regional body forces is combined at depth with decompression melting and mantle plume thermal anomaly, resulting in emplacement of elongated magma reservoirs along the grabens. Injection of dikes above the reservoirs and flood basalt eruption result in a reservoir underpressurization of up to hundreds of MPa and induces <b>surface</b> <b>collapse.</b> Each collapse event is associated with an eruption of volcanic volumes akin to those of individual flow eruptions in large terrestrial igneous provinces. The geometry and mechanisms of graben formation and <b>surface</b> <b>collapse</b> are described and used to infer reservoir depth and width.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of <b>surface</b> <b>collapse</b> and crack evolution in a roadway chain failure process in the pillar recovery of Hongling lead zinc ore in Inner Mongolia Province, China, microseismic monitoring technology, moment tensor theory, and numerical simulation are used for the inversion of rock mass fracturing, the destruction type classification of crack, and {{the mechanism of}} surrounding rock. Research shows the following: (1) the rock mass fracturing is first produced within the + 955 m level, before extending through the hanging wall to the ground surface. Then, many shear failures occur in the ground surface of the footwall, extending downwards in an arc-shaped path to the + 905 m level. Finally, the surface gradually collapses with large-scale shear failures. (2) The mechanism of <b>surface</b> <b>collapse</b> is as follows: after the recovery of pillars in the + 905 m level, tensile cracks generated {{in the top of}} orebody # 2 extend upwards and obliquely. Analogously, shear cracks are generated in the top of orebody # 1, extending upwards. After the recovery of pillars in the + 855 m level, the marble interlayer is destroyed and sinks, and many tensile cracks and shear cracks exist and incise in the ground surface, which cause the ground surface to collapse. (3) The mechanism of crack evolution is as follows: after the recovery of 5107 pillars, the footwall haul road in the + 905 m level was damaged and collapsed by the cut-through cracks. Those cracks then continue to extend upwards and converge with the slanting shear cracks in the + 905 m level, which form a triangular failure in the footwall rock. Finally, the failure causes the tensile and shearing cracks in the haulage way of the + 955 m level to extend and connect, which forms the haulage way chain failure...|$|E
