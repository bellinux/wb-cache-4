5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using <b>safety</b> <b>equipment,</b> societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E

The following day, the inspectorate gave permission for the trains to be taken into use, despite noting a series of non-conformities with safety regulations: the inspectorate lacked a list of the train's deviations from the safety regulations; lack of a system to automatically monitor the speed of the trains, particularly when automatic train stop was disconnected; lack of safety training for the crew; lack of an evacuation analysis; and lack of control of the marking of <b>safety</b> <b>equipment.</b> Most of the deviations were to be followed up within two weeks. Quale stated that the deviated issues were of a nature which had not previously been applied to trains and that it was therefore not critical.|$|E

40|$|Background: Hand {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common bodily traumas sustained at work and are always preventable. Different occupational and non-occupational risk factors may predispose to these grave events identification and modifying them has a critical role in prevention of the accidents. This study was carried out to evaluate the association between these factors and hand injuries. Materials and Methods: In this case control study 82 industrial workers with occupational hand injuries from Tehran nearby factories were compared with eighty-three controls. Working circumstances were assessed using a detailed occupational and non-occupational (individual and socio-psychological factors) questionnaire. Data were analyzed with chi-square and t-test. Results: Rotational shift work (P= 0. 027), lack of a close relationship between the workers, lack of training, availability and using <b>safety</b> <b>equipments</b> are statistically significant risk factors related to hand injuries (P= 0. 006). There is no significant relationship between individual and familial factors and hand injuries. Conclusion: Availability of <b>safety</b> <b>equipments</b> and their proper use are the most important preventive factors for hand injury. Lack of close relationship between workers can also be regarded as a significant risk factor...|$|R
5|$|The first {{ascent of}} Mont Blanc in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel Paccard {{initiated}} {{the sport of}} alpine mountaineering, and {{it was during the}} golden age of alpinism (185465) and the silver age of alpinism (186582) {{that the majority of the}} main summits of the massif were first attained. Members of the England-based Alpine Club were instrumental in many of the first ascents, usually accompanied by guides from the towns of Chamonix or Courmayeur, such as Michel Croz, Michel Payot and Émile Rey, as well as the Swiss guide, Christian Almer. Across the massif there are now more than two thousand different mountaineering routes to the summits, ranging greatly in both length and difficulty. These attract climbers from all over the world who, unlike the early ascensionists, now have access to numerous climbing guidebooks, modern <b>safety</b> <b>equipment,</b> good information on climbing routes and technical difficulty, as well as weather forecasts and mountain accommodation and food.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1930s, {{more than}} a dozen {{different}} climbing routes had been established on Grand Teton including the northeast ridge in 1931 by Glenn Exum. Glenn Exum teamed up with another noted climber named Paul Petzoldt to found the Exum Mountain Guides in 1931. Of the other major peaks on the Teton Range, all were climbed by the late 1930s including Mount Moran in 1922 and Mount Owen in 1930 by Fritiof Fryxell and others after numerous previous attempts had failed. Both Middle and South Teton were first climbed on the same day, August 29, 1923, by a group of climbers led by Albert R. Ellingwood. New routes on the peaks were explored as <b>safety</b> <b>equipment</b> and skills improved and eventually climbs rated at above 5.9 on the Yosemite Decimal System difficulty scale were established on Grand Teton. The classic climb following the route first pioneered by Owen, known as the Owen-Spalding route, is rated at 5.4 due a combination of concerns beyond the gradient alone. Rock climbing and bouldering had become popular in the park by the mid 20th century. In the late 1950s, gymnast John Gill came to the park and started climbing large boulders near Jenny Lake. Gill approached climbing from a gymnastics perspective and while in the Tetons became the first known climber in history to use gymnastic chalk to improve handholds and to keep hands dry while climbing. During the latter decades of the 20th century, extremely difficult cliffs were explored including some in Death Canyon, and by the mid-1990s, 800 different climbing routes had been documented for the various peaks and canyon cliffs.|$|E
