50|$|The {{construction}} of <b>shield</b> <b>walls</b> was {{common in the}} late 12th century in Germany and Austria {{and may have been}} a reaction to the increasing use of heavy siege engines such as the trebuchet (the height of the walls protecting the buildings beyond from arching fire). The thickness of a <b>shield</b> <b>wall</b> could, in extreme cases, be as much as 12 m (e.g. Neuscharfeneck Castle). Behind the battlements {{at the top of the}} wall there was usually an allure or <b>wall</b> walk; the <b>shield</b> <b>wall</b> could also be flanked by two wall towers.

40|$|To {{suppress}} the muon background {{arising from the}} Beam Delivery System (BDS) of the International Linear Collider (ILC), and to hinder it from reaching the interaction region, two different shielding scenarios are under discussion: five cylindrical muon spoilers with or without an additional magnetized <b>shielding</b> <b>wall.</b> Due to cost and safety issues, the scenario preferred by the Machine-Detector-Interface (MDI) group is to omit the <b>shielding</b> <b>wall,</b> although omitting it also has disadvantages. To support the decision making for the muon shielding, {{the impact of the}} muons from the two different shielding scenarios was studied in a full Geant 4 detector simulation of the SiD detector, one of two proposed detectors for the ILC.

40|$|The {{synchrotron}} {{light source}} BESSY {{consists of a}} 50 MeV microtron, a full energy synchrotron and a 1. 9 GeV storage ring. The electron losses during injection causes electromagnetic cascades within the stainless steel of the vacuum system and the aluminum vacuum chambers of the undulators.

The cross sections of the evaporation reac-tions of neutrons is {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the cross sections of the latter two reaction channels.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the potential radiation hazard caused by beam losses {{in one of}} the transfer lines (TT 2) of the CERN Proton Synchrotron, close {{to the point where the}} beam is split and can be directed towards the Super Proton Synchrotron via the TT 10 tunnel, sent to the n_TOF experiment installed in the extension of TT 2 (TT 2 A tunnel), or stopped in a massive dump. The TT 2 area is separated from the downstream TT 2 A zone of n_TOF by a 4. 8 m thick concrete wall. A full beam loss in TT 2 could generate a serious radiation hazard on the TT 2 A side of the <b>shielding</b> <b>wall.</b> Several beam loss scenarios were investigated by Monte Carlo simulations performed with the FLUKA code. The various radiation components making up the dose equivalent rate in TT 2 A were assessed. It was found that the dose equivalent is dominated by either muons, mainly originating from pion decay, or neutrons produced in hadronic cascades inside the <b>shielding</b> <b>wall,</b> depending on the point where the beam is lost. A comparison between simulation results and measurements is made...|$|E

40|$|A lead {{slowing-down}} spectrometer (LSDS) {{system is}} a promising nondestructive assay technique that enables a quantitative measurement of the isotopic contents of major fissile isotopes in spent nuclear fuel and its pyroprocessing counterparts, such as 235 U, 239 Pu, 241 Pu, and, potentially, minor actinides. The LSDS system currently under development at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (Daejeon, Korea) is planned to utilize a high-flux (> 1012  n/cm 2 ·s) neutron source comprised of a high-energy (30  MeV) /high-current (∼ 2 A) electron beam and a heavy metal target, which results in a very intense and complex radiation field for the facility, thus demanding structural shielding to guarantee the safety. Optimization of the structural shielding design was conducted using MCNPX for neutron dose rate evaluation of several representative hypothetical designs. In order to satisfy the construction cost and neutron attenuation capability of the facility, while simultaneously achieving the aimed dose rate limit (< 0. 06  μSv/h), a few shielding materials [high-density polyethylene (HDPE) –Borax, B 4 C, and Li 2 CO 3] were considered for the main neutron absorber layer, which is encapsulated within the double-sided concrete wall. The MCNP simulation indicated that HDPE-Borax is the most efficient among the aforementioned candidate materials, and the combined thickness of the shielding layers should exceed 100  cm to satisfy the dose limit on the outside surface of the <b>shielding</b> <b>wall</b> of the facility when limiting {{the thickness of the}} HDPE-Borax intermediate layer to below 5  cm. However, the <b>shielding</b> <b>wall</b> must include the instrumentation and installation holes for the LSDS system. The radiation leakage through the holes was substantially mitigated by adopting a zigzag-shape with concrete covers on both sides. The suggested optimized design of the shielding structure satisfies the dose rate limit and can be used {{for the construction of a}} facility in the near future...|$|E
