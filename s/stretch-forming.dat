The platform of ABAQUS is firstly used for numerical simulation of skin <b>stretch-forming.</b> And the surface load conditions are therefore obtained. The topology optimization is carried out accordingly to maximize the structural stiffness with the material properties and the boundary conditions properly defined. Referring to the obtained topology design, the optimal structure is reconstructed and then evaluated by the non-linear numerical simulation of <b>stretch-forming.</b> Compared with the traditional design, the numerical results have shown that the topology design can improve the stiffness and strength of the <b>stretch-forming</b> die significantly...|$|E

40|$|Quality is a {{major issue}} in the {{production}} of sheet stretchformed aircraft skins. A typical <b>stretch-forming</b> system is composed of a series of operations, including heat treatment, stretch forming, chemical milling, and trimming. Each of these operations is subject to significant input and process variation, leading to variation on the work-in-process. This variation then results in fit-up problems at the assembly stage and high scrap or rework cost. In this paper we use a mathematical model of a <b>stretch-forming</b> manufacturing system to aid in reducing end-of-line variation. For the paper we reduce the system to two key operations: heat treatment and stretch forming. Physics-based mathematical models of each are used to derive a variational model of the system, which maps output quality characteristic variations to input variations. This variational model is used to identify the major sources of variation in the system: aging time and forming force. To reduce the effects of these variabl [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present {{paper is}} focused on the Finite Element {{modeling}} of the Marciniak <b>stretch-forming</b> test in warm condition. Such a test was proposed by the authors for evaluating the warm formability of the Mg alloy AZ 31 according to the most important parameters: the temperature and the strain rate. Tensile tests confirmed the large influence of the strain rate on the deformation of the AZ 31, especially when the test temperature is over 200 °C. Three dimensional FE simulations were thus carried out in order to analyze the strain and strain rate evolutions during the formability test at the temperature of 200 °C. In particular, simulations were aimed at investigating the effect of the specimen’s geometry on the strain rate evolution in the central region, where failure occurs during the Marciniak <b>stretch-forming</b> test. An equation for calculating the punch speed profile able to keep a constant equivalent strain rate in the central region of the specimen has been furnished according to the geometry of the specimen. Its efficiency was validated by means of additional simulations implementing the punch speed profile calculated using the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Gores are {{pie-shaped}} {{panels that}} are welded {{together to form}} the dome ends of rocket fuel tanks {{as shown in figure}} 1. Replacing aluminum alloy 2219 with aluminum (Al) -lithium (Li) alloy 2195 as the Space Launch System (SLS) cryogenic tank material would save enormous amounts of weight. In fact, it has been calculated that simply replacing Al 2219 gores with Al 2195 gores on the SLS core stage domes could save approximately 3, 800 pound-mass. This is because the Al-Li 2195 alloy exhibits both higher mechanical properties and lower density than the SLS baseline Al 2219 alloy. Indeed, the known advantages of Al 2195 led to its use as a replacement for Al 2219 in the shuttle external tank program. The required thicknesses of Al 2195 gores for either SLS core stage tanks or upper stage tanks will depend on the specific design configurations. The required thicknesses or widths may exceed the current experience base in the manufacture of such gores by the <b>stretch-forming</b> process. Accordingly, the primary objective of this project was to enhance the formability of Al 2195 by optimizing the heat treatment and <b>stretch-forming</b> process for gore thicknesses up to 0. 75 inches, which envelop the maximum expected gore thicknesses for SLS tank configurations...|$|E

Three sheet metal forming processes are realized with this method.

The results show that uniform shaped domes with a dome height over 250 µm with diameters of 1. 4 mm could be produced.

40|$|The {{preferred}} polymer {{for many}} transparent thin-walled products requiring biaxial strength and dimensional stability is poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). There are continual demands for improved product performance, while minimizing material usage, and process modeling {{is an important}} tool in achieving this. A new study of PET has been carried out, aimed at improving the fidelity of constitutive modeling of this polymer in <b>stretch-forming</b> processes. Several additional refinements {{have been added to}} an existing constitutive model used for process modeling with PET. They are {{based on the results of}} a recent extensive experimental study of biaxial stretching of PET, under conditions relevant to industrial forming processes. New features now included are: post-yield strain-softening at the lowest temperatures; rate and temperature-dependent flow lock-up associated with incipient crystallization; and tension-thinning flow at the highest temperatures. Comparison of model predictions with experimental results confirm that the additions to the model improve the ability to capture the behavior of PET in biaxial hot-stretching processes. © 2011 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) was devised as a {{flexible}} forming {{process in the}} 1990 s. The basic principle of ISF is that a generic forming tool moves along a tool path and progressively forms a metal sheet into the desired shape. The tool is either moved using CNC machines or industrial robots. Applying CNC technology or robots to sheet metal forming allows for replacing expensive dedicated tooling and for a fast transfer from the CAD model to the formed part. Since its first applications in the 1990 s ISF has undergone tremendous developments. Various process variants such as double-sided ISF and hybrid process combinations such as heat-assisted ISF as well as <b>stretch-forming</b> and ISF have been put forward. The present contribution gives an overview of these developments with a special focus {{on the outcome of}} the research accomplished within the cluster of excellence “Integrative Production Technology for High Wage Countries”, where the development of fully integrated sheet metal production facilities is envisioned as the next evolution step of ISF. The development of dedicated equipment for hybrid and fully integrated sheet metal manufacturing and specialized CAX environments as well as applications are described to show the potential of the technology...|$|E
40|$|Microdefects on thin {{conversion}} {{film coated}} Zn hot-dip galvanized steel (HDG) sheets were generated by <b>stretch-forming</b> and verified by cyclic voltammetry, which revealed higher anodic and cathodic current density levels on the pre-damaged samples. The data {{were compared to}} the kinetics of electrochemically determined ion transport processes along strained conversion film covered substrate surfaces in humid air and along uniaxially stretched epoxy/conversion layer/zinc interfaces exposed to the same corrosive environment. Analysis with a Scanning Kelvin Probe indicated increased driving forces for ion transport, but verified accelerated kinetics of cathodic delamination only {{in some areas of}} the stretch-formed epoxy coated substrates. This finding reflected a rather insignificant macroscopic acceleration of corrosion processes for samples that were strained by up to 15 %. Similarly, accelerated oxygen reduction driven electrolyte spreading on bare conversion film covered HDG surfaces was verifiable only on a pm scale during initial process stages. This confirmed that stretching-induced defect formation increased the electrochemical activity of the substrates, but neither effectively nor significantly promoted the kinetics of ion transport along the sample surfaces in the present case. As a result, stable epoxy/conversion layer/zinc interfaces were maintained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{summarizes}} {{recent and}} on-going {{work on the}} exploitation of TRansformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP) {{in an effort to}} develop automotive steels which would possess high-strength combined with high formability while these steels could also exhibit high fracture and fatigue resistance. Especially for the automotive industry, the driving force for these developments is the vehicle weight reduction, which could eventually lead to lower fuel consumption combined with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The discussion starts with the modelling and characterization of the retained austenite stability (the transforming phase) as well as the modelling of the transformation kinetics, i. e. evolution of transformation with plastic strain. Enhancement of formability is discussed next. Constitutive micromechanical modelling has been employed for the calculation of forming limit diagrams (FLD) for these complex steels, an issue of great practical importance for the optimisation of <b>stretch-forming</b> and deep-drawing operations. Fracture resistance can be considerably increased by the TRIP effect. A review is made of the "transformation toughening" arising from metastable austenitic dispersions in ultrahigh strength steels and the high fracture toughness achieved in this class of materials. The potential of the TRIP effect in increasing fatigue strength has not yet received considerable attention. However once we understand the fatigue behaviour of these materials, new applications, e. g. long products made of TRIP steel, might emerge for automotive applications. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Multiphase TRIP steels are a {{relatively}} new class of steels exhibiting excellent combinations of strength and cold formability, a fact that renders them particularly attractive for automotive applications. The present work reports models regarding the prediction of the stability of retained austenite, the optimisation of the heat-treatment stages necessary for austenite stabilization in the microstructure, {{as well as the}} mechanical behaviour of these steels under deformation. Austenite stability against mechanically-induced transformation to martensite depends on chemical composition, austenite particle size, strength of the matrix and stress state. The stability of retained austenite is characterized by the M-S(sigma) temperature, which can be expressed {{as a function of the}} aforementioned parameters by an appropriate model presented in this work. Besides stability, the mechanical behaviour of TRIP steels also depends on the amount of retained austenite present in the microstructure. This amount is determined by the combinations of temperature and temporal duration of the heat-treatment stages undergone by the steel. Maximum amounts of retained austenite require optimisation of the heat-treatment conditions. A physical model is presented in this work, which is based on the interactions between bainite and austenite during the heat-treatment of multiphase TRIP steels, and which allows for the selection of treatment conditions leading to the maximization of retained austenite in the final microstructure. Finally, a constitutive micromechanical model is presented, which describes the mechanical behaviour of multiphase TRIP steels under deformation, taking into account the different plastic behaviour of the individual phases, as well as the evolution of the microstructure itself during plastic deformation. This constitutive micromechanical model is subsequently used for the calculation of forming limit diagrams (FLD) for these complex steels, an issue of great practical importance for the optimisation of <b>stretch-forming</b> and deep-drawing operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for using steel in lightweight bodywork construction has attained {{a high level}} of development with the result that the field for further optimisation is increasingly diminishing. As a consequence, lightweight construction materials such as magnesium in particular but also aluminium are set to increase in importance in the future. Based on casted-rolled magnesium sheets, which make an economical production of semi-finished material possible for the first time, different shaping and joining processes were developed and converted. The aim of the experimental series was to determine the maximum forming capability of the AZ 31 used, particularly taking into account the optimum temperature regime and a practical solution as regards the lubrication necessary. For s deep drawing and <b>stretch-forming,</b> hydroforming as well as tube and roll bendin technologies in particular, the theoretical bases were created and subsequently the processes and tools were material-specifically laid out. As a result thermoformed parts were manufactured with draw depths of up to 120 mm. The necessary joining processes were likewise developed in parallel, and these included, for example, r the welding of tailored blank and the assembly of the demonstrator. It was clearly evident that laser welding without a filler material is definitely suitable for the fabrication of magnesium tailored blanks using welding. In basic investigations the achievable quality of cutting surfaces were investigated in conventinal shear cutting and high speed impact cutting operations. It was shown that the process with high speed and cooled sheet metal leads to a better quality than a high speed process at elevated temperatures. The results of the specific research trials were translated into the design of the “car-door“demonstrator on a scale of 1 : 1. In addition to thermoforming and stretch forming this combines a number of forming technologies in its final structure, such as curling and tube bending, hydro-forming and extrusion together with cutting and punching...|$|E
40|$|Low-alloy TRIP steels are a {{new class}} of steels with {{excellent}} combinations of strength and formability, which offer a unique field for the study of multiscale effects in materials, in the sense that experimental observations and models referring to different scale levels have to be combined, for the understanding and the design of these steels. In the present work, models involving multiscale physical quantities are reported, which regard prediction of the stability of retained austenite and of the kinetics of its mechanically-induced transformation to martensite, optimization of the heat-treatment stages necessary for austenite stabilization in the microstructure, as well as prediction of the mechanical behaviour of these steels under deformation. Austenite stability depends on chemical composition, austenite particle size, strength of the matrix and stress state, i. e. on factors ranging from the nano- to the macro-scale. The stability of retained austenite against mechanically-induced transformation to martensite is characterized by the s M temperature, which can be derived {{as a function of the}} aforementioned multiscale factors by an appropriate model presented in this work. The kinetics of the mechanically-induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite are also dependent on multiscale factors, such as the population density of martensitic nucleation sites, the retained austenite particle size and the macroscopic level of plastic deformation. In the present work, a model describing the kinetics of this mechanically-induced transformation as a function of these factors is presented. Furthermore, the mechanical behaviour of TRIP steels also depends on the amount of retained austenite present in the microstructure, which is determined by the combinations of temperature and temporal duration of the heat-treatment stages undergone by the steel. Optimum amounts of retained austenite require optimization of the heat-treatment conditions. A physical model is presented in this work, which is based on the interactions between bainite and austenite during the heat-treatment of TRIP steels, which allows for the selection of treatment conditions leading to the maximization of retained austenite in the final microstructure.
