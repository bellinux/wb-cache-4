5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a <b>serum</b> <b>level</b> taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E

40|$|Cord <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of {{thyroglobulin}} (Tg) and {{thyroid stimulating hormone}} (TSH) in 147 {{term and}} preterm infants were related to gestation age, birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and several perinatal factors by means of multiple linear regression analysis. None of the perinatal factors influenced Tg and TSH cord <b>serum</b> <b>levels.</b> However, in infants who developed RDS, Tg and TSH cord <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> differed significantly from values in infants who did not develop this syndrome. In RDS infants, significantly higher Tg values were found. Tg cord <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> increased with birth weight in the "average" RDS infant (i. e. infants with birth weights according to the 50 th percentile of the growth chart for their gestation age), while these levels decreased in the "average" non-RDS infant. In RDS infants TSH cord <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> increased with increasing birth weight, while these levels did not vary in non-RDS infants. Although Tg and TSH cord <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> in RDS infants increased during gestation, no correlation between Tg and TSH cord <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> could be demonstrated. There was no correlation between Tg and TSH cord <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> in non-RDS infants.

We investigated alterations in <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of BDNF and GDNF in opiate-dependent patients (28 males) who received diacetylmorphine treatment within a structured opiate maintenance programme. BDNF (T = 2. 735, p = 0. 009) <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly increased in the opiate-dependent patients as compared with healthy controls (21 males), whereas GDNF <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> (T = 1. 425, p = 0. 162) did not differ significantly from GDNF <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of the healthy controls. BDNF <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly associated with craving for heroin (measured by the Heroin Craving Questionnaire (r = 0. 420, p = 0. 029) and by the General Craving Scale (r = 0. 457, p = 0. 016), whereas GDNF <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> were not associated with psychometric dimensions of heroin craving.

40|$|Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus {{has been}} {{identified}} as the main nosocomial agent of neonatal late-onset sepsis. However, based on the pharmacokinetics and erratic distribution of vancomycin, recommended empirical dose is not ideal, due to the inappropriate <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> that have been measured in neonates. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of vancomycin used in newborns and compare the prediction of adequate <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> based on doses calculated according to mg/kg/day and m 2 /day. This is an observational reprospective cohort at a referral neonatal unit, from 2011 to 2013. Newborns treated with vancomycin for the first episode of late-onset sepsis were included. Total dose in mg/kg/day, dose/m 2 /day, age, weight, body surface and gestational age were identified as independent variables. For predictive analysis of adequate <b>serum</b> <b>levels,</b> multiple linear regressions were performed. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for proper <b>serum</b> vancomycin <b>levels</b> was also obtained. A total of 98 patients received 169 serum dosages of the drug, 41 (24. 3 %) of the doses had <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> that were defined as appropriate. Doses prescribed in mg/kg/day and dose/m 2 /day predicted <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> in only 9 % and 4 % of cases, respectively. Statistical significance was observed with higher doses when the <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> were considered as appropriate (p <  0. 001). A dose of 27  mg/kg/day had a sensitivity of 82. 9 % to achieve correct <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of vancomycin.

40|$|Surfactant protein A (SP-A) and {{intercellular}} adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM - 1) {{were recently}} {{reported to be}} associated with fibrotic changes in pulmonary diseases. Inhaled asbestos induces pulmonary fibrosis leading to asbestosis. To evaluate the possible roles for the development of asbestosis, the <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of SP-A and sICAM- 1 were measured and compared among workers exposed to asbestos (29 patients with asbestosis (PWAs), 50 asbestos-exposed workers without asbestosis (AEWs)), and 51 healthy con- trols (HCs). The mean <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of SP-A were significantly higher in PWAs (53. 2 ± 33. 4 ng/ml) and AEWs (45. 1 ± 30. 2 ng/ml) than that in HCs (28. 8 ± 10. 6 ng/ml). The mean <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of SP-A in smoking population of AEWs and HCs were significantly higher than those in non-smoking AEWs and HCs. The mean <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of SP-A in smokers were significantly higher in PWAs and AEWs than in HCs. The mean <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of SP-A in non-smokers were significantly higher in PWAs than in HCs. The mean <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of sICAM- 1 were significantly higher in PWAs (270. 2 ± 114. 8 ng/ml) and AEWs (250. 7 ± 80. 5 ng/ml) than in HCs (152. 2 ± 49. 9 ng/ml). The mean <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of sICAM - 1 in AEWs were significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. The mean <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of sICAM- 1 in smokers were significantly higher in PWAs and AEWs than in HCs. The mean <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of sICAM- 1 in non-smokers were significantly highter in PWAs and AEWs than in HCs. The <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of SP-A were significantly correlated with the <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of sICAM- 1 in PWAs and AEWs. In conclusion, the present study suggests that asbestos exposure is independently related to the elevation of <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of both SP-A and sICAM- 1 and that this elevation is associated with the development of asbestosis. SP -A and sICAM- 1 can be useful markers in detecting early asbestos-related disorders...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The {{present study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of prolactin and the inflammatory status in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients with normal weight. Methods. Patients with normal weight, drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls were enrolled in the study. <b>Serum</b> <b>levels</b> of prolactin (PRL) were measured using electrical chemiluminescence immunoassay. <b>Serum</b> <b>levels</b> of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. Sixty patients with normal weight, drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia and 60 healthy controls were enrolled. The schizophrenia group had higher <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of PRL, IL- 1 beta, IL- 6 and TNF-alpha compared with the control group. There was a gender difference of hyperprolactinemia in schizophrenia group. There were positive relationships between <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of PRL and <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of IL- 1 beta, IL- 6 and TNF-alpha within the schizophrenia group. Within the schizophrenia group, TNF-alpha was the strongest predictor among the three cytokines for <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of prolactin after controlling for gender, age, education, smoking status and disease duration.

40|$|Obesity is {{characterized}} by alterations in immune and inflammatory function. In order to evaluate the potential role of cytokine expression by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) in obesity-associated inflammation, we studied <b>serum</b> protein <b>levels</b> and mRNA levels in PBMC of interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 1 β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α and IL- 1 Ra in nine lean and 10 obese subjects. Serum IL- 1 β was undetectable, IL- 1 Ra <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> were elevated, <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of TNF-α were decreased and <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of IL- 6 were similar in obese subjects compared to lean subjects, while transcript levels of IL- 6, IL- 1 β and TNF-α, but not IL- 1 Ra, were decreased in PBMC from obese subjects. PBMC from obese subjects did, however, up-regulate cytokine expression in response to leptin. Thus, obesity-associated changes in IL- 1 Ra <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> and IL- 6 mRNA levels were not correlated with changes in cognate mRNA and <b>serum</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively, while TNF-α <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> and PBMC mRNA levels were both decreased in obese patients. While immune alterations in obesity are manifest in peripheral blood lymphocytes, the general lack of correlation between altered <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> and altered PBMC gene expression suggests that PBMC may not be the source of aberrant <b>serum</b> cytokine <b>levels</b> in obesity...|$|R

We investigated alterations in NGF and VEGF-A <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> in opiate-dependent patients (25 male patients), who received diamorphine (DAM, heroin) treatment within a structured opiate maintenance program, and compared the results with the NGF and VEGF-A <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of healthy controls (23 male controls). NGF and VEGF-A <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> were assessed before and after DAM administration twice a day (in the morning (16 h after last application [...] t 1) and in the afternoon (7 h after last application [...] t 3)) in order to detect a possible immediate or summative (in the afternoon) heroin effect on these two neuropeptides. Moreover, we investigated possible associations between the <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of these neurotrophic growth factors and psychometric dimensions of addictive behavior, e. g. craving, withdrawal, depression. Whereas there was no direct effect of DAM application on the <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of both neurotrophic growth factors neither in the morning nor in the afternoon, the NGF <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> of the patient group were found to be significantly increased at all four time points of investigation compared with the healthy controls. In contrast, VEGF-A <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> did not differ significantly in the patient and control groups. We found a significant positive association between the NGF <b>serum</b> <b>levels</b> and several items of the short opiate withdrawal scale as well as a negative association between self-reported mood (measured by visual analogue scale) and mood before heroin application (in the morning as in the afternoon).
