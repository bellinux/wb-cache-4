40|$|Purpose - The {{sensitivity}} of orifice plate metering to poorly conditioned and <b>swirling</b> <b>flows</b> are subjects of concerns to <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> users and manufacturers. The distortions caused by pipe fittings and pipe installations upstream of the orifice plate are {{major sources of}} this type of non-standard flows. These distortions will alter the accuracy of metering up to an unacceptable degree. Design/methodology/approach - The design of orifice plate meters that are independent of the initial flow conditions of the upstream is a major object of <b>flow</b> <b>metering.</b> Either using a long straight pipe or a flow conditioner upstream of an orifice plate usually achieves this goal. The effect of cone swirler flow conditioner for both standard and non-standard flow conditions has been carried out in the experimental rig. The measuring of mass flow rate under different conditions and different Reynolds numbers were used to establish a change in discharge coefficient relative to a standard one. Findings - The experimental results using the cone swirler flow conditioner showed that the combination of an orifice plate and cone swirler flow conditioner is broadly insensitive to upstream disturbances. The results clearly show that this flow conditioner can attenuate the effect of both <b>swirling</b> and asymmetric <b>flows</b> on <b>metering</b> to an acceptable level. Originality/value - Previous work on the orifice plate has shown that the concept has promise. The results of using a combination of a cone swirler and orifice plate for non-standard <b>flow</b> conditions including <b>swirling</b> <b>flow</b> and asymmetric flow show this package can preserve the accuracy of metering up to the level required in the standards, providing that a new discharge coefficient is used for the combined swirler and orifice plate...|$|R

40|$|The {{surfactant}} used in {{this study}} is well known as an additive for drag reduction in straight (non-swirling) pipe flow. This paper deals with <b>swirling</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics of a surfactant solution. We investigated the effects of surfactant concentration and Reynolds number on flow characteristics. It is shown that the drag reducing effect is less than in straight pipe flow, and that the surfactant solution must be highly concentrated with great elasticity in order to produce a drag reduction. As the results of velocity measurement by LDV and wall pressure measurement in the axial direction, it is expected that the swirl intensity of the drag reducing <b>swirling</b> <b>flow</b> with a surfactant decays more quickly as the flow progresses downstream. And we propose that this mechanism helps create the drag reduction in <b>swirling</b> <b>flow.</b> For the velocity profiles of drag reducing <b>swirling</b> <b>flow,</b> only the forced-vortex type is observed in this experiment.

In this work, we examined five turbulence models, the renormalization group #kappa#-#epsilon# model, for the non-linear #kappa#-#epsilon# model, the algebraic Reynolds stress model, the differential Reynolds stress model as well as the standard #kappa#-#epsilon# model. To investigate their behaviour of prediction of confined turbulent <b>swirling</b> <b>flows,</b> the <b>swirling</b> straight pipe <b>flow,</b> <b>swirling</b> diffuser <b>flow,</b> <b>swirling</b> <b>flow</b> in a curved pipe and vortex throttle flow were calculated and the calculated results were compared with the measured data. From these investigations, we find that the standard #kappa#-#epsilon# model can make satisfactory prediction to the <b>swirling</b> diffuser <b>flow.</b> But to other flows, the behaviour of the standard #kappa#-#epsilon# model is poor. Basically, the renormalization group #kappa#-#epsilon# model and algebraic Reynolds stress model have similar properties as the standard #kappa#-#epsilon# model. The differential Reynolds stress model that is used in this work and the non-linear #kappa#-#epsilon# model clearly improve the prediction of the turbulent <b>swirling</b> <b>flows</b> compared with the other turbulence models, and so they are recommended more suitably to predict the turbulent <b>swirling</b> <b>flows.</b> It is also important to develop numerical algorithms for calculation of turbulent <b>swirling</b> <b>flows</b> that guarantee the stability and convergence of the numerical solutions, because the complicated turbulence models, such as, the non-linear #kappa#-#epsilon# model, algebraic Reynolds stress model and differential Reynolds stress model often destabilize the numerical algorithm to calculate complex flows.
