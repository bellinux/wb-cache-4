40|$|Whereas recent {{scholarly}} {{research has}} provided many insights about universities engaging in commercial activities, {{there is still}} little empirical evidence regarding the opposite phenomenon of companies disseminating scientific knowledge. Our paper aims to fill this gap and explores the motivations of firms that disclose research outcomes in a <b>scientific</b> <b>format.</b> Besides considering an internal firm dimension, we focus particularly on knowledge sourcing from academic institutions and the appropriability regime using a cost-benefit framework. We conduct an econometric analysis with firm-level data from the fourth edition of the French Community Innovation Survey (CIS 4) and matched scientific publications for a sample of 2, 512 R&D performing firms from all manufacturing sectors. The analysis provides evidence that the access to important scientific knowledge imposes the adoption of academic disclosure principles, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong predictor. Furthermore, {{the results suggest that}} overall industry conditions are influential in shaping the cost-benefit rationale of firms with respect to scientific disclosure...|$|E

40|$|Founded in 2012, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) {{is one of}} {{the most}} ambitious {{attempts}} to date to bridge the divide between scientific knowledge and indigenous and local knowledge. Doing so requires overcoming participatory, epistemological and ontological challenges, including different communicative forms, diverging criteria for knowledge validation, and conflicting views of nature. Central IPBES documents are analyzed to see how the platform deals with these challenges. While IPBES constitutes an unprecedented, innovative and ambitious institutional design for the cross-fertilization of knowledge, the results show that IPBES (i) struggles to reconcile an open, collaborative atmosphere with the demands for structure set by the <b>scientific</b> <b>format,</b> (ii) tends to shy away from potentially conflict-laden issues and disagreements, (iii) often treats scientific knowledge and indigenous or local knowledge as easily distinguishable entities, and (iv) has yet to solve the epistemological challenges of knowledge generation and validation when working across knowledge-systems. Taken together, these features seem to hinder the cross-fertilization of knowledge. The case of IPBES thus holds important lessons for future efforts to transform both knowledge production and the overall framing of challenges within global environmental governance...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{database}} management systems (DBMSs) have historically seen very limited use within the scientific computing community. One {{reason for this}} absence is that previous database systems lacked support for the extensible data structures and performance features required within a high-performance computing context. However, database vendors have recently enhanced the functionality of their systems by adding object extensions to the relational engine. In principle, these extensions allow for the representation of a rich collection of scientific datatypes and common statistical operations. Utilizing these new extensions, this paper presents {{a study of the}} suitability of incorporating two popular <b>scientific</b> <b>formats,</b> NetCDF and HDF, into an object-relational system. To assess the performance of the database approach, a series of solution variables from a regional weather forecast model are used to build representative small, medium and large databases.

40|$|ACE 10 Question Learning Objectives Writing: Students will {{generally}} be {{writing in a}} <b>scientific</b> <b>format</b> for the first time. This may {{be very different from}} prior writing in the university. This will come from discussions in the classroom sessions and from feedback on the course paper chapters that are submitted during the progress of the course. Oral Communication: This is reinforced by the presentation of relevant papers from the scientific literature during most of the class periods. Students need to learn to master the content of such papers, prioritize the important elements, and present them in a coherent fashion. The student effort receives intrinsic feedback during the process by questions and comments from the instructor and from the other students. Critical Thinking: Critical thinking can only be done once a student has mastered a significant amount of foundational literature. Students {{at the start of the}} topic will have little ability to carry out critical thinking about the course theme. As students read more of the primary literature and seek out other references to flesh out certain aspects and to reconcile contradictory reports, they will be encouraged to reflect on the epistemology of the conclusions. Ethics: Each section of the class involves one class session related to an ethical issue. This usually involves a case study that is read prior to the class and a group discussion. In some cases, it is productive to have students attempt to present differing viewpoints, but in for other topics, students seem able to grasp the diverse social impacts.

40|$|Evidence to {{the case}} that {{classical}} gravitation provides the clue to {{make sense out of}} quantum gravity is presented. The key observation is the existence in classical gravitation of child universe solutions or "almost" solutions, "almost" because of some singularity problems. The difficulties of these child universe solutions due to their generic singularity problems will be very likely be cured by quantum effects, just like for example "almost" instanton solutions are made relevant in gauge theories with breaking of conformal invariance. Some well motivated modifcations of General Relativity where these singularity problems are absent even at the classical level are discussed. High energy density excitations, responsible for UV divergences in quantum field theories, including quantum gravity, are likely to be the source of child universes which carry them out of the original space time. This decoupling could prevent these high UV excitations from having any influence on physical amplitudes. Child universe production could therefore be responsible for UV regularization in quantum field theories which take into account semiclassically gravitational effects. Child universe production in the last stages of black hole evaporation, the prediction of absence of tranplanckian primordial perturbations, connection to the minimum length hypothesis and in particular the connection to the maximal curvature hypothesis are discussed. Some discussion of superexcited states in the case these states are Kaluza Klein excitations is carried out. Finally, the posibility of obtaining "string like" effects from the wormholes associated with the child universes is discussed.

40|$|Rationale From general {{practitioners}} to academic staff, clinicians {{continue to have}} difficulties in applying clinical epidemiology in their everyday work. They do not fully understand the logical rules behind the numbers {{and they do not}} recognize these rules in their work. We present a new model where the pre-test and the post-test probabilities are converted to log 10 of odds, and the likelihood ratio (LR) to its own log 10. Methods Following Bayes' theorem, adding the log 10 LR to the log 10 pre-test odds gives the log 10 post-test odds, which can easily be represented on a logarithmic scale. In addition, by rounding the log 10 LR to half the unit, we create classes of discriminative power of tests, close to intuitive estimation. This model generates also a user-friendly diagram, adding considerably to the understanding of Bayes' theorem. We evaluated the effect of the rounding, the current use of the classical model and the acceptability of the new model. Results Rounding 10 disease characteristics to half the unit gives an absolute error of less than half a unit. After six explanations of Bayes' theorem, only 6 / 16 medical students were capable of answering simple questions about predictive value. When asked about weight of disease characteristics, no one of the 50 clinicians mentioned sensitivity, specificity, predictive value or LR. With the new model, more than 80 % of trainees found medical decision making easier to understand and recognized the theory in their practice. Conclusions We conclude that our model of diagnostic clinical epidemiology offers a logical environment for an easy and rapid assessment of the evolution of disease probability with consecutive tests, providing a <b>scientific</b> <b>format</b> for 'qualitative' clinical estimations...|$|E
