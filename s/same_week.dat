40|$|Abstract Background Computerized {{morbidity}} registration networks {{might serve}} as early warning systems in a time where natural epidemics such as the H 1 N 1 flu can easily spread from one region to another. Methods In this contribution we examine whether general practice based broad-spectrum computerized morbidity registration networks {{have the potential to}} act as a valid surveillance instrument of frequently occurring diseases. We compare general practice based computerized data assessing the frequency of influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) with data from a well established case-specific sentinel network, the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS). The overall frequency and trends of weekly ILI and ARI data are compared using both networks. Results Detection of influenza-like illness and acute respiratory illness occurs equally fast in EISS and the computerized network. The overall frequency data for ARI are the same for both networks, the overall trends are similar, but the increases and decreases in frequency do not occur in exactly the <b>same</b> <b>weeks.</b> For ILI, the overall rate was slightly higher for the computerized network population, especially before the increase of ILI, the overall trend was almost identical and the increases and decreases occur in the <b>same</b> <b>weeks</b> for both networks. Conclusions Computerized morbidity registration networks are a valid tool for monitoring frequent occurring respiratory diseases and the detection of sudden outbreaks. </p...|$|R
30|$|Social {{interactions}} {{within a}} group of participants can form a community if they occur more frequently within the group than {{with other members of}} the network. In temporal text networks, those interactions are the result of the exchange of messages between actors. In this example we show how our model can be used to find communities of actors discussing about the same topics during the <b>same</b> <b>weeks.</b> Following the method described in “Discrete analysis” section we first transform our network to a multilayer network preserving information about interactions between users, topics and time, so that we can then apply an existing clustering algorithm.|$|R
