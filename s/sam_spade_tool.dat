50|$|Duff {{began working}} in radio {{while in the}} {{military}} during World War II. He announced re-broadcasts prepared for Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In this role, he served as the announcer for Suspense dated March 16, 1943. Duffs greatest radio role was when he played Dashiell Hammetts private eye <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade</b> from 1946 to 1950, starring in The Adventures of <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade</b> on three different networks: ABC, CBS, and NBC. Lurene Tuttle starred as Effie Perrine, Spades attentive secretary. In 1951, Steve Dunne took {{over the role of}} <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Adventures of <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade,</b> Detective was a {{radio series}} based loosely {{on the private}} detective {{character}} <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade,</b> created by writer Dashiell Hammett for The Maltese Falcon. The show ran for 13 episodes on ABC in 1946, for 157 episodes on CBS in 1946-1949, and finally for 51 episodes on NBC in 1949-1951. The series starred Howard Duff (and later, Steve Dunne) as <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade</b> and Lurene Tuttle as his secretary Effie, and took a considerably more tongue-in-cheek approach to the character than the novel or movie. The announcer was Dick Joy.|$|R
5000|$|In the Dashiell Hammett book The Maltese Falcon and the 1941 Warner Bros film, <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade's</b> partner, Miles Archer, is {{shot and}} killed with a Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver. The {{revolver}} {{is shown in the}} film being fired when Archer is shot. Soon after, the unique cylinder is clearly visible when an investigating detective shows the revolver to <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade.</b> <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade</b> then identifies the gun as a [...] "Webley-Fosbery". However, Bogart says it's a [...] "45 caliber, 8 shot," [...] which is not correct because {{it would have to be}} a [...]38 caliber to be 8 shots. The 45 caliber was only 6 shots. In the original book, <b>Sam</b> <b>Spade</b> refers to it as a [...] "Thirty-eight, eight shot.", so the script writer changed it, wrongly, from the original.|$|R
