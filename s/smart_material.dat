[...] A very simple example: a photosensor might passively measure the incident light and discharge its absorbed energy as electricity when the light passes above or below a specified threshold, sending a signal to a larger machine. [...] Such a sensor would supposedly cost less and use less power than a conventional sensor, and yet function usefully in all the same applications [...] for example, turning on parking lot lights when it gets dark.|$|E
