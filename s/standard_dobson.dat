40|$|The 1992 global average total ozone, {{measured}} by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on the Nimbus- 7 satellite, was 2 to 3 percent lower than any earlier year observed by TOMS (1979 to 1991). Ozone amounts were low {{in a wide range}} of latitudes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and the largest decreases were in the regions from 10 to 20 deg S and 10 to 60 deg N. Global ozone in 1992 is at least 1. 5 percent lower than would be predicted by a statistical model that includes a linear trend and accounts for solar cycle variation and the quasi-biennial oscillation. These results are confirmed by comparisons with data from other ozone monitoring instruments: the SBUV/ 2 instrument on the NOAA- 11 satellite, the TOMS instrument on the Russian Meteor- 3 satellite, the World <b>Standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> Instrument 83, and a collection of 22 ground-based Dobson instruments...|$|E
40|$|A new {{method is}} {{presented}} to determine vertical ozone profiles from measurements of spectral global (direct Sun plus upper hemisphere) irradiance in the ultraviolet. The method {{is similar to the}} widely used Umkehr technique, which inverts measurements of zenith sky radiance. The procedure was applied to measurements of a high-resolution spectroradiometer installed near the centre of the Greenland ice sheet. Retrieved profiles were validated with balloon-sonde observations and ozone profiles from the space-borne Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). Depending on altitude, the bias between retrieval results presented in this paper and MLS observations ranges between − 5 and + 3  %. The magnitude of this bias is comparable, if not smaller, to values reported in the literature for the <b>standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> Umkehr method. Total ozone columns (TOCs) calculated from the retrieved profiles agree to within 0. 7 ± 2. 0  % (± 1 σ) with TOCs measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on board the Aura satellite. The new method is called the Global-Umkehr method...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{recalibration}} and reprocessing of {{the total}} ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) data have made possible a new determination of the global average total ozone decrease of 3. 5 percent over the 11 -year period, January 1, 1979, to December 31, 1989, with a 2 sigma error of 1. 4 percent. The revised TOMS ozone trend data are in agreement, within error limits, with the average of 39 ground-based Dobson stations and with the world <b>standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> spectrometer 83 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Superimposed on the 11 -year ozone trend is a possible solar cycle effect, quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), annual, and semiannual cycles. Using solar 10 - 7 -cm flux data and 30 -mbar Singapore wind data (QBO), a time series has been constructed that reproduces the long-term behavior of the globally averaged ozone. Removal of the apparent solar cycle effect from the global average reduces the net ozone loss to 2. 66 + or - 1. 4 percent per decade. The precise value of the global average ozone trend depends on the latitude range selected, with ranges greater than + or - 69 emphasizing the larger variations at high latitudes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{exploits}} nadir spectral measurements in 325 - 335 nm {{range to}} infer total column ozone (TCO) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) and SCaning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY(SCIAMACHY) instruments. TCO {{from these two}} instruments retrieved using the Weighting Function Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFDOAS) are presented. Unlike in standard DOAS where the fitting procedure results inozone slant column which needs to be converted into vertical column (TCO) by using air mass factor (AMF), in our novel approach direct retrieval of vertical column amounts of ozone is possible by fitting vertically integratedozone weighting function to the sun-normalized radiances. Other implementations include proper modelling of the Ring effect including Raman correction for ozone absorption, the implicit use of the effective albedo and effective sceneheight accounting for cloud effects, and an ozone temperature correction. The new algorithm has been extensively validated with ground-based Dobson andBrewer TCO measurements. In general, the agreement between GOME WFDOAS and ground stations data is very good and the validation shows that the retrieval accuracy of WFDOAS is within the uncertainty of current ground-based instruments. Better agreements are observed in the comparison withBrewer measurements than with Dobson measurements. This may be explained {{to a large extent}} by the neglect of ozone temperature correction in the <b>standard</b> retrieval for <b>Dobson</b> and Brewer. Temperature correction has a larger effect onthe Dobson results. The accuracy of WFDOAS retrievals makes GOME data very attractive for evaluating the ground-based network data. Eight years of GOME data are used to assess the quality of the WOUDC-archived Brewer data. It is shown that monitoring of Brewer data quality and identification ofproblems in Brewer instruments are possible. This method can also be applied to other ground-based instruments. Despite improvement with WFDOAS, somewhat larger differences between satellite TCO and ground based measurements remain at high latitudes under low sun conditions. The persistent TCO differences are due in part to profile shape sensitivity of satellite TCO retrieval algorithms. Improved ozone and temperature profile climatologies, which is prepared and presented in this thesis, will lead to improved satellite ozone measurements. The effect of ozone and temperature profiles on TCO retrievals is explored. The studydemonstrates that an improved and updated ozone and temperature climatological profiles can reduce the systematic errors in the retrieved GOME TCO, inparticular at high solar zenith angles. For SCIAMACHY application, the only change of algorithm is for calculating the reference spectra online in each iteration during retrievals rather than using look-up tables. Scaled SCIAMACHY FM ozone cross-section and wavelength pre-shifted by 0. 016 nm, as determined from our comprehensive investigation performed in this thesis, is used for the calculation of reference spectra and the Ring spectra. Improved cloud products and the new ozone and temperature profile climatologies are used. Quality of theretrieved TCO is assessed by correlative measurements from GOME and selected Brewer spectrophotometers. In general a good agreement is achieved apart from a scan angle dependent offset of about - 1 % to - 2 %. The reason for the offset is not understood but part of the offset might be related to thecalibration errors in the level 1 data. Nevertheless, combined data set from GOME and SCIAMACHY as retrieved from WFDOAS algorithm presented in this thesis will be valuable for long-term ozone studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of the calibration of the Nimbus 7 solar backscatter UV (SBUV) and {{total ozone mapping spectrometer}} (TOMS) instruments by comparing their ozone measurements with those made by a single, very stable Dobson instrument: the world primary <b>standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> spectrometer number 83. Measurements of ozone made with instrument 83 at Mauna Loa observatory in eight summers between 1979 and 1989 were compared with coincident TOMS ozone measurements. The comparison shows that relative to instrument 83, ozone measured by TOMS (and SBUV) was stable between 1979 and approximately 1983, had decreased by 3 percent by 1986, and had decreased by almost 7 percent by 1989. A similar time dependence is seen when data from an ensemble of 39 Dobson stations throughout the world is compared with TOMS over the period 1979 - 1987. The most likely reason for the relative drift is that the diffuser plate used by both SBUV and TOMS to measure solar flux has suffered an uncorrected wavelength-dependent degradation, with most of the degradation occurring after 1983. The recently released version 6 TOMS data, corrected using the internal 'pair justification' technique, show almost no drift relative to Dobson instrument 83. Accurate measurements of long-term global ozone change will require a coherent system incorporating both ground-based and satellite-based ozone measurements...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of retrieved total column ozone (TCO) amounts between the Pandora # 34 spectrometer {{system and the}} Dobson # 061 spectrophotometer from direct-sun observations {{was performed on the}} roof of the Boulder, Colorado, NOAA building. This paper, part of an ongoing study, covers a 1 -year period starting on 17 December 2013. Both the <b>standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> and Pandora TCO retrievals required a correction, TCO(sub corr) = TCO (1 + C(T)), using a monthly varying effective ozone temperature, T(sub E), derived from a temperature and ozone profile climatology. The correction is used to remove a seasonal difference caused by using a fixed temperature in each retrieval algorithm. The respective corrections C(T(sub E)) are C(sub Pandora) = 0. 00333 (T(sub E) - 225) and C(sub Dobson) = - 0. 0013 (T(sub E) - 226. 7) per degree K. After the applied corrections removed most of the seasonal retrieval dependence on ozone temperature, TCO agreement between the instruments was within 1 % for clear-sky conditions. For clear-sky observations, both co-located instruments tracked the day-to-day variation in total column ozone amounts with a correlation of r(exp 2) = 0. 97 and an average offset of 1. 1 +/- 5. 8 DU. In addition, the Pandora TCO data showed 0. 3 % annual average agreement with satellite overpass data from AURA/OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and 1 % annual average offset with Suomi-NPP/OMPS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, the nadir viewing portion of the Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite) ...|$|E
40|$|Total {{ozone data}} {{obtained}} during summers at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, with Dobson Spectrophotometer 83 are routinely compared with overpass total ozone {{data from the}} Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) spectrometer launched aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite in 1978. Results from the TOMS/Dobson instrument comparisons through 1990 have been presented by McPeters and Komhyr (1991). Dobson spectrophotometer 83 was established as the standard instrument for the U. S. A. Dobson instrument station network in 1962. In 1980, the instrument was designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as the <b>Standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> Spectrophotometer for the World. Long-term ozone measurement precision of the instrument has been maintained at plus or minus 0. 5 percent (Komhyr et al., 1989). On an absolute scale, the ozone measurement accuracy of the instrument is estimated to plus or minus 3 percent. In early April, 1990, comparison of total ozone and vertical distribution (Umkehr) observations were made {{for the first time}} with Dobson spectrophotometer 8. 3. The work was conducted at the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) in Boulder, Colorado, and at the research and instrument manufacturing facility of the Ball Aerospace System Division located about 2 km east of Boulder. (The SBUV- 2 S/N- 2 instrument, built by Ball Aerospace Systems Division, is scheduled for launch aboard the NOAA- 13 satellite). We present results of the comparisons which include ozone vertical distribution data obtained with a balloon-borne electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesonde (Komhyr, 1969) ...|$|E
40|$|NASA is {{creating}} a long term satellite ozone time series by combining data from multiple instruments: Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) (1978 - 1993), Meteor 3 TOMS (1991 - 1994), Earth Probe TOMS (1996 - present), Nimbus 7 SB-JV (1978 - 1990), NOAA- 9 Solar Backscatter UV Spectrometer (SBUV/ 2) (1984 - 1997), NOAA- 11 SBUV/ 2 (1989 - 1994), and NOAA- 14 SBUV/ 2 (1995 - present). The stability of individual data sets and possible instrument-to-instrument differences are best checked by comparison with ground-based measurements. We have examined the time dependence of the calibrations of these instruments by comparing satellite derived ozone with that measured by the world primary <b>standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> spectrometer No. 83. This instrument has been maintained since 1962 as a standard for total ozone to an uncertainty of plus or minus 0. 5 %. Measurements of AD pair ozone made with instrument No. 83 at Mauna Loa observatory most summers since 1979 were compared with coincident TOMS and SBUV(/ 2) ozone measurements. The comparison shows that the various instruments were stable relative to instrument No. 83 to within about plus or minus 1 %, but that there are instrument-to-instrument biases {{of as much as}} 3 %. Earth Probe TOMS, for example, is 1 % to 2 % high relative to Nimbus 7 TOMS when the world standard instrument is used as a transfer standard. Similar results are seen when comparisons are made with an ensemble of 41 Dobson stations throughout the world, demonstrating that the ensemble as a whole is stable despite the fact that many instruments within the ensemble have clear calibration changes...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{measurements}} were taken using the Brewer spectrometer no. 30, the filter ozonometer M 124 no. 200 and the Dobson spectrophotometer no. 71 from September 1987 to December 1988 at Potsdam. The {{performance of the}} instrument types and the compatibility of ozone data was checked under the conditions of a field measuring station. Total ozone values derived from Dobson AD direct sun {{measurements were}} considered as standard. The Dobson instrument had been calibrated at intercomparisons with the World <b>Standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> instrument no. 83 (Boulder) and with the Regional Standard instrument no. 64 (Potsdam), while the Brewer instrument was calibrated several times with the Travelling Standard Brewer no. 17 (Canada). The differences between individual Brewer DS (direct sun) ozone data and Dobson ADDS are within plus or minus 3 percent with half of all differences within plus or minus 1 percent. Less than 0. 7 percent of the systematic difference can be due to atmospheric SO 2. Due to inadequate regression coefficients Brewer ZB (zenith blue) ozone measurements are by (3 [...] . 4) percent higher than Dobson ADDS ozone values. M 124 DS ozone data are systematically by (1 [...] . 2) percent higher than Dobson ADDS ozone with 50 percent of the differences within plus or minus 4 percent, but with extreme differences up to plus or minus (20 [...] . 25) percent. M 124 ZB ozone values are by (3 [...] . 5) percent higher than Dobson ADDS with all the differences within plus or minus 10 percent, i. e. the scatter of differences is smaller for ZB than for M 124 DS measurements, Results for differences in the daily mean ozone values are also addressed. The differences include the uncertainties in the ozone values derived from both types of measurements. They provide {{an indication of the}} uncertainty in ozone data and the comparability of ozone values derived from different types of instruments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} ultraviolet narrowband interference filters in the spectrophotometric determination of local atmospheric total ozone burdens. An investigation of a prototype interference filter spectrophotometer shows that its total ozone measurements are in error owing to {{the breadth of the}} filters' passband skirts and to the transmittance sideband leakages of the filters. Accurate spectral transmittance measurements, extending down to transmittances of 10 - 7, are described and show that the leakage sidebands generally occur close to the passbands and in the near infrared spectral region. An outline of the design and construction of a new, more accurate filter spectrophotometer is given. The use of stacks of two filters at each wavelength greatly improves the narrowness of the passband skirts and significantly decreases the transmittances of the leakage sidebands. In addition a very effective sideband blocking filter is used. The considerably improved performance of this new spectrophotometer is confirmed by the results of a direct comparison of the instrument with a <b>standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> prism spectrophotometer. A study is presented of the effects of filter non-uniformity, orientation, aging and temperature. This enables the establishment of criteria in these regards for accurate total ozone-measurement. A similar study is made of the instrument's photomultiplier detector. The effects of the filters' finite bandwidths are analysed by a numerical simulation of the spectral characteristics of the whole measurement process. The theory involved is given. Calculations show that double stacked filters perform considerably better than single filters. Over the usual operating ranges of airmass and total ozone, the error in the total ozone measurement due to the filter bandwidth effect, is found to be about ± 1. 0 % for the doubled-filter instrument. Corrections for the error are tabulated...|$|E
40|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>Dobson</b> Umkehr {{methodology}} {{to retrieve}} coarse-resolution ozone profiles {{used by the}} National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration uses designated solar zenith angles (SZAs). However, some information may be lost if measurements lie outside the designated SZA range (between 60 ° and 90 °), or {{do not conform to}} the fitting technique. Also, while Umkehr measurements can be taken using multiple wavelength pairs (A, C and D), past retrieval methods have focused on a single pair (C). Here we present an Umkehr inversion method that uses measurements at all SZAs (termed operational) and all wavelength pairs. (Although, we caution direct comparison to other algorithms.) Information content for a Melbourne, Australia (38 ° S, 145 ° E) Umkehr measurement case study from 28 January 1994, with SZA range similar to that designated in previous algorithms is shown. When comparing the typical single wavelength pair with designated SZAs to the operational measurements, the total degrees of freedom (independent pieces of information) increases from 3. 1 to 3. 4, with the majority of the information gain originating from Umkehr layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10 – 20 km and 25 – 30 km respectively). In addition to this, using all available wavelength pairs increases the total degrees of freedom to 5. 2, with the most significant increases in Umkehr layers 2 + 3 to 7 and 9 + (10 – 40 and 45 – 80 km). Investigating a case from 13 April 1970 where the measurements extend beyond the 90 ° SZA range gives further information gain, with total degrees of freedom extending to 6. 5. Similar increases are seen in the information content. Comparing the retrieved Melbourne Umkehr time series with ozonesondes shows excellent agreement in layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10 – 20 and 25 – 30 km) for both C and A + C + D-pairs. Retrievals in layers 5 and 6 (25 – 30 and 30 – 35 km) consistently show lower ozone partial column compared to ozonesondes. This is likely due to stray light effects that are not accounted for in the forward model, and under represented stratospheric aerosol...|$|E
