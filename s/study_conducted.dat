5|$|A Limousin/Jersey {{backcross}} <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> in Australia and New Zealand {{to investigate}} {{the effects of the}} F94L myostatin variant concluded that the mutation had no significant effect on birth-weight and growth traits. Averaged over all backcross calves in the trial (total of 766), animals homozygous for the mutation had approximately 6% heavier carcases than animals without the mutation, 15% larger eye muscle (also known as rib eye) area, 13% heavier silverside weight, and 13% heavier total meat weight. Increased meat weight and size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in total fat weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second backcross <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat and fat quantities in cattle homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that {{families}} failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories.

A broad range of relevant research findings are discussed, including preclinical <b>studies</b> <b>conducted</b> with laboratory animals, laboratory and treatment-outcome <b>studies</b> <b>conducted</b> with cocaine abusers, and large epidemiological <b>studies</b> <b>conducted</b> with national samples of the U.

The Andy Griffith Show {{is one of}} only three shows to have its final season be the number one ranked show on television, the other two being I Love Lucy and Seinfeld. In 1998, more than five million people a day watched the show's reruns on 120 stations.|$|E

5|$|A field <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> {{in winter}} 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be {{territorial}} around {{a rich source}} of nectar, namely a large cup gum (Eucalyptus cosmophylla), driving off smaller honeyeaters. This indicated the species would exclude other species if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be more aggressive if there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.|$|E
5|$|A <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> in 1999 for the City of Portland by {{researchers}} from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|An {{unpublished}} <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 {{suggested that}} previous studies lacked focus on endocranial details. The {{study found that}} the Cryolophosaurus fossil has a nearly complete, undistorted cranial cavity which is complete enough to give an approximate shape and size of the living brain. The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda.|$|E

5|$|Because {{game animals}} can be shot using lead bullets, the {{potential}} for lead ingestion from game meat consumption has been studied clinically and epidemiologically. In a recent <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by the CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus visit Adenanthos cuneatus flowers. A 1978 field <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> around Albany found the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) {{occasionally}} visited Adenanthos cuneatus, while the western spinebill much preferred the species to other flowers. A 1980 field study at Cheyne beach showed that the New Holland honeyeater and white-cheeked honeyeater pollinate it A 1985–86 field study in the Fitzgerald River National Park found that the nectar-feeding honey possum occasionally eats it. The silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) feeds on nectar from the flowers, and has also been observed taking dew-drops from leaves early in the morning.|$|E
