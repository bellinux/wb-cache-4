Traditional clustering algorithms which no longer cater to the data mining requirements are modified increasingly. Clustering algorithms are numerous which can be divided in several categories.

Throughout the breeding season the research included observations of ecological factors (water chemism, zooplankton quantity, macrozoobenthos quantity) and of ichthyoproduction (yield growth, survival rate of fish, average individual mass of fish, Klark’s condition coefficient, Fulton’s condition coefficient and feeding coefficient). The research results show that all fish-ponds had similar water chemism.

40|$|Abstract Background Rice is {{staple food}} {{for more than}} half of the world’s {{population}} including two billion Asians, who obtain 60 - 70 % of their energy intake from rice and its derivatives. To meet the growing demand from human population, rice varieties with higher yield potential and greater yield stability need to be developed. The favourable alleles for yield and yield contributing traits are distributed among two subspecies i. e., indica and japonica of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.). Identification of novel favourable alleles in indica / japonica will pave way to marker-assisted mobilization of these alleles in to a genetic background to break genetic barriers to yield. Results A new plant type (NPT) based mapping population of 310 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to map novel genomic regions and QTL hotspots influencing yield and eleven yield component traits. We identified major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for days to 50 % flowering (R 2 [*]=[*] 25 %, LOD[*]=[*] 14. 3), panicles per plant (R 2 [*]=[*] 19 %, LOD[*]=[*] 9. 74), flag leaf length (R 2 [*]=[*] 22 %, LOD[*]=[*] 3. 05), flag leaf width (R 2 [*]=[*] 53 %, LOD[*]=[*] 46. 5), spikelets per panicle (R 2 [*]=[*] 16 %, LOD[*]=[*] 13. 8), filled grains per panicle (R 2 [*]=[*] 22 %, LOD[*]=[*] 15. 3), percent spikelet sterility (R 2 [*]=[*] 18 %, LOD[*]=[*] 14. 24), thousand grain weight (R 2 [*]=[*] 25 %, LOD[*]=[*] 12. 9) and spikelet <b>setting</b> <b>density</b> (R 2 [*]=[*] 23 %, LOD[*]=[*] 15) expressing over two or more locations by using composite interval mapping. The phenotypic variation (R 2) ranged from 8 to 53 % for eleven QTLs expressing across all three locations. 19 novel QTLs were contributed by the NPT parent, Pusa 1266. 15 QTL hotpots on eight chromosomes were identified for the correlated traits. Six epistatic QTLs effecting five traits at two locations were identified. A marker interval (RM 3276 -RM 5709) on chromosome 4 harboring major QTLs for four traits was identified. Conclusions The present study reveals that favourable alleles for yield and yield contributing traits were distributed among two subspecies of rice and QTLs were co-localized in different genomic regions. QTL hotspots will be useful for understanding the common genetic control mechanism of the co-localized traits and selection for beneficial allele at these loci will result in a cumulative increase in yield due to the integrative positive effect of various QTLs. The information generated in the present study will be useful to fine map and to identify the genes underlying major robust QTLs and to transfer all favourable QTLs to one genetic background to break genetic barriers to yield for sustained food security. </p...|$|E

In order to circumvent the serious difficulty that its existing version can only be effectively carried out on considerably small/medium datasets, a novel scalable synchronization-inspired partitioning clustering algorithm termed LSSPC, based on the center-constrained minimal enclosing ball and the reduced <b>set</b> <b>density</b> estimator, is proposed for large dataset applications.

Then it carries out clustering adaptively on the obtained reduced dataset by using Sync with the Davies-Bouldin clustering criterion and a new order parameter which can help us observe the degree of local synchronization. Finally, it finishes clustering by using the proposed algorithm CRD on the remaining objects in the large dataset, which can capture the outliers and isolated clusters effectively. The effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm LSSPC for large datasets is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified by running on artificial and real datasets.

40|$|Reduced <b>set</b> <b>density</b> {{estimator}} (RSDE) is {{an important}} technique {{that can be used}} to replace the classical Parzen window estimator (PW) for saving the computational cost. Though RSDE demonstrates a nicer performance in the density accuracy and the computational time compared with several existing methods, it still faces the critical challenge for practical applications because of its high time complexity (no less than O (N 2)) and space complexity (O (N 2)) in training the model weighting coefficients on large data sets. In order to overcome this shortcoming, a fast reduced <b>set</b> <b>density</b> estimator algorithm (FRSDE) is proposed in this study. First, the relationship between RSDE and the minimal enclosing ball problems (MEB) in computational geometry is revealed. Then, the finding that RSDE is equivalent to a special MEB problem is derived. With this finding, the fast core-set based MEB approximation algorithm is introduced to develop the proposed algorithm FRSDE. Compared with RSDE, FRSDE has the following distinctive advantage: it can guarantee that the upper bound of the time complexity is linear with the size N of a large data set and the upper bound of the space complexity is independent of N. Our experimental results show that the proposed FRSDE has a competitive performance in the density accuracy and an overwhelming advantage over RSDE for large data sets in the data condensation rate and the training time for the weighting coefficients.

In the course of proving optimal regularity we also improve some of the perturbation theory due to Caffarelli (1981). Since our methods depend on comparison principles and regularity theory, and not on linearity, our stability results apply to a large class of obstacle problems with nonlinear elliptic operators.
