50|$|P. hamatus {{has been}} shown to have {{different}} levels of effect on different crops. In California, P. hamatus is the most common pin nematode (6) and has been seen to reduce crop yield of grapes in vineyards and fig farms by <b>stunting</b> <b>plant</b> growth and reducing fruit size(6). This ultimately results in loss of profits for local farmers. However, data from stone fruit farms in California show no damage to crops with populations of pin nematodes reaching 3000 nematodes/ 1 kg of soil (15). There is also evidence that populations of pin nematodes around 500 nematodes/ 1 kg of soil work as antagonists for other more damaging nematodes producing healthier trees (15). So in that case they are not really detrimental to the plant, but possible indirectly beneficial. This not always the case however. For example, P. hamatus in mint caused losses of 25% - 36% when planted in soil with 8000 nematodes/ quart, which shows it does not play an antagonistic role (4). Overall, the disease severity of P. hamatus is variable and is specific to the species of plant that it is parasitizing on and the concentration at which it is found.|$|E
40|$|The National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) has {{declared}} war on the Chromolaena weed (Chromolaena odorata) in Papua New Guinea (PNG), and has won the first battle. Chromolaena {{is one of the}} most serious invasive weeds in the tropics. As well as having a highly damaging effect on agriculture, the weed is also a major threat to biodiversity. Chromolaena has been spreading since it was first sighted in the Gazelle Peninsula in East New Britain in the 1960 s and is currently confirmed in 12 provinces of PNG. Now NARI, which has been conducting research into the biological control of this weed since 1999, has found two natural enemies of the alien species. Two insects have been released for biological control, the moth Pareuchaetes pseudoinsulata and the gall fly Cecidochares connexa. The larvae of the moth feed on Chromolaena leaves and, when there are sufficient quantities of them, they cause heavy defoliation, resulting in the destruction of the weed. Adults of the gall fly lay eggs in soft apical stem tissue and the larvae, upon hatching, feed in the stem, causing gall formation. The galls affect the flow of water and nutrients to other parts of the weed, thus <b>stunting</b> <b>plant</b> growth and reducing seed production. In the Markham Valley of Morobe Province, the combined effect of the moth and the gall fly has produced spectacular defoliation and the death of many plants in areas of previously impenetrable Chromolaena weed. NARI is rearing and releasing more moth larvae and gallflies, which can be supplied for release when new infestations of Chromolaena weed are detected.

40|$|Abstract only availableWhen Arabidopsis must {{defend itself}} from {{bacterial}} infections, {{the process can}} potentially be harmful to the host plant. The specific gene I am focusing on in my project is SRFR 1 (suppressor of rps 4 -RLD), which {{is involved in the}} avrRps 4 triggered disease resistance pathway. SRFR 1 is located close to the bottom of Arabidopsis' fourth chromosome. It was found that if a T-DNA insertion was made into exon 3 of SRFR 1 in the Arabidopsis accession Columbia- 0 (Col- 0), one fourth of the <b>plants</b> are <b>stunted,</b> indicating that stunting is a recessive trait. <b>Stunting</b> in <b>plants</b> is a phenotype that is related to plants that have their defense mechanisms activated nonstop. However, mutations in SRFR 1 in the Arabidopsis accession RLD did not cause stunting, indicating that genetic differences exist between Col- 0 and RLD that control the stunted phenotype. In order for my project to begin, srfr 1 - 3 plants (T-DNA insertion in SRFR 1, Col- 0 background) were crossed to RLD, and it was determined that stunting was based on two recessive genes. One candidate gene to contribute to stunting caused by the srfr 1 - 3 allele is SNC 1, a Col- 0 gene known to cause stunting if SNC 1 expression is misregulated. The major goal of my project is to find out if SNC 1 is the other gene that is required for stunting. The method I will use to find out if SNC 1 is the second gene required for stunting is by crossing srfr 1 - 3 plants with snc 1 - 11 plants. If srfr 1 - 3 causes stunting but needs SNC 1 to do so, if the SNC 1 gene is not functional theoretically plants should not be stunted. In the F 2 generation, I will genotype <b>stunted</b> <b>plants</b> and determine if the SNC 1 gene is activated or deactivated. If the SNC 1 gene is activated in <b>stunted</b> <b>plants</b> then there is a possibility of SNC 1 being the second responsible gene. If SNC 1 is deactivated in <b>stunted</b> <b>plants,</b> then it cannot be the second gene responsible for stunting. The second part of my project takes an unbiased approach by mapping (or finding the location on the chromosome) the additional gene required for stunting. I will run several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based genetic markers on a selected group of plants and compare phenotypes and genotypes to determine where the target gene is located.

40|$|Summary. Bacterial leaf {{nodulation}} is a {{model of}} exceptional collaboration of bacteria and higher plants. The presence of the endosymbiont is absolutely required to ascertain survival of the host. Abandonment of the symbiotic cycle leads to distorted leaf formation and <b>stunted</b> <b>plant</b> growth, eventually resulting in death of the host. Recently, the endophytes of several Psychotria have been identified as novel Burkholderia species. With our research we are trying to discover the strategies involved in this symbiosis, with Psychotria as the host and Burkholderia as the endosymbiont. To this purpose we thoroughly analyzed healthy nodulated plants and crippled bacteria-free plants...|$|R

40|$|Population {{dynamics}} of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines {{and its effects on}} soybean growth and yield were surveyed in 1989 - 1990. Experiments were conducted in the naturally infested plots and in the treated plots using 10 % enhanced Dimethoate. In 1989, soybean aphids in the untreated plots developed earlier and increased rapidly. Aphid density per 100 plants on June 15 th was over 10, 000, and the rapid development period was over 40 d. But aphids in 1990 developed slightly later with a shorter development period. Soybeans in the untreated plots significantly displayed the symptoms of distorted leaves, shorter stems and <b>stunted</b> <b>plants.</b> Plants in the treated plots were higher (20. 2 cm in 1989) than those in the untreated plots.
