5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the <b>submucosa,</b> and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The <b>submucosa</b> also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{are part}} of the lower {{respiratory}} tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea. The lungs include the bronchial airways that terminate in alveoli, the lung tissue in between, and veins, arteries, nerves and lymphatic vessels. The trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and <b>submucosa.</b> The smaller bronchi have a single layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} pharyngeal walls {{consisting of}} the four constrictor muscles form part of the mechanism of swallowing. The microscopic anatomy is composed of four layers, being from the lumen outwards, the mucosa, <b>submucosa,</b> muscles and the fibrosa, or fibrous layer. The mucosa consists of stratified squamous epithelium, that is generally non-keratinised, except when exposed to chronic irritants such as tobacco smoke. The <b>submucosa</b> contains aggregates of lymphoid tissue.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the other}} parts of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, the human stomach walls consist of an outer mucosa, inner <b>submucosa,</b> muscularis externa, and serosa.|$|E
25|$|More specifically, peptic ulcers {{erode the}} muscularis mucosae, at minimum {{reaching}} {{to the level}} of the <b>submucosa</b> (contrast with erosions, which do not involve the muscularis mucosae).|$|E
25|$|The {{proximity}} of the dento-alveolar process explains the forming of palatal abscesses and the palatal mucosa and <b>submucosa</b> with its numerous glands and the squamous keratinized epithelium is in correlation with the rich tumoral pathology.|$|E
25|$|Meckel's {{diverticulum}} {{is located}} in the distal ileum, usually within 60–100cm (2feet) of the ileocecal valve. This blind segment or small pouch is about 3–6cm (2inch) long and may have a greater lumen diameter than that of the ileum. It runs antimesenterically and has its own blood supply. It is a remnant of the connection from the yolk sac to the small intestine present during embryonic development. It is a true diverticulum, consisting of all 3 layers of the bowel wall which are mucosa, <b>submucosa</b> and muscularis propria.|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue {{is used in}} {{endoscopic}} polypectomy as {{an adjunct}} to saline or epinephrine, and is used for injection into the <b>submucosa</b> around the polyp to be removed. This allows the submucosal tissue plane to be identified after the polyp is removed, which is useful in determining if more tissue needs to be removed, or if there has been a high risk for perforation. Methylene blue is also used as a dye in chromoendoscopy, and is sprayed onto the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract in order to identify dysplasia, or pre-cancerous lesions. Intravenously injected methylene blue is readily released into the urine and thus can be used to test the urinary tract for leaks or fistulas.|$|E
25|$|There are 800-1000 minor {{salivary glands}} located {{throughout}} the oral cavity within the <b>submucosa</b> {{of the oral}} mucosa in the tissue of the buccal, labial, and lingual mucosa, the soft palate, the lateral parts of the hard palate, and {{the floor of the}} mouth or between muscle fibers of the tongue. They are 1-2mm in diameter and unlike the major glands, they are not encapsulated by connective tissue, only surrounded by it. The gland has usually a number of acini connected in a tiny lobule. A minor salivary gland may have a common excretory duct with another gland, or may have its own excretory duct. Their secretion is mainly mucous in nature (except for Von Ebner glands- see next section) and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are sometimes associated with minor salivary glands if there is dry mouth present (see further discussion). The minor salivary glands are innervated by the seventh cranial or facial nerve.|$|E
25|$|Living {{habits are}} varied; the family {{includes}} both bottom-foraging and midwater species. Callichthyids inhabit {{a wide range}} of habitats, from small, swift, oxygen-rich creeks to big rivers and flooded areas. Their habitats may even include swampy and muddy habitats where oxygen may be virtually absent. Callichthyids survive in these conditions by breathing air; air is collected at the water surface and swallowed. The intestines are used to absorb oxygen, and the air is expelled from the anus. The anterior digestive intestine packages digesta into a string of slightly compressed boluses, creating an air channel in the digestive intestine, thus allowing air to pass unimpeded. The posterior intestine is modified for respiration into a thin-walled and highly vascularized structure by reduction of the thickness of the epithelium, <b>submucosa,</b> and muscle layers; though highly modified to absorb air, it is inefficient for digestive purposes. Air moving through the digestive tract facilitates the movement of digesta to the rectum. Unlike other catfish such as loricariids or trichomycterids that may breathe air only under hypoxic conditions, callichthyids breathe air under all water conditions. Some callichthyids are able to absorb air through their hind guts to move short distances on land. Air stored in their digestive tracts also accounts for 75% of the necessary air for neutral buoyancy.|$|E
500|$|The {{wall of the}} {{esophagus}} from the lumen outwards consists of mucosa, <b>submucosa</b> (connective tissue), layers of muscle fibers between layers of fibrous tissue, and an outer layer of connective tissue. The mucosa is a stratified squamous epithelium of around three layers of squamous cells, which contrasts to the single layer of columnar cells of the stomach. The transition between {{these two types of}} epithelium is visible as a zig-zag line. [...] Most of the muscle is smooth muscle although striated muscle predominates in its upper third. It has two muscular rings or sphincters in its wall, one at the top and one at the bottom. The lower sphincter helps to prevent reflux of acidic stomach content. The esophagus has a rich blood supply and venous drainage. Its smooth muscle is innervated by involuntary nerves (sympathetic nerves via the sympathetic trunk and parasympathetic nerves via the vagus nerve) and in addition voluntary nerves (lower motor neurons) which are carried in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle.|$|E
2500|$|The gastric mucosa of {{the stomach}} {{consists}} of the epithelium and the lamina propria (composed of loose connective tissue), with {{a thin layer of}} smooth muscle called the muscularis mucosae separating it from the <b>submucosa</b> beneath. The <b>submucosa</b> lies under the mucosa and consists of fibrous connective tissue, separating the mucosa from the next layer. Meissner's plexus is in this layer. The muscularis externa lies beneath the <b>submucosa,</b> and is unique from other organs of the gastrointestinal tract, consisting of three layers: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>submucosa</b> {{consists}} of a dense irregular layer of connective tissue with large blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves branching into the mucosa and muscularis externa. It contains the [...] submucosal plexus, an enteric nervous plexus, situated on the inner surface of the muscularis externa.|$|E
2500|$|An ulcer ( [...] ; from Latin ulcus, [...] "ulcer, sore") is a {{break in}} the skin or mucous {{membrane}} with loss of surface tissue and the disintegration and necrosis of epithelial tissue. A mucosal ulcer is an ulcer which specifically occurs on a mucous membrane. An ulcer is a tissue defect which has penetrated the epithelial-connective tissue border, with its base at a deep level in the <b>submucosa,</b> or even within muscle or periosteum. An ulcer is a deeper breach of the epithelium than an erosion or an excoriation, and involves damage to both epithelium and lamina propria.|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{modification}} of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and <b>submucosa</b> are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection. The prolapse is exposed {{if it is not}} already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor. The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. [...] "Mucosal proctectomy" [...] was first discussed by Delorme in 1900, now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision, while effectively repairing the prolapse. The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with full-thickness prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation). Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%–75% of patients). Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased. Constipation is improved in 50% of cases, but often urgency and tenesmus are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, anastomotic dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6-32% of cases. Mortality occurs in 0-2.5% cases. There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7-26% cases).|$|E
2500|$|Labial {{reduction}} {{by means}} of a central wedge-resection involves cutting and removing a partial-thickness wedge of tissue from the thickest portion of the labium minus. Unlike the edge-resection technique, the resection pattern of the central wedge technique preserves the natural rugosity ("wrinkled" [...] edge) of the labia minora. If performed as a full-thickness resection, there exists the potential risk of damaging the pertinent labial nerves, which can result in painful neuromas, and numbness. A partial thickness removal of mucosa and skin, leaving the <b>submucosa</b> intact, decreases the risk of this complication. F. Giraldo et al. procedurally refined the central wedge resection technique with an additional 90-degree Z-plasty technique, which produces a refined surgical scar that is less tethered, and diminishes the physical tensions exerted upon the surgical-incision wound, and, therefore, reduces the likelihood of a notched (scalloped-edge) scar. The central wedge-resection technique is a demanding surgical procedure, and difficulty can arise with judging the correct amount of labial skin to resect, which might result in either undercorrection (persistent tissue-redundancy), or the overcorrection (excessive tension to the surgical wound), and an increased probability of surgical-wound separation. The benefit of this technique is that an extended wedge can be brought upwards towards the prepuce to treat a prominent clitoral hood without a separate incision. This leads to a natural contour for the finished result, and avoids direct incisions near the highly-sensitive clitoris.|$|E
50|$|The <b>submucosa</b> is also {{identified}} in endoscopic ultrasound {{to identify the}} depth of tumours and to identify other abnormalities. An injection of dye, saline, or epinephrine into the <b>submucosa</b> is imperative in the safe removal of certain polyps.|$|E
50|$|Identification of the <b>submucosa</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy, where special fibre-optic cameras are used to perform procedures on the gastrointestinal tract. Abnormalities of the <b>submucosa,</b> such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, usually show integrity of the mucosal surface.|$|E

[...] Other examples include periosteum and perichondrium and tunica albugenia. In the <b>submucosa</b> layer, the fiber bundles course in varying planes allowing the organ to resist excessive stretching and distension.|$|E

50|$|In 1999 {{the same}} team showed that the {{presence}} of a non-lifting sign correlated with the depth of invasion of the <b>submucosa</b> by early colorectal cancers that were being considered for endoscopic resection. The tumours which did lift when fluid was injected were found to be less invasive than those that did not (sm1 or sm2 - invasion confined to the upper two thirds of the <b>submucosa,</b> with at least 1mm of uninvolved <b>submucosa</b> underneath). It is thought that the non-lifting sign is due to fibrosis around the tumour causing tethering of the tumour to the muscularis mucosae.|$|E
50|$|A <b>submucosa</b> {{may or may}} not {{be present}} deep to the dense layer of the lamina propria, {{depending}} on the region of the oral cavity. If present, the <b>submucosa</b> usually contains loose connective tissue and may also contain adipose tissue or salivary glands, as well as overlying bone or muscle within the oral cavity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>submucosa</b> (or tela <b>submucosa)</b> is a {{thin layer}} of tissue in various organs of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and {{genitourinary}} tracts. It is the layer of dense irregular connective tissue that supports the mucosa (mucous membrane) and joins it to the muscular layer, the bulk of overlying smooth muscle (fibers running circularly within layer of longitudinal muscle).|$|E
50|$|Submucosal fistulae pass superficially {{beneath the}} <b>submucosa</b> {{and do not}} cross either {{sphincter}} muscle.|$|E

5000|$|The submucous plexus (Meissner's plexus, plexus of the <b>submucosa,</b> plexus submucosus) {{lies in the}} <b>submucosa</b> of the {{intestinal}} wall. The nerves of this plexus are derived from the myenteric plexus which itself {{is derived from the}} plexuses of parasympathetic nerves around the superior mesenteric artery. Branches from the myenteric plexus perforate the circular muscle fibers to form the submucous plexus. Ganglia from the plexus extend into the muscularis mucosae and to the mucous membrane.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>submucosa</b> ( [...] + mucosa) is to a mucous {{membrane}} what the subserosa ( [...] + serosa) is to a serous membrane.|$|E
5000|$|The non-lifting sign is the {{suitability}} of large flat or sessile colorectal polyps for polypectomy by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). When fluid is injected under a polyp in preparation for endoscopic mucosal resection, some polyps do not [...] "lift", indicating that the polyp is not separating from the <b>submucosa.</b> This makes polypectomy more technically difficult, and {{increases the risk of}} intestinal perforation if polypectomy is then attempted. It is also thought to be indicative of an early colorectal cancer that has invaded the <b>submucosa</b> significantly (sm3 - invasion down to the lower one third of the <b>submucosa),</b> which would make surgical removal of the tumour preferable to allow complete removal of the cancer. Consequently, the non-lifting sign is generally considered to be a contraindication to performing endoscopic mucosal resection.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the other}} parts of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, the human stomach walls consist of an outer mucosa, and inner <b>submucosa,</b> muscularis externa, and serosa.|$|E

5000|$|False diverticula (also {{known as}} [...] "pseudodiverticula") {{do not involve}} muscular layers or adventitia. False diverticula, in the GI tract for instance, involve only the <b>submucosa</b> and mucosa.|$|E
5000|$|Progression of {{epithelial}} cancer often {{relies on}} deep and regional lymph node invasion [...] The lamina propria {{being one of}} the barriers to the <b>submucosa</b> is an area where epithelial cancer invasion is of significance since lymphatic invasion is an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis, especially in gastric cancer. As soon as the tumors breach the basement membrane and reach the lamina propria, they are exposed to lymphatics which may increase the rate of metastasis and cancer progression. Deeper invasion into the <b>submucosa</b> will increase the exposure to lymphatics.|$|E
