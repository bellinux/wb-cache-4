50|$|To {{alleviate}} this problem, a {{new concept}} must be introduced: the <b>steric</b> <b>factor,</b> ρ.

50|$|Usually {{there is}} no simple way to {{accurately}} estimate <b>steric</b> <b>factors</b> without performing trajectory or scattering calculations.|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{the more}} complex the {{reactant}} molecules, the lower the <b>steric</b> <b>factors.</b> Nevertheless, some reactions exhibit <b>steric</b> <b>factors</b> greater than unity: the harpoon reactions, which involve atoms that exchange electrons, producing ions. The deviation from unity can have different causes: the molecules are not spherical, so different geometries are possible; not all the kinetic energy is delivered into the right spot; {{the presence of a}} solvent (when applied to solutions); and so on.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} nine benzene oligocarboxylic acids is {{characterized}} using anion-exchange chromatography {{to determine the}} steric mass-action affinity parameters: the characteristic charge, the equilibrium ion-exchange constant (and the corresponding Gibbs free energy of ion-exchange), and <b>steric</b> <b>factor.</b> Isocratic elution under various concentrations of sodium chloride in the mobile phase provides the characteristic charge and the ion-exchange constant. The former agrees closely {{with the number of}} carboxylic acid groups in the sample, and the latter seems to be strongly influenced by the relative positions of the carboxylic acid groups on the benzene ring. Analysis of all samples under a linear salt gradient provides retention times that follow the same order as the ion-exchange constants determined isocratically. Using an appropriate model, along with the isocratically determined characteristic charge and ion-exchange constant, the linear gradient retention times are predicted theoretically and agree well with the experimental times. Frontal experiments led to the calculation of the characteristic charge and the <b>steric</b> <b>factor.</b> The former agrees well with the value determined isocratically. For most samples, the <b>steric</b> <b>factor</b> increases slowly with the characteristic charge...|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{volume of}} a set of reference molecules composed of 21 -substituted methyl, ethyl, ethenyl and ethynyl radicals have been obtained from a theoretical study. The computed volume of each substituent is shown to be constant in the various molecules considered for the study and independent of the hybridization of the linked carbon atom. An additivity scheme allows to determine these substituent volumes, which may be used as a <b>steric</b> <b>factor</b> and be introduced in, a structure/reactivity model. The introduction of this <b>steric</b> <b>factor</b> significantly improves the model relating the activation barriers to the well known Field and Resonance parameters for the 1 -substituted dienes in the Diels-Alder reaction. As expected, this factor has only a small effect on 2 -substitued dienes in the Diels-Alder reaction and failed to improve the correlation in the case of endo/exo additions of substituted ethylene.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{scanning}} {{flow cytometer}} (SFC) to study the evolution of monomers, dimers and higher multimers of latex particles at the initial stage of the immunoagglutination is described. The SFC can measure the light-scattering pattern (indicatrix) of an individual particle over an angular range of 10 - 60 deg. A comparison of the experimentally measured and theoretically calculated indicatrices allows one to discriminate different types of latex particles (i. e. monomers, dimers, etc.) and, therefore, to study the evolution of immunoagglutination process. Validity of the approach was verified by simultaneous measurements of light-scattering patterns and fluorescence from individual polymer particles. Immunoagglutination was initiated by mixing bovine serum albumin (BSA) -covered latex particles (of 1. 8 um in diameter) with anti-BSA IgG. The analysis of experimental data {{was performed on the}} basis of a mathematical model of diffusion-limited immunoagglutination aggregation with a <b>steric</b> <b>factor.</b> The <b>steric</b> <b>factor</b> was determined by the size and the number of binding sites on the surface of a latex particle.

40|$|The steric mass-action (SMA) {{model has}} been widely {{reported}} in the literature for ion-exchange and metal-affinity interaction adsorption equilibrium of biomacromolecules. In this paper, the usefulness of SMA model is analyzed for describing micromolecule ion-exchange equilibrium onto cation exchangers, CM Sephadex C- 25 and Streamline SP. Batch adsorption experiments with ephedrine hydrochloride as a model adsorbate are carried out to determine the model parameters, that is, <b>steric</b> <b>factor,</b> characteristic charge and equilibrium constant. The result shows that the SMA model parameters of micromolecule cannot be obtained using the nonlinear least-square fitting method as protein&# 39;s due to the remarkable difference between the molecular mass and dimension of micromolecule and protein. It is considered that the small size of the adsorbates dealt with in this study justifies the neglect of steric hindrances arising from adsorbate bulkiness. Thus, the three-parameter SMA model is reduced to two-parameter one (i. e., <b>steric</b> <b>factor</b> is equal to zero) for describing micromolecule ion-exchange equilibrium. It is found that the equilibrium constant for CM Sephadex C- 25 increases with increasing ionic strength, while the equilibrium constant for Streamline SP shows an opposite trend. This is probably due to the remarkable difference between the physical properties of the two adsorbents. Then, the relationship between the equilibrium constant and ionic strength is described by an expression.
