During {{the summer months}} (late June through early September) service runs {{seven days a week}} from approximately 5:30 am until midnight, and is complimented by local shuttles in downtown Hyannis, Provincetown, and Woods Hole. Service is somewhat reduced in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> (Memorial Day to late June and Labor Day to Columbus Day) and is limited in the off season when four of the eight routes do not run and the remainder only operate 5:30 am to 8 pm, Monday through Friday with most routes having reduced service on Saturday.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{controlling}} factor over a tropical monsoon climate is {{its relationship to}} the monsoon circulation. The monsoon is a seasonal change in wind direction. In Asia, during the summer (or high-sun season) there is an onshore flow of air (air moving from ocean towards land). In the “winter” (or low-sun season) an offshore air flow (air moving from land toward water) is prevalent. The change in direction is due to the difference in the way water and land heat. October is the hottest month no matter whether is it in the southern or northern hemisphere. This is because October is the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> of the year as if it {{is the end of the}} wet season and no winter winds blowing ( [...] Northeast monsoon).|$|E
5000|$|HSC INCAT 046 was {{constructed}} for TT-Line and operated across Australia's Bass Strait on the world's longest distance high speed ferry service (marketed as Devil Cat), between Station Pier, Port Melbourne, Victoria to The Esplanade, George Town, Tasmania. [...] Typical service speed was 80 km/h with fares averaging $100 (AUD) one-way in peak season (Dec-Jan) and $92 one-way in <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> (Jan-Apr). Weather {{conditions in the}} Bass Strait often led to cancellation during storms and heavy seas, with five cancellations in the first ten weeks of operating. [...] The vessel's ride during choppy conditions led to its nickname [...] "Spew Cat". The ship was sold to Bay Ferries after the first season, but during the 2000-2001, 2001-2002 summer peak periods it was charted to again run the George Town - Station Pier route as the Devil Cat.|$|E

50|$|The {{campaign}} {{began in}} October 2010 during the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> for Hersheypark called Hersheypark in the Dark. Several {{people from the}} website Keystone Thrills organized a park meetup. When that occurred, several people claiming to be “scientists” working for a company called the “Ride Institute of Technology” (RIT) showed up and gave the group an envelope filled with puzzle pieces before walking away. Once assembled, the puzzle spelled out See u in the spring…game on. The letterhead displayed a logo from RIT, along with the group’s website. A mysterious letter posted on the website offered a number of clues about the group’s founders, but nothing specific. The letter referenced Comet Halley and announced a new project to begin {{in the spring of}} 2011. In February 2011, the group received a letter from the Ride Institute of Technology written in Dutch. Upon translation, the letter revealed the official ride announcement would come early August and was later interviewed for a news segment regarding the proposed attraction on WGAL 8 out of Lancaster, PA.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decades, {{the role of}} the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> has gained {{increasing}} attention. It is obvious that an expansion of the length of the high season with the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> will {{have a positive effect on}} labor demand and income in a given region. The purpose of this paper is to address the issue of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> in a time series framework. Departing from a discussion of the nature of types of seasonal variation, a test is set up in order to examine the impact of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season.</b> The test examines the impact on the mean share of hotel nights in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> months in two different periods. The method is applied on a monthly data set on hotel nights ranging for 37 years by regions of Denmark and by nationalities of visitors. At the regional level, a much-diversified picture is found. In general, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> of October has increased significance. For rural counties such as Storstroem, Ribe and North Jutland positive effects are observed for other months as well. However, we find for many other rural areas no significant effect. With regard to nationalities of tourists visiting Denmark, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> has a different interpretation. For nationalities close to Denmark we observe a quite similar pattern to the one observed by regions in Denmark. For oversea tourists like from the US or Japan the pattern is different and also much dependent on the price level and exchange rate fluctuations. In order to examine the validity of this approach an a comparison is made with data for Norway. Here a completely different picture is revealed highlighting the significance of Winter tourism relative to Denmark. Theme: Regional developmen...|$|E

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} reviews recent {{research}} examining how winter-based outdoor recreation along the North Shore of Lake Superior {{will be affected}} by climate change. The research revealed the majority of outdoor recreationists who visit the region now won’t change their travel plans as temperatures increase and the snow and ice thins out. However, a substantial number of outdoor recreationists indicated they will visit the region more often in the future. This is largely due to longer <b>shoulder</b> <b>seasons,</b> which support these individuals’ preferred outdoor recreational activities. Knowing how outdoor recreationists’ behavioral responses to climate change vary will help community planners and natural resource managers make decisions that will benefit both their communities and their guests...|$|R
50|$|Khabarovsk Krai has a {{severely}} continental climate with its northern areas being subarctic with stronger maritime summer moderation in the north. In its southerly areas, especially inland, annual swings are extremely strong, with Khabarovsk itself having hot, wet and humid summers which rapidly transforms into severely cold and long winters, where temperatures hardly ever go above freezing. This {{is because of}} the influence of the East Asian monsoon in summer and the bitterly cold Siberian High in winter. The second largest city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur has even more violent temperature swings than Khabarovsk with winter average lows below -30 C but in spite of this avoiding being subarctic because of the significant heat in <b>shoulder</b> <b>seasons.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{transport}} and communication infrastructures {{have had a}} profound impact on the tourism industry. Despite the growing number and importance of online travel agencies and travel metasearch sites tourism literature addressing this issue is very scarce. This paper aims to examine the temporal changes of return airfares on online travel agency (OTA) and travel metasearch websites from Budapest to three short-haul destinations for fixed departure dates in high and <b>shoulder</b> <b>season.</b> The study was based on quantitative research methods using automated internet data collection and statistical analysis (ANOVA tests). During the study, we created a database containing more than 31 thousand ticket prices over a 182 -day period for the three selected destinations. Empirical findings showed that no single website offered lowest airfares consistently and metasearch sites outperformed OTAs in almost any cases by offering lower airfares. Results also indicated the best time to book flights on the selected sites, airfares for <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> were significantly cheaper than for high season and ticket prices tend to be more expensive on Mondays and Sundays...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{passive solar}} house design is {{cumbersome}} because of the effort required to vary the design parameters and interpret performance results. When this process is aided by building simulation software, the designer is not given adequate feedback on the relationships between key design parameters and their effects on passive solar performance. To improve {{the efficiency of the}} design process, the use of solar design days (SDDs) is explored. The days represent a cold sunny, cold cloudy, and warm sunny (<b>shoulder</b> <b>season)</b> day for the climate of interest. Unlike traditional equipment-sizing design days, the SDDs are used as performance indicators. Limiting the period that is studied can put the designer in touch with exactly how the window size, window type, thermal mass, and effective envelope U-value affect performance. While energy performance is a key metric, thermal comfort is also important. The warm sunny day will allow the user to prevent overheating and reduce cooling loads. Since there is a good correlation between cold sunny day performance and annual performance, it is adequate to design a house based on cold sunny day performance alone in the early design stages. This paper will explain how SDDs {{can be used as a}} tool to design {{passive solar house}}s and the associated methodology...|$|E
40|$|Irrigation in {{many regions}} of New Zealand can be managed using a better {{understanding}} of rainfall. However, access to reliable rainfall forecasts and the lack of understanding of current irrigation demands preclude many farmers from making informed irrigation decisions. A pilot study that combined current irrigation demands and short-term (2 - 6 day) rainfall forecast to enable informed irrigation decisions was conducted in a South Island river-based irrigation scheme. Pilot study farmers were provided near-real time access to on-farm measured soil moisture and region-specific weather forecasts. Water use efficiency was described as absence of irrigation-induced drainage below root zone. Initial results indicated that farmers used weather forecast for irrigation scheduling during <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> (Sep-Oct. Mar-Apr) but less so during peak season (Nov-Feb). Because of the potential unreliability of river supplies, farmers tend to practice a “just-in-case” approach where irrigations are scheduled around availability of river supply rather than crop demand and forecast rainfall. To enable the better uptake of weather forecasts for irrigation management, a combination of increasing the reliability of the water supply and accessibility of reliable weather forecasts, are necessary. While a tech transfer approach may enable hydrological and technological changes to irrigation management, our study also highlighted that to achieve a behaviour change, it is important to include collaboration, co-innovation and co-learning of irrigation management...|$|E
40|$|Ecosystem-scale methane (CH 4) flux (F CH 4) over a subarctic fen at Churchill, Manitoba, Canada was {{measured}} {{to understand the}} magnitude of emissions during spring and fall <b>shoulder</b> <b>seasons,</b> and the growing season in relation to physical and biological conditions. F CH 4 {{was measured}} using eddy covariance with a closed-path analyser in four years (2008 – 2011). Cumulative measured annual F CH 4 (<b>shoulder</b> plus growing <b>seasons)</b> ranged from 3. 0 to 9. 6 g CH 4 m − 2 yr − 1 among the four study years, {{with a mean of}} 6. 5 to 7. 1 g CH 4 m − 2 yr − 1 depending upon gap-filling method. Soil temperatures to depths of 50 cm and air temperature were highly correlated with F CH 4, with near-surface soil temperature at 5 cm most correlated across spring, fall, and the <b>shoulder</b> and growing <b>seasons.</b> The response of F CH 4 to soil temperature at the 5 cm depth and air temperature was more than double in spring to that of fall. Emission episodes were generally not observed during spring thaw. Growing season emissions also depended upon soil and air temperatures but the water table also exerted influence, with F CH 4 highest when water was 2 – 13 cm below and lowest when it was at or above the mean peat surface...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a visitor survey undertaken at the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway Coast World Heritage Site, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This site is globally significant to geologists because of its Tertiary lava sequences and their associated palaeosols, but to tourists it is the spectacular columnar jointing and mythology that are its main attractions. The survey was conducted in October 2007 to assess the tourism <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> visitors to the site. It sought to assess visitors’ understanding of the geodiversity features and geoconservation value of the site. Additionally, it sought to determine their opinions on the current on-site interpretation to gauge whether this aids the visitor understanding and experience of the site. It was found that visitors had a fair understanding of the terms ‘geodiversity’ and ‘geoconservation’ and some had understanding of the geological value of the site. The on-site interpretation materials did not fully meet the needs and expectations of the visitors. Improvements to these materials to enhance visitors’ understanding and experience of the site are suggested such as providing more appropriate information and opportunities for human interaction in the form of rangers or guided walks. The survey’s findings and consequent suggested improvements have clear implications for the broader provision of interpretative materials at similar coastal geological geotourism sites across the UK...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the first passive solar wall providing simultaneously super insulation, heat storage and daylighting {{to the inner}} space. The wall’s external layer is composed of a silica aerogels bed for high insulation and solar radiation transmission. The second layer, internal, is composed of glass bricks filled with a eutectic phase change material (PCM) for heat storage and restitution. The whole wall is translucent. The experimentations carried out to characterize thermal and optical properties of the materials used are described. Then results are given for a full scale comparative experimentation on a twin zones building located {{in the south of}} France for the solar wall and a standard opaque high thermal capacity wall. Results show the heat losses through the wall are very low while the heat and light gains are high: The U value of the solar wall is 0. 59 W m− 1 K− 1 and 0. 72 W m− 1 K− 1 respectively when the PCM is in liquid and solid state. With the test building in free floating condition, the temperature difference between the outdoor and indoor air provided by the wall is about 9 °C in winter. The wall can provide up to 500 lux to the inner environment, which is sufficient for conference rooms. The tested wall has proven more effective in winter and <b>shoulder</b> <b>season,</b> particularly for cold sunny climates, but may cause overheating in summer...|$|E
40|$|The White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) {{provides}} {{a unique and}} important recreational opportunity and experience for visitors from around New England and beyond. Monitoring is a necessary step to assess recreation use trends, resource impacts, and visitor experience. This monitoring can inform management to better adapt to use levels, anticipate future trends and mitigate resource concerns. Goals of the monitoring are outlined in the Forest Plan and Monitoring Guide. Visitor use and Wilderness data and information from across the WMNF was brought together to assess current monitoring efforts. Within several important recreation sectors historical data was used to analyze and model trend lines. The areas of analysis included developed campground use, backcountry hut and shelter use, alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and Wilderness group size and number of visitors. Overall the WMNF is {{keeping up with the}} recreation and wilderness monitoring goals set forth in the Monitoring Guide. The Forest as a whole has continued to provide a wide range of quality recreation opportunities from motorized to non-motorized to primitive. Efforts to monitor developed recreation sites including ski areas, and campgrounds as well as backcountry facilities such as huts and selected shelters have been consistent. In addition, the Forest has continued to complete Wilderness visitor use monitoring consistently over the past five years. Areas in the monitoring program that still need implementation include monitoring of rock climbing areas and <b>shoulder</b> <b>season</b> impacts of snowmobiling. Other monitoring areas that need some improvement include outfitter/guide use, use on Forest Trails, Wilderness campsite size and visitor perceived quality and crowding. These areas all have some monitoring efforts but will need to be improved in order to fulfill the objectives outlined in the Monitoring Guide...|$|E
