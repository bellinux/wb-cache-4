40|$|Recovering an over-exploited {{resource}} Cue: Medicinal {{plants are}} a highly valuable resource, both {{for use by}} local communities and {{as a source of}} income. But as with most resources, they are limited. Over-exploitation can quickly lead to the resource being finished, offering no benefits to future generations. The Prunus africana tree {{is one of the most}} famous medicinal plants in Africa. Known as piju in Cameroon, the bark of the tree is traditionally used to treat a wide range of illnesses, including malaria, stomach ache and urinary problems. In the 1970 s a pharmaceutical company also began harvesting the bark from the forests of Cameroon, to make drugs used to treat prostate cancer. Demand for the tree bark was very high, but the rate of harvesting was not sustainable. By the 1990 s, nearly all the Prunus trees in one area of South West Cameroon, the Lebialem highlands, were gone. Now, the Environmental and Rural Development Foundation, a Cameroonian NGO, is working to restore the trees, and make sure they are managed in a sustainable way. Louis Nkembi, President of the Foundation explained to Martha Chindong what they are doing. IN:		?We are trying to replant? OUT:		? the opportunity to talk to you. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 23 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Louis Nkembi of the Environmental and Rural Development Foundation. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Nkembi	We are trying to replant. We are also trying to push ahead for the creation of community forests which could now become sustainably managed by the local people. The government has put in place this legislation on community forest which provides the opportunity for community groups to organise themselves and manage these forests for their own benefits and also to replant those areas where they have previously existed but today they are no more, to several problems including over-harvesting, landslides etc. Chindong	So you are not trying to prevent the people from harvesting the bark of the tree again? Nkembi	No in terms of sustainable management we are not preventing, we are not stopping. We rather want to see there is that the use is done wisely so that future generations could continue to use the same species, the same quantity of products for the wellbeing of these communities. We are not stopping communities from using these products but rather assisting them in a way such that they would continue to use them forever. Chindong	<b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing it, in very concrete terms? Nkembi	We organise communities into functional community groups and we have been registered with the relevant government departments. We have now identified, mapped out the forest areas and all the farmlands where they have to be planted. Some farmers will like to have these planted in their farms, personal farms. So we have also identified who these farmers are and we have created what we call the Lebialem Prunus Farmers Association and we are now identifying the different kind of trainings which we want to offer to them. Chindong	Is there a better way to harvest the bark of a tree that you are trying to introduce to the people? Nkembi	We have been able to put into place a better system where not all of the bark is peeled off. Bark is peeled off in certain quantities over a certain period of time and by the time we come back to the same tree to reharvest it has taken two, three, four years, given the opportunity to the tree to regenerate itself. But if the whole bark is peeled off at once that would definitely lead to the death of a tree. Chindong	How are the farmers taking it considering that it is there source of income? Are they patient enough to harvest just a portion and then wait for some years first before they come back to the same tree? Nkembi	Well every new thing is painful to adopt. Gradually they are adopting it and we are also not just taking Prunus as the sole enterprise but integrating it into the farming system, so that while they are not harvesting Prunus they could be harvesting other products within their farms. In that way they have a kind of a continuous income stream coming from the different farming enterprises. Chindong	Now can you paint us a picture of the relationship between forest conservation, medicinal plants and income generation? Nkembi	These areas are ecologically fragile habitants which need to be protected and by encouraging local population to plant these trees, they are indirectly promoting and protecting the ecological fragile landscapes. They are indirectly conserving the birds, because the trees give the birds the suitable habitats, and promoting conservation in general. Chindong	And where is the place of the income generation? Nkembi	Planting trees of economic importance means that they could harvest these trees for sale, for household use. And we know that Prunus has a very high demand both in national and in the international markets. So if this Prunus africana is promoted on intensive and large scale this is going to generate a lot of money for local communities once they are organised. Chindong	<b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> getting funding for the project you are carrying out? Nkembi	We, over the last year we have had an agreement or a convention with one of our US partners ?Trees for the future?. They currently are assisting us to develop a country programme on tree planting and Prunus africana, neem, jatropha and the moringa are some of the key species which we are promoting alongside some of the fast growing multipurpose agroforestry species. So they are our principal partner ?Trees for the future? and we hope to identify other partners who assist us in funding and so forth. Chindong	Thank you for making yourself available to us. Nkembi	Thank you very much Martha Chindong for giving me the opportunity to talk to you. End of track.

In southern Sudan, many people have now returned to their villages from refugee camps, where they have survived on food aid. But now, back home, many are returning to a very basic subsistence farming which produces no extra income and little security in the face of crop failure. One group which is trying to help in these challenging situations is the Savannah Farmers? Cooperative. The organisation offers training in improved farming methods and has also started an unusual microfinance programme for its farmer members. Managing Director, Zamba Duku, explained more to Pius Sawa. IN:	?The organisation, Savannah Farmers? Cooperative ? OUT:	? think women are adequately covered. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 15 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Zamba Duku, Managing Director of the Savannah Farmers? Cooperative in southern Sudan. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Duku	The organisation, Savannah Farmers? Cooperative began in 2001. It started as a kind of charitable organisation to support farmers, but to support farmers not by giving relief or anything free, but by making available tractors to farmers, so that these farmers can use them at a very subsidised cost. It is only in the second season of last year that we began to look at giving the farmers services, and then they pay later, and that is where the microfinance component came in. Sawa	Maybe you can describe this microfinance component; how does it help farmers? Duku	It helps farmers a lot in that a farmer gets his land ploughed very quickly using the tractor. The farmer is given seeds which he or she may not have and the farmer is also given further assistance in weeding, if he or she cannot manage. But we don?t give the money to the farmer, we ask the farmer to get somebody to clean the land, and then we come and pay. Sawa	And how many farmers are you dealing with? Duku	On a pilot basis we have now 320 farmers. Sawa	This sounds like a unique programme. Duku	It?s unique {{in the sense that we}} do not give direct cash to the clients, we give them services which are valued, and then they will pay for the services at the end of harvest, after they have sold their crop. In most microfinance programmes, the beneficiary or the client is given actual cash, and also the client is expected to belong to a small group so that that group can act as a kind of collateral. But in our case here we take each farmer on his or her own merit. Sawa	And what types of crops are they growing? Duku	We signed an agreement with a certain Indian company to grow some Indian crop, and this is green gram, and that is what we are supporting them to grow. Sawa	Apart from green gram how do they produce food for survival? Duku	Actually we require that each farmer who is our beneficiary has two acres set aside for this crop, and then that farmer can grow any other number of acres for his other crops. Food production is not interrupted. Sawa	And I?m trying to look at how a farmer can be able to recover this loan, in what period and how do you recover it? Duku	Actually we expect to recover the money spent in one season at the end of that season. Sawa	Are you partnering with any microfinance institution? Duku	Not as such but we are actually being treated as a kind of unique microfinance institution by the World Bank, which is interested in our model and has given us some money. Sawa	How much money have you got so far? Duku	They have given us US$ 100, 000, with the promise that if we manage this one successfully, they will give us even up to $ 400, 000 in the coming year. Sawa	How does the World Bank have the guarantee that they will not lose their money? Duku	There is no guarantee as such. We only hope that the weather will be good and that the crop will not fail. This is the major thing. But they insist that if there are any losses then we will share the cost, the losses, with them. Sawa	What about the farmers, do they have any risks of them incurring when they don?t recover the loans? Duku	Absolutely not. If the farmers have failed because of climatic conditions, there is no way that we can penalise them. Sawa	How are you trying to successfully engage them into farming through this microfinance institution? Duku	What we are trying to do is entice them with the prospect of earning money for themselves, because this is a major thing for them, a major concern is how do you get money. Sawa	And we see that women have been having a problem of acquiring microfinance credits or loans. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> managing to bring women on board, because most of them don?t own land? Duku	Actually ours is not for women or for men as such, because we are targeting family units, and every family unit will include women and men, so our support goes to families rather than to individuals as such, and in that way I think women are adequately covered.

40|$|Production {{units for}} primary schools CUE: In many {{countries}} agriculture is a common, sometimes even compulsory {{subject in the}} school curriculum, particularly at secondary level.

Ndambo Ndambo is a project co-ordinator for the ZNFU, the Zambia National Farmers? Union. Like many in Zambia, he is very concerned about the small number of school leavers who are venturing into agriculture. Chris Kakunta spoke to him about what he felt was necessary to change the perception of farming in a country where only 5 % of young people are making a living from agriculture. IN:		?One of the membership drives ? OUT:		? the young people take over. ? DUR?N	 2 ? 42 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ndambo Ndambo of the Zambia National Farmers Union talking to Chris Kakunta about the need to get young people involved in agriculture. Transcript Ndambo	One of the membership drives of the Young Farmers in Zambia has been one where we are targeting the young farmers in the rural areas, those who have gone out of school. Kakunta	There is always this conception that farming is for those who have failed in schools and <b>so</b> on. <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> trying to change the perception of young farmers so that they can venture into agriculture as a source of livelihood? Ndambo	The other part which has been very effective is targeting primary schools and secondary schools, where we have helped to set up production units in the primary schools among the school children, boys and girls. Kakunta	So do you think by perhaps emphasising on agriculture in schools, and putting agriculture as part of the curriculum in schools, could encourage the youth into venturing into agriculture? Ndambo	To some extent, but sometimes if you put agriculture in the curriculum, as the way forward, students or pupils tend to take it as just a course, or part of the syllabus, to go to advance a different career. But I think the practical aspect of involving these pupils into production units, would be a better way of enhancing, showing them that agriculture can be a source of employment, and also livelihood when they are out of school. Kakunta	Your organisation has been mobilising these youths. I believe there are some problems that <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> facing in trying to stimulate them into agriculture. What are some of these problems? Ndambo	The problems of youth are quite vast, and when we are looking at Zambia, where we have got 62 % of the population being youth, and out of that only 5 % are living on agriculture. So to make this mass movement turn around to involve the youth and see agriculture as a focus, you need a lot of players in the whole thing. And at ZNFU we have tried our best, but despite our capacity in terms of the staff available to drive this, the efforts we are making at ZNFU are just like a teaspoon of salt in the sea because the capacity of ZNFU is not enough. So we need the integration of all sectors to drive with one force and not have different messages to the young farmers. Kakunta	So where does the future of agriculture lie, considering the government is not putting much emphasis on the youth? Ndambo	I think that?s a very serious problem, as the government itself has turned a blind eye on the young people in agriculture. Only old people are doing agriculture, and as soon as they die or they become too old, the young people are not motivated to do agriculture, then {{we are going to have}} a serious crisis. So at this point in time, I think it is high time we propagated the young people to be in agriculture, so that the chain of production, the responsibility in agriculture continues among the old and then the young people take over. End of tape. Ndambo Ndambo, a project co-ordinator for the Zambian National Farmers Union, is concerned about the small number of school leavers who enter agriculture. He believes that setting up small production units in primary schools may be a better way of encouraging young people into agriculture than having it as a subject in the school curriculum...|$|R
