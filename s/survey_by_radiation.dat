40|$|Changes in the {{subsurface}} can be imaged {{by subtracting}} seismic reflection data at two different states, one {{serving as the}} initial survey or base, and the second as the monitor survey. Conventionally, the reflection data are acquired by placing active seismic sources at the acquisition surface. Alternatively, these data can be acquired from passive sources in the subsurface, using seismic interferometry. Unfortunately, the reflection responses as retrieved by seismic interferometry inherit an imprint of the passive source distribution. Therefore, monitoring with seismic interferometry requires high passive source repeatability, which is often not achievable in practice. We propose an alternative, by using active seismic data for the base survey and a single passive source for the monitor <b>survey.</b> <b>By</b> constraining the <b>radiation</b> pattern of the (active) base survey according to {{the characteristics of the}} (passive) monitor survey, we succeed to extract time-lapse response in the image domain. The proposed method is illustrated with numerically modeled data. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{current state}} {{and need for}} {{radiation}} protection training in Finland have been <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> the <b>Radiation</b> and Nuclear Safety Authority â€“ STUK. The survey sought {{to determine whether the}} current requirements for radiation protection training had been met, and to promote radiation protection training. Details of the scope and quality of present radiation protection training were requested from all educational institutes and organizations providing radiation protection training. The survey covered both basic and further training, special training of radiation safety officers, and supplementary training. The questionnaire was sent to 77 educational organization units, 66 per cent of which responded. Radiation workers and radiation safety officers were asked about radiation protection knowledge and needs for additional training. The questionnaire was sent to 880 radiation users and 170 radiation safety officers, 70 per cent of whom responded. The survey covered all professional groups and fields of the use of ionizing radiation except nuclear energy. The amount of radiation protection training in basic and further (specialization) training in the same vocational or academic degree varied remarkably by educational organization. The average amounts of radiation protection included in most professional degrees met the requirements. 32 per cent of workers considered their radiation protection training inadequate for their duties, and 48 per cent had completed no supplementary training in radiation protection over the last five years. Nurses working in public sector hospitals and physicians working in health centres had th...|$|R
