25|$|Babies {{born with}} severe CP often have an {{irregular}} posture; their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff. Birth defects, such as <b>spinal</b> <b>curvature,</b> a small jawbone, {{or a small}} head sometimes occur along with CP. Symptoms may appear or change as a child gets older. Some babies born with CP do not show obvious signs right away. Classically, CP becomes evident when the baby reaches the developmental stage at 6 to 9 months and is starting to mobilise, where preferential use of limbs, asymmetry, or gross motor developmental delay is seen.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{scoliosis}} {{was discovered}} by Hippocrates, physicians and orthopedic surgeons have sought {{to find a cure}} for the condition. In the mid-twentieth century, modern medicine and treatment made it possible to decrease the progression of scoliosis within patients and alleviate the pain they experienced. This {{was the result of the}} progression of scoliosis screenings and treatment. New ways were developed to treat scoliosis because the condition was increasingly understood among medical professionals and orthopedic surgeons. These treatments such as bracing and rod insertion into the spine were made possible at the turn of the twentieth century. During this time, many schools subjected their students to physical examinations and posture tests. It was believed that students suffered from negative effects such as poor posture due to hunching over desks for hours in the classroom. Although these screenings were not intended to detect <b>spinal</b> <b>curvature,</b> physicians diagnosed many students with scoliosis. Scoliosis was considered a disease-based condition during the mid-twentieth century caused by tuberculosis or poliomyelitis. These diseases responsible for causing spinal deformities were successfully managed throughout the 1960s due to the distribution of vaccines and antibiotics. Despite the successful management of diseases causing spinal deformity, many patients suffered from scoliosis with no known cause. The unknown cause was eventually determined to be idiopathic scoliosis. Alfred Shands Jr., an orthopedic surgeon, discovered that two percent of patients had non-disease related scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis, also known as the [...] "cancer of orthopedic surgery", was determined to be dangerous because there was no current treatment. The condition needed to be detected in patients promptly so treatment could be developed in time to halt its progression. As a result, schools made it mandatory for students to have screenings for scoliosis. Early on, set symptoms could be recognized among the students being tested from ages five to eighteen, but subsequent studies never confirmed them for this age-range. To begin the screenings, children would have their shoulder height, leg length and <b>spinal</b> <b>curvature</b> measurements taken while partially clothed. This was followed with the forward-bend test and bodily comparisons to wall charts that were printed reproductions of the ideal human posture. Unfortunately, these screenings were not always accurate and many students were misdiagnosed because poor posture could often be mistaken for scoliosis. One of the first treatments designed was the Milwaukee brace, a rigid contraption of metal rods attached to a plastic or leather girdle, designed to straighten the spine. As a result of the constant pressure the brace inflicted on a patients' spine, it was particularly painful and inconvenient to wear due to physical limits it imposed. Wearing the brace was known to cause jaw pain, skin irritation, muscle pain and low self-esteem among patients. The 'Harrington rod' technique was the second major treatment for scoliosis to emerge and became the first significant surgical procedure to manipulate spinal positioning. This treatment was initially developed to treat paralytic scoliosis that resulted from the polio epidemic of the 1950s. The Milwaukee brace was the only nonoperative and noninvasive alternative to surgery at the time to provide postoperative correction to polio patients. A curve exceeding sixty degrees required the Harrington rod technique, otherwise the Milwaukee brace was recommended. However, Canadian physician, Elizabeth Wyne, observed that fifty percent of patients wearing the Milwaukee brace still required surgery later in life. Surgery may straighten the spine however it does not necessarily eradicate a patient of all the pain they suffer from due to scoliosis. Individuals who undergo surgery are left with scars and often have a lack of feeling in their backs to the invasive nature of this treatment. Despite the advancements of scoliosis treatments, yet to be determined is a cure that is reliable, risk-free and that results in few or no consequences for patients.|$|E

40|$|Spinopelvic {{alignment}} {{refers to}} the interaction between pelvic orientation, <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures,</b> and the line of gravity. In a healthy modern human, this alignment is characterized by reciprocal curves/orientation of the sacrum, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and cervical lordosis. In an economic sagittal posture, these curvatures keep the line of gravity close {{to the center of}} the acetabulum. The purpose of this study is to explore the spinopelvic alignment in extinct hominins. We examined spinopelvic alignment of a single representative from each of the following hominin groups: Australopithecus, Homo erectus (H. erectus), H. neanderthalensis, and early H. sapiens. Pelvic incidence, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and cervical lordosis for each representative was estimated and compared with that of modern humans. Three basic spinopelvic alignments were found: (1) the sinusoidal alignment with moderate to high <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> and pelvic incidence found in H. erectus and H. sapiens; (2) the straight alignment with small <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> and small pelvic incidence found in Neandertal lineage hominins; (3) the compound alignment found in Australopithecus, with moderate pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis, and nearly straight cervical spine. Our results indicate that balanced upright posture can be achieved in different alignments. Each hominin group solved the requirements of erect posture in a slightly different way. Moreover, we propose the term “cranio-spino-pelvic balance” to substitute “spino-pelvic balance. ” From an evolutionary perspective, not only changes in the pelvis have conditioned the evolution of the <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> but also changes in the equilibrium of the head likely also affected this balance.

40|$|Sports with a {{predominance}} of forward-bending and extension postures {{have been associated}} with alterations in the sagittal <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> and greater risk of spinal injury. Because, the tennis players adopt these postures, the aims of this study were: 1) to describe <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> and pelvic tilt in male and female highly trained adolescent tennis players during relaxed standing posture and with thoracic spine corrected (in prone lying on the floor); and 2) to determine the frequency of thoracic hyperkyphosis and lumbar hypo/hyper lordosis in these postures. Forty adolescent tennis players (24 male and 16 female) aged 13 - 18 years, participated voluntarily in this study. The Spinal Mouse system was used to measure sagittal <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> and pelvic tilt. The mean values in the relaxed standing posture were 43. 83 ° ± 7. 87 ° (thoracic kyphosis), - 27. 58 ° ± 7. 01 ° (lumbar lordosis), and 13. 38 ° ± 5. 57 ° (pelvic tilt) for male tennis players, respectively; and 36. 13 ° ± 6. 69 ° (thoracic kyphosis), - 32. 69 ° ± 5. 06 ° (lumbar lordosis), 20. 94 ° ± 5. 36 ° (pelvic tilt) for female tennis players (p < 0. 05 between genders in all spinal parameters). The male and female tennis players showed a frequency of 62. 5 % and 93. 8 % (p = 0. 032) for neutral thoracic kyphosis, and 83. 3 % and 93. 8 % (p = 0. 062) in neutral lumbar lordosis, respectively.

30|$|Overall, the {{selected}} endpoints offered a comprehensive toxicological characterization of complex environmental mixtures. In particular, developmental malformations and delay in hatching were valid endpoints for {{the characterization of}} sediment pollution. In fact, abnormal <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> (i.e., kyphosis) and hatching problems were observed only in embryos exposed to sediments from Kramfors. However, {{it is important to}} underline that several chemicals that were detected in the three sites of GoB (i.e., PAHs, BDEs, heavy metals) were reported to cause <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures,</b> general developmental toxicity, degeneration of myocytes, neural cell death and delayed hatching [45 – 55]. Thus, it may be hypothesized that the higher concentrations of PAHs in Kramfors (24 -fold higher compared to those measured in Sundsvall and Örnsköldsvik) may actually be responsible of the observed effect. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} teratogenic effects in early fish life stages are mainly caused by high PAHs concentrations [26, 56].|$|R

A unified set of methods for treatment of abnormal <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> in its conservative, orthopedic or surgical modalities is still nonexistent at the world scale. Many authors admit that asymmetrical load, weakness and easy fatigue of the neuromuscular system are the reason for the formation of flawed posture, which can serve as an unlocking mechanism for structural scoliosis [5, 6]. Others consider heredity to be an etiological factor [8, 9]. According to them, the predisposition to the disease is congenital, but the deformations appear as a result of excessive load. Good prevention of abnormal <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> requires a whole set of measures, applied in both home and school environments [3]. One of the main tasks of adapted physical activity and sports (APAS) is achieving a more intense regime of children and adolescents with special needs in order to improve their functional and physical status.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between the age of reaching motor milestones, especially anti-gravity activities, and the age of development of pathological <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> in children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We hypothesized that earlier achievement of anti-gravity motor milestones predicts a later development of pathological <b>spinal</b> <b>curvatures.</b> Ninety-six children participated in this retrospective study. The severity of the disease was classified according to Sillence into types I-IV. Spinal radiography was performed annually and spinal deformities were measured according to the Cobb angle. Scoliosis was defined as a Cobb angle exceeding 9 degrees. Pathological thoracic kyphosis was defined as a Cobb angle exceeding 40 degrees. The parents were asked to report the age at which the child achieved motor milestones, and data were checked against health care records. Thirty-seven of 96 children (39 %) developed a scoliosis of more than 9 degrees. Nine of 96 children (9 %) developed a pathological kyphosis. The age of developing scoliosis was significantly lower than the age of development of the pathological kyphosis (P= 0. 01). Bone mineral density was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in 53 children, 28 of whom developed scoliosis, and 25 of whom did not. The mean DEXA Z-score of the 28 children with scoliosis was significantly lower than that of the 25 children without (- 5. 2, SD 1. 3 vs - 3. 2, SD 1. 9; P-value < 0. 001). Children with OI type IV, but particularly OI type III, reached motor milestones much later than children with OI type I. The motor milestone "supported sitting" showed a significant inverse association with time of the first presence of scoliosis with a Cobb angle greater than 9 degrees (linear regression coefficient: - 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval: - 2. 6 to - 0. 03). The age of achieving the motor milestones "lifting the head to 45 degrees in prone position", "rolling", and "supported-" and "unsupported standing" were not significantly associated with age of the first presence of scoliosis with a Cobb angle greater than 9 degrees. However, the directions of associations suggest that here, too, there is a tendency for later development of scoliosis in those who reach milestones at earlier ages. Multivariable analyses showed that the motor milestone "sitting with support" was significantly associated with age of first achieving scoliosis, independent of gender and type of OI (linear regression coefficient: - 0. 9, 95 % confidence interval: - 1. 3 to - 0. 5).
