More recent studies have worked on Souther's contributions with more detailed studies which are funded by colleges and universities. Since colleges and universities started studying the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, it has been an extremely important volcano for subglacial volcanism because its ice-contact lavas record evidence of ice existence and thickness in an area for which there is very little data on ice conditions before the Illinoian Stage of glaciation, which preceded the last glacial, or [...] "Wisconsin", period. Several areas of possible basaltic and trachytic ice-contact products were studied in detail on the western flank of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, in order to approve their ice-contact nature, and to eventually better constrain former ice existence and thickness. Its lava plateau has also been an important cultural resource. In 2006, Jeff Hungerford, a student of the University of Pittsburgh in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on fieldwork on the region surrounding Edziza's Tennena Cone, located immediately west of Ice Peak which formed subglacially during the early Holocene period when this area had remnants of glacial ice from the last ice age.

In this case, even though the glacier was thin, a large jökulhlaup was observed as the glacier was largely made up of impermeable (unfractured) ice with a sudden supraglacial flood once the cavity has reached capacity. The resulting flood severely damaged buildings on the island, with complete destruction of a British scientific station.|$|E

They are named ice-melt subsidence structures, and they are analogous to kettle holes that are commonly found in proglacial sandurs and some lahars sourced in ice-clad volcanoes.

The ice-melt subsidence structures at Varða are a proxy for buried ice. They are the only known evidence for a <b>subglacial</b> <b>eruption</b> and associated jökulhlaup that created the ice blocks.

40|$|National audienceThe Skeiðarársandur {{is a large}} {{glaciofluvial}} plain in {{the south}} of the Vatnajökull ice cap. In November 1996, a jökulhlaup triggered by a <b>subglacial</b> <b>eruption</b> and produced a catastrophic flood which incised the Skeiðarársandur. Those incised channels trap currently part of the wind transport (essentially the transport by saltation). Measures of the dominant orientations of the vegetation and petrographical analysis of the aeolian deposits provide us the opportunity to geographically delimit the blownout areas. Thus, with the ratio of (1) the loess deposit volume accumulated in the jökulhlaup channels since 1996 and (2) the blownout land surfaces, a minimum deflation rate for the east part of the Skeiðarársandur is calculated. According to our results, the Skeiðarársandur loses 0. 05 to 0. 1 mm in thickness due to aeolian transport by saltation each year...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{analytical}} {{models of}} subglacial eruptions are presented, which simulate evolving subglacial cavities and volcanic edifices during rhyolitic eruptions beneath temperate glaciers. They shove that the relative sizes of cavity and edifice may strongly influence the eruption mechanisms. Intrusive eruptions will occur if the edifice fills the cavity, with rising magma quenched within the edifice and slow melting of ice. Explosive magma-water interaction may occur if a water- or steam-filled gap develops above the edifice. Meltwater {{is assumed to}} drain away continuously, but any gap above the edifice will be filled by meltwater or steam. Ductile roof closure will occur if the glacier weight exceeds the cavity pressure and is modelled here using Nye's law. The {{results show that the}} effusion rate is an important control on the eruption style, with explosive eruptions favoured by large effusion rates. The models are used to explain contrasting eruption mechanisms during various Quaternary subglacial rhyolite eruptions at Torfajokull, Iceland. Although the models are simplistic, they are first attempts to unravel the complex feedbacks between <b>subglacial</b> <b>eruption</b> mechanisms and glacier response that can lead to a variety of eruptive scenarios and associated hazards...|$|E
50|$|Three {{forms of}} glaciovolcanism are known. <b>Subglacial</b> <b>eruptions</b> occur when a volcano erupts under ice.

40|$|Eruptions beneath ice {{sheets and}} glaciers can {{generate}} hazardous ash plumes and powerful meltwater floods, {{as demonstrated by}} the recent Icelandic eruptions at Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 and at Grímsvötn in 2011. A key scientific objective for volcanologists is to better understand the factors controlling <b>subglacial</b> <b>eruptions,</b> but the eruptions are mostly hidden beneath ice that is often hundreds of metres thick, thereby preventing direct observation. New approaches are therefore needed to reconstruct the factors driving explosive activity and the response of the overlying ice. The dissolved volatile content, preserved in glassy volcanic rock, offers a useful means of reconstructing palaeo-ice thicknesses. However, for subglacial rhyolite at least, there seems to be little or no correlation between loading pressure and eruptive style. Instead, there is a strong correlation between the pre-eruptive volatile content, degassing path and eruptive behaviour. It seems that the style of many <b>subglacial</b> <b>eruptions</b> is controlled by the same mechanisms as subaerial eruptions, with explosivity strongly influenced by degassing and magmatic fragmentation...|$|R
