40|$|Most {{approaches}} {{to the problem of}} source separation use the assumption of statistical independence. To capture statistical independence higher order statistics are required. In this chapter we will demonstrate how higher order criteria, such as maximum kurtosis, arise naturally from the property of non-stationarity. We will also show that source sepa-ration of non-stationary signals can be based entirely on second order statistics of the signals. Natural signals, be it images or time sequences, are for the most part non-stationary. For natural signals therefore we argue that non-stationarity is the fundamental property, from which speci c second or higher order separation criteria can be derived. We contrast the linear bases obtained using second order non-stationarity and ICA for the cases of natural images and <b>speech</b> <b>powers.</b> Based on these results we argue that <b>speech</b> <b>powers</b> can in fact be understood as a linear superposition of non-stationary spectro-temporal independen...|$|R

In this competition, the loved ones watched rocks fall into a crater. Once they believed 1000 rocks fell into the crater, they hit their buzzer. The loved one who hits their buzzer the closest to 1000 rocks will win Head of Household for their loved one. Cassandra's father won the competition, and Cassandra became the new Head of Household. On Day 57, the HouseGuests were given the task to marry Nikki and Joel in the Have-Not room. If they pass their task, {{there will be no}} more Have-Nots for the season. They passed their task and Have-Nots were disbanded. On Day 57, Cassandra nominated Nick & Phil and Nikki for eviction, with Nick & Phil as the target. On Day 58, everyone except for Tim calculated in The Price of POV Power of Veto competition, hosted by Season 3 winner, Sarah Hanlon. in this competition, HouseGuests were secluded in a booth and were given an equivalent to 100 poker chips- black chip representing one and red chips representing five. Sarah will make them a series of nine offers. HouseGuests must then place a bet with their chips of how willing they are to accept it in exchange for points. HouseGuests must keep the offers they buy, regardless whether they win or lose the competition. The HouseGuest with the most points will win the Power of Veto. Cassandra agreed to clean up poker chips and took a strategy session with Sarah. Jared agreed to take an eel bath for the duration of the competition. Nick & Phil agreed to wear a skunk suit, sit out of the next POV, and receive a haircut from Sarah. Joel agreed to eat slop for the rest of the season, not shower for a week, and give up all but a bag of his personal belongings. Nick & Phil won the Power of Veto. On Day 60, Nick & Phil took themselves off the block, and Cassandra named Jared as the replacement nominee. On Day 63, Jared was evicted by a 3-1 vote, with Nick & Phil voting to evict Nikki. Immediately after Jared's eviction, the HouseGuests were informed of the double eviction. They then went to the backyard for the Bowled Over Head of Household competition. In this competition, each HouseGuest had their own lane with five bowling pins at the end. The first HouseGuest to knock down all five of their pins will be the new Head of Household. Nick & Phil were the winners. Nick & Phil then nominated Nikki and Tim for eviction.

40|$|Abstract—Single-channel {{enhancement}} algorithms {{are widely}} used to overcome the degradation of noisy speech signals. Speech enhancement gain functions are typically computed from two quantities, namely, {{an estimate of the}} noise power spectrum and of the noisy <b>speech</b> <b>power</b> spectrum. The variance of these power spectral estimates degrades the quality of the enhanced signal and smoothing techniques are, therefore, often used to decrease the variance. In this paper, we present a method to determine the noisy <b>speech</b> <b>power</b> spectrum based on an adaptive time segmentation. More specifically, the proposed algorithm determines for each noisy frame which of the surrounding frames should contribute to the corresponding noisy power spectral estimate. Further, we demonstrate the potential of our adaptive segmentation in both maximum likelihood and decision direction-based speech enhancement methods by making a better estimate of the a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Objective and subjective experi-ments show that an adaptive time segmentation leads to significant performance improvements in comparison to the conventionally used fixed segmentations, particularly in transitional regions, where we observe local SNR improvements in the order of 5 dB.

30|$|This paper {{seeks to}} improve CSP {{analysis}} in noisy environments {{with a special}} weighting algorithm. We assume the target sound source is a human speaker and the noise is broadband noise such as a fan, wind, or road noise in an automobile. Denda et al. proposed weighted CSP analysis using average speech spectrums as weights [7]. The assumption is that a subband with more <b>speech</b> <b>power</b> conveys more reliable information for localization. However, it {{did not use the}} harmonic structures of human speech. Because the harmonic bins must contain more <b>speech</b> <b>power</b> than the other bins, they should give us more reliable information in noisy environments. The use of harmonic structures for localization has been investigated in prior art [8, 9], but not for CSP analysis. This work estimated the pitches (F 0) of the target sound and extracted localization cues from the harmonic structures based on those pitches. However, the pitch estimation and the associated voiced-unvoiced classification may be insufficiently accurate in noisy environments. Also, {{it should be noted that}} not all harmonic bins have distinct harmonic structures. Some bins may not be in the speech formants and be dominated by noise. Therefore, we want a special weighting algorithm that puts larger weights on the bins where the harmonic structures are distinct, without requiring explicit pitch detection and voiced-unvoiced classification.|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} {{speech enhancement}} system {{consists of two}} major components, the estimation of noise power spectrum, and the estimation of speech. In single channel speech enhancement systems, most algorithms require an estimation of average noise spectrum since a secondary channel is not available. This requires a reliable speech/silence detector. Thus the speech/silence detection can be a determining factor {{for the performance of}} the whole speech enhancement system. The speech/silence detection finds out the frames of the noisy speech that contain only noise. If the speech/silence detection is not accurate then speech echoes and residual noise tend to be present in the enhanced speech. The performance of noise estimation algorithm is usually a tradeoff between speech distortion and noise reduction. In existing methods, noise is estimated only during speech pauses and these pauses are identified using Voice Activity Detector (VAD). This paper describes novel noise estimation method to estimate noise in non-stationary environments. This approach uses an algorithm that classifies noisy speech signal into pure speech, quasi speech and non-speech frames based on adaptive thresholds without using of VAD. Speech presence is determined by computing the ratio of the noisy <b>speech</b> <b>power</b> spectrum to its local minimum, which is computed by averaging past values of the noisy <b>speech</b> <b>power</b> spectra with a look-ahead factor.
