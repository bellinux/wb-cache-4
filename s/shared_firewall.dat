40|$|Abstract We {{present an}} {{adaptive}} controlled scheduler for heterogeneous applications running on general purpose comput-ers. Our scheduler can effectively support diverse application requirements. It employs uniform rate-based sharing. Application heterogeneity is satisfied by partitioning CPU capacity into service classes, {{each with a}} different criterionfor admission control. As a result, {{we are able to}} provide at once guaranteed performance, flexible allocation of rates with excellent scalability and intermediate service classes offering tradeoffs between reserved rate utilization and thestrength of guarantees. Our scheduler has been implemented in Solaris 2. 5. 1. It runs existing applications without modifications. We present experimental results showing the scalability, efficiency, guaranteed performance, and over-load performance aspects of our scheduler. We demonstrate the importance of priority inheritance implemented in our scheduler for stable system performance. keywords: multimedia operating system, CPU scheduling, admission control, rate-based <b>sharing,</b> <b>firewall</b> protection,priority inversion 1 Introduction Emerging continuous media (CM) applications have well defined quality of service (QoS) constraints. These applica-tions have stringent resource requirements and can benefit from non-interference. It is not possible to run them in a closed or embedded system environment [11]. Instead, many will continue to run on general purpose machines, whereapplications of diverse characteristics run concurrently. QoS requirements of applications in an open and general purpose computing environment requires further research. Appropriate admission control and scheduling policies must be investigated to avoid long term resource overload, and to provide forms of progress guarantees. The resources should be carefully scheduled. CPU time is one bottleneckresource, if we consider the processor requirements of applications like software media codes...|$|R
50|$|Packet {{filtering}} {{alone is}} not regarded as providing enough protection. In order to effectively block peer-to-peer-related network traffic, {{what is needed is}} a firewall that does application filtering, which can be regarded as an extension to stateful packet inspection. Stateful packet inspection can determine what type of protocol is being sent over each port, but application-level filters look at what a protocol is being used for. For example, an application-level filter might {{be able to tell the}} difference between HTTP traffic used to access a Web page and HTTP traffic used for file <b>sharing,</b> whereas a <b>firewall</b> that is only performing packet filtering would treat all HTTP traffic equally.|$|R
50|$|Windows XP RTM {{introduced}} the Internet Connection Firewall. It was later upgraded to Windows Firewall in Windows XP Service Pack 2 with support for filtering IPv6 traffic as well. By default, Windows Firewall performs stateful packet filtering of inbound solicited or unsolicited traffic on {{all types of}} network interfaces (LAN/WLAN, PPPoE, VPN, or dial-up connections). Like Internet Connection <b>Sharing,</b> the <b>firewall</b> has a location-aware policy, meaning it can be disabled in a corporate domain but enabled for a private home network. It has an option to disallow all exceptions which may be useful when connecting to a public network. The firewall {{can also be used}} as the edge firewall for ICS clients. When the firewall blocks a program, it displays a notification. Excepted traffic can be specified by TCP/UDP port, application filename and by scope (part of the network from which the excepted traffic originates). It supports port mapping and ICMP. Security log capabilities are included, which can record IP addresses and other data relating to connections originating from the home or office network or the Internet. It can record both dropped packets and successful connections. This can be used, for instance, to track every time a computer on the network connects to a website. Windows Firewall also supports configuration through Group Policy. Applications can use the Windows Firewall APIs to automatically add exceptions.|$|R
40|$|DB servers for {{managing}} personal information have security systems for enhancing security, but security systems {{do not fully}} operate in user’s smart home PC, and it is thus necessary to analyze vulnerabilities for protecting personal information, and to study selfdiagnosis of security. This study aims to search and encrypt information related to protecting personal information in a smart home PC to enhance security and to delete files so that they cannot be recovered. The analysis of vulnerabilities detected in a smart home PC aims to check user account, <b>shared</b> folders, service <b>firewall,</b> screen savers, and automatic patch updates. A quantitative analysis and expression about vulnerabilities after checking them is carried out to make and show a check list for enhancing security. Smart home PC security management is then managed and operated by a server semi-automatically. It is expected that this study will contribute to reducing financial damages and people’s distress by further protecting personal information in a smart home PC, and enhancing national cyber security...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{networks for}} broadcast, telephony and data are converging to services on the Next Generation Networks (NGN), which are introduced by all major Service Providers (SP). Major requirements {{on the future}} IP network are security and mobility, which are reflection of the Internet’s importance and wide use of portable smart devices. Secure IP mobility {{is the focus of}} this thesis, i. e. how the user can move through different access networks whilst maintaining uninterrupted and secure IP communication. In particular, the remote access (corporate access) is the prime task, thus remote clients connect to central gateway, where corporate IP address or LAN segments are assigned. The corporate access requires naturally high level of security to protect against competitors. The security must cover the application data and mobile protocol signalling. This thesis targets an implementable solution for IPv 4 and IPv 6. It must integrate in the existing Service Provider infrastructure, like tunnelling devices (BRAS), AAA, Load <b>Sharing,</b> High Availability, <b>Firewalls,</b> PKI, monitoring, and administration etc. The existing approaches, like for example: Mobile IP with IPSec, MOBIKE, Proxy Mobile IP, are presented and analysed at first stage. The existing solutions fall short in many areas like: not considering NAT devices, not compatible to multi-homed hosts, without session tracking protection, problems with anti-spoofing rules performed by Internet Providers etc. A major deficit of all existing solutions is that the network parameters are updated at constant intervals. Neither the frequency of the host movements nor the network properties are considered by the update. This leads to underperformance regarding to the network load and convergence time due to disconnection. In this thesis, a new protocol family is developed, called Mobile VPN (M-VPN). The M-VPN consists of three sub protocols: Mobile Key Exchange (M-KE), Mobile Secure Encapsulation (M-SE), Mobile Location Update (M-LU). There are two major parts in this work: (1) engineering development of M-SE and M-KE for mobile IP security, and (2) mathematical algorithms (M-LU) for optimisation of the updates in mobile networks. Both parts build a complete view of the remote corporate access in mobile environments. The M-KE and M-SE have novel characteristics like mobility during the session negotiation through polling and caching, protection against location tracking through pseudo random header values and overlay dynamic topologies through network resources discovery. The principal idea in M-LU is to make the update interval proportional to the probability of disconnection. The updates are frequent in the timeframe with a high probability of disconnection and vice versa. The probability density function is built using the history of past changes in the parameters. The classical estimation methods cannot be used in a straightforward way in M-LU, since they require numerical values as result from a measurement. Unfortunately, the update procedure delivers only Boolean values and namely if the IP/UDP parameters have changed. The developed M-LU protocol creates three novel frameworks representing comprehensive and primitive solutions of the problem, thus stochastic, subjective and analytical. They are based on (1) sequential Monte Carlo in Particle filter, (2) Adaptive Fuzzy controller and (3) extended Kalman filter. A proof of concept on Mobile Location Update protocol is achieved through simulation on Matlab 7. 0. The results show clear outperformance of new methods against the constant interval. The novel framework can also be implemented in various protocols like IPSec, SIP or Mobile IP etc...|$|R
