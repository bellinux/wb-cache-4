500|$|Auditions {{were held}} for the part of Sarah, the eldest {{daughter}} of the Barnes family and actress Loui Batley secured the role. On 1 July 2009, Digital Spy reported that Loui Batley had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of}} the year. Loui's decision matched co-worker Zoë Lister (Zoë Carpenter). The Hollyoaks website officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Batley and Lister would leave towards the end of that year. Their final storyline was described as a [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", stating that either Sarah or Zoë would die. Batley wanted to quit the serial in December 2008 when her contract ran out. Kirkwood asked her to stay another six months with the promise of a good exit storyline. The plot also involved Zoe and Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). She made it clear to Kirkwood and new executive producer Lucy Allan that she would leave afterward. Allan then came up with the idea of writing Batley out of the serial in its sister show Hollyoaks Later. Upon hearing Kirkwood's ideas for her exit storyline, Batley said: [...] "I've been there for quite a while and it was a great ending for the character - I couldn't have asked for a better way to go..." [...] Hollyoaks Later producer Bryan Kirkwood said: [...] "Loui's been brilliant in Hollyoaks and she's massively underrated. She's been at the centre of some of the biggest storylines on the main show. She never turned in a performance less than top-notch and I wish <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more recognition for that. She's a very strong actress and it's been fantastic to work with her - and great to be involved in her exit." ...|$|E
