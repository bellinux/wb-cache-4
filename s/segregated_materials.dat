We {{find that the}} percolation threshold is generally a non-monotonous function of segregation, and that an optimal (i. e., minimum) critical concentration exists well before maximum segregation is reached. We interpret this feature as originating from a competition between reduced available volume effects and enhanced concentrations needed to ensure percolation in the highly segregated regime.

40|$|Recent seismological {{measurements}} of the Pacific oceanic structure have detected a positive correspondence between surface topography, seismic wave speed, and the geoid (gravitational potential). High seismic wave speed indicates cold material sinking, which pulls the surface downward. Thus, topographic lows are expected to correlate with seismic wave speed highs, contrary to the new seismic measurements. We propose models which include two <b>segregated</b> <b>materials,</b> representing the fertile upper mantle and the residue from crustal melting, in order to decouple the surface topography from subsurface convection and create {{a positive correlation between}} topography and wave speed. We add a low viscosity zone beneath the residue to enhance the density contribution to the geoid anomaly and ensure that its sign is in phase with that of the surface topography and wave speed. Our models produce surface topography and geoid anomalies comparable to the recent seismological measurements. These models offer constraint...|$|E

The trends of variations of chemical compositions of minerals were also studied. Other related meteorites, ALH 81187 and ALH 81261 (acapulcoites) were also studied for comparison. Textures of these meteorites are various from fine-grained recrystallized chondrite-like materials including minerals known in chondrites, to coarse-grained materials with opaque mineral grains which have complex shapes, often with large aggregates of Fe-Ni metal. The variety of modal abundances and textures of primitive achondrites suggests that heterogeneity produced by local segregation of partially melted materials on their parent bodies can explain the origin of variation of primitive achondrites. Systematic variations in the relative abundances of olivine, augite+plagioclase, and orthopyroxene shows that the plagioclase-augite-rich region of Caddo County B 3 A (augite+plagioclase= 96. 8 %) can be taken as an endmember of the variations observed in other primitive achondrites.

40|$|Mixtures of {{cationic}} and {{anionic surfactants}} crystallized at various ratios {{in the absence}} of added salt form micrometer-sized colloids. Here, we propose and test a general mechanism explaining how this ratio controls the shape of the resulting colloidal structure, which can vary from nanodiscs to punctured planes; during cocrystallization, excess (nonstoichiometric) surfactant accumulates on edges or pores rather than being incorporated into crystalline bilayers. Molecular segregation then produces a sequence of shapes controlled by the initial mole ratio only. Using freeze-fracture electron microscopy, we identified three of these states and their corresponding coexistence regimes. Fluorescence confocal microscopy directly showed the segregation of anionic and cationic components within the aggregate. The observed shapes are consistently reproduced upon thermal cycling, demonstrating that the icosahedral shape corresponds to the existence of a local minimum of bending energy for facetted icosahedra when the optimal amount of excess <b>segregated</b> <b>material</b> is present...|$|R

The total area of tubular cells recorded in the electron microscopy sections was 93 X 10 (- 4) mum 2. Since the distal convoluted tubules, covering about 12 % of the whole tubulocellular area, contained only 3 - 4 % of all AV, they were omitted from the main calculations. The number of AV per area unit and {{the total amount of}} <b>segregated</b> <b>material</b> showed a distinct diurnal rhythm, synchronous for the different types of AV which were distinguished from each other according to their contents.

Six stands of Scots pine growing in the north of Scotland were studied to evaluate the potential of different non-destructive assessment methods (stem straightness score, various branch indices, and portable acoustic tools) for predicting log grade out-turn, sawn timber appearance grade and mechanical properties. Stem straightness score and the height of the lowest dead branch were found to be the best predictors of log grade out-turn.

Measurements of stress wave velocity in trees and logs, using portable acoustic tools, were good predictors of the mechanical properties of sawn timber.

The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate combining abilities for soybean rust resistance in the F 2 and F 3 populations at MUARIK and F 3 populations simultaneously across five locations. Combining ability for soybean rust resistance was estimated from a half diallel cross of eight soybean using disease severity and sporulation rates as indices for resistance. A consistent contribution of additive gene action was observed at MUARIK across F 2 and F 3 despite high environment contribution to both severity and sporulation rate. The simultaneous evaluation of F 3 populations in five diverse loca√Ç¬¨tions produced similar results with significant GCA effects for both traits. There were, however, greater genotypic effects to soybean rust severity and sporulation across the five test environments, although genetic systems of severity and sporulation rate acted independently. Additive and additive x additive epistatic gene effects were the most common form of GCA controlling resistance. Specific combining ability did not always contribute to soybean rust resistance. The positive correlation between parental severity, sporulation rate performance and GCA estimates suggested that selection of parents for soybean rust resistance breeding can be based on parental performance. Parental line UG 5 was the most outstand√Ç¬¨ing producing the greatest number of resistant populations.

40|$|Decontamination of {{materials}} such as soils or waste water that contain radioactive isotopes, heavy metals, or hazardous components is a subject of great interest. Magnetic separation is a physical separation process that <b>segregates</b> <b>materials</b> {{on the basis of}} magnetic susceptibility. Because the process relies on physical properties, separations can be achieved while producing a minimum of secondary waste. Most traditional physical separation processes effectively treat particles larger than 70 microns. In many situations, the radioactive contaminants are found concentrated in the fine particle size fraction of less than 20 microns. For effective decontamination of the fine particle size fraction most current operations resort to chemical dissolution methods for treatment. High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) is able to effectively treat particles from 90 to {approximately} 0. 1 micron in diameter. The technology is currently used on the 60 ton per hour scale in the kaolin clay industry. When the field gradient is of sufficiently high intensity, paramagnetic particles can be physically captured and separated from extraneous nonmagnetic material. Because all actinide compounds are paramagnetic, magnetic separation of actinide containing mixtures is feasible. The advent of reliable superconducting magnets also makes magnetic separation of weakly paramagnetic species attractive. HGMS work at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is being developed for soil remediation, waste water treatment and treatment of actinide chemical processing residues. LANL and Lockheed Environmental Systems and Technologies Company (LESAT) have worked on a co-operative research and development agreement (CRADA) to develop HGMS for radioactive soil decontamination.

To further summarize, the focus this quarter has been on finalizing commercial design and the layout of four dryers behind each Unit. The modification to the coal handling facilities at Coal Creek and incorporation of air jigs to further beneficiate the <b>segregated</b> <b>material</b> the dryers will reject 20 to 30 % of the mercury and sulfur is segregated however this modification will recover the carbon in that stream...|$|R

End-of-life products, post-consumer waste, industrial excess, or otherwise collected materials for reuse are typically mixed with other incompatible materials. These <b>materials</b> must be <b>segregated</b> using <b>material</b> separation processes. This thesis investigates the performance and design of material separation systems for recycling through modeling material flows within these systems. The material separation system models developed here are suited to material re-cycling because they encompass all types of separation process and any configuration of those processes as well as treat binary and multi-material streams. These mod-els capture the material behavior of separation systems through mass flow balance equations constructed using system configuration and process performance data. The Bayesian material separation model is used to capture the performance of separation stages processing a binary material mixture, while the material separation matri...|$|R

However, most breeding programs have been set and designed by breeders, neglecting the role of users: farmers and farming communities. Farmers have been the passive users, receiving finished breeding lines varieties for their production. The dissemination process of ‚Äútechnology transfer" has been very slow and costly for both breeders and farmers. The use of participatory approaches in crop improvement have ensured the involvement of farmers in the whole process or, at least, in the evaluation process. This has resulted in better understanding and acceptability of new crop varieties generated through the breeding program. Can Tho University, as the leading research institution for adapting participatory approaches to rice improvement, started on-farm breeding programs as early as 1975, after the war, by sending out their staff and students to work closely with farmers on crop-improvement programs. In 1994, with the inception of the Community-Based Biodiversity Development and Conservation (CBDC) project, participatory plant- breeding (PPB) and participatory varietal-selection (PVS) approaches were introduced as methods to develop and identify crop varieties specific lo niche environments and farmers' preferences. These participatory approaches are also being used in one of the study sites, Tra Cu, of the global in situ Conservation project implemented in Vietnam in collaboration with Ihe international Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI). The result has been very positive, with many promising crop varieties selected from these programs and used in larger-scale production. Farmers have been successful in <b>segregating</b> <b>material</b> selection and many farmers have become well known through these activities. Participatory approaches are very important for crop improvement at the community level in Vietnam. PPB and PVS approaches are the key tool for crop improvement. Successful results from farmer selections have strongly proven that these approaches are right. This experience has been very useful for national crop-improvement programs...|$|R
