50|$|Australian road {{transport}} {{has a reputation}} for using very large trucks and road trains. This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the trailers, with four tyres on each axle. This means that Australian single semi-trailer trucks will usually have 22 tyres, which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries. Super single tyres are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tyre for each side of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair. Super singles are also often used on the <b>steer</b> <b>axle</b> in Australia to allow greater loading over the <b>steer</b> <b>axle.</b> The increase in loading of steer tyres requires a permit.|$|E
50|$|A {{tractor unit}} can have many axles {{depending}} on axle load legislation. The most common varieties {{are those of}} 4×2, 6×2 and 6×4 types. However, some manufacturers offer 6×6, 8×6, 8×8, 10×8, and 10×10 axle configurations. A 6×4 has three axles, normally an undriven front <b>steer</b> <b>axle</b> and the two rear axles driven. 6×4 units are more common in long distance haulage in larger countries such as the United States and Australia. In Europe, the 4×2 and 6×2 variants are more commonplace.|$|E

The bogies weigh only 15.8 tonnes and are equipped with radially <b>steered</b> <b>axles.</b> This reduces rail wear significantly. A redesigned bogie construction was refitted by the manufacturer in the mid-2000s after the locomotives were found to oscillate sideways when running at speeds of over 160 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Tractors {{with three}} axles or more {{can have more}} than one {{steering}} axle, which can also be driven. Most 6×2 units allow the undriven rear axle to be raised when lightly loaded, or running without a trailer, to save tire wear, save toll road fees, and increase traction on the driven axle. The 6×6 units have three axles, all can be driven, and 8×6 units have four axles, with either the rear three driven and the front axle not, or the front and rear-most two axles powered and an unpowered lifting bogie center axle to spread the load when needed. The 8×8 units also have four axles, but with all of them driven, and 10×8 units have five axles with the rear four usually driven and the front axle for steering. All five axles of 10×10 units are driven. The front two axles are usually both <b>steer</b> <b>axles.</b> The axle configurations are usually based on axle load legislation, and maximum gross vehicle weight ratings (BDM).|$|R

50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with dual wheels, with three 8 t axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from single versus dual wheels. The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the <b>steer</b> <b>axle.)</b> A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both dual wheels and on single wheels, instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on single wheels.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{a result}} of {{successful}} initiatives in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, {{the introduction of a}} Smart Truck or performance-based standards (PBS) approach in the heavy vehicle sector in South Africa was identified by the CSIR as a research area warranting funding because of the potential benefits in terms of transport efficiency, road/vehicle safety and the protection of road infrastructure. The PBS approach involves setting standards to specify the performance required from the operation of a vehicle on a network rather than prescribing how the specified level of performance is to be achieved. A need was identified to design, manufacture and operate a number of PBS demonstration projects in South Africa in order to gain practical experience in the PBS approach and to quantify and evaluate potential benefits. The Smart Truck demonstration projects have been designed and manufactured to comply with the safety standards of the Australian PBS system. These include directional and non-directional manoeuvres such as acceleration capability, slow speed swept path, static rollover threshold and rearward amplification. In order to evaluate the impact of the PBS vehicles on pavements, the South African Mechanistic-Empirical Design and Analysis Methodology was used to calculate the road wear characteristics of various baseline and PBS vehicle combinations. In most cases, the PBS vehicles were found to be significantly more road-friendly per ton of payload than the corresponding baseline vehicles. Modifications for reducing road wear were identified such as load redistribution {{in order to reduce the}} load on the steering axle, replacing wide-based single tyres with dual tyres and, where appropriate, replacing a single <b>steer</b> <b>axle</b> with a twin <b>steer</b> <b>axle</b> unit. The paper describes the results of road wear analyses of five PBS vehicles and the corresponding baseline vehicles...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, {{weigh-in-motion}} (WIM) sensors {{have been used in}} the United States to collect vehicle weight data for designing pavements and monitoring their performance. The use of these sensors is now being expanded for enforcement purposes to provide virtual weigh stations for screening vehicles in traffic streams for overweight violations. A study found that static weigh stations in Indiana were effective for identifying safety violations, but ineffective for identifying overweight vehicles. It was also determined that the alternative approach to identifying overweight vehicles using virtual weigh stations requires a high level of WIM data accuracy and reliability that can only be attained with a rigorous quality control program. Accurate WIM data is also essential {{to the success of the}} Long-term Pavement Performance project and the development of new pavement design methods. This dissertation proposes a quality control program that addresses vehicle classification, speed, axle spacing, and weight accuracy by identifying robust metrics that can be continuously monitored using statistical process control procedures that differentiate between sensor noise and events that require intervention. The speed and axle spacing accuracy is assessed by examining the drive tandem axle spacing of the population of Class 9 vehicles. The weight accuracy is assessed by examining the left-right <b>steer</b> <b>axle</b> residual weight of the population of Class 9 vehicles. Data mining of these metrics revealed variations in the data caused by incorrect calibration, sensor failure, temperature, and precipitation. The accuracy metrics could be implemented in a performance-based specification for WIM systems that is more feasible to enforce than the current specifications based on comparing static vehicle weights with dynamic vehicle weights measured by the WIM sensors. The quality control program can also be used by agencies to prioritize maintenance to more effectively allocate the limited funds available for sensor repair and calibration. This research provides a tool that agencies can use to obtain and sustain higher quality WIM data. ...|$|E
40|$|Besides the {{braking system}} the {{steering}} system {{is one of the}} most important systems on vehicles. The reliability and the performance of a steering system decides on the controllability of the vehicle under normal conditions as well as emergency situations. In everyday use the characteristics, the connectivity to assistance systems and the energy efficiency of the steering system become more and more important to fulfill the increasing demands regarding fuel consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and comfort. To meet these demands, new steering systems must be implemented and new technologies have to be developed.

40|$|Long Combination Vehicles (LCVs) require {{different}} strategies in controlling lateral {{dynamics of the}} combinations to ensure optimal paths followed by the trailers. Steering more than one axle of the combination has been developed in previous works and now needs to be verified in real vehicle tests.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} way in which traYc data are used in exible {{pavement}} design and analysis procedures. A deterministic long-term pavement performance model (LTPPM) is used to calculate exible pavement damage caused by traYcking from three realistic eets of commercial vehicles. The eets have been modelled using seven-axle group models representing <b>steer</b> <b>axles,</b> drive axles (single or tandem) and trailer axles (tandem or tridem) with either steel suspensions or air suspensions. Results are compared with the calculated exible pavement damage caused by a eet of 80 kN standard axles and predictions from the currently used method of traYc characterization for UK pavement design procedures. Results show that pavements that fail by rutting last longer when traYcked by the realistic vehicle eets compared with the eet of 80 kN standard axles whereas the pavements that are predicted to fail by fatigue last longer when traYcked by the eet of 80 kN standard axles. Results also show that current UK pavement design procedures are more sensitive to diVerences in the vehicle eet compared with LTPPM predictions...|$|R

This is part of an ongoing effort to model and predict vehicle dynamic behavior. The new machine is called the Suspension Parameter Identification and Evaluation Rig (SPIdER) and has a capacity intended to cover all of the military’s wheeled vehicles. The machine operates by holding the vehicle body nominally fixed while hydraulic cylinders move an “axle frame ” in bounce or roll under each axle being tested. Up to two axles may be tested at once. Forces at the tires and motions of the wheel centers in three dimensions and two angles are measured. Other motions of the suspension and the minimal motions of the vehicle body are measured. For <b>steer</b> <b>axles</b> the steering ratio, Ackerman steer characteristics, and kingpin orientation are measured.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} optimal trailer steering controller for a tractor–semitrailer is discussed. A {{linear model}} of a tractor–semitrailer with <b>steered</b> trailer <b>axles</b> is described, and an optimal trailer steering controller is introduced. A path-following controller is derived to minimise the path-tracking error in steady-state manoeuvres using active trailer steering. A roll stability controller is introduced by adding the lateral acceleration of trailer centre of gravity as another objective in the steering controller, so as to improve roll stability in transient manoeuvres. A strategy to switch between these two control modes is demonstrated. Simulation {{results show that the}} steering controller can ensure good path tracking of articulated vehicles in steady-state manoeuvres and improve roll stability significantly in transient manoeuvres, while maintaining the path-tracking deviation within an acceptable range. Tests with an experimental tractor–semitrailer equipped with a high-bandwidth active steering system validate the controller design and simulation results.

5000|$|A typical SPMT has {{a grid of}} {{computer-controlled}} axles, usually 2 axles {{across and}} 4-8 axles along. When two (or more) axles are placed side-by-side, this is called an axle line. All axles are individually controllable, in order to evenly distribute weight and <b>steer</b> accurately. Each <b>axle</b> can swivel through 360°. The axles are coordinated by the control system to allow the SPMT to turn, move sideways or even spin in place. Some SPMTs allow the axles to telescope independently of each other so that the load can be kept flat and evenly distributed while moving over uneven terrain. Each axle can also contain a hydrostatic drive unit.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and evaluates a 3 -D kinematic controller for passively-steered rovers. Passively-steered rovers have no steering motors, but rely on differential wheel velocities {{to change}} the <b>axle</b> <b>steer</b> angles. This passive steering design is reliable and efficient but more challenging to control than powered steering designs, especially when driving on rough terrain. A controller based on 2 -D kinematics fails to accurately maintain the desired trajectory when traversing obstacles. The presented 3 -D kinematic controller uses inertial and proprioceptive sensing to modify commanded steer angles and wheel velocities, greatly improving steering accuracy. Validation in simulation and physical experiments is presented. These results are significant because they establish {{the viability of the}} passive-steering configuration for precise navigation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{work was}} carried out at Volvo 3 P, 26200 Advanced Engineering, Gothenburg during the time November 2005 – May 2006. It {{was a part of}} the Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree at Luleå University of Technology. The thesis work focused on {{implementation}} of a new steering concept to an otherwise regular Volvo FM truck. The steering concept was considered interesting in applications where low ground pressure or good off-road performance is important. The performance of the concept, mainly in terms of steering capabilities, vehicle stability and off-road performance was to be predicted. Other areas such as transmission layout and axle configuration were also to be considered. Basic rules and restrictions concerning the design were set. With these restrictions, a mathematical model was constructed. With this model the steering performance could be predicted for any vehicle, regardless of its dimensions. Two concept vehicles, one 6 x 6 and one 8 x 6, were designed in ProEngineer and their performance was studied in detail. The need of front-wheel drive could not be fully determined and therefore the optimal transmission configuration could not be defined. Since the 8 x 6 vehicle where designed with a <b>steered</b> rear <b>axle,</b> the turning ability of this vehicle is slightly superior to the turning ability of the 6 x 6 vehicle. The transmission layout and front axle configuration should be examined with dynamic analysis to fully understand the tractive requirements of the front axle. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} dynamic {{behaviour}} and maneuverability of high capacity transport vehicles, the converter dolly can {{be equipped with}} <b>steered</b> and braked <b>axles.</b> By improving the actuation and steering strategy, the combinations performance can be increased drastically. This thesis modified an existing steered dolly to accommodate a rapid prototpying system, so that previously developed steering algorithms can be executed in real-time and evaluated in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation as well as on-track testing further on. The main-outcomes are a ready-to-use interface for algorithm development in MATLAB/Simulink that allows to request steering angles individually for each axle and supplies feedback for all relevant parameters (e. g. articulation angle between different units of combination, steering angle of tractor) for their computation in real-time. On top of that a concept for requesting braking torques from the dolly's braking system for future projects was developed. To ensure safety of the whole combination, especially during track-tests, a supervisor system was implemented to limit the request based on hardware limitations. Additionally an inertial measurement unit setup was developed and implemented for use on the combination to gather suficient data {{for each of the}} combination's independently moving units dynamic behavior during testing to calibrate and parametrize the tested algorithms. In the scope of this thesis the dolly was modified to conduct hardware-in-the-loop simulations. All necessary systems to achieve this were built as prototypes for a workshop test-environment limiting the use-case to a standing-system. Reliable track-proof solutions were developed and commissioned for manufacturing, so that track-testing is possible soon after...|$|R
