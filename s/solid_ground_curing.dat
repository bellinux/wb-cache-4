50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>ground</b> <b>curing</b> {{utilizes}} {{the general}} process of hardening of photopolymers by a complete lighting and hardening {{of the entire}} surface, using specially prepared masks. In SGC process, each layer of the prototype is cured by exposing to an ultra violet (UV) lamp instead of by laser scanning. So that, every portion in a layer are simultaneously cured and do not require any post-curing processes. The process contains the following steps.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> <b>curing</b> system {{is that it does}} not require a support structure since wax is used to fill the voids. The model produced by SGC process is comparatively accurate in the Z-direction because the layer is milled after each light-exposure process. Although it offers good accuracy coupled with high throughput, it produces too much waste and its operating costs are comparatively high due to system complexity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Curing</b> - A {{layer of}} liquid {{photopolymer}} is {{spread over a}} platform. An optical mask is generated and laid over the polymer. A UV lamp cures the resin that is not blocked by the mask. Any remaining liquid is removed and the voids are filled with wax. Liquid resin is spread over the layer that was just produced and the process is repeated. When the part is finished, the wax can be melted out of the voids.|$|E

The advantage of a <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> floor is the elimination of dry rot and other problems normally associated with hollow joisted floors. The disadvantage is that the floor is less resilient to walk upon and may be more tiring for the user. <b>Solid</b> <b>ground</b> floors are usually found or situated in a kitchen but will be necessary for other rooms where wood blocks and other similar finishes are required.|$|R

50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>ground</b> <b>curing</b> (SGC) is a photo-polymer-based {{additive}} manufacturing (or 3D printing) technology used for producing models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts, {{in which the}} production of the layer geometry is carried out by means of a high-powered UV lamp through a mask. As the basis of <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> <b>curing</b> is the exposure of each layer of the model by means of a lamp through a mask, the processing time for the generation of a layer is independent of the complexity of the layer. SGC was developed and commercialized by Cubital Ltd. of Israel in 1986 in the alternative name of Solider System. While the method offered good accuracy and a very high fabrication rate, it suffered from high acquisition and operating costs due to system complexity. This led to poor marketacceptance. While the company still exists, systems are no longer being sold. Nevertheless, it's still an interesting example of the many technologies other than stereolithography, its predeceasing rapid prototyping process that also utilizes photo-polymer materials. Though Objet Geometries Ltd. of Israel retains intellectual property of the process after the closure of Cubital Ltd. in 2002, the technology is no longer being produced.|$|E

40|$|Several new {{technologies}} collectively {{referred to as}} solid freeform fabrication have been developed {{in the last decade}} for use in the rapid prototyping of solid three dimensional parts. These include stereolithography, photosolidification, <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> <b>curing,</b> 3 D printing, fused deposition modeling, ballistic particle manufacturing, selective laser sintering, laminated object manufacturing, and shape deposition manufacturing. The prototypes they produce serve as physical models during design review, allow engineers to perform functional testing of parts, and are often used as mold patterns or positives for secondary tooling to manufacture small batch sizes. This paper describes the technologies used by each of these processes, and compares their strengths and limitations.

30|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{stereolithography}} {{there has been a}} surge in the development of different RP technologies, which have been patented and commercialized. Some of these may have already become obsolete [28] as could be concluded from comparison of the early technology reviews by Pham et al. [26] and Yan et al. [29], or they may have been experimental and remained undeveloped beyond the research phase; or are now known by different names. For example, Photo Masking (PM) described in 2010 by Chua et al. [30] appears to be similar to that of <b>Solid</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Curing</b> (SGC) which according to Levy et al. [28] disappeared from the market in 1999. The annual reports published by Wohlers and Associates are useful to keep track of developments [31, 32]. Their summary on the history of RP reflects the competition between suppliers of RP technologies, and lists suppliers and manufacturers of RP systems, which have ceased to trade [32].|$|E
40|$|Rapid Manufacturing is a {{term that}} embraces rapid {{prototyping}} and rapid tooling. Rapid prototyping is an exciting new technology for quickly creating physical models and functional prototypes directly from CAD models. Rapid tooling generally concerns the production of tooling using parts manufactured by rapid prototyping. Rapid prototyping and rapid tooling are means for compressing the time-to-market of products and, as such are competitiveness enhancing technologies. The book describes the characteristics and capabilities of the main known rapid prototyping processes. It covers in detail commercially available processes, such as: - Stereolithography (SLA); - Selective Laser Sintering (SLS); - Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM); - <b>Solid</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Curing</b> (SGC); - Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) and provides information on several other processes still under development. The book discusses various direct and indirect methods of producing soft tooling, firm tooling (or bridge tooling) and hard tooling based on rapid prototyping. The discussion is wide- ranging and not found in other books published to-date. Also special to the book is material on process optimisation. This was derived from work at the authors'Centre and is not available in other texts. The book places {{a strong emphasis on}} practical applications, devoting special chapters to both the applications of rapid prototyping and rapid tooling. The book contains an abundance of photographs and diagrams, some in colour, to illustrate clearly the principles of the machines and processes involved. The book does not require any special background. It should be of interest to manufacturing, industrial, production, mechanical and materials engineers wishing to up date themselves on {{some of the most important}} developments in modern manufacture. (The authors are from the Manufacturing Engineering Centre, which conducts leading-edge research into advanced manufacturing as well as providing a commercial rapid prototyping and tooling service to several hundred industrial customers) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{production}} of complex components {{with little or}} no machining by powder metallurgy (PM) techniques has brought in injection moulding {{as one of the most}} popular processing techniques. The tools and dies required for injection moulding are themselves complex and in order to process these, the technology of rapid prototyping (RP) or solid free-form fabrication (SFF) etc. has come into vogue. Essentially, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the required free-form is created and converted into STL (after the process Stereo Lithography for which 3 D systems developed this format) format. The latter is sliced into thin cross-sectional layers and the output is fed to the rapid prototyping machine which then builds the free-form, one layer atop another. The free-form is then sintered to yield the final product. During the past decade, RP has evolved into a class of technologies such as stereo-lithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> <b>curing</b> (SGC), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), fused deposition modelling (FDM), inkjet printing, etc. Not only can solid free forms be fabricated using these techniques, but functionally gradient materials (FGM) with properties varying from the surface to the interior, as well as composite materials, can also be advantageously made. The RP techniques are extensively used in processing ceramics and ceramic-polymer composites. The most popular techniques for metal powders are FDM and SLS. The latter often uses metal powders along with polymers. Complex shapes such as gears, turbine blades, etc. are produced. The technology however is in the early stages as far as Powder Metallurgy applications are concerned. It poses considerable challenges to the powder producers who are likely to concentrate on production of inks, gels, pastes and powder blends etc. in the future, which are required as feed materials for the RP techniques. The other feed materials which need to be developed will be in the form of metal powder-polymer blends, wires, rods, granules etc. The present paper discusses various RP processes and their applications to fabrication of automotive PM components...|$|E
