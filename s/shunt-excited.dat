5000|$|For broadcasting, mast {{radiators}} are {{the most}} common type of antenna used, consisting of a steel lattice guyed mast in which the mast structure itself is used as the antenna. Stations broadcasting with low power can use masts with heights of a quarter-wavelength (about 310 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) to 5/8 wavelength (225 electrical degrees; about 440 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer), while high power stations mostly use half-wavelength to 5/9 wavelength. The usage of masts taller than 5/9 wavelength (200 electrical degrees; about 410 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) with high power gives a poor vertical radiation pattern, and 195 electrical degrees (about 400 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) is generally considered ideal in these cases. Usually mast antennas are series-excited (base driven); the feedline is attached to the mast at the base. The base of the antenna is at high electrical potential and must be supported on a ceramic insulator to isolate it from the ground. <b>Shunt-excited</b> masts, in which the base of the mast is at a node of the standing wave at ground potential and so does not need to be insulated from the ground, have fallen into disuse, except in cases of exceptionally high power, 1 MW or more, where series excitation might be impractical. If grounded masts or towers are required, cage or long-wire aerials are used. Another possibility consists of feeding the mast or the tower by cables running from the tuning unit to the guys or crossbars at a certain height.|$|E
40|$|The <b>shunt-excited</b> antenna, first {{described}} and experimented with by Morrison and Smith, 1 {{was found to}} have a current distribution {{similar to that of the}} classical insulated-base antenna, except near the grounded base. Therefore, the <b>shunt-excited</b> antenna should have nearly the same radiation properties as an insulated-base antenna having the same length and radiating at the same wavelength. The present work is an attempt to investigate theoretically whether and to what extent these predictions are justified. The current distribution is, therefore, calculated according to the ordinary simplified line theory. The radiation pattern is thereafter derived and a formula for the radiation resistance is found. The radiation resistance is calculated numerically as a function of the ratio “antenna-length/wavelength. ” It seems to be in many cases very different for a <b>shunt-excited</b> antenna than for an insulated-base antenna.

40|$|A {{calculation}} of the starting torque ratio of permanent magnet, series, and <b>shunt-excited</b> dc motors powered by solar cell arrays is presented for two cases, i. e., with and without a maximum-power-point tracker (MPPT). Defining motor torque magnification by {{the ratio of the}} motor torque with an MPPT to the motor torque without an MPPT, a magnification of 3 for the permanent magnet motor and a magnification of 7 for both the series and shunt motors are obtained. The study also shows that all motor types are less sensitive to solar insolation variation in systems including MPPTs as compared to systems without MPPTs...|$|E
