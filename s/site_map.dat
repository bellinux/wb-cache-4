It was Sapper who labelled each of the archaeological groups and their attendant structures. American archaeologist A. Ledyard Smith visited the ruins in 1949 and wrote a chapter about the site in his Archaeological Reconnaissance in Central America, published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1955. Archeological excavations were carried out from 1954 through 1967 by the Musée de l'Homme of Paris under the direction of archaeologist Henri Lehmann, who certainly believed that he was excavating the Pocomam capital as described in Colonial records.|$|E

40|$|Mouse c-myb gene {{transcripts}} {{in various}} cells of haemopoietic origin were analysed using S 1 nuclease and RNase mapping techniques and by Northern blotting. It {{was found that}} the prevalent 3. 8 -kb c-myb mRNA present in thymocytes, T cell leukaemias, myelomonocytic leukaemias, erythroleukaemias and myeloid stem cells was initiated at several cap <b>sites</b> <b>mapping</b> within a region 97 - 244 bp upstream from the protein coding sequence. Utilization of additional cap <b>sites</b> <b>mapping</b> further upstream was also observed in certain cells, most notably thymocytes, and this gave rise to RNA species (4. 3 - 5. 6 kb) larger than the presumptive mRNA. In contrast, myeloma cell c-myb transcripts, which are much less abundant than those in more immature haemopoietic cells, were found to be initiated at a restricted set of cap <b>sites</b> <b>mapping</b> 244 - 277 bp upstream of the coding sequence. Hence, these data suggest that the abundance of the c-myb mRNA may be regulated by a process involving selective utilization of mRNA cap sites.

40|$|Navigating {{through a}} large Web site can be a {{frustrating}} exercise. Many <b>sites</b> employ <b>Site</b> <b>Maps</b> to help visitors understand the overall structure of the site. However, by their very nature, unpersonalized <b>Site</b> <b>Maps</b> show most visitors large amounts of irrelevant content. We propose techniques based on Web usage mining to deliver Personalized <b>Site</b> <b>Maps</b> that are specialized {{to the interests of}} each individual visitor. The key challenge is to resolve the tension between simplicity (showing just relevant content), and comprehensibility (showing sufficient context so that the visitors can understand how the content is related to the overall structure of the site). We develop two baseline algorithms (one that displays just shortest paths, and one that mines the server log for popular paths), and compare them to a novel approach that mines the server log for popular path fragments that can be dynamically assembled to reconstruct popular paths. Our experiments with two large Web sites confirm that the mined path fragments provide much better coverage of visitors sessions than the baseline approach of mining entire paths...|$|R

40|$|Carbohydrate-protein {{interactions}} are exquisitely specific, and underpin many biological and biochemical processes. In particular, carbohydrate-antibody recognition is the initial step in transplant rejection across ABO blood group and species barriers. Such {{interactions are}} difficult to structurally characterize, due to the high flexibility of carbohydrates. In silico techniques {{can be used to}} fill the gaps in structural knowledge, but must be thoroughly validated prior to use. In this project, novel in silico mapping techniques were developed and validated for investigating carbohydrate-protein recognition, with a focus on carbohydrate-antibody recognition. Anti-αGal antibodies, which recognize the αGal epitope on porcine tissues and are involved in the rejection of pig-to-human xenografts, were used as a test system throughout the project. A selection of docking programs were evaluated for their ability to reproduce the carbohydrate binding modes of a series of high resolution carbohydrate-antibody crystal structure complexes. Of the programs investigated, it was found that Glide performed the best at this task. The results also highlighted that interaction-based approaches could be useful in identifying likely binding modes. A “site mapping” technique was developed, which utilizes information from a given docking ensemble to identify protein residues likely to be involved in ligand recognition. The technique was validated for carbohydrate-antibody recognition using poses generated by Glide. Application of the technique to a panel of anti-αGal antibodies established the structurally conserved nature of carbohydrate recognition by these antibodies. Since <b>site</b> <b>mapping</b> alone cannot be used to infer likely binding modes, ligand-based mapping approaches were developed. The “epitope mapping” technique is used to determine ligand atoms likely to be involved in protein interaction. The “conformation mapping” technique is used to identify likely torsion angles of carbohydrate glycosidic linkages. Both of these techniques utilize the same docking ensemble as the <b>site</b> <b>mapping</b> technique. By combining the output from the three mapping techniques, likely carbohydrate binding modes of the anti-αGal antibodies were determined. These binding modes demonstrated the structural basis of the observed carbohydrate selectivity by two of these antibodies. The <b>site</b> <b>mapping</b> technique was applied to investigate peptide-antibody recognition, highlighting its potential application in the design of carbohydrate-mimetic peptides. The technique was validated using a series of high resolution peptide-antibody crystal structure complexes. The recognition of peptide mimics of the αGal epitope by the anti-αGal antibodies was investigated using the <b>site</b> <b>mapping</b> technique. By comparing the carbohydrate- and peptide-derived <b>site</b> <b>maps</b> for each of the antibodies, it was determined that the peptides largely act as structural mimics of the carbohydrates. Carbohydrate-lectin recognition was also investigated using molecular docking and the <b>site</b> <b>mapping</b> technique. Although molecular docking could usually identify the crystal bound carbohydrate conformation, it was rarely ranked highly. This highlights the need for alternative scoring approaches when studying carbohydrate-lectin recognition using molecular docking. <b>Site</b> <b>mapping</b> was shown to identify lectin residues involved in carbohydrate recognition with improved consistency and accuracy over the top ranked docking pose, and thus, mapping techniques may be useful for these structurally investigating these challenging systems. The in silico mapping techniques developed in this project are likely to be generally useful for studying ligand-protein recognition, as well as being valuable tools for drug design.
