In {{this study}} effects of <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> rate upon {{morphology}} {{and size of}} primary particles in Al- 7. 1 wt % Si slurry produced by SSR process were examined. SSR slurries with various solid fractions were poured into a wedge-shaped steel die to produce a range of <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> rates. The extent of primary particle growth during <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> at various cooling rates was estimated at 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 solid fractions using a 1 / 3 -power law relationship. The results indicate that for a given cooling rate primary particles in higher solid fraction SSR slurries grow less significantly during quench than those in low solid fraction slurries. The shape factor of primary particles also depends on <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> rate and solid fraction and decreases with increasing the <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> rate and/or the solid fraction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{two-dimensional}} heat-transfer {{model for}} transient simulation of a billets caster is presented. Its accuracy is verified through measured billet temperature and shell thickness. Billets temperature and solidification are computed by this model {{as a function}} of time varying casting speed, <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> water flow rates and temperature, billet cross section, steel grade, and pouring and ambient temperatures. A control methodology and algorithm suitable for online control of 5 strands billet continuous casting machine is integrated in this model. The ability of this model to control the surface temperature profile is demonstrated through dynamic and precise adjustment of <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> water flow rates. This <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> system has been applied to a billet caster in Hangzhou Steel Corporation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For bloom casting, typical quality defects such as midway crack usually occur upon {{improper}} cooling control during non-steady casting conditions specially for {{the production}} specialty steels,. A key measure to eliminate the defects formation has been presented by the adoption of more sophisticated <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> strategies to balance the surface reheating due to casting speed fluctuation. With the consideration of the complex casting conditions and the characteristics of bloom casters, a dynamic control model for the <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> has been developed in the paper to obtain a reasonable temperature profile and solidification progress for the bloom casting process, {{which is based on}} a slice residence time method combined with a multi-level control strategy. The feedback system, based on the difference between the calculated surface temperatures and the predetermined or measured surface temperatures, has been integrated into two-dimensional thermal model. The interlocking protection system between level- 1 and level- 2 is included in the model together with the data diagnosis and processing. Furthermore, the control model also offers technological interface for the introduction of new steel grades in production and the related modification to the <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> parameters. It is shown from online application that the dynamic control system of <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> for bloom casting is robust during operation and adaptable to any change of real casting conditions. Sound quality bloom castings according to acid etched tests have been obtained from the caster accordingly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper has}} studied the {{formation}} mechanism of frame-shaped segregation in 40 Cr wire rod rolled from bloom {{by means of the}} composition measurement, the electron microscopic observation and the energy spectrum analysis method. The results show that the frame-shaped segregation in wire rod originated from the positive segregation in columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition zone of bloom. The main influence factors are the solidification behavior of liquid steel in columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition zone, the temperature gradient of different solidification regions in bloom, the diffusion rate of the solute and inclusions in transition zone and so on. It may reduce the frame-shaped segregation by improving the purity of liquid steel, adopting the electromagnetic stirring in <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> zone and enhancing the cooling intensity of the <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> zone...|$|R
