5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{can be put}} to work in {{a number}} of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a {{disability}} or are therapy dogs, <b>some</b> <b>work</b> for customs agencies in drug detection, some as police dogs, others haze pest animals, such as geese, for city or state agencies, and <b>some</b> <b>work</b> as scat-detection dogs, tracking endangered wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|Busch drew on {{contemporary}} parochial and city life, satirizing Catholicism, Philistinism, strict religious morality and bigotry. His comic text was colourful and entertaining, using onomatopoeia, neologisms and other figures of speech, {{and led to}} <b>some</b> <b>work</b> being banned by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after this}} setback {{he still did}} <b>some</b> <b>work</b> for the firm. He tracked down and {{informed}} the firm of patent infringing copies of their engines in Leeds between 1795–1796 and probably also {{did the same thing}} subsequently in Lancashire.|$|E

5|$|These GTPases {{regulate}} cell motility, {{proliferation and}} {{also contribute to}} tumor progression and invasion. In many cell types, NEDD9 overexpression increases spreading and crescent morphology (an indicator of high motility). However, in fibroblasts, <b>some</b> <b>work</b> has found that absence of NEDD9 leads to more rapid focal adhesion turnover, which led to increase of migration in NEDD9-/- compared to wild type.|$|E
5|$|A round Norman-style apse {{was added}} to the church in 1868, the architects being the Lancaster {{partnership}} of Paley and Austin. The incumbent, the Rev. Thomas Clarke, paid for this addition, but died before its construction was complete. Architect J.S.Crowther oversaw further alterations in 1881–83; a baptistery was built, the organ was moved and choir stalls were built in the chancel. <b>Some</b> <b>work</b> was done to the interior of the tower in 1908. Renovations in 1955 included the addition of a central aisle and the removal of some of the church furnishings. The Victorian pulpit was replaced. A small extension was added north of the tower in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>some</b> <b>work</b> {{was done}} to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E

5|$|At the cinema, Joan is {{promoted}} to part-time assistant manager and Rayner tells {{her that the}} safe sometimes contains over £2,000 at weekends. She later tells Freddie, after he goes round to her house to offer Reg <b>some</b> <b>work</b> (Reg was not at home as Freddie told him {{to meet him at}} the pub). They talk about art, and he invites her (and Reg) to his house-warming party.|$|E
5|$|Edward IV died in 1483, {{leaving the}} kingdom to his young son, Edward V, but his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, {{had his own}} ambitions for the throne. Lord Hastings was unwilling to support the {{deposition}} of Edward V and, as a consequence, Richard summarily executed him that June, ahead of his own coronation. Kirby Muxloe and Lord Hastings' other estates were then restored to his widow, Katherine. After a short pause, Katherine continued <b>some</b> <b>work</b> on the site until the summer of 1484, focusing on making the corner tower and partially finished gatehouse habitable, before the project was finally halted. By this point around £1,000 had been spent on the works, including the laying of 1.3 million bricks.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, a Mr Bowker from Shawford {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the towpath to be diverted, but this was overturned when Rev. J H Du Boulay appealed against the decision. The diversion was sanctioned in 1914, {{although there have been}} doubts about the legality of the action, and subsequently two further diversions were made, at Chickenhall, near the southern end and at Hockley, near the northern end. No maintenance was carried out on the waterway until the formation of Catchment Boards. Thus responsibility for the waterway as a drainage channel passed to the Hampshire Catchment Board in 1942, and <b>some</b> <b>work</b> was carried out to maintain the integrity of the waterway. These responsibilities later passed to the Southern Water Authority, and now reside with the Environment Agency.|$|E

5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became interested, and did <b>some</b> <b>work</b> on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate <b>some</b> <b>work</b> rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Japanese noise {{rock group}} Boredoms have {{borrowed}} elements of grind, and toured with Brutal Truth in 1993. The Japanese grindcore group Gore Beyond Necropsy formed in 1989, and later collaborated with noise music artist Merzbow. Naked City, led by avant-garde jazz saxophonist John Zorn, performed an avant-garde form of polystylistic, grindcore-influenced punk jazz. Zorn later formed the Painkiller project with ambient dub producer Bill Laswell on bass guitar and Mick Harris on drums, which also collaborated with Justin Broadrick on <b>some</b> <b>work.</b> In addition, grindcore was one {{influence on the}} powerviolence movement within American hardcore punk, and has affected some strains of metalcore. Some musicians have also produced hybrids between grind and electronic music.|$|E

During the Long Way Round journey in 2004, McGregor and his travelling companions saw some of UNICEF's work in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, and during the Long Way Down trip in 2007, he and Charley Boorman did <b>some</b> <b>work</b> for UNICEF in Africa. McGregor hosted the annual Hollywood gala for the GO Campaign in 2009 and 2010. He {{has worked with the}} Children's Hospice Association Scotland, as featured in Long Way Down. In 2012, he travelled with UNICEF immunization workers to remote parts of India, Nepal and the Republic of Congo for a BBC2 documentary entitled Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{detailed}} {{design for the}} Merchant Navy class was undertaken by the drawing office at Brighton works, but <b>some</b> <b>work</b> was also undertaken by Ashford and Eastleigh. This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class to {{a limited number of}} personnel. The design incorporated a number of novel features, compared to then-current steam locomotive practice in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two ships}} {{of the ten}} were completed: Cöln and Dresden. Five other ships were launched, but not completed—these ships {{received}} names—and the remaining three had only had <b>some</b> <b>work</b> done to their keels before work ceased. These latter three ships were known only by their contract names. Cöln and Dresden had very limited careers, since they were completed so late in the war. They both participated in a fleet sortie into the northern North Sea that attempted to intercept a heavily-escorted convoy from Britain to Norway. And they {{were assigned to the}} abortive final sortie in October 1918. Both cruisers were interned in Scapa Flow and scuttled there in June 1921, and both remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|The castle's {{foundations}} {{rested on}} the underlying shingle of the beach. The walls were made from Kentish ragstone, mostly roughly laid, with <b>some</b> <b>work</b> using finer ashlar, with Caen stone used in the detailing. Most of the ragstone was collected from the local beaches, where there were suitable outcrops {{to the west and}} east of the site. 459 tons of Caen stone was recycled from the priories of Christ Church and Horton, which had recently been dissolved by Henry. In total, 147,000 bricks were used, produced at 13 different brickyards, and 44,000 tiles, mostly manufactured in Wye, along with 1,829 loads of lime, 110 tons of coal and 979 tons of timber. The total cost of the project came to £5,584.|$|E
5|$|The game {{supports}} {{up to six}} {{human or}} artificial intelligence players in local and online multiplayer, except on the PlayStation 4, which has a human player limit of four per console. Videoball has team and ranked matchmaking multiplayer modes. There is no set practice game mode, but players can train against computer-controlled opponents in exhibition matches and the scenario-based Arcade mode, in which the player faces two computer-controlled opponents in specific level configurations. The Arcade mode artificial intelligence personalities each have fitting names, such as Homer (who stays near its endzone) and Punchy (who bullies players with projectiles). <b>Some</b> <b>work</b> in pairs to establish gameplay concepts, such as Tippy, who passes the ball to Toppy, who maintains {{the top of the}} field.|$|E
