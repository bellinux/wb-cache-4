5|$|A serious {{industrial}} disaster was {{the dumping}} of mercury compounds into Minamata Bay, Japan. It {{is estimated that}} over 3,000 people suffered various deformities, severe mercury poisoning <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> death from {{what became known as}} Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|The third type, {{pancreatic}} mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) mainly {{occur in}} women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause <b>symptoms,</b> <b>or</b> have suspicious features, they {{can usually be}} successfully removed by surgery.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} studies, it is {{not known}} whether {{increased}} fluid intake improves <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> shortens respiratory illness, and there is a similar lack of data for the use of heated humidified air. One study has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.|$|E
50|$|Tests {{performed}} in a physical examination are usually aimed at detecting a <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> sign, and in these cases, a test that detects a <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> sign is designated a positive test, and a test that indicated absence of a <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> sign is designated a negative test, as further detailed in separate section below.|$|R

5000|$|In medicine, {{the term}} {{sine qua non}} (contrast with pathognomonic) is often used in regard to any sign, <b>symptom,</b> <b>or</b> finding whose absence would very likely mean absence of the target disease or condition. The test for such a sign, <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> finding would thereby have very high sensitivity, and rarely miss the condition, so a {{negative}} result should be reassuring (the disease tested for is absent). Examples include: ...|$|R
5|$|Identification of AVMs {{requires}} detailed {{medical imaging}} of the organs most commonly affected by these lesions. Not all AVMs cause <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> {{are at risk}} of doing so, and hence there is a degree of variation between specialists as to whether such investigations would be performed, and by which modality; often, decisions on this issue are reached together with the patient.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, then-presidential {{candidate}} Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine was poisoned {{with a large}} dose of TCDD. His blood TCDD concentration {{was measured}} 108,000 pg/g of fat, which is the second highest ever measured. This concentration implies a dose exceeding 2mg, or 25 μg/kg of body weight. Also he suffered from chloracne for many years, but again after initial malaise, other <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> abnormal laboratory findings were few.|$|E
5|$|People may be {{released}} after assessment from hospital or emergency {{room to the}} care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> those that might indicate an emergent condition such as: change in consciousness, convulsions, severe headache, extremity weakness, vomiting, new bleeding or deafness in either or both ears.|$|E

5000|$|Hamman's murmur, {{also known}} as Laënnec-Hamman symptom, Laënnec-Müller-von Bergmann-Hamman <b>symptom,</b> <b>or</b> Hamman's crunch is a {{crunching}} sound heard over the precordium due to spontaneous mediastinal emphysema.|$|R
50|$|A chief {{difficulty}} in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly, especially when cause or pathogenesis are unknown. Thus diagnostic terms often only reflect a <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> set of <b>symptoms</b> (syndrome).|$|R
5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} initial home treatment {{instead of}} hospital treatment {{for those with}} acute leg DVT. This applies as long as individuals feel ready for it, and those with severe leg <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> comorbidities would not qualify. An appropriate home environment is expected: one that can provide a quick return to the hospital if necessary, support from family or friends, and phone access.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> only mild symptoms in the first 24hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Up to 85% {{of people}} {{infected}} with H. pylori never experience <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> complications. Acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain (stomach ache) or nausea. Where this develops into chronic gastritis, the symptoms, if present, are often those of non-ulcer dyspepsia: stomach pains, nausea, bloating, belching, and sometimes vomiting or black stool.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} psychosocial {{interventions}} {{may be useful}} in the treatment of schizophrenia including: family therapy, assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive remediation, skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management. Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of <b>symptoms,</b> <b>or</b> no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 118, over {{a period}} of six months, she was {{submitted}} to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and {{there was no evidence of}} progressive neurological disease, depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained mentally intact until the end of her life.|$|E
50|$|A postdrome is a <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> set of <b>symptoms</b> {{that occurs}} after a {{particular}} condition has passed. A common {{usage of the}} term is {{in relation to the}} effects experienced following the end of a migraine attack.|$|R

50|$|In many leprosy cases, {{madarosis}} is a <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> {{a quality}} after diagnosis. However, in India, leprosy is common and researchers report {{a case of}} madarosis before diagnosis of leprosy with no skin lesions, only madarosis. This allowed for quicker treatment.|$|R
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
50|$|Patients with polycythemia vera {{are prone}} to the {{development}} of blood clots (thrombosis). A major thrombotic complication (e.g. heart attack, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, or Budd-Chiari syndrome) may sometimes be the first <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> indication that a person has polycythemia vera.|$|R
50|$|Central {{facial palsy}} (colloquially {{referred}} to as central seven) is a <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> finding characterized by paralysis or paresis of {{the lower half of}} one side of the face. It usually results from damage to upper motor neurons of the facial nerve.|$|R

5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative <b>symptoms,</b> <b>or</b> severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic <b>symptoms</b> <b>or</b> signs (i.e., {{outside the}} mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often {{out of proportion to}} the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E
50|$|Diaphoresis is a {{non-specific}} <b>symptom</b> <b>or</b> sign, {{which means}} that it has many possible causes. Some causes of diaphoresis include physical exertion, menopause, fever, ingestion of toxins or irritants, and high environmental temperature. Strong emotions (anger, fear, anxiety) and recall of past trauma can also trigger sweating.|$|R
