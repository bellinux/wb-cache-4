50|$|The Tethys Himalaya (TH) is an {{approximately}} 100-km-wide <b>synclinorium</b> {{formed by}} strongly folded and imbricated, weakly metamorphosed sedimentary series. Several nappes, termed North Himalayan Nappes {{have also been}} described within this unit. An almost complete stratigraphic record ranging from the Upper Proterozoic to the Eocene is preserved within the sediments of the TH. Stratigraphic analysis of these sediments yields important indications on the geological history of the northern continental margin of the Indian sub-continent from its Gondwanian evolution to its continental collision with Eurasia. The transition between the generally low-grade sediments of the Tethys Himalaya and the underlying low- to high-grade rocks of the High Himalayan Crystalline Sequence is usually progressive. But in many places along the Himalayan belt, this transition zone {{is marked by a}} major structure, the Central Himalayan Detachment System (also known as South Tibetan Detachment System or North Himalayan Normal Fault) which has indicators of both extension and compression (see ongoing geologic studies section below).|$|E
5000|$|The {{formations}} of the Shinkolobwe {{ore deposit}} form a {{spur of the}} Mine Series wedged into a fold-fault. Uranium minerals, and associated cobalt, silver, nickel, bismuth and arsenic, occur as massive sulfide ore in veinlets along fractures, joints, and minor faults within the Katanga <b>synclinorium.</b> Uraninite mineralization occurred 630 Ma, when uraniferous solutions percolated into the dolomitic shales of the Precambrian Mine Series (Serie des Mines), under the Roche Argilotalqueuse (R.A.T.) nappe. The Mine Series is a Schist-Dolomite System postulated {{to be in the}} Roan System. This schistose-dolomite appears structurally between two contacts of the Kundelungu System, the Middle Kundelungu and the Lower Kundelungu, of the Katanga Group. The Lower and Upper Kundelungu form a double syncline, the northern limb of which overlies the Shinkolobwe Fault. These structural complexities aside, the Katanga stratigraphic column consists, top to bottom, of the Precambrian Kundelungu System (Upper, Middle and Lower), the Grand Congomerate and Mwashya Systems, the Schist-Dolomite System (Roan System-Mine Series of R.G.S., C.M.N., S.D., R.S.C., R.S.F., D.

50|$|The Adamsfield Jubilee {{element is}} {{east of the}} Tyennan Block. It has a strip exposed on the surface that {{includes}} the Florentine <b>Synclinorium,</b> The Adamsfield District, the Jubilee Region, {{and down to the}} South Coast at Precipitous Bluff and Surprise Bay. It also underlies the Tasmania Basin across southeastern Tasmania, but not including the east coast. The subsurface structure has been studied from a few outliers, boreholes, xenoliths, and gravity and magnetic surveys. The basement at 5 km deep {{is the same as the}} Tyennan metamorphic rocks (Scotchfire Metamorphic Complex). Its oldest exposed rocks are from the Clark Group, of pelitic rocks, some with stromatolites, and evaporites, and overlaid with orthoquartzite. The Weld River Group lies above, starting with 0.5 km thickness of conglomerate and sandstone, then up to 3 km of dolostone, interbedded with sandstone, mudstone and diamictite. Glacial dropstones are found in the interbedding, suggesting Cryogenian age, however carbon isotope results suggest Ediacaran age instead. Gravity and magnetic studies indicate that this sort of dolomite (dense and non-magnetic) underlies Hobart and Bruny Island in a north-south strip, and also in a region west of Hobart.|$|E
5000|$|In the Rocky Cape Block west of Wynyard {{and north}} of Granville Harbour, the Precambrian rocks consist of the Rocky Cape Group from the Stenian period, with Cowrie Siltstone, Detention Subgroup, Irby Siltstone, and Jacob Quartzite. [...] The {{sequence}} covers most of the block and is over 5700 metres thick. Currents travelled either northwesterly or southeasterly. The metamorphic belt titled the Arthur Lineament forms {{the limits of the}} Rocky Cape Group to the south east. The Burnie Formation followed in the Tonian period south east of the lineament with greywacke and slaty mudstone, and also some basic pillow lavas. The Oonah Formation has even more varieties of rock than the Burnie formation, also including conglomerate, quartz sandstone, dolomite and chert. The Bowry Formation in the Cryogenian [...] was intruded by granite (Bowry granitoids) [...] These have been metamorphosed to the blueschist level. In the Smithton <b>Synclinorium</b> the Togari Group followed with conglomerate from the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations and dolomite marking the end of Cryogenian and on into the Ediacaran and Cambrian. The Togari group contains greywacke, conglomerate, diamictite, mafic volcanic rocks, and quartz sandstone, and mudstone. The components of the Togari Group are called Forest Conglomerate and Quartzite, Black River Dolomite, Kanunnah subgroup (containing the lavas) and Smithton Dolomite. [...] These rocks are important for determining the boundary between the Cryogenian and Ediacaran periods as they contain volcanics that can be dated and dolostones marking the end of glaciations and marking the period boundary.|$|E

40|$|End <b>Synclinorium</b> and {{adjacent}} anticlinoria {{has been made}} by the determination of illite crystallinity and bo values of K-white mica in eighty slates and phyllites. Illite crystallinity values vary from 0. 40 A ~ on the Molong Anticlinorium to 0. 12 A ~ within the axis of the syn-clinorium, suggesting anchizonal to epizonal metamor-phic conditions. This is in agreement with previous observations on Ca Al-hydrosilicate assemblages which indicated a change from prehnite pumpellyite facies in the anticlinoria djacent to the <b>synclinorium</b> to middle greenschist facies in the axis. Local variations in crystal-linity are attributed to variation in a ~ in fluids migrating along cleavage zones. The mean bo value obtained from the pelites is 9. 017 A (an = 0. 008; n = 80) which is in close agreement with that obtained from part of the adjacent Capertee Anti-clinorium (ff = 9. 019 A; an = 0. 007; n = 52). However, 't' tests indicate that two bo populations are present in the <b>synclinorium</b> (Y = 9. 010 and 9. 022 A), with the lower values concentrated in the southern portion of this structure. The two populations are considered {{to be the result of}} slightly different metamorphic conditions pre-vailing during the deformation of the rocks in the <b>synclinorium.</b> A higher geothermal gradient affecting rocks giving the lower bo values is attributed to the presence of granitoids at shallower depths than elsewhere in the <b>synclinorium.</b> rz ~ y w o R D S: illite, mica, metamorphic rocks, North Hill End <b>Synclinorium,</b> New South Wales, Australia.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{diversity}} of deformations, esp. faults, in the Ordovician to the Devonian deposits of the Prague Basin, their relations to the Proterozoic basement, and draws some conclusions about causes of this diversity. Attention is paid to the eastern, deeper downfolded part of the Basin (Prague <b>Synclinorium).</b> Some longitudinal faults (Libeň Thrusts, Tetín Thrust) are confined to the basin filling and are apparently due {{to the release of}} stresses generated during folding. Most of faults, however, are rooted in the Proterozoic basement and some of them were connected with Early Palaeozoic synsedimentary movements and/or volcanism (Prague Fault, Tachlovice Fault, Tobolka Fault, etc.). Some transverse faults separate segments having structures incompatible to one another. This testifies to the transverse faulting simultaneous with the folding and to the basement fractures influencing the deformation of the basin filling. The distinct SE vergency of folds in the Silurian-Devonian of the <b>synclinorium</b> {{can be explained by the}} underthrusting of a basement block towards NW. Otherwise, the tectonic transport in the <b>synclinorium</b> was bilateral and the vertical component of displacements prevailed.
