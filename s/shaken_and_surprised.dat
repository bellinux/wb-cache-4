6000|$|Albinia awoke, refreshed, {{though still}} <b>shaken</b> <b>and</b> feeble, <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to find that}} dinner was going on downstairs. Her own meal {{presently}} put such new force into her, that she felt able to speak Maurice's name without bursting into tears, and longing to see both her little ones beside her, she told the nurse to fetch the boy, but received for answer, 'No, Master Maurice {{said he would not}} come,' and the manner conveyed that it had been defiantly said. Master Maurice was no favourite in the nursery, and he was still less so, when his mamma, disregarding all mandates, set out to seek him. Already she heard from the stairs the wrangling with Susan that accompanied all his toilettes, and she found him the picture of firm, solid fairness, in his little robe de nuit, growling through the combing of his tangled locks. Though ordinarily scornful of caresses, he sprang to her and hugged her, as she sat down on a low chair, and he knelt in her lap, whispering with his head on her shoulder, and his arms round her neck, 'Mamma, were you dead?' ...|$|R
6000|$|To this Lumley replied by {{expressing his}} {{gratification}} at the news, <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> {{hands with the}} two Indians, who, however, received the shake with some distrust <b>and</b> much <b>surprise,</b> until Big Otter explained the nature and meaning of the white man's salutation. He also explained the meaning of [...] "What cheer." [...] On hearing which Maqua, {{not to be outdone}} in politeness, extended his hand for another <b>shake,</b> <b>and</b> exclaimed [...] "Watchee!" [...] with profound gravity. Mozwa, with some hesitation, imitated his father's example.|$|R

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and whether they are associated with co-sleeping. In Japan, co-sleeping is common during infancy and early childhood. This study investigates the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and their associations with co-sleeping among 4 -month-old infants in Japan. A questionnaire was administered to mothers who participated in a 4 -month health checkup program in Kamagaya City in Japan (n = 1307; valid response rate, 82 %). The questionnaire investigated the frequency of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering during the past one month, co-sleeping status, and living arrangements with grandparents, in addition to traditional risk factors such as stress due to crying. Associations between co-sleeping <b>and</b> self-reported <b>shaking</b> or smothering were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. The prevalence of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering at least one time during the past one month was 3. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 2. 4 %– 4. 3 %) and 2. 4 % (95 % CI, 1. 5 %– 3. 2 %), respectively. Co-sleeping was marginally associated {{with the amount of}} crying and not associated with stress due to crying. Further, co-sleeping was not associated with either self-reported shaking or smothering, although stress due to crying showed strong association with <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering. Co-sleeping was not a risk factor for <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering...|$|R
