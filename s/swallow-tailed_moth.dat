60|$|Arundina, a {{beautiful}} purple grassy-leaved orchid, was abundantly in flower on the hill-top, {{and the great}} white <b>swallow-tailed</b> <b>moth</b> (Saturnia Atlas) was extremely common, with tropical butterflies and other insects. The curious leaf-insect (Mantis) was very abundant on the orange trees, on the leaves of which the natives believe it to feed; nor indeed could we persuade some of our friends that its thin sharp jaws are unsuited for masticating leaves, and that these and its prehensile feet indicate its predacious nature: added to which, its singular resemblance to a leaf is no less a provision against its being discovered by its enemies, than an aid in deceiving its prey.|$|E

50|$|Nepheloleuca complicata, the <b>swallow-tailed</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth in {{the family}} Geometridae. It is found in Cuba, Jamaica and Haiti and from Panama to Peru. The habitat {{consists}} of lowland rainforests and mid-elevation cloudforests up to altitudes of about 1,800 metres.|$|E
50|$|The berries {{are a very}} {{valuable}} food resource for many birds. In Northern California elderberries are a favorite food for migrating band-tailed pigeons. Flocks can strip an entire bush {{in less than an}} hour. Elders are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, buff ermine, dot moth, emperor moth, engrailed moth, <b>swallow-tailed</b> <b>moth</b> and the V-pug. The crushed foliage and immature fruit have a strong fetid smell.|$|E
50|$|Ivies are {{of major}} {{ecological}} importance for their nectar and fruit production, both produced {{at times of}} the year when few other nectar or fruit sources are available. The ivy bee Colletes hederae is completely dependent on ivy flowers, timing its entire life cycle around ivy flowering. The fruit are eaten by a range of birds, including thrushes, blackcaps, and woodpigeons. The leaves are eaten by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as angle shades, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, scalloped hazel, small angle shades, small dusty wave (which feeds exclusively on ivy), <b>swallow-tailed</b> <b>moth</b> and willow beauty.|$|E
