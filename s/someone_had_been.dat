5|$|Altgens was {{featured}} in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He initially reported hearing two shots, but thought <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> setting off fireworks. For a November 25 story, Altgens wrote {{that he did not}} know the origin of the gunshots until later, but he believed they came from the other side of Elm Street, opposite the presidential limousine from where he was standing.|$|E
25|$|After several minutes, the {{coverage}} {{came back to}} the CBS newsroom where Cronkite reported that the President had been given blood transfusions and two priests had been called into the room. He also played an audio report from KRLD that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested in the assassination attempt at the Texas School Book Depository. Back in Dallas Barker announced another report of the death of the President, mentioning that it came from a reliable source. Before the network left KRLD's feed for good, Barker first announced, then retracted, a confirmation of Kennedy's death.|$|E
25|$|He also {{describes}} how his first chronological victim was actually Isaac Morris, the sleazy lawyer and drugs trafficker who anonymously purchased {{the island and}} arranged the invitations on his behalf. Morris was poisoned before Wargrave departed for the island. Wargrave's intention {{is that when the}} police arrive they will find ten bodies, with evidence that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> alive after each death, but nobody else on the island, and no way to trace the killer through his invitations or preparations. He states that, although there are three clues that could guide the police to the correct killer, he is confident they will be unable to do so and that the mystery will remain unsolved until the confession is retrieved.|$|E

500|$|Tatler listed Cumberbatch in the [...] "Most Eligible Bachelors in the United Kingdom" [...] in 2012. In {{the same}} year, Cumberbatch {{described}} a cyberstalking {{incident in which}} he discovered that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> live-tweeting his movements in his London home. Coming to terms with it, he said, it is [...] "an ongoing process. To think that somebody knew everything I'd done in a day and told {{the rest of the}} world in real time!" [...] His photograph taken at the Garrick Club by Derry Moore, 12th Earl of Drogheda was the cover of Moore's 2012 book An English Room.|$|E
500|$|Reports {{conflict}} {{about who}} shot first, {{but after two}} members of the mob approached the house, someone opened fire. Sarah Carrier was shot in the head. Her nine-year-old niece at the house, Minnie Lee Langley, had witnessed Aaron Carrier taken from his house three days earlier. When Langley heard <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shot, she went downstairs to find her grandmother, Emma Carrier. Sylvester placed Minnie Lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door, using the closet for cover: [...] "He got behind me in the wood , and he put the gun on my shoulder, and them crackers was still shooting and going on. He put his gun on my shoulder... told me to lean this way, and then Poly Wilkerson, he kicked the door down. When he kicked the door down, Cuz' Syl let him have it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his spare}} time during and between holding {{political}} appointments and serving in elected offices, Jones regularly embarked upon [...] "pleasure trips" [...] to various American cities including Baltimore and Richmond. Another known pastime of Jones's was gaming. According to Maxwell and Swisher in their History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897), Jones had been gambling {{over the course of}} several days while in Richmond until a final game left him with only one shilling remaining in his pocketbook. Jones was wearing a coat fastened with twelve gold buttons each valued at five dollars, and undeterred after losing his last shilling, he began staking one gold button at a time until he was left with one. Without hesitation, Jones removed his final button and remarked: [...] "Here goes the last button on Gabe's coat." [...] Maxwell and Swisher state that Jones's remark [...] "became a proverb in Hampshire County" [...] and was used when <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> driven to extremes and utilized what little resources were left at their disposal.|$|E

2500|$|This {{particle}} [...] pri , {{which is}} used when an action that had been expected to be performed by the subject is now finally being performed, [...] has no equivalent in English.

2500|$|The {{statement}} also {{relies on}} the inference that the sampling was random. [...] If <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> picking through the bag to find white beans, then it would explain why the handful had so many white beans, and also explain why the number of white beans in the bag was depleted (although the bag is probably intended to be assumed much larger than one's hand).|$|E
2500|$|The crime {{had been}} unsolved {{for two years}} when, in October 2003, local media again covered the murder. Erickson {{reportedly}} had several dreams about the crime after seeing an article in a newspaper and, a few days later, mentioned the murder to Ferguson asking him if he thought {{he may have been}} involved. [...] "It was crazy that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> murdered a couple blocks away from where we had been partying". said Erickson. Ferguson reassured him that he was not involved in the crime. Over time, Erickson says, he began to think more and more about the murders and {{about the fact that he}} could not remember that evening.|$|E

2500|$|On October 23, 1976, {{a similar}} {{shooting}} {{occurred in a}} secluded residential area of Flushing, Queens, next to Bowne Park. Carl Denaro, 20, and Rosemary Keenan, 18, were sitting in Keenan's parked car when the windows suddenly shattered. [...] "I felt the car exploded [...] ", Denaro said later. Keenan quickly started the car and sped away for help. The panicked couple {{did not realize that}} <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shooting at them, even though Denaro was bleeding from a bullet wound to his head. Keenan had only superficial injuries from the broken glass, but Denaro eventually needed a metal plate to replace a portion of his skull. Neither victim saw the attacker.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a little}} after 4:00, Officer Simonsen phoned Warden Powell, who was {{across the street at}} his residence. [...] Simonsen told the warden there was a {{disturbance}} inside the prison and that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> knifed. [...] Under duress from Myles and Smart, the officer told the warden little else, and Powell rushed through Tower 7 along with two guards to see what the [...] "disturbance" [...] was. [...] As soon as he entered Inside Administration, he was yanked through the doorway. [...] His escort realized something was wrong and retreated, escaping back through Tower 7. [...] The guards on top of this tower knew something was wrong and had tried to warn the warden, but the blustery spring wind had obliterated their words.|$|E
2500|$|Legal {{systems in}} some parts of the world {{distinguish}} civil, criminal, and administrative law, but under the Chinese legal system, the magistrate administered both judicial and administrative law.The magistrate was not allowed arbitrary decisions or to rely on local customary law but was constrained both by imperial edicts, which had the force of law, and the law codes. These dynastic law codes, such as the Tang Code or the Great Qing Code, included both civil law and criminal law. Cases ranged from murder and theft to accusations that a neighbor did not tie his horse or dog [...] or that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> kicked or bitten. Litigants also went to the magistrate with disputes over marriage, adoption, inheritance, and land, and these often had consequences for country revenue or taxes and tax collection. The Codes described offenses in detail, but the magistrate was also allowed to make an analogy to an existing provision of the code by using the rule: [...] "Everyone who does that which ought not to be done will receive forty strokes of the light bamboo. If the matter is adjudged to more serious, he will be punished by eighty strokes with the heavy bamboo." [...] Death sentences under the Qing were reviewed by the emperor, and serious cases of any nature could be appealed or reviewed, sometimes even to the emperor himself.|$|E
