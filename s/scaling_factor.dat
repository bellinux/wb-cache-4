5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters {{can be derived from}} it by applying a <b>scaling</b> <b>factor</b> to the components of the prototype.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{similarity}} solutions to this equation {{have been found}} for various types of flow, including flat plate boundary layers.

30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{topic is}} how {{the difference in the}} <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> is dependent on the GCR spectra. In Fig. 9 (a), the estimation using the <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> of 3.77 is described. However, this <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> does not seem to reproduce neutron production from alpha particles. The best fit to the calculations by the alpha particle interaction models is achieved with a <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> of 2.94. This is in agreement with a <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> of 3.0 that was previously estimated by Masarik and Reedy (1996) and Reedy (2009). Thus, we can safely state that variations in the <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> are largely dependent on the GCR spectra, thereby demonstrating the need for more accurate data on the GCR spectra. On the other hand, {{it is not necessary to}} use a <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> when using a heavy ion interaction model. Therefore, the use of the heavy ion interaction model in the radiation environment on the Moon will give more accurate results when calculating the neutron production in the lunar subsurface.|$|R

Four different <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> schemes are proposed, tested, compared and analyzed.

The four schemes have been integrated for comparison within three recently proposed distributed differential evolution structures and tested on several various test problems. Numerical results show that, on average, {{the employment}} of multiple <b>scale</b> <b>factors</b> is beneficial since in most cases it leads to significant improvements in performance with respect to standard distributed algorithms.

Therefore, {{it seems that}} the integer-to-integer lifting is achieved. However, the problem is whether the structure obtained by omitting the <b>scaling</b> <b>factors</b> is a kind of wavelet filter with normalization. Obviously the answer is no. The reason is that the lifting wavelets are usually obtained by factoring the traditional wavelets, and the <b>scaling</b> <b>factors</b> are the important parts of the factoring. If we omit the <b>scaling</b> <b>factors,</b> the structure of the traditional wavelet is also destroyed. The function of the <b>scaling</b> <b>factors</b> is to keep the same energy for the coefficients in different scale. “Keeping the same energy” is important to image compression, it can make the encoding algorithm using less bits to encode the wavelet coefficients. Therefore, the method by omitting the <b>scaling</b> <b>factors</b> is not a good choice.|$|R
