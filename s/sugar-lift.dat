5000|$|Contemporary printmakers {{often use}} spraypaint {{instead of a}} powder, {{particularly}} when using the technique known as <b>sugar-lift.</b> To produce a printing surface using <b>sugar-lift,</b> the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image [...] "lifts off" [...] the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate {{is ready to be}} printed from.|$|E
