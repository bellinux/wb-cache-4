40|$|A novel {{scheme of}} high {{stability}} engine control (HISTEC) {{on the basis}} of an improved linear quadratic regulator (ILQR), called direct <b>surge</b> margin <b>control,</b> is derived for super-maneuver flights. Direct <b>surge</b> margin <b>control,</b> which is different from conventional <b>control</b> scheme, puts <b>surge</b> margin into the engine closed-loop system and takes <b>surge</b> margin as <b>controlled</b> variable directly. In this way, direct <b>surge</b> margin <b>control</b> can exploit potential performance of engine more effectively with a decrease of engine stability margin which usually happened in super-maneuver flights. For conquering the difficulty that aeroengine surge margin is undetectable, an approach based on improved support vector regression (SVR) machine is proposed to construct a surge margin prediction model. The surge margin modeling contains two parts: a baseline model under no inlet distortion states and the calculation for surge margin loss under supermaneuvering flight conditions. The previous one is developed using neural network method, the inputs of which are selected by a weighted feature selection algorithm. Considering the hysteresis between pilot input and angle of attack output, an online scrolling window least square support vector regression (LSSVR) method is employed to firstly estimate inlet distortion index and further compute surge margin loss via some empirical look-up tables...|$|R

40|$|Surge {{tanks are}} units {{employed}} in chemical processing {{to regulate the}} flow of fluids between reactors. A notable feature of <b>surge</b> tank <b>control</b> {{is the need to}} constrain the magnitude of the Maximum Rate of Change (MROC) of the surge tank outflow, since excessive fluctuations in the rate of change of outflow can adversely affect down-stream processing (through disturbance of sediments, initiation of turbulence, etc.). Proportional + Integral controllers, traditionally employed in <b>surge</b> tank <b>control,</b> do not take direct account of the MROC. It is therefore of interest to explore alternative approaches. We show that the surge tank controller design problem naturally fits a differential games framework, proposed by Dupuis and McEneaney, for controlling a system to confine the state to a safe region of the state space. We show furthermore that the differential game arising in this way can be solved by decomposing it into a collection of (one player) optimal control problems. We discuss the implications of this decomposition technique, for the solution of other controller design problems possessing some features of the surge tank controller design problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A novel {{method for}} {{introducing}} a back-up system to an active compressor <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> system {{is presented in}} this paper. Active <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> is a promising method for extending the compressor map towards and into the unstable area at low mass flow by stabilizing the surge phenomenon. The method also has potential for allowing operation at higher efficiencies. However, a failure in the active <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> system may endanger the compressor by entering deep surge as the compressor is allowed {{to operate in the}} stabilized surge area. We propose the use of a back-up system applied to the active system to keep the compressor safe should the active system fail. This paper present an active compressor <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> system with piston actuation combined with a blow off system as the back-up. Performance of the combined system is evaluated by simulating the system in situations where the piston is saturated or jammed.

We examined the data on various timescales from daily to monthly because SST over the Sea of Japan also varies on timescales shorter than a month. &# 8195;The results showed that the impact of SST over the Sea of Japan on precipitation on the Sea of Japan side was strongly timescale-dependent. On the shorter intraseasonal timescales of several days to a few weeks, SST had a clear impact on precipitation, while the impact was indistinct when the 15 -day and monthly averaged precipitation and SST values were used. On the other hand, cold surges over the Sea of Japan primarily accounted for the amount of precipitation on the Sea of Japan side. The timing and strength of cold <b>surges</b> <b>controlled</b> precipitation on all timescales.

40|$|Lecturepg. 13 - 26 For every {{centrifugal}} compressor installation, {{the design of}} the <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> system is vitally important to prevent damage of the compressor internal components, seals, and bearings. While most <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> systems are capable of preventing surge for steady-state operation, emergency shutdowns (ESDs) are particularly challenging, since the <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> system must respond faster than the deceleration rate of the train. The available experimental data are not of sufficient quality and resolution to properly validate current software packages. This paper outlines an experimental test program using a full-scale compressor tested in a hydrocarbon flow loop under controlled, laboratory conditions. Transient compressor surge data during and ESD were captured over a variety of initial speed, pressure, and flow conditions. Furthermore, the anti-surge valve was modified in subsequent tests to simulate a slower and a smaller valve, providing a more varied test condition.

The importance of centrifugal compressors for natural gas transmission is discussed, and the causes of surge and the consequences of current <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> approaches are explained. Previous technology development, including findings from early GMRC research, previous surge detection work, and selected publications, are presented. The project is divided into three Phases to accomplish the project objectives of verifying near surge sensing, developing a prototype <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> system (sensor and controller), and testing/demonstrating the benefits of direct <b>surge</b> <b>control.</b> Specification for the direct <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> sensor and controller developed with guidance from the industry Oversight Committee is presented in detail. Results of CFD modeling conducted to aid in interpreting the laboratory test results are shown and explained. An analysis of the system dynamics identified the data sampling and handling requirements for direct <b>surge</b> <b>control.</b> A detailed design process for surge detection probes has been developed and explained in this report and has been used to prepare drag probes for the laboratory compressor test and the first field test. The surge detection probes prepared for testing have been bench tested and flow tested to determine and calibrate their sensitivity to flow forces as shown in data presented in this report. The surge detection drag probes have been shown to perform as expected and as required to detect approaching surge. Laboratory test results of surge detection in the SwRI centrifugal compressor demonstrated functionality of the surge detection probes and a change in the impeller inlet flow pattern prior to surge. Although the recirculation cannot be detected because of the specific geometry of this compressor, there are changes that indicate the approach of surge that can be detected. Preparations for a field test had been completed {{at one point in the}} project. However, a failure of the surge probe wiring just inside the compressor case has caused a delay in the field testing. Repairs for the wiring in the compressor have been scheduled and the field test will take place shortly after the repairs...|$|E

40|$|Active {{controllers}} {{that allow}} the compressor to operate safely at its peak pressure rise point by preventing <b>surge</b> and <b>controlling</b> entry into rotating stall need to be globally stabilizing. Bifurcation methods have emerged as {{a useful tool for}} the analysis of global stability and control of nonlinear dynamical systems such as the axial compressor. In this paper we show how bifurcation analysis can be used effectively to obtain answers to questions of global stability of the compressor dynamics. Since the bifurcation method does not directly provide information on transient behaviour, we demonstrate how bifurcation results need to be carefully interpreted to be of use when dealing with practical systems. We then present a novel nonlinear bifurcation-based stall/surge controller that is globally stabilizing. With such a controller, it becomes possible to avoid surge entirely and to prevent abrupt entry into rotating stall. The controller also eliminates the hysteresis between entry into and recovery from a rotating stall, and maintains system stability under all perturbations, small and large...|$|R
