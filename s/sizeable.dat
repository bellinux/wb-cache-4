5|$|Generally, Lacock Abbey prospered {{throughout}} the Middle Ages. The rich farmlands {{which it had}} received from Ela ensured it a <b>sizeable</b> income from wool.|$|E
5|$|Australia started poorly, and Davidson made a duck as the {{tourists}} were dismissed for 190. Davidson then took 3/67, removing Pullar, May and Subba Row as England took a <b>sizeable</b> 177-run lead.|$|E
5|$|The British Indian Ocean Territory {{currently}} has no permanent population {{although there is}} a <b>sizeable</b> population who were born in the BIOT but currently live in Mauritius and the United Kingdom and so would be eligible to compete on birth criteria.|$|E
5|$|A fleet was {{necessary}} for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a <b>sizeable</b> one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak of war with Japan, and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.|$|E
5|$|A <b>sizeable</b> {{portion of}} the Russian 58th Army, one of the {{foremost}} military units in Russia, was included in the Russian order of battle. It exceeds the Georgian Army in the number of troops, heavy hardware and planes. The 58th Army fought in Second Chechen War.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Canada {{is home to}} many sign languages, some {{of which}} are Indigenous. American Sign Language (ASL) is spoken across the country due to the {{prevalence}} of ASL in primary and secondary schools. Due to its historical relation to the francophone culture, Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is spoken primarily in Quebec, although there are <b>sizeable</b> Francophone communities in New Brunswick, Ontario and Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a <b>sizeable</b> proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|England never seriously {{threatened}} {{to reach the}} victory target of 442 runs, which would have comfortably broken the world record for a fourth-innings run chase. Allan Lamb added to his reputation for mastering fast bowling with a defiant 113, but it was <b>sizeable</b> contributions from the tail and extras that took England to a respectable total of 307 – but a bad defeat by 134 runs.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Nepalis, {{who settled}} in the region during British rule, {{comprise}} the majority of Gangtok's residents. Lepchas, native to the land, and Bhutias also constitute a <b>sizeable</b> portion of the populace. Additionally, {{a large number of}} Tibetans have immigrated to the town. Immigrant resident communities not native to the region include the Marwaris, who own most of the shops; the Biharis, who are employed in mostly blue collar jobs and the Bengalis.|$|E
5|$|George Koval's father, Abram Koval, {{left his}} home town of Telekhany in Belarus to immigrate to the United States in 1910. Abram, a carpenter, settled in Sioux City, Iowa, which {{at the turn of}} the 20th century was home to a <b>sizeable</b> Jewish {{population}} of merchants and craftsmen. He and his wife Ethel Shenitsky Koval raised three sons: Isaya, born 1912; George (or Zhorzh), born Christmas 1913; and Gabriel, born 1919.|$|E
5|$|Hinduism is {{the largest}} {{religion}} in Mangalore, with Devadiga, Mogaveera, Billavas, Ganigas, Bunts, Kota Brahmins, Shivalli Brahmins, Havyaka Brahmins, Sthanika Brahmins, Goud Saraswat Brahmins (GSBs), and Chitpavan Brahmins are the major communities in Hindus. Christians form a <b>sizeable</b> section of Mangalorean society, with Mangalorean Catholics accounting for the largest Christian community. Protestants in Mangalore typically speak Kannada. Anglo-Indians were {{also part of the}} Mangalorean Christian Community.|$|E
5|$|In 1628 he sailed {{again for}} Newfoundland, {{this time with}} his second wife Jane, most of his children, and 40 more settlers, to officially take over as Proprietary Governor of Avalon. He and his family moved into the house at Ferryland built by Wynne, a <b>sizeable</b> {{structure}} for the time, by colonial standards, {{and the only one}} in the settlement large enough to accommodate religious services for the community.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{reported}} that the soil of the park formed by the phumdis is highly acidic, with unsuitable pH conditions for many species of plants to grow and flourish. Further, the acidity of the soil has also adversely affected the fish breeding farms.s|accessdate=2009-04-04|author =Shaji K.A.|publisher= Udhakamandalam, Countercurrents.org}} Recent reports indicate that locals are slicing the phumdis into <b>sizeable</b> pieces and towing them with canoes to sell to fish culture owners.|$|E
5|$|Loved is a {{browser-based}} platform {{video game}} developed by Alexander Ocias, an Australian graphic designer and artist. Written in Adobe Flash, {{the game was}} built {{over the course of}} about half a year in Ocias' spare time. Released online on 14 June 2010 onto various game hosting websites, it has garnered <b>sizeable</b> praise and scrutiny since its release, with critics finding the game to be thought-provoking while having poor controls.|$|E
5|$|Mike Gatting was the {{incumbent}} England captain for the First Test at Trent Bridge. The {{result was a}} draw, with Graham Gooch and David Gower helping England to save the game {{from a position of}} weakness, after conceding a <b>sizeable</b> first-innings lead to the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Shepton {{benefits}} from a <b>sizeable</b> park, {{a gift of}} land from a local man, John Kyte Collett. As a boy he {{was thrown out of}} the grounds of local estates for trespass so in later life he purchased and gave land to the town to provide a public space; this park, which opened in 1906, is called Collett Park in his honour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sizeable</b> Maya populations {{existed in}} Petén before the conquest, {{particularly}} around the central lakes {{and along the}} rivers. Petén was divided into different Maya polities engaged in a complex web of alliances and enmities. The most important groups around the central lakes were the Itza, the Yalain and the Kowoj. Other groups with territories in Petén included the Kejache, the Acala, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Xocmo, the Chinamita, the Icaiche and the Manche Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj was a <b>sizeable</b> {{city with}} the {{principal}} architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.|$|E
5|$|The English {{county of}} Buckinghamshire is {{bisected}} by the Chiltern Hills, which rise sharply and cross the county from northeast to southwest. Although the fertile soil and good drainage of the Chilterns provides ideal conditions for farming, the steep hills historically made travelling difficult. Few <b>sizeable</b> settlements developed in Buckinghamshire, and what roads existed were of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|The November preview episode {{received}} 275,000 {{viewers and}} a 0.07 18–49 rating. The actual series premiere saw a <b>sizeable</b> {{rise in the}} ratings, with the 9:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. EST episodes performing relatively well by GSN's standards, earning 421,000 and 451,000 viewers respectively. On February 23, 2017, the show hit a series high with 500,000 viewers and a 0.13 18–49 rating.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} mostly low-lying (especially East Mainland) but with coastal cliffs {{to the north}} and west and two <b>sizeable</b> lochs: the Loch of Harray and the Loch of Stenness. The Mainland {{contains}} the remnants of numerous Neolithic, Pictish and Viking constructions. Four of the main Neolithic sites are included in the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, inscribed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{carries a}} considerable {{volume of traffic}} throughout the year; however, in the summer, its peak volume is nearly double the average, as traffic intensifies because of tourists travelling to Adriatic Sea resorts and back. Furthermore, the southernmost sections of the motorway serve Zagreb's <b>sizeable</b> suburban traffic.|$|E
5|$|The new {{gap between}} Hamilton and Massa in the Drivers' Championship {{after the race}} stood at fourpoints in Hamilton's favour. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren {{somewhat}} caught up on Ferrari, although {{the gap between the}} two teams was still <b>sizeable</b> at 19points. McLaren were ten points behind BMW coming into the race and the deficit was reduced to three due to the race result.|$|E
5|$|The touring batsmen then {{enjoyed the}} Lord's conditions, {{reaching}} 397 {{in their second}} innings, with <b>sizeable</b> contributions from Greenidge (103), Richards (72), Dujon (52) and Logie again, this time with an unbeaten 95, a match performance that secured him the award of Man of the match.|$|E
5|$|With unity as an {{essential}} teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an administration they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any Bahá'í divisions have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a <b>sizeable</b> following. The followers of such divisions are regarded as Covenant-breakers and shunned, essentially excommunicated.|$|E
5|$|Within {{days of the}} shooting, {{the police}} said they had {{received}} a <b>sizeable</b> number of tip-offs alerting them to suspicious photographs, videos, and comments on chat rooms. Finnish media reported that several bomb threats and other threatening messages were circulating among students nationwide in the {{few days after the}} shootings as well.|$|E
5|$|Almost every <b>sizeable</b> body {{of water}} in Scotland has an {{associated}} kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip {{have been seen as}} counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, {{it is evident that}} the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a <b>sizeable</b> centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} data to accurately estimate population sizes {{at the time}} of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that <b>sizeable</b> Maya populations existed in Petén, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Petén and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala. The Itza spoke a variety of Yucatecan Maya.|$|E
5|$|Among US-built battleships, Texas {{is notable}} for her <b>sizeable</b> number of firsts: the first US Navy vessel to house a {{permanently}} assigned contingent of US Marines, the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, the first US ship to control gunfire with directors and range-keepers (analog forerunners of today's computers), the first US battleship {{to launch an}} aircraft, from a platform on Turret 2, {{one of the first}} to receive the CXAM-1 version of CXAM production radar in the US Navy, the first US battleship to become a permanent museum ship, and the first battleship declared to be a US National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has no <b>sizeable</b> {{employers}} {{outside of}} the public sector, with most workers commuting to Dundee. Arbroath itself has an economically active population of 9,192 people, with the public sector (21.8%) the largest employer of Arbroath residents closely followed by the manufacturing (16%) and retail sector (15.4%). The fishing industry accounts for 0.4% (fewer than 50 people) although the processing sector is considered separately under manufacturing and the figure of 50 people relates directly to the catching and support sectors.|$|E
5|$|As most Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents, {{they seek}} a living through ad-hoc various {{industries such as}} the construction, recycling and prostitution industries or as street pedlars. Vietnamese that live along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong rivers are subsistence fishermen. A <b>sizeable</b> number of these stateless Vietnamese consisted of migrants that came to Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 during the UNTAC administration. The majority of Vietnamese still {{live below the poverty}} line, although {{a very small number of}} Vietnamese are represented in the Cambodian business sector. One example is Sok Kong, the head of the business conglomerate Sokimex which owns state concessionaires in the country's petroleum, tourism and entrepot industries.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression {{resulted}} in massive {{unemployment in the}} late 1920s and 1930s, more Japanese and Okinawans migrated to Palau. Immigrants brought along their families and sought employment in various professions. The Japanese immigrants held administrative posts, while the Okinawans and a few Koreans worked as labourers in the agricultural, fishery and mining industries. By 1935, the Japanese constituted at least 60% of Palau's population and were concentrated in urban areas such as Angaur and Koror. Some Japanese settlers took Palauan wives or mistresses, {{and there was a}} <b>sizeable</b> minority of mixed Japanese-Palauan children towards the later years of the Japanese administration.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{there are}} two major methods of {{producing}} isotopes of transplutonium elements: (1) irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of <b>sizeable</b> amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Both Calakmul and Tikal were <b>sizeable</b> Preclassic {{cities that}} survived into the Classic Period. Early hieroglyphic texts from stelae found in Structure 2 record the {{probable}} enthronement {{of a king}} of Calakmul in AD 411 and also records a non-royal site ruler in 514. After this there is {{a gap in the}} hieroglyphic records that lasts over a century, although the Kaan dynasty experienced a major expansion of its power at this time. The lack of inscriptions recording the events of this period may be either {{due to the fact that}} the Kaan dynasty was located elsewhere during this time or perhaps that the monuments were later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics who were still a <b>sizeable</b> minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E
