5|$|A Ghost Story for Christmas is a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> annual British short {{television}} films originally {{broadcast on}} BBC One between 1971 and 1978, and revived in 2005 on BBC Four. With one exception, the original instalments were directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and the films were all shot on 16mm colour film. The remit behind {{the series was}} to provide a television adaptation of a classic ghost story, in line with the oral tradition of telling supernatural tales at Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA is broken and then joined {{to the end of a}} different DNA molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied. Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E
50|$|Maze of Moonlight {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Gael Baudino in 1993. It is the second in the <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Starlight tetralogy. The other novels are <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Starlight, Shroud <b>of</b> Shadow, and <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Sunlight.|$|R
50|$|Shroud of Shadow {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Gael Baudino in 1994. It is the third in the <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Starlight tetralogy. The other novels are <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Starlight, Maze <b>of</b> Moonlight, and <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Sunlight.|$|R
50|$|<b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Starlight {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Gael Baudino and {{published}} in 1989. It {{is the first in}} the <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Starlight tetralogy. The other novels are Maze of Moonlight, Shroud <b>of</b> Shadow, and <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Sunlight.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} a number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that use RNA as their {{template}} for synthesis of a new <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> RNA. For instance, a number of RNA viruses (such as poliovirus) use this type of enzyme to replicate their genetic material. Also, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase {{is part of the}} RNA interference pathway in many organisms.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E

40|$|The {{composite}} R plasmid NR 1, its resistance {{transfer factor}} which specifies resistance to tetracycline (RTF-Tc component), and its r-determinants component were each denatured and centrifuged to equilibrium in CsCl density gradients containing polyuridylic acid-polyguanidylic acid. The complementary deoxyribonucleic acid <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> NR 1 and the complementary <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> the RTF-Tc component could be separated by this technique {{because of a}} threefold difference in polyuridylic acid-polyguanidylic acid binding to the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> the RTF-Tc component. The two <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> the r-determinants component bound equal amounts of polyuridylic acid-polyguanidylic acid. Hybridization <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid with in vivo-labeled ribonucleic acid from Proteus mirabilis containing NR 1 indicated that transcription within the RTF-Tc component is from the NR 1 strand which preferentially binds polyuridylic acid-polyguanidylic acid, whereas transcription within the r-determinants component is predominantly from the complementary strand...|$|R
40|$|The DNA <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> lambdoid phages with deletions or substitutions of the guanine plus cytosine-rich {{region in}} the left arm are not resolvable by {{complexing}} with poly UG followed by centrifugation in CsCl. This work describes a completely general procedure for the <b>strand</b> resolution <b>of</b> these phages by hybridization with fragments <b>of</b> separated <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> the parent phage. In particular, resolution <b>of</b> the DNA <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> the specialized transducing phage lambda-h 80 C 1 - 857 dargF is described, and evidence is presented which indicates that argF is transcribed from the r strand...|$|R
5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist {{at the end}} of an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Sunlight {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Gael Baudino in 1994. It is the fourth in the <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Starlight tetralogy. The other novels are <b>Strands</b> <b>of</b> Starlight, Maze of Moonlight, and Shroud of Shadow. Out of the four-book series, this book alone was not {{released}} in the UK market because, according to the author, the publishers believed [...] "that British readers won't {{have any interest in}} events set in contemporary Denver".|$|R
50|$|The arm-ring {{found with}} the body was made from {{waterlogged}} leather, <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> fibres and four bronze mounts. According to Louise Mumford of the National Museum, the leather ring was made with two <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> leather joined together through numerous small slits.|$|R
5000|$|The dsRNA {{then gets}} cut up by a Dicer into small (21-28 nt = {{nucleotides}} long) <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> miRNAs (microRNAs) or siRNAs (short interfering RNAs.) A Dicer is an endoribonuclease RNase, {{which is a}} complex of a protein mixed with <b>strand(s)</b> <b>of</b> RNA.|$|R
5|$|The first <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> {{the novel}} follows Hollis Henry, {{a former member}} of the early 1990s cult band The Curfew and a {{freelance}} journalist. She is hired by advertising mogul Hubertus Bigend to write a story for his nascent magazine Node (described as a European Wired) about the use of locative technology in the art world. Helped by curator Odile Richard she investigates Los Angeles artist Alberto Corrales, who recreates virtually the deaths of celebrities such as River Phoenix. Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' technical requirements. Chombo's background is troubleshooting navigation systems for the United States military. He is reclusive and paranoid, refusing to sleep in the same GPS grid square on consecutive nights, and only consents to talk to Hollis due to his admiration for The Curfew.|$|E
5|$|The human TBR1 gene {{is located}} on the q arm of the {{positive}} <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> chromosome 2. It is 8,954 base pairs in length. TBR1 is one of the three genes that make up the TBR1 subfamily of T-box genes. The two other genes that form the TBR1 subfamily are EOMES (also known as TBR2) and TBX21 (also known as T-BET). TBR1 is also known as T-box Brain Protein, T-Brain 1, and TES-56. The encoded protein consists of 682 amino acid residues and has a predicted molecular weight of 74,053 Da. It is composed of 6 exons.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and ligase activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E

5|$|With the Gregorian missionaries, a third <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> Christian {{practice}} {{was added to}} the British Isles, to combine with the Gaulish and the Hiberno-British strands already present. Although it is often suggested that the Gregorian missionaries introduced the Rule of Saint Benedict into England, there is no supporting evidence. The early archbishops at Canterbury claimed supremacy over all the bishops in the British Isles, but their claim was not acknowledged by {{most of the rest of}} the bishops. The Gregorian missionaries appear to have played no part in the conversion of the West Saxons, who were converted by a missionary sent directly by Pope Honorius I. Neither did they have much lasting influence in Northumbria, where after Edwin's death the conversion of the Northumbrians was achieved by missionaries from Iona, not Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Although the themes, {{events and}} {{characters}} of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, {{and there is no}} one canonical version; Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. Many elements and incidents that are now {{an integral part of the}} Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.|$|E
5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also monotypic, as {{it contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the growth on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> mycelium tethers the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E

5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E
5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E
