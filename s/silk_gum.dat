50|$|The cocoons are {{soaked in}} hot water in order to soften the sericin (also known as <b>silk</b> <b>gum)</b> which coat the fibres and stick the cocoons {{together}}. Silk threads are then unwound and reeled together to produce a single thread. Weavers at Angkor Silk Farm make both raw silk and fine silk {{that do not have}} the same texture at all. Sericin has not been completely removed from raw silk threads, which will give a rougher texture to the fabric at the end.|$|E
40|$|By {{employing}} finishing {{techniques to}} silk fabric alongside a shibori or resist process, areas of different densities can be formed within the cloth; creating textured, puckered and distorted effects. One process: salt shrinking is {{unknown in the}} western world but has evolved over the centuries within Japan. It is a tradition originally used for finishing silk crepe, where by soaking the fabric in seawater the silk fibres contracted to create more density. The effects tended to be unstable so today; calcium chloride or calcium nitrate solutions are now employed. A second process relies upon sericin or the <b>silk</b> <b>gum</b> present within a silk fibre to create texture. During the manufacturing the sericin is left on {{in order to protect the}} fibre but is then removed during scouring in order to create a soft lustrous fabric. With both processes if silk fabrics are patterned with shibori techniques, prior to the salt treatment or scouring, the resulting fabrics will contain, areas of different densities and texture with visible contrast occurring between the areas protected by the resists and those that were affected by the finishing. The textures that are produced are said to be almost permanent, but break down with severe washing...|$|E

From Norway, across and down the North Sea, in the Channel and throughout the Mediterranean and Red Sea, Allied sea and air power began slowly to bleed away Germany's supplies. In the first 7 days of October alone, the British Contraband Control detained, either by confiscating neutral cargoes or capturing German ships, 13,800 tons of petrol, 2,500 tons of sulphur, 1,500 tons of jute (the raw material from which hessian and burlap cloth is made), 400 tons of textiles, 1,500 tons animal feed, 1,300 tons oils and fats, 1,200 tons of foodstuffs, 600 tons oilseeds, 570 tons copper, 430 tons of other ores and metals, 500 tons of phosphates, 320 tons of timber and various other quantities of chemicals, cotton, wool, hides and skins, rubber, <b>silk,</b> <b>gums</b> and resins, tanning material and ore crushing machinery.|$|R

Besides the pictures there are marks, which are understood to represent certain things. These picture dispatches are made in the form of rolls, or books.

50|$|After Anglo-Egyptian rule {{had been}} established, {{six of the}} {{formerly}} Jewish families chose to revert to Judaism. They were quickly joined by many more Jewish families who saw the economic opportunities of the developing country. From 1900 Jews {{from all over the}} Middle East and North Africa began to arrive in Sudan via Cairo and settle along the Nile in the four towns of Khartoum, Khartoum North, Omdurman and Wad-Medani. Predominantly small-time merchants of textiles, <b>silks</b> and <b>gum,</b> their businesses soon began to flourish. By 1926 the small synagogue they had quickly erected had been replaced by a brand new, self-funded building and several of its members owned large, successful business.|$|R

40|$|This report {{discusses}} black-colored silks from southeastern Asia {{that are}} {{often referred to as}} “gummed” silks. These silks are treated with iron-rich mud that coats the silk filaments and creates a deep black color (often in conjunction with a previous coloration). The report covers three areas. Firstly, I review various names used for black mud-treated silks and begin to contextualize the production and use region. Two mud-treated silk samples from early- 1930 s Southeast Asia are introduced in this discussion. Secondly, I initiate investigation into the role of mud-treated black silks in Chinese fashion history during the transition from the late-imperial era to twentieth-century modernity. Thirdly, the use of mud-treated silks in twenty-first-century fashion is highlighted. Context of Mud-Treated Silks “Gummed silk” is apparently a common euphemism for a variety of mud-treated or mud-coated silks. In the context of Asian black <b>silks,</b> <b>gummed</b> is not a reference to the raw state of silk filaments, but rather a general name for shiny black silk fabrics coated with tannin-rich mud. Jiāo-chou and xiang-yun-shā are the names most often employed in China to refer to slightly stiff bi-colored silks that are brownish-orange on one side and black on the other. Fashion designers, manufacturers, retailers, and authorities on textiles employ several other names for these bi-colored and other solid black mud-treated silks. For example, contemporary fashion designer Luiang Zi calls the bi-colored silks Liangchou. Other names for mud-treated silks include Canton silk, gambiered silk, Guangdong silk, lacquered silk, liang silk, Tang silk, and tea silk. The array of names suggests both a variety of southeastern Chinese and Southeast Asian ethnic groups making and using various mud-treated silk fabrics, and the imprecision in translating the names into English. To further confound clarity in researching or discussing these fabrics, codification of particular mud-treated silk textiles and their specific techniques and characteristics remains to be accomplished. Thus, to simplify terminology at this time, I employ the descriptive adjectives gummed (already widely applied) or mud-treated, as noted above) when referring to textiles from this broad category. For the bi-colored mud-treated silks from southeast China, I use jiāo-chou and xiang-yun-shā for plain and crepe weaves, and leno-weave, respectively...|$|R

In sooth, these graces have left me so far behind in foolery that I have not a jest left in my pouch! So here I be, while my Lord Cardinal is shut up with Madame d'Angouleme in the castle--the real old castle, mind you--doing the work, leaving the kings and queens {{to do their own}} fooling." ...|$|R
5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the <b>silk</b> protein, fibroin, <b>gummed</b> together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|R
40|$|This one-hour {{discussion}} {{panel will}} examine bi-colored black and brown silk textiles called chiao-chou and shiang-yin-sa, (a. k. a. black <b>gummed</b> <b>silk,</b> Canton silk, cloud perfumed silk, gambiered silk, and by other names). Little {{known in the}} West, these textiles express cultural identities associated with a specific geographic locals where the required mud treatment can take place. Thus, the textiles have primarily been made in southern China in Guangdong province and in Southeast Asia in Thailand and Vietnam where Chinese immigration occurred. Since their heyday during the Qing Dynasty (1644 – 1911), they faded from use. The panel first contextualizes the textiles and the culture surrounding them through a brief history and explanation of the dyeing method. Even though common people used them, chiao-chou and shiang-yin-sa demanded a high market value based on the silk fibers and lengthy dye process. Beyond precious monetary value, beliefs imbue the textiles, such as their benefit to health and well-being. The fabric also represents the unified cosmos, bringing together the earth, vegetation, water, and sun in material form. Members of the panel will examine {{the characteristics of the}} textiles––such as chemical properties and permeability to light and air––in relation to the senses and to the beliefs inhered in the textiles in the second section. Samples include contemporary and one-hundred-year-old pieces. The reemergence of these textiles comprises the third aspect of the discussion. Here the panel will examine recent marketing invoking the cultural beliefs while simultaneously promoting the silks as ecological and sustainable. The panel will close with discussion of the use of chiao-chou and shiang-yin-sa by fashion designers such as Vivienne Tam in the United States, in the 1990 s, and Bonnie Tchien Hy in Paris, currently...|$|R
