40|$|Pilot in-the-loop {{oscillation}} (PIO) is {{a phenomenon}} which occurs due to the dynamic interaction between pilot and aircraft. This detrimental aircraft handling quality appears {{through a variety of}} flight conditions and is very difficult to predict. Due to this complex behavior, PIO is not easily eliminated. This report describes a method of PIO analysis that is capable of examining multiple asymmetric nonlinearities acting simultaneously. PIO analyses are performed on a model based on the USAF NT- 33 A variable stability aircraft with nonlinearities including <b>stick</b> <b>position</b> <b>limiting,</b> elevator deflection limiting, and elevator rate limiting. These analyses involve the use of dual input describing functions which enable the prediction of frequency, amplitude, and mean point of oscillation. ii FOREWORD This effort is sponsored by the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division Contract N 60921 - 89 -D-A 239 (053).

Given the growing roles of liquidity and <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> in finance along with recent Wall Street legislation changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, we carry out studies to test how effectively price impact liquidity measures measure liquidity, whether <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> have impacts on market liquidity, and how optimal speculative <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> should be modeled, based on microstructure theories.

The motion of critical points, their <b>limiting</b> <b>positions</b> as the pole approaches the boundary and the differential geometry of the level lines of the Green's function are main themes in the paper. A unifying role is played by various affine and projective connections and corresponding Möbius invariant differential operators. In the doubly connected case the three Eisenstein series E_ 2, E_ 4, E_ 6 are used. A specific result is that a doubly connected domain is the disjoint union of the set of critical points of the Green's function, the set of zeros of the Bergman kernel and the separating boundary <b>limit</b> <b>positions</b> for these. At the end we consider the projective properties of the prepotential associated to a second order differential operator depending canonically on the domain. Comment: 63 page...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of limit equilibrium theory, the isoperimetric model of functional extremum regarding the seismic active earth pressure is deduced according to the variational method.

Based on the necessary conditions required {{for the existence of}} functional extremum, the function of the slip surface and the normal stress distribution on the slip surface is obtained, and the functional extremum problem is further converted into a function optimization problem with two undetermined Lagrange multipliers. The calculated results show that the slip surface is a plane and the seismic active earth pressure is minimal when the action point is at the lower <b>limit</b> <b>position.</b> As the action point moves upward, the slip surface becomes a logarithmic spiral and the corresponding value of seismic active earth pressure increases in a nonlinear manner.

The fusion-fission and the deep-inelastic components of the fragment yield have been extracted using multiple Gaussian functions from the experimental fragment energy spectra. The elemental yields of the fusion-fission component {{have been found to}} be fairly well exlained in the framework of standard statistical model. It is found that there is strong competition between the fusion-fission and the deep-inelastic processes at these energies. The time scale of the deep-inelastic process was estimated to be typically in the range of ∼ 10 ^- 21 - 10 ^- 22 sec., and it was found to decrease with increasing fragment mass. The angular momentum dissipations in fully energy damped deep-inelastic process have been estimated from the average energies of the deep-inelastic components of the fragment energy spectra.
