40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> on the physicochemical properties of wheat starch.

Change in starch properties arising from the interaction between were assessed for starch blue value, viscosity, solubility and retrogradation. In addition, the structure and thermodynamic properties of the modified starch were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Results: The properties of wheat starch changed greatly by adding different <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> to their structures. Starch containing 0. 30 % <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> had the lowest peak (2034 cps), trough (1331 cps), final (1896 cps), setback viscosities (565 cps), iodine value (0. 378), supernatant volume (76. 6 mL), and lower dissolution rate (0. 063 g).

40|$|International audienceA {{method has}} been {{developed}} for estimating the content in foods of the emulsifying additive E 473, <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> of fatty acids. The analytical approach taken to estimate the complex mixtures that comprise this additive involved, selective solvent extraction of the intact esters using a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate, alkaline hydrolysis of the esters to liberate sucrose, and then GC-MS measurement of the liberated sucrose using GC-MS after acidic hydrolysis to glucose and fructose and then silylation. The method was developed to aid future estimates of intake of this food additive. The method determines the total <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> content of a food sample and does not attempt to discrimination between individual <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> when present as a mixture in a food sample. A single (average) factor is used to convert the liberated sucrose content into sucrose ester content.

We have investigated the influence of these <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> on the in vitro diffusion profiles of lidocaine hydrochloride, a weak ionizable base (pKa= 7. 9), at different pH values, using porcine ear skin as the barrier membrane. As expected, lidocaine flux in the absence of an enhancer, increased from pH 5 to 9 with a corrresponding increase in the level of the unionized base. However, when skin was pretreated with 2 % laureate in Transcutol (2 % L-TC), drug permeation was higher at pH 5. 0 and 7. 0 than at 9. 0. A different trend was observed in experiments with 2 % oleate in Transcutol (2 % O-TC), where skin flux was maximal at a more basic pH, when the degree of ionization is low.

We {{also found that the}} Polysorbate 80 - and sucrose oleate-stabilized nanodispersions had the highest astaxanthin losses (i. e., the lowest astaxanthin contents in the final products) among the nanodispersions. This work demonstrated the importance of emulsifier type in determining the physicochemical characteristics of astaxanthin nano-dispersions...|$|E
5000|$|P&G is {{marketing}} its <b>sucrose</b> <b>ester</b> products {{under the}} brand [...] "Sefose" [...] {{for use as}} an industrial lubricant and paint additive. Because olestra is made by chemically combining sugar and vegetable oil, it releases no toxic fumes and could potentially become a safe and environmentally friendly replacement for petrochemicals in these applications. It is currently used {{as a base for}} deck stains and a lubricant for small power tools, and there are plans to use it on larger machinery.|$|R
30|$|Esters, {{acting as}} {{thickeners}} and emulsifiers, {{are widely used}} in the formulas of noodles and CSB. Numerous studies have reported that propylene glycol alginate (PGA) {{can be used for}} improving noodle quality. Yang et al. [67] carried out a research that PGA influences the acidity of wet noodles, property and texture. The water absorption, dough viscoelasticity, noodle hardness and elasticity were enhanced with the addition of PGA, its optimum adding amount was 0.3 %. This finding was confirmed by the research of Yang et al. [68] who also found that the optimum dosage of PGA in fresh noodle was 0.3 %. Liu et al. [69] investigated the effects of low-ester PGA on noodle quality. The results showed that low-ester PGA used in the noodles can effectively improve noodle quality; and when the content of low-ester PGA was between 0.2 and 0.3 %, the hardness, chewiness and glue viscosity of noodles were increased greatly; meanwhile, the water absorption and dissolution rate of starch were reduced; noodles had the best chewiness, smoothness, and taste. The fatty acid <b>sucrose</b> <b>ester</b> was also involved in noodle making, which showed that the cooking quality of middling noodles improved greatly when the noodles were added 1.5 % fatty acid <b>sucrose</b> <b>ester</b> [70].|$|R
30|$|Regarding CSB, {{calcium stearoyl lactylate}} (CSL), sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) and glyceryl {{monostearate}} (GMS) are widely applied in individual or composite ways for quality improvement. The optimum formulation for the best anti-aging was sodium stearyl lactate 0.15 %, {{glyceryl monostearate}} 0.05 %, <b>sucrose</b> <b>ester</b> of fatty acids 0.15 % [27]. Besides, the effects of diacetytartaric esters of monoglycerides (DATEM), CSL and SSL on CSB was investigated, which indicated that CSL–SL was beneficial to dough viscoelasticity; mixture of DATEM, CSL–SSL in flour decreased the dough extensibility while noodle whiteness was increased [71].|$|R
