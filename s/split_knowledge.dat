The paper develops a theoretical model that studies how firms optimally <b>split</b> <b>knowledge</b> between their headquarters and their production plants if communication costs impede the access of production plants to headquarter knowledge. The paper assumes that the foreign plants of multinational firms face higher communication costs with headquarters than their domestic plants, and shows that multinational firms therefore systematically assign more knowledge to both their foreign and domestic plants than non-multinationals. This helps explain why multinational firms pay higher wages to their production workers than non-multinational firms, and why their sales and their investment probability decrease across space.

If peer-to-peer technology {{is to be}} used in a business context, intermediary nodes might have an incentive not to adhere to the specified routing protocol if there is a benefit to be gained from doing so. We address the problem of rationality and self-interest in this context by hiding the content and the originator of messages from intermediary peer nodes. Consequently, rational nodes cannot selectively discriminate against messages originating from particular senders or messages with a specific content. Our proposal is based on the concept of <b>split</b> <b>knowledge,</b> where a message is split into two parts at its origin and these parts are then routed to the destination via two disjoint paths. We present a method of how this concept can be implemented in the CHORD peer-to-peer system.

" Fyodor Dostoevsky "Personality is only ripe when a man has made the truth his own. " Soren Kierkegaard This research has attempted to get an insight into the phenomenon of growing older with HIV. It attends the experience of the first aging HIV cohort and tries to understand what it means for the participants to grow older with this particular condition. The study was conducted using semi-structured interviews and data was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The participants were seven gay men and heterosexual woman age between 43 and 70 years of age. They were united by a history of living with HIV from some six to twenty-eight years in duration. Four superordinate themes emerged from the interview data. All the participants recognised the fact that they belonged to the first wave of long-term HIV survivors and their experience with growing older was collectively linked to anxieties of an unknown future. Participants reported stigma as an ongoing experience of living with HIV and were concerned that this stigma seemingly increased with age. Individual identities of the participants were affected by stigma and trauma of initial diagnosis. With increasing age these identities have a tendency to evoke a sense of ‘not belonging’. It seemed that participants were feeling difficulty with placing themselves contextually into wider society. The research unveils a various number of coping strategies of the participants, which includes <b>split,</b> <b>knowledge,</b> fantasy and spirituality. These were designed to increase a sense of internal Control and stabilise perceived disempowerment. In many cases, they were aiming to facilitate an escape from the harsh realities of HIV treatment. Although these strategies were initiated by the shock of the diagnosis, they haven’t seemed to have become redundant over the 13 years. To the contrary, participants seemed to be employing more coping strategies with increasing age. There is a link between the experience of the Past and Present and expectations of the Future. This has been elucidated in a separate chapter by using one generic account which seems to sum up the eight individual client stories. It is further argued that this study provides an insight into the lived experience of these individuals and can therefore be useful for advancing a therapeutic, counselling knowledge when working with this particular group...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSketches are an {{essential}} tool for designers. They allow the externalizing {{of ideas and}} are therefore economic cognitively. Sketches also provide the designer with new insights, which {{play an important role}} in the emergence of ideas. However, some studies tend to show that sketching does not systematically have a positive effect on idea generation. Our research thus aims to analyze the generative effects of sketches by studying the way sketches support the design strategy of designers. We especially focus on the role of knowledge in comparison with concepts. Three sequences of sketches are analyzed employing C–K design theory; we show that drawings refer to both concepts and knowledge, but mostly to knowledge. In particular, sketching helps the architect mobilize knowledge distant from the initial topic. Moreover, the designer carries out through sketching an important work of knowledge structuration that we call 'knowledge preordering'; by carefully selecting, testing and, if necessary, removing knowledge, the designer organizes a strategically built knowledge space. In particular, all elements involving modularity or determinism in the knowledge basis are abandoned. Such knowledge preordering thus allows the building of a <b>splitting</b> <b>knowledge</b> structure, which offers new rules for concept generation and enhances the production of original and disruptive ideas...|$|R

40|$|Investigating Plato’s ontological {{as well as}} {{epistemological}} {{status in}} each of his dialogues, this book is going to challenge the current theories of Plato’s development and suggest a new theory. Regarding the relation of Plato’s early and middle period dialogues, scholars have been divided to two opposing groups: unitarists and developmentalists. While developmentalists try to prove that there are some noticeable and even fundamental differences between Plato’s early and middle period dialogues, the unitarists assert that there is no essential difference in there. The main goal of the first two chapters is to suggest that some of Plato’s ontological as well as epistemological principles change, both radically and fundamentally, between the early and middle period dialogues. Though {{this is a kind of}} strengthening the developmentalistic approach corresponding the relation of the early and middle period dialogues, based on the fact that what is to be proved here is a essential development in Plato’ ontology and his epistemology, by expanding the grounds of development to the ontological and epistemological principles, it hints to a more profound development. The fact that the bipolar and <b>split</b> <b>knowledge</b> and being of the early period dialogues give way to the tripartite and bound knowledge and benig of the middle period dialogues indicates the development of the notions of being and knowledge in Plato’s philosophy before the dialogues of the middle period. The first chapter entitled “Plato’s Onto-Epistemological Principles in the Early Dialogues” tries to draw out six principles out of Plato’s early dialogues specially Euthyphro, Laches, Charmides, Hippias Major and Euthydemus. We discuss that these principles present kind of a bipolar as well as split ontology and epistemology. The second chapter, “Revision of First Socrates’ Principles in the Middle Period Dialogues”, aims to argue that the onto-epistemological principles of the early dialogues are being radically changed in three dialogues of Meno, Phaedo and Republic in the middle period dialogues. Not only the bipolar ontology and epistemology of the early dialogues give place to a tripartite ontology and epistemology but also their split being and knowledge are inclined to be replaced by bound being and knowledge. Our next step in this book is to suggest a new approach to Plato’s theory of being in Republic V and Sophist based on the notion of difference and the being of a copy. To understand Plato’s ontology in these two dialogues we are going to suggest a theory we call Pollachos Esti; a name we took from Aristotle’s pollachos legetai both to remind the similarities of the two structures and to reach a consistent view of Plato’s ontology. Based on this theory, when Plato says that something both is and is not, he is applying difference on being which is interpreted here as saying, borrowing Aristotle’s terminology, 'is is (esti) in different senses'. I hope this paper can show how Pollachos Esti can bring forth not only a new approach to Plato’s ontology in Sophist and Republic but also a different approach to being in general. Thence, chapter three, “Pollachos Esti; Plato’s Ontology in Sophist and Republic”, intends to discuss that i) the theories of ‘being as difference’ and ‘being of a copy’, considered together in what we call the theory of pollachos esti, can well be compared to the structure of pollachos legetai in Aristotle when it is attached to the theories of pros hen and substance; and ii) the ontology of Republic V-VII is based on this theory and is, thus, almost the same as the ontology of Sophist. Investigating the most famous chronologies of the last 150 years from Campbell on, the fourth chapter, “The Standard Chronology of the Dialogues”, is to argue that all of them have a somewhat fix and dogmatic arrangement of Plato’s dialogues in which Meno, Phaedo and Republic are located after some early dialogues and before Theaetetus and Parmenides, on the one hand, and all the so-called late period dialogues after Theaetetus and Parmenides on the other hand. It is also reminded that all that the stylometric evidences can show is the lateness and homogeneity of the late period dialogues and, thence, nothing about the relation between dialogues like Theaetetus, Parmenides and Republic. The standard chronology is the subject of many criticisms some of which are discussed in our fifth chapter, “Objections against the Standard Chronology”, in three groups. While the first group of objections criticizes the place of the middle period dialogues immediately after the early ones, the second group attacks the place of late dialogues after the middle ones. The third group includes objections against the place of Parmenides in the standard chronology and tries to show that it cannot be considered after the middle period dialogues. The efforts of the first five chapters lead to a new theory of Plato’s ontological as well as epistemological development in an onto-epistemological chronology of his dialogues in our sixth chapter, “An Onto-Epistemological Chronology of Plato’s dialogues”. Instead of three periods, this chronology includes four waves of dialogues, Socratic wave, ontological wave, epistemological wave and political wave, in which all the so-called middle and late period dialogues are to be interpreted based on the problems presented in Parmenides I. The main changes we suggest in the standard chronology include firstly that Theaetetus and Parmenides I must be posited before Meno and Phaedo and, secondly, Republic must be posited after Sophist. Based on this arrangement, we can find Philosophos, Plato’s promised but unwritten dialogue, inside Republic...|$|E

40|$|Recent policy {{analysis}} {{has had a}} growing interest in examining the everyday practices of policy work. Despite this, conceptions of what policy can and should encompass tend {{to be focused on}} its tangible outputs and products, in particular the texts and documents of policy and governance. Policy’s legitimacy is commonly considered to rest on its participants’ ability to make rational decisions motivated not by private reasons but by the public good. This has had serious implications for scholars’ ability to discuss the non-purposive, nonverbal and non-rational content in policy work. This thesis presents an ethnographic study of emotion in the context of policy work. Starting from informants’ own understandings of what emotion means in policy and politics, it focuses on a fifteen month period in the policy practices of a Scottish NGO and its stakeholders and participants. From the perspective of a participant observer policy worker, it uses observation, documents, and interviews to explore the way traditionally “rational” models of governance based on apparently objective knowledge and other non-rational, “caring” ways of knowing are brought to bear upon policy work through detailed examination of practice. Analysis of these practices begins by examining the way that informants described the anxieties caused by competing understandings of “good” governance. Emotion and rationality were considered mutually exclusive but equally essential components of policy making. This thesis proposes that the way these anxieties were managed by the Partnership’s policy participants was to split these incommensurable expectations of governance between two self-identifying groups: activists such as community organisers and professionals such as civil servants. <b>Splitting</b> <b>knowledge</b> in this way helped the wider policy making community to maintain their own sense of legitimacy and moral integrity while making use of “dangerous” knowledge...|$|R

Also person receives education {{for the sake of the}} future of public recognition, which will provide access to a number of material and spiritual wealth, will provide the foundation for future family and other personal projects. Finally, carrying out a preliminary examination of values that have relevance to education can not be ignored and the values that formally belong to other spheres of social life and other social systems – economic, political, legal, religious, aesthetic, etc. values substantially, although and each in its own way, to motivate education. Cognitive foundations of teaching epistemology reveal its core – that can determine its internal goal, which is the knowledge as a educational material. Scholar, teacher and specialist practices operating information that coincides only partially. You should refer to the image of "black box" for that what happens inside is unclear, but clearly know that you must provide the "input" to the "black box" in order to get something that is expected. For pedagogy what is happening in science remains a "black box" incomprehensible to the end of the procedure, but the teacher rightly expects that the results of these procedures will give the result to be useful for education – what is commonly called the scientific data. Furthermore, for practitioners are not always clear operations that makes a teacher, they are to them as the "black box", but the result – professionally educated person who is ready to begin practice in a particular area and has the necessary professional competence. Thus, the "output" of each language game should be information that is required for the following language games – at least when talking about the pedagogy from the cognitive point of view. If we consider the educational process as a "black box" that can be considered its "input" scientific evidence, and "output" – professional competence. And as the very education system decides what constitutes appropriate scientific data, so only the future employer decides what constitutes adequate professional competence. Thus, the "input" should be such technologization on the principles to be agreed between science and education, the "output" – between education and the requirements of professional practice, and only inside the educational process are used purely educational technology. It should rather talk about the different principles and methods for technologization at various stages of training. Dealing with different contexts of application knowledge, we have different ways to formalize it, including the use of various applications of computer processing. Only by defining the following general settings formalize knowledge, you can successfully apply the techniques of informatization of educational process. Due to a clear outline boundaries of formalization one can carry a total computerization of learning, not just segmental, occasional use of information technology. It should be then reformatting all the educational material, making it more analytically organized. Actually, one can talk about pedagogy as logic that operates on specific variables to be only the rules of coordination, adherence and submission.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the methodology {{and the results}} of check-ing consistency of the knowledge base of CADIAG- 2, a large-scale med-ical expert system. Such knowledge base consists of a large collection of rules representing knowledge about various medical entities (symptoms, signs, diseases [...] .) and relationships between them. The major portion of the rules are uncertain, i. e., they specify to what degree a medical entity is confirmed by another medical entity or a combination of them. Given the size of the system and the uncertainty it has been challenging to vali-date its consistency. Recent attempts to partially formalise CADIAG- 2 ’s knowledge base into decidable Gödel logics have shown that, on that for-malisation, CADIAG- 2 is inconsistent. In this paper we verify this result with an alternative, more expressive formalisation of CADIAG- 2 as a set of probabilistic conditional statements and apply a state-of-the-art probabilistic logic solver to determine satisfiability of the knowledge base and to extract conflicting sets of rules. As CADIAG- 2 is too large to be handled out of the box we describe an approach to <b>split</b> the <b>knowledge</b> base into fragments that can be tested independently and prove that such methodology is complete (i. e., is guaranteed to find all conflicts). With this approach we are able to determine that CADIAG- 2 contains numerous sets of conflicting rules and compute all of them for a slightly relaxed version of the knowledge base. ...|$|R
40|$|The SITAR project, {{designed}} {{to implement the}} GIS Archaeology of Rome, was started in 2007 by the Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Roma (SSBAR). The {{starting point for the}} SITAR project was the SSBAR requirement to digitize and manage a large quantity of administrative and scientific data concerning Cultural Heritage. This project was developed at a crucial point in which the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities was rethinking the Territorial Information System, the data standardization and data sharing system used in the past decades. It was the input to the new institutional Open Approach. This aspect is apparent in the proposed SITAR data model, whose linearity is applied in the same basic logical levels already identified and well-structured information architecture of the System and those that will be tested. The additional advantage of SITAR is precisely the possibility of <b>splitting</b> archaeological <b>knowledge</b> into these core levels and reassembling it under the guidance of those who have the tools and scientific knowledge to do so. The SSBAR aspires to the creation of an archaeological ‘cadastre’ of Rome which is an approved and certified basis created according to information on legal and administrative aspects of archaeological science. In addition, the comparison with other institutions actively engaged in testing new multimedia technologies applied to cultural heritage has encouraged the evolution of SITAR to 3 D data modeling and the development of procedures to test the archaeological potential...|$|R
40|$|When {{reasoning}} with {{implicitly defined}} contexts or theories, a general notion of proof in context is more appropriate than classical uses of reflection rules. Proofs in a multicontext framework {{can still be}} carried out by switching to a context, reasoning within it, and exporting the result. Context switching however does not correspond to reflection or reification but involves changing the level of nesting of theory within another theory. We introduce a generalised rule for proof in context and a convenient notation to express nesting of contexts, which allows us to carry out reasoning in and across contexts in a safe and natural way. 1 Introduction A general notion of relativised truth can be useful for reasoning in and about different theories in a formal setting.

40|$|Default {{logic is}} {{computationally}} expensive. One {{of the most}} promising ways of easing this problem and developing powerful implementations is to split a default theory into smaller parts and compute extensions in a modular, "local" way. This paper compares two recent approaches, Turner's splitting and Cholewinski's stratification. It shows that the approaches are closely related [...] in fact the former {{can be viewed as a}} special case of the latter. 1 Introduction Default logic (Reiter 1980) is one of the most prominent approaches of nonmonotonic reasoning, since it provides a formal theory of reasoning based on default rules. One of the main problems with its applicability is that it is computationally harder than classical logic (Marek and Truszczynski 1993, Gottlob 1992), which makes the implementation of powerful systems difficult. A possible solution to this problem might be to <b>split</b> the available <b>knowledge</b> into smaller parts, and to apply default reasoning in a local way. This idea [...] ...|$|R

According to Ibn Khallikan, he received the nickname [...] "al-Baqir" [...] (the ample) due to the [...] "ample fund of knowledge" [...] he collected. However, Ya'qubi believed that he was called al-Baqir because he [...] "split open knowledge", examining its depths. The Shiites believe that Baqir al-'ilm was not an ordinary title, because it was given to him by Muhammad. According to al-Kulayni, Muhammad's only living companion Jabir ibn Abd Allah would sit in the mosque and cry: [...] "Ya baqir al-ilm, Ya baqir al-ilm". Although Medinans thought that Jabir was insane, he assured them that Muhammad had told him: [...] "O Jabir! You will meet a man from my family who will have the same name and the same characteristics as mine. He will <b>split</b> open <b>knowledge</b> extensively." [...] According to al-Kulayni, Jabir ibn Abd Allah met al-Baqir when passing a Quran school. Abd Allah saw that the imam was still a child, and examined him to see if he had the features which Muhammad had described. Jabir asked, [...] "Characteristics of the Messenger of Allah; by Him in whose hands is my soul, O boy, what is your name?"
