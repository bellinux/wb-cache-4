50|$|Affiliated {{with the}} Disciples of Christ, {{the school was}} founded in 1894 by Mattie F.

Mattie Carr financed {{the construction of the}} main building <b>by</b> <b>sale</b> 250 <b>lots</b> at $200 each in Sherman. The school opened in September of that year and Mattie Carr successfully ran the school until her death in 1908, and Mr. Carr carried on as president until his death in 1913. The school was then run by the local churches of the Disciples of Christ. In 1914 Carlton College, itself founded in Fannin County, Texas in 1866, merged into Carr-Burdette College. By 1929 declining enrollment and troubled finances led the school to close. Ten years later, in April 1939, the property was sold and the two brick buildings were razed.|$|R

50|$|New {{regulations}} for {{the elections of}} the doge introduced in 1268 remained in force {{until the end of}} the republic in 1797. Their object was to minimize as far as possible the influence of individual great families, and this was effected by a complex electoral machinery. Thirty members of the Great Council, chosen <b>by</b> <b>lot,</b> were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to nine; the nine chose forty and the forty were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to twelve, who chose twenty-five. The twenty-five were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to nine and the nine elected forty-five. Then the forty-five were once more reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to eleven, and the eleven finally chose the forty-one who actually elected the doge. None could be elected but by at least twenty-five votes out of forty-one, nine votes out of eleven or twelve, or seven votes out of nine electors. A detailed description of this process, and the ceremonial procession that followed, is preserved in Martin Da Canale's work Les Estoires de Venise (English translation by Laura K.
