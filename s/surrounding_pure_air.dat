40|$|The {{specific}} heat and {{heat of fusion}} of sea ice in the temperature range between the freezing point and- 8 °C, computed from fairly accurate equations, were illustrated in figures and in tables. These quantities are defined {{on the basis of}} thermal and phase equilibrium conditions between the brine and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>pure</b> ice. From this point of view, simple preliminary experiments were undertaken to determine whether the equilibrium is nearly always maintained or not. It was found from the experiments that a fairly large temperature difference between the brine and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>pure</b> ice appears quickly with a rapid change of ice temperature and then disappears gradually.
