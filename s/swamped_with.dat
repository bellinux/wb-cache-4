5|$|In December 1930, Einstein visited America for {{the second}} time, {{originally}} intended as a two-month working visit as {{a research fellow at}} the California Institute of Technology. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the U.S., he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama {{elected president}} and his junior staffers working in the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a Passover Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> callers seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of Passover to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the first night of Passover with their families. About 20 guests sat around a table in the Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, recited the Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E
5|$|Early {{work was}} {{promising}} {{and by the}} fall of 1976 the project was building momentum. Fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with 400,000 letters, influencing President Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise. Bryant and Scott's proposal became the first accepted by the studio in October; Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and producers were <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> grateful fan mail. By the start of 1977 the project's official title was changed to Star Trek—The Motion Picture (a title reapplied to the eventually released 1979 film). The elation was short-lived; the first draft of the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and pressure was mounting for Paramount to either begin production or cut its losses and cancel the project. Producer Jerry Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators to complement the script.|$|E

5|$|With Jock in {{increasingly}} {{poor health}} after the war, the Smith family briefly considered sending Ian {{to start a}} life in the United States {{with the help of}} Jock's brother Elijah, who had become a prosperous New York businessman. Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however, and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodesia in early-1946 to find the campus <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> veterans like himself—there were 400 of them out of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university's ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and Chairman of the students' representative council. He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying it would be one administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the Vaal Dam south of Johannesburg, upstaging the well-fancied Wits crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity honours for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do so. At the end of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree ("by some miracle", he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at Gwebi Agricultural College, near Salisbury.|$|E

25|$|Turner was {{something}} of an invalid from 1904 onwards. Nonetheless, in 1906, at age 81, Turner, was still personally supervising work at his shipyard, and found himself suddenly <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> work following the San Francisco earthquake.

25|$|When a {{real-world}} airline is {{created in the}} image of a virtual airline, legal issues can arise out of copyright violations. In 2003, a real world airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, announced a new low-cost carrier by the name of Jetstar Airways. However, a virtual airline named Jetstar International Airlines already existed, complete with a web site. As part of their startup promotion, Qantas sold 100,000 airline tickets at a discount price, and the virtual airline's web site was <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> would-be customers, job-seekers, and prospective vendors. The virtual airline sued Qantas, claiming that Qantas stole the virtual airline's livery and trademark. The matter was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.|$|E

25|$|Warren's biggest {{difficulty}} was the Jack the Ripper case. He was criticised {{for failing}} {{to track down the}} killer and faced press accusations that were frequently baseless. He was accused of failing to offer a reward for information, although in fact he supported the idea and it was blocked by the Home Office. He was accused of not putting enough police officers on the ground, whereas in fact Whitechapel was <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> them.. He was accused of being more interested in uniformed policing than detective work, which was true, but failed to take into consideration the fact that he allowed his experienced detective officers to conduct their own affairs and rarely interfered in their operations. He was accused of not using bloodhounds, and when he did eventually bring them in, he was accused of being obsessed with them.|$|E
500|$|When NEMS was <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> {{offers of}} {{endorsements}} from America following {{the success of}} [...] "I Want To Hold Your Hand", Epstein, who was usually meticulous in matters involving the Beatles, decided to delegate this responsibility as {{he felt it was}} distracting him from his main task of managing his expanding roster of artists. He then asked Jacobs, his London-based, Hove-living celebrity lawyer (Jacobs's other clients included Marlene Dietrich, Diana Dors, Judy Garland, Liberace and Laurence Harvey) to appoint someone specifically to take over the assignment and gave Jacobs power of attorney in the matter. Jacobs at first handed the daily management of this to his chief clerk, Edward Marke, but it transpired that Marke knew almost nothing about the merchandising business, and so Jacobs was forced to look [...] elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Despite this {{positive}} publicity, {{the jury}} was persuaded by Jacobs' testimony and frightened by Goldman's politics. The assistant District Attorney questioned Goldman about her anarchism, {{as well as her}} atheism; the judge spoke of her as [...] "a dangerous woman". She was sentenced to one year in the Blackwell's Island Penitentiary. Once inside she suffered an attack of rheumatism and was sent to the infirmary; there she befriended a visiting doctor and began studying medicine. She also read dozens of books, including works by the American activist-writers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau; novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne; poet Walt Whitman, and philosopher John Stuart Mill. When Goldman was released after ten months, a raucous crowd of nearly 3,000 people greeted her at the Thalia Theater in New York City. She soon became <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> requests for interviews and lectures.|$|E

500|$|Selling the ZX81 {{over the}} counter was seen as {{something}} of a gamble and Rowland's colleagues were initially unenthusiastic about the scheme. Branch buyers thought that the ZX81 was unlikely to sell more than 10–15 units per branch at launch. Rowland himself thought that the ZX81 would sell about 10,000 units during the first five months of the retail agreement, equivalent to one month's mail order sales by Sinclair. In the event, the ZX81 was a massive success for Smith's, it went on sale for £99 making it the first home PC in the UK to retail for under £100. The [...] "Computer Know-How" [...] sections were <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> eager customers, overwhelming the 300 staff who had been trained to demonstrate the machines; a Financial Times correspondent wrote of being [...] "dazed and bewildered by the crowds of schoolchildren clustered round the ZX81 in your local branch of W.H. Smith." [...] Within a year, Smith's had sold 350,000 ZX81s, making an estimated net profit of £10 million. Sales of peripherals, software, books and magazines netted even more profit.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the general}} feeling {{around the league}} was that the {{punishment}} {{could have been more}} severe. Detroit Red Wings general manager Jack Adams said that Campbell [...] "could do no less" [...] and [...] "I thought he would be suspended until January 1 of next season." [...] Red Wings forward Ted Lindsay, whom the league had disciplined earlier the same season for an incident in Toronto in which he attacked a Maple Leafs fan who had been threatening teammate Gordie Howe, expressed the stronger opinion that Richard was lucky not to get a life suspension: [...] "In baseball, football or almost anything else that much would be almost automatic. I say they should have suspended him for life." [...] Bruins president Walter A. Brown agreed with Adams, saying [...] "That's the least they could do"; Bruins player Fleming Mackell said, [...] "If they had thrown the book at Richard in [...] when he cut Bill Ezinicki and Vic Lynn, it might have stopped him and made him an even greater hockey player because of it." [...] Interest was high in the hockey world; the Detroit Free Press reported its switchboard was <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> calls.|$|E
500|$|After Virginia, {{most other}} Confederate ironclads had at best limited success, {{and many were}} {{complete}} failures. Particularly embarrassing were four that were contracted to be built for service on the Mississippi River. Of the four, only one, , entered into combat {{in the way that}} was intended, with full crew and under steam. Of the others, [...] was destroyed on the stocks; [...] was hastily launched and then burned to avoid capture; and [...] was used merely as an ineffectual floating battery at the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, when the fate of New Orleans was decided, and she was then blown up rather than be surrendered. No parties in the Confederacy acquitted themselves well in the three losses, but Mallory must bear {{a large part of the}} blame. Poor administration is among the foremost reasons for the delays that hindered completion of the vessels. By failing to prioritize their construction, he allowed Louisiana and Mississippi to compete for scarce resources. Because he did not delegate responsibility, he was <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> details of the construction of Virginia while letting problems concerning the other ships go unresolved. And because he accepted the role implicitly assigned to his service as secondary to the Army, the Navy had to work with only the materials and funds that were left over after the Army had satisfied its needs.|$|E

500|$|At the lighthouse, Mr. Briscoe {{decides to}} brave the storm in a landing craft, but is {{immediately}} <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> water and {{carried by the}} tide towards the mainland. After Castro avails himself of {{the services of a}} prostitute, he rampages around the property searching for Picasso. The storm crashes through the inn. A guest is killed by a billiards table that falls on top of him and is dragged off into the sea. Mr. Glowery is also dragged off into the sea by the storm. Castro and his assistant round up the guests and interrogate them about the location of the $1.5 million Picasso stole. In another part of the inn a fire starts. Finally, Mr. Briscoe shows up and kills Castro's assistant before knocking Castro unconscious. While Hawthorne learns his wife is leaving him for the prostitute, the inn becomes completely engulfed in flames. Picasso, Hawthorne, and Briscoe motor a lobster boat over to the lighthouse, and dump Castro's dead assistant into the sea along with Castro himself, weighed down with two cinder blocks chained to his ankles. When they land on the island, Briscoe runs into the lighthouse and blows himself up. Amongst the rubble of the lighthouse, Picasso notices the inscription [...] "MORTE D'AUTHOR" [...] painted on one of the surrounding rocks and says to the innkeeper [...] "He's been thinking about this for some time, George." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 8 1976, Bryant and Scott {{delivered}} a twenty-page treatment entitled , which executives Barry Diller and Michael Eisner liked. In the treatment, Kirk {{and his crew}} encounter beings {{they believe to be}} the mythical Titans and travel back millions of years in time, accidentally teaching early man to make fire. Planet of the Titans also explored the concept of the third eye. With the studio's acceptance of this treatment Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and Isenberg were <b>swamped</b> <b>with</b> grateful fan mail. Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators. Key amongst these were famed production designer Ken Adam, who said that [...] "I was approached by Gene Roddenberry and we got on like a house on fire", and thus he was employed to design the film. In turn Adam employed artist Ralph McQuarrie fresh off the yet to be released Star Wars. They worked on designs for planets, planetary and asteroid bases, a black hole [...] "shroud", a crystalline [...] "super brain", and new concepts for the Enterprise, including interior concepts which Adam later revisited for the film Moonraker and a flat-hulled starship design (frequently credited to McQuarrie, but which McQuarrie's own art of book identifies as an Adam design). McQuarrie wrote that [...] "there was no script" [...] thus much of the work was [...] "winging it". When that film folded after three months for Adam and [...] "a month and a half" [...] for McQuarrie, their concepts were shelved, although a handful of them were revisited in later productions.|$|E
