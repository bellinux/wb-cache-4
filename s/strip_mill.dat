2500|$|With {{the rise}} of {{industrialisation}} and coalmining along the Neath valley, it no longer suited {{its role as a}} fashionable and picturesque residence. In the 20th century Rheola was the home of Col J. Edwards Vaughan at least until 1926. In 1939 the estate was bought by the British Aluminium Company, [...] who used the house as offices, and built an aluminium smelting plant on a large plot between the house and road. Aluminium smelting requires large amounts of electricity, and the original plan had been to use locally produced electricity, generated with local coal supplies. However World War II broke out before the generators were imported from Switzerland, so the smelting plant attempted to run using national grid electricity, and this was discontinued by 1943. The factory was then in use as a <b>strip</b> <b>mill.</b> The industrial activity had involved an area of hardstanding covering almost , which then was used for screening coal from the nearby coalmines. By 1981 it had ceased to be needed for coal screening, and the estate was sold to local construction and demolition company RM Rees. The industrial buildings were used for architectural salvage and a weekly market. The house was in serious decline, as were the grade II listed stables and coach house.|$|E

5000|$|The Detroit mill {{initially}} {{consisted of}} a small reversing hot rolling <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> with a slab heating furnace. The original hot <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> {{was known as the}} [...] "Coffee Grinder" [...] from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.|$|E

50|$|Despite this blow, the {{industry}} continued, {{but on a}} smaller scale. Nevertheless, there were still 518 mills in operation in 1937, including 224 belonging to Richard Thomas & Co. However the traditional 'pack mill' had been overtaken by the improved 'strip mill', of which the first in Great Britain was built by Richard Thomas & Co. in the late 1930s. <b>Strip</b> <b>mills</b> rendered the old pack mills obsolete and the last of them closed in about the 1960s.|$|R

50|$|The <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> {{was a major}} innovation, {{with the}} first being erected at Ashland, Kentucky in 1923. This {{provided}} a continuous process, cutting out the need to pass the plates over the rolls and to double them, as in a pack mill. At the end the strip was cut with a guillotine shear or rolled into a coil. Early (hot rolling) strip mills did not produce strip suitable for tinplate, but in 1929 cold rolling began {{to be used to}} reduce the gauge further. The first <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> in the United Kingdom was opened at Ebbw Vale in 1938 with an annual output of 200,000 tons.|$|E

50|$|Tinplate made via {{hot-dipped}} {{tin plating}} {{is made by}} cold rolling steel or iron, pickling to remove any scale, annealing to remove any strain hardening, and then coating it with {{a thin layer of}} tin.
