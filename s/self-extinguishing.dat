50|$|High partial {{pressures}} of oxygen greatly increase fire hazard, and many materials which are <b>self-extinguishing</b> in atmospheric air will burn continuously {{in a high}} oxygen concentration.|$|E
50|$|In many {{locations}} mattresses are now {{treated with}} fire retardant or built with fire-resistant material. Many new foams <b>self-extinguish.</b> This {{is the most}} common use of chemical fire retardancy.|$|R
50|$|Fault current can {{be limited}} by using current {{limiting}} devices such as grounding resistors or fuses. If the fault current is limited to 5 amperes or less, then many ground faults <b>self-extinguish</b> and do not propagate into phase-to-phase faults.|$|R
50|$|The {{fabric is}} {{composed}} of very stable polymers that do not react with other substances, and therefore, <b>self-extinguishes</b> when exposed to fire. The fabric does not melt or drip — which ensures that the fabric will not stick to skin and or intensify injury.|$|R

50|$|FR-4 (or FR4) is a grade {{designation}} {{assigned to}} glass-reinforced epoxy laminate sheets, tubes, rods and {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs). FR-4 is a composite material composed of woven fiberglass cloth with an epoxy resin binder that is flame resistant (<b>self-extinguishing).</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{cars have}} {{security}} cameras installed, {{just like the}} new Stockholm metro cars; this can contribute to increased security. Naturally, other safety details have also been carefully worked out, not least fire safety, {{with the use of}} non-inflammable and <b>self-extinguishing</b> materials.|$|E
50|$|Fire-resistant cigarettes, which {{reduce the}} risk of fire from {{unattended}} cigarettes, are made with special paper that includes a plastic compound, ethylene vinyl acetate. If a cigarette made with this type of paper is left unattended, the plastic in the paper will help the cigarette <b>self-extinguish.</b>|$|R
50|$|Polyesters as {{thermoplastics}} {{may change}} shape after {{the application of}} heat. While combustible at high temperatures, polyesters tend to shrink away from flames and <b>self-extinguish</b> upon ignition. Polyester fibers have high tenacity and E-modulus as well as low water absorption and minimal shrinkage in comparison with other industrial fibers.|$|R
40|$|A {{test program}} was {{performed}} to determine the highest pressure in oxygen where materials used in the planned NASA Constellation Program Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Crew Module (CM) would not propagate a flame if an ignition source was present. The test methodology used {{was similar to that}} previously used to determine the maximum oxygen concentration (MOC) at which self-extinguishment occurs under constant total pressure conditions. An upward limiting pressure index (ULPI) was determined, where approximately 50 percent of the materials <b>self-extinguish</b> in a given environment. Following this, the maximum total pressure (MTP) was identified; where all samples tested (at least five) <b>self-extinguished</b> following the NASA-STD- 6001. A Test 1 burn length criteria. The results obtained on seven materials indicate that the non-metallic materials become flammable in oxygen between 0. 4 and 0. 9 psia...|$|R
50|$|Phenylphosphine {{also have}} uses in polymer synthesis. Using radical initiations or UV irradiation, {{polyaddition}} of phenylphosphine to 1,4-divinylbenzene or 1,4-diisopropenylbenzene will form phosphorus-containing polymers, which have <b>self-extinguishing</b> properties. When mixed with flammable polymers such as polystyrene and polyethylene, the mixed polymer exhibits flame resistant properties.|$|E
5000|$|Polycarbonates are transparent, <b>self-extinguishing</b> materials. They possess {{properties}} like crystalline thermoplasticity, {{high impact}} strength, good thermal and oxidative stability. They {{can be used}} in machinery, auto-industry, and medical applications. For example, the cockpit canopy of F-22 Raptor is made of high optical quality polycarbonate.|$|E
5000|$|Aluminized boPET {{films are}} no longer used as thermal and {{acoustic}} insulation in aircraft since they {{were found to have}} been a factor in the Swissair Flight 111 crash. The accident investigation showed that the aluminum layer prevents the film from <b>self-extinguishing</b> in a fire under the conditions in aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Promoted-ignition {{testing of}} 3. 2 mm {{diameter}} aluminum rods in high purity oxygen was performed. The rod and detached drops of both <b>self-extinguished</b> and water quenched samples were examined using {{scanning electron microscopy}} and electron probe microanalysis to analyze the physical structure of the sample and gather compositional data. A comparison of the micrographs of <b>self-extinguished</b> and quenched samples reveals clear differences in the extent of melted and re-solidified (unreacted) material and {{the thickness of the}} oxide layer, highlighting the effect of cooling rate on the burning system. A qualitative physical model for the burning of bulk aluminum in gaseous oxygen is presented. The model, incorporating a molten drop growth and detachment cycle, is based on an initial heterogeneous burning phase leading to a second phase of combined heterogeneous and homogeneous burning...|$|R
5000|$|Kretek is {{very popular}} in rural areas as this type of {{cigarette}} is cheap. Kretek is known to burn slowly, and also <b>self-extinguish.</b> [...] Evidence seems to suggest oral lesions may be less common than with other cigarette types. Due to this effect, cigarette smoking has largely replaced betel chewing.|$|R
50|$|Another way to {{extinguish}} a fire is fuel removal. This {{can be accomplished}} by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel, by removing solid fuel in the path of a fire, or by allowing the fire to burn until all the fuel is consumed, at which point the fire will <b>self-extinguish.</b>|$|R
50|$|NEMA is the {{regulating}} {{authority for}} FR-4 and other insulating laminate grades. Grade designations for glass epoxy laminates are: G10, G11, FR4, FR5 and FR6. Of these, FR4 is the grade most widely in use today. G-10, the predecessor to FR-4, lacks FR-4's <b>self-extinguishing</b> flammability characteristics. Hence, FR-4 has since replaced G-10 in most applications.|$|E
5000|$|Fire safe cigarettes, {{abbreviated}} [...] "FSC", {{also known}} as lower ignition propensity (LIP), reduced fire risk (RFR), <b>self-extinguishing,</b> fire-safe or reduced ignition propensity (RIP) cigarettes, are cigarettes {{that are designed to}} extinguish more quickly than standard cigarettes if ignored, with the intention of preventing accidental fires. In the United States, [...] "FSC" [...] above the barcode signifies that the cigarettes sold are fire standards compliant (FSC).|$|E
50|$|A {{replacement}} 63 m Trimaran is {{now under}} construction in Banyuwangi, {{and is expected to}} be launched in early 2016. In the interim period, advances in infusable vinylester resin chemistry have seen the incorporation of nano particles into the resin. These particles aid the transfer of the resin through the carbon/glass fibre matrix and allow the use of fire retardant grade vinylester for infusion. This makes the carbon fibre composite structure of the new vessel <b>self-extinguishing.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Australia, around 14 {{people are}} claimed to die {{annually}} from cigarette related fires. The government has accepted the proposal for FSCs {{and is in}} the process of implementing regulations. Cigarette companies were required to change their products to ensure that cigarettes <b>self-extinguish</b> more readily before the regulations came into effect in March 2010.|$|R
30|$|We {{monitored}} {{ambient air}} temperature (°C), relative humidity (RH; %), and wind speed (m s− 1) during each burn using a Kestrel 4000 Weather Meter™ (Nielsen-Kellerman, Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, USA) positioned 1.3 m {{above the ground}} in a similar fuel type within 20 m of the plot. Weather was monitored every 30 seconds from ignition until flames had <b>self-extinguished.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{modacrylic}} has {{properties that}} are similar to an acrylic. However, modacrylics are flame retardant and do not combust. The fibers are difficult to ignite and will <b>self-extinguish.</b> In addition to a modacrylic's flame retardant properties it has a relatively high durability that is comparable to wool. Modacrylic fibers have a moderate resistance to abrasion and a very low tenacity.|$|R
50|$|Later in life he {{developed}} glaucoma and by 1943 was functionally blind. He would have poor health {{the rest of}} his life. Even so—in ill health and nearly blind—he continued to work on his inventions. One of his last was a <b>self-extinguishing</b> cigarette, which used a small plastic pellet filled with water placed just before the filter. He died on July 27, 1963 at the age of 86 and is buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.|$|E
50|$|All units {{work through}} an {{integrated}} system {{have been linked}} to control room hardware by the Custodian of the electronic archive Visual production equipped with the latest information technologies and secure its contain units of <b>self-extinguishing</b> The visual production is traded through the central organs between the units and the editing room is equipped with To link with ground stations or satellites or to the Information Network with the possibility of implementing more than one process material film and one at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Having had no {{communication}} {{from the surface}} for nearly two hours and unaware that there were currently no divers available, Pacocha fired another flare at 04:20. Yellow was picked {{so as not to}} give the impression that something new was seriously wrong—they only wanted to express concern that they had not heard anything in a couple of hours. However, at 04:40 a small electrical short and fire broke out in main control. It was brief and <b>self-extinguishing,</b> but renewed concern for the survivors' atmosphere. Only carbon dioxide extinguishers were available for fire-fighting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{burn rate}} of {{cigarette}} paper is regulated {{through the application}} of different forms of microcrystalline cellulose to the paper. Cigarette paper has been specially engineered by creating bands of different porosity to create [...] "fire-safe" [...] cigarettes. These cigarettes have a reduced idle burning speed which allows them to <b>self-extinguish.</b> This fire-safe paper is manufactured by mechanically altering the setting of the paper slurry.|$|R
50|$|Pyron is flame {{resistant}} fiber {{used as an}} effective heat-blocking and fire barrier material. Pyron fibers do not burn, melt, or drip. Instead they char and <b>self-extinguish.</b> The largest application for Pyron is the aircraft brake market, where Pyron holds the dominant position in the marketplace. Other commercial applications include metal working protection, automotive, aerospace, furniture and bedding, racewear and other protective apparel, military, energy storage, and noise vibration handling.|$|R
5000|$|Polyesters include {{naturally}} occurring chemicals and synthetics. Natural polyesters {{and a few}} synthetic ones are biodegradable, but most synthetic polyesters are not. Polyesters may change shape after the application of heat and are combustible at high temperatures. They tend to shrink away from flames and <b>self-extinguish</b> upon ignition. Polyester fibers have high tenacity and E-modulus as well as low water absorption and minimal shrinkage in comparison with other industrial fibers.|$|R
