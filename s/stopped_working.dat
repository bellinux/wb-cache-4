5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic Circle, the magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} radio compass. In Number 2, the radio compass <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E

5|$|In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his {{acquaintance}} with Inamdar, who was {{based at the}} Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, working under Inamdar. Shortly before the war, Modi {{took part in a}} non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The July 25, 2008 Arena Mexico show drew an {{estimated}} crowd of 16,500, which {{was close to}} a sell out for the arena and {{a significant increase in}} attendance compared to the Super Viernes shows in the weeks prior to the Universal Tournament and the Leyenda de Plata finals. SuperLuchas magazine later described the Universal Tournament as a promising sign of what the CMLL/TNA working relationship would bring, but in hindsight also noted that it turned out that those promises were never fulfilled as the two companies <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> together by the end of 2008.|$|E
5|$|The bomb sight {{was also}} {{supplied}} with the Emergency Computor, a simple circular slide rule for use when the main computor <b>stopped</b> <b>working.</b> In {{this case the}} bomb aimer would dial in the same basic parameters on the various disks, and read out the proper sighting angle at the bottom. Wind had to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E

5|$|The {{championship}} {{has been}} declared vacant {{on a number of}} occasions, either because of an injury to one of the champions or because a wrestler <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> for CMLL for a period of time. The championship has been held up once, based on the inconclusive outcome of a match, being vacant for a week until the two teams had a rematch. CMLL has also held a couple of tournaments designed to give the winners of the tournament a match against the champions, declaring them the official number one contender for the champions.|$|E
5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale when he <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> as {{a journalist}} in 1996. The story was rejected {{in the final round}} of the 1997 , which took place in March 1998, because of its controversial content. Masao Higashi, {{who took part in the}} award's preliminary selection committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students killing each other being too reminiscent of the Kobe child murders committed the previous year. Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E
5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and <b>stopped</b> <b>working.</b> The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E

5|$|Rodin's {{relationship}} with Turquet was rewarding: through him, {{he won the}} 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin {{a new level of}} artistic freedom. Soon, he <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Simpson trained {{throughout}} his winter break into 1957. In May, he rode {{in the national}} 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a points race at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> {{for a month and}} struggled to regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals. After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill climb championship in October before taking a short break from racing. In spring 1958 he traveled to Sofia with Sheil for two weeks' racing. On his return he won the national individual pursuit championship at Herne Hill Velodrome. In July, Simpson won a silver medal for England in the individual pursuit at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final. A medical exam taken with the Royal Air Force (RAF) revealed Simpson to be colour blind.|$|E
5|$|Verna Hellman {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri. She was the {{daughter}} of Selma (née Schwartz) and Samuel Hellman, who was then working as a journalist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Saturday Evening Post. Sam Hellman subsequently moved his family to Hollywood, where he became a prolific screenwriter. Verna Hellman graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.A. in journalism. She then held several positions at 20th Century Fox, including being the assistant sound editor on Fritz Lang's 1944 film The Woman in the Window. In 1946, she married the film editor Sam Fields and <b>stopped</b> <b>working.</b> The Fields had two sons; one of them, Richard Fields, became a film editor. In 1954, Sam Fields {{died of a heart attack}} at the age of 38.|$|E

5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started {{to pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine <b>stopped</b> <b>working.</b> Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo and fell {{to the back of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder <b>stopped</b> <b>working.</b> The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> as {{an insurance}} actuary {{and became a}} researcher at the Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E
