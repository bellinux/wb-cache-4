The relation between electron scattering optical depth and the forward-backward ratio is studied.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an algorithm to retrieve <b>scattering</b> <b>cloud</b> pressures and other cloud properties with the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The <b>scattering</b> <b>cloud</b> pressure is retrieved using the effects of rotational Raman scattering (RRS). It {{is defined as the}} pressure of a Lambertian surface that would produce the observed amount of RRS consistent with the derived reflectivity of that surface. The independent pixel approximation is used in conjunction with the Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity model to provide an effective radiative <b>cloud</b> fraction and <b>scattering</b> pressure in the presence of broken or thin cloud. The derived cloud pressures will enable accurate retrievals of trace gas mixing ratios, including ozone, in the troposphere within and above clouds. We describe details of the algorithm that will be used for the first release of these products. We compare our <b>scattering</b> <b>cloud</b> pressures with cloud-top pressures and other cloud properties from the Aqua Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. OMI and MODIS are part of the so-called A-train satellites flying in formation within 30 min of each other. Differences between OMI and MODIS are expected because the MODIS observations in the thermal infrared are more sensitive to the cloud top whereas the backscattered photons in the ultraviolet can penetrate deeper into clouds. Radiative transfer calculations are consistent with the observed differences. The OMI cloud pressures are shown to be correlated with the cirrus reflectance. This relationship indicates that OMI can probe through thin or moderately thick cirrus to lower lying water clouds...|$|R

The Bandeirante then broke up and impacted the slope of a ridge 1,3km further on. The tail section and right wing were found 150m from the main wreckage. Weather at 05:00 was good: nil wind, 40km visibility, <b>scattered</b> <b>clouds</b> at 2200 feet and an insignificant small shower band. Investigation revealed a.o. that the captain had insufficient rest prior to the flight {{and that he had}} consumed an above-therapeutic level of antihistamine prior to the flight, which would have degraded his ability to safely pilot the aircraft.

The strength of the transmissions received indicated that Earhart and Noonan were indeed in the vicinity of Howland island, but could not find it and after numerous more attempts it appeared that the connection had dropped. The last transmission received from Earhart indicated she and Noonan were flying along a line of position (taken from a [...] "sun line" [...] running on 157–337 degrees) which Noonan would have calculated and drawn on a chart as passing through Howland. Two-way radio contact was never established, and the aviators and their aircraft disappeared somewhere over the Central Pacific Ocean.
