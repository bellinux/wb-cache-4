5|$|Hood {{was due to}} be modernised in 1941 {{to bring}} her up to a {{standard}} {{similar to that of}} other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She would have received new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin 5.25-inch gun turrets and six octuple 2-pounder pom-poms. Her 5-inch upper armour <b>strake</b> would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition the conning tower would have been removed and her bridge rebuilt. The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast capital ship, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s she was in need of a lengthy overhaul.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of the helical <b>strakes</b> in suppressing the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a rigid cylinder is investigated by providing a three start helical <b>strakes</b> around a circular cylinder at two Reynolds numbers (100 & 28000). While the effect of helical <b>strakes</b> on suppression of vortex shedding has been studied extensively, the mechanism of VIV mitigation using helical <b>strakes</b> is much less well documented in the literature. In the present study, a rigid circular cylinder of diameter d= 40 mm attached with three-strand helical <b>strakes</b> of dimensions of 10 d in pitch and 0. 15 d in height was tested by simulation. To numerically simulate vortex shedding, CFD {{is used to calculate}} the unsteady flow that arises from a fluid moving past an obstruction. A computational grid independence study has been done for flow over the circular cylinder and the grid resolution in which there is faster recovery of coefficient of lift is taken for the simulation. The contours of static pressure, velocity magnitude and vorticity magnitude and the hydrodynamic coefficients Cd and CL are obtained. It is found that, as expected, the <b>straked</b> cylinder has a higher drag coefficient in comparison with a smooth bare cylinder. The helical <b>strakes</b> can reduce VIV by about 99 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} paper investigates experimentally {{the effectiveness}} of <b>strakes</b> in suppressing the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a long flexible cylinder by varying the number of helix of the <b>strakes,</b> which differ from the previous studies that only focus on short rigid cylinder. The experiment was conducted in the towing tank with constant velocity under subcritical Reynolds number (0. 14 x 104 - 1. 37 x 104) by using a poly vinyl chloride cylinder with aspect ratio of 162. CCD cameras were installed to capture the amplitude vibration while the variation of tension was measured by using tension load-cell. The drag force coefficient and the cross-flow and in-line frequency response {{were obtained from the}} strain gauges. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to identify the main deficiency and advantage of a two-start helical <b>strakes</b> compare to a three-start helical <b>strakes</b> in reducing the VIV of a low mass ratio flexible riser. The experimental result shows that the two-start helical <b>strakes</b> perform well in mitigating the VIV in low reduced velocity range. However, its effectiveness in suppressing the vibration amplitude of flexible cylinder is far smaller than the three-start helical <b>strakes.</b> Substantial amplitude mitigation is found for the three-start helical <b>strakes,</b> but with significant amplification of drag at high reduced velocity, which is unfavourable. On the other hand, although the mean drag coefficient is slightly higher for the two-start helical <b>strakes</b> in the lock-in region, the drag force response is more consistent and independent to the velocity changes at high reduced velocity...|$|R

40|$|The {{volumetric}} reconstruction technique {{presented in}} this paper employs a two-camera stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) system in order to reconstruct the mean flow behind a fixed cylinder fitted with helical <b>strakes,</b> which are commonly used to suppress vortex-induced vibrations (VIV). The technique is based on the measurement of velocity fields at equivalent adjacent planes that results in pseudo volumetric fields. The main advantage over proper volumetric techniques is the avoidance of additional equipment and complexity. The averaged velocity fields behind the <b>straked</b> cylinders and the geometrical periodicity of the three-start configuration are used to further simplify the reconstruction process. Two <b>straked</b> cylindrical models with the same pitch (p = 10 d) and two different heights (h = 0. 1 and 0. 2 d) are tested. The reconstructed flow shows that the <b>strakes</b> introduce in the wake flow a well-defined wavelength of one-third of the pitch. Measurements of hydrodynamic forces, fluctuating velocity, vortex formation length, and vortex shedding frequency show the interdependence of the wake parameters. The vortex formation length is increased by the <b>strakes,</b> which is an important effect for the suppression of vortex-induced vibrations. The results presented complement previous investigations concerning the effectiveness of <b>strakes</b> as VIV suppressors and provide a basis of comparison to numerical simulations.
