The aim of the study is to estimate the distance, radial velocity, age, membership and reddening of the cluster using both spectroscopic and photometric techniques. We used new spectroscopic data collected from SAAO's 1. 9 m telescope together with existing photometric data from catalogues in the study of Trumpler 27.

The observational material is not sufficient to distinguish between a normal carbon abundance and a slight carbon depletion for the giant-branch stars, but carbon appears to be somewhat depleted in stars on the asymptotic giant branch.

Methods. ESO/VLT {{observations of the}} targets with the NIR spectrometer ISAAC were compared with several published NIR <b>spectral</b> <b>atlases</b> of O and B supergiants, an identification of each object’s spectral characteristics was made, enabling the refinement of spectral classification of the mass donors. Results. We determined that EXO 1722 - 363 was of spectral type B 0 - B 1 Ia, positioned at a distance 8. 0 + 2. 5 − 2. 0 kpc with a progenitor mass in the range 30 M ⊙- 40 M⊙. Luminosity calculations imply that LX ∼ 10 35 - 10 37 erg s − 1 for this distance range. We conclude that EXO 1722 - 363 shares many of the properties associated with other X-ray binary B-type supergiant donors. We found that OAO 1657 - 415 correlates closely with the spectra of a class of transitional objects, the Ofpe/WNL stars, an intermediate evolutionary stage between massive O type stars leaving the main sequence and evolving into Wolf-Rayets. Due to the wide range in luminosity displayed by Ofpe/WNL stars, (log(L/L⊙) ∼ 5. 3 - 6. 2) distance determinations are problematic. For OAO 1657 - 415 we report a distance of 4. 4 ≤d≤ 12 kpc, implying an X-ray luminosity of 1. 5 × 10 36 ≤ LX ≤ 10 37 erg s − 1. We have used ou...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Spectral-line asymmetries and {{wavelength}} shifts are {{signatures of}} hydrodynamics in solar and stellar atmospheres. Theory may precisely predict idealized lines, but observed spectra {{are limited by}} blends, too few suitable lines, imprecise laboratory wavelengths, and by instrumental imperfections. AIMS: Bisectors and shifts are extracted until the 'ultimate' accuracy limits in highest-quality solar and stellar spectra, to understand limits set by stellar physics, observational techniques, and limitations in laboratory data. METHODS: <b>Spectral</b> <b>atlases</b> of the Sun and bright solar-type stars were examined for thousands of 'unblended' lines with the most accurate laboratory wavelengths, yielding bisectors and shifts as averages over groups of similar lines, thus minimizing effects of photometric noise and of random blends. RESULTS: For solar spectra, bisector shapes and shifts were extracted for previously little-studied species (Fe II, Ti I, Ti II, Cr II, Ca I, C I), using recently determined very accurate laboratory wavelengths. In Procyon and other F-type stars, a blueward bend in the bisector near the spectral continuum reveals line saturation and damping wings in upward-moving photospheric granules. Accuracy limits set by 'astrophysical' noise, finite instrumental resolution, superposed telluric absorption, and inaccurate wavelengths, together limit absolute lineshift studies to approximately 50 - 100 m/s. CONCLUSIONS: Spectroscopy with resolutions R = 300, 000 will enable bisector studies for many stars. Circumventing remaining limits of astrophysical noise in line-blends and rotationally smeared profiles may ultimately require spectroscopy across spatially resolved stellar disks.

They are {{rare in the}} 1 - 5 μm region for historical reasons, but once available, high resolution atlases {{in this part of}} the spectrum will aid the study of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. Aims. The aim of the CRIRES-POP project is to produce a high resolution near-infrared spectral library of stars across the H-R diagram. The aim of this paper is to present the fully reduced spectrum of the K giant 10 Leo that will form the basis of the first atlas within the CRIRES-POP library, to provide a full description of the data reduction processes involved, and to provide an update on the CRIRES-POP project. Methods. All CRIRES-POP targets were observed with almost 200 different observational settings of CRIRES on the ESO Very Large Telescope, resulting in a basically complete coverage of its spectral range as accessible from the ground. We reduced the spectra of 10 Leo with the CRIRES pipeline, corrected the wavelength solution and removed telluric absorption with Molecfit, then resampled the spectra to a common wavelength scale, shifted them to rest wavelengths, flux normalised, and median combined them into one final data product. Results. We present the fully reduced, high resolution, near-infrared spectrum of 10 Leo. This is also the first complete spectrum from the CRIRES instrument. The spectrum is available online.

40|$|Determining the {{properties}} of starbursts requires spectral diagnostics of their ultraviolet radiation fields, to test whether very massive stars are present. We test several such diagnostics, using new models of line ratio behavior combining Cloudy, Starburst 99 and up-to-date <b>spectral</b> <b>atlases</b> (Pauldrach et al. 2001; Hillier & Miller 1998). For six galaxies we obtain new measurements of Hei 1. 7 µm/Br 10, a difficult to measure but physically simple (and therefore reliable) diagnostic. We obtain new measurements of Hei 2. 06 µm/Brγ in five galaxies. We find that Hei 2. 06 µm/Brγ and [Oiii]/Hβ are generally unreliable diagnostics in starbursts. The heteronuclear and homonuclear mid–infrared line ratios (notably [Neiii] 15. 6 µm / [Neii] 12. 8 µm) consistently agree {{with each other and}} with Hei 1. 7 µm/Br 10; this argues that the mid–infrared line ratios are reliable diagnostics of spectral hardness. In a sample of 27 starbursts, [Neiii]/[Neii] is significantly lower than model predictions for a Salpeter IMF extending to 100 M⊙. Plausible model alterations strengthen this conclusion. By contrast, the low–mass and low–metallicity galaxies II Zw 40 and NGC 5253 show relatively high neon line ratios, compatible with a Salpeter slope extending to at least ∼ 40 – 60 M⊙. One solution for the low neon line ratios in the high– metallicity starbursts would be that they are deficient in � 40 M ⊙ stars compared to a Salpeter IMF. An alternative explanation, which we prefer, is that massive stars in high–metallicity starbursts spend much of their lives embedded within ultra–compact Hii regions that prevent the near – and mid–infrared nebular lines from forming and escaping. This hypothesis has important consequences for starburst modelling and interpretation.

After previous photometric and spectroscopic observing campaigns in the optical and near-infrared, new photometry and spectroscopy was performed in the near-infrared with the SofI instrument on the ESO/NTT telescope in 2008 and 2010 on a sample of INTEGRAL sources. These observations, and specifically the detection of certain features in the spectra, allow the identification of these high-energy objects by comparison with published nIR <b>spectral</b> <b>atlases</b> of O and B stars. We present photometric data of nine sources (IGR J 10101 - 5654, IGR J 11187 - 5438, IGR J 11435 - 6109, IGR J 14331 - 6112, IGR J 16328 - 4726, IGR J 17200 - 3116, IGR J 17354 - 3255, IGR J 17404 - 3655, and IGR J 17586 - 2129) and spectroscopic observations of 13 sources (IGR J 10101 - 5654, IGR J 11435 - 6109, IGR J 13020 - 6359, IGR J 14331 - 6112, IGR J 14488 - 5942, IGR J 16195 - 4945, IGR J 16318 - 4848, IGR J 16320 - 4751, IGR J 16328 - 4726, IGR J 16418 - 4532, IGR J 17354 - 3255, IGR J 17404 - 3655, and IGR J 17586 - 2129). Our spectroscopic measurements indicate that: five of these objects are Oe/Be high-mass X-ray binaries (BeHMXB), six are supergiant high-mass X-ray binaries (sgHMXB), and two are sgB[e]. From a statistical point of view, we estimate the proportion of confirmed sgHMXB to be 42 % {{and that of the}} confirmed BeHMXB to be 49 %. The remaining 9 % are peculiar HMXB.
