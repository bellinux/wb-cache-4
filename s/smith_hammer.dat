50|$|Forging—the process smiths use {{to shape}} metal by hammering—differs from {{machining}} in that forging does not remove material. Instead, the <b>smith</b> <b>hammers</b> the iron into shape. Even punching and cutting operations (except when trimming waste) by smiths usually re-arrange metal around the hole, rather than drilling {{it out as}} swarf.|$|R
50|$|As a smithing god, Hephaestus {{made all}} the weapons of the gods in Olympus. He served as the {{blacksmith}} of the gods, and was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centers of Greece, particularly Athens. The cult of Hephaestus was based in Lemnos. Hephaestus' symbols are a <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer,</b> anvil, {{and a pair of}} tongs.|$|R

5000|$|The basic art and {{principles}} of forging a blade has remained similar {{for thousands of years}} and the modern bladesmith uses a variety of tools and techniques in order to produce a blade.

The {{fundamental}} rule about neighboring {{property is}} that {{the owner of the}} adjoining property must avoid everything that might prove a nuisance to the neighbor, or become a source of injury to the neighbor's property. [...] "The noise of a <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer,</b> of a mill, or of children in school, is not to be considered a nuisance" [...] (ii. 3). Disputes as regards to injury or nuisance are generally settled by the fact of prior or established rights (Ḥazaḳah).|$|R
60|$|After dinner I wandered {{about the}} streets, past the great old {{houses of the}} nobles in the Calle de los Caballeros, empty now and dilapidated, for every gentleman that can put a penny in his pocket goes to Madrid to spend it; {{down to the river}} which flowed swiftly between high banks. Below the bridge two Moorish mills, {{irregular}} masses of blackness, stood finely against the night. Near at hand they were still working at a forge, and I watched the flying sparks as the <b>smith</b> <b>hammered</b> a horseshoe; the workers were like silhouettes in front of the leaping flames.|$|R
50|$|An anvil is a {{block with}} a hard surface on which another object is struck. The block is as massive as is practical, because the higher the inertia of the anvil, the more {{efficiently}} it causes {{the energy of the}} striking tool to be transferred to the work piece. On a quality anvil the <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer</b> should rebound with almost as much energy as the smith puts into the downward stroke, ultimately making the smith's job easier and less physically strenuous. In most cases the anvil is used as a forging tool. Before the advent of modern welding technology, it was a primary tool of metal workers.|$|R
5000|$|Pettersson, the {{youngest}} of four children of a violent, alcoholic blacksmith, was born at the manor of Granhammar in Västra Ryd parish {{in the province of}} Uppland, but grew up in poor circumstances in the Södermalm district of Stockholm, where he resided during his whole life. He once said of himself: [...] "I wasn't born under a piano, I didn't spend my childhood with my father, the composer... no, I learnt how to work white-hot iron with the <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer.</b> My father was a smith who may have said no to God, but not to alcohol. My mother was a pious woman who sang and played with her four children." ...|$|R
60|$|Turning his horse, and bidding John {{to do the}} same, Oswald reined {{back his}} animal three or four lengths; and when the Bairds' party were within twenty yards, touched it with his spur and dashed at them, meeting them just abreast of Roger. The first man he met thrust at him with his spear, but Oswald parried with his sword, and with a back-handed blow smote the man just under the chin, and he fell with a crash from his horse. At the same moment he heard a blow {{like that of a}} <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer,</b> as Roger's staff fell upon the steel cap of the first who {{attacked}} him.|$|R
5000|$|Flake Hammerscale is {{produced}} in large quantities during multiple stages of the smithing process. To create the pure iron necessary for forging, a smith must first purify the iron ore. The smelting of ore creates a ‘bloom’, a porous mixture of slag and metal. The smith then repeatedly heats and hammers the bloom to remove impurities. This technique creates hammerscale of varying composition. As the purification process continues, the hammerscale’s iron content increases. [...] Additional hammerscale {{is produced}} during the forging of the pure iron from the heating and hammering necessary to shape the piece. The scale produced at this stage is characterized by its blue-black color and tends to be slimmer and darker due to its incredibly high iron oxide content. Archeologists believe that spheroidal hammerscale is produced primarily during the process known as fire welding. Also known as forge welding, this technique is used to connect two pieces of metal by heating them to a high temperature and forcing them together with a hammer or other tool. For this method to be successful, the surface of each piece of metal must be molten. As the <b>smith</b> <b>hammers</b> the pieces together, some metal is forced out from between them, often {{in the form of}} a molten jet which cools in the air to form spheroidal hammer scale. It is also possible for spheroidal hammerscale to form during the purification of slag. As the <b>smith</b> <b>hammers</b> a bloom, it compacts which can drive molten metal out of the slag into the air.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, but {{it might}} be done,' said Dapplegrim. 'I will help you; but you must first have me well shod. You must ask for ten pounds of iron and twelve pounds of steel for the shoeing, and one <b>smith</b> to <b>hammer</b> and one to hold.' ...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{work surface}} of the anvil {{is known as the}} face. It is {{generally}} made of hardened steel and should be flat and smooth with rounded edges for most work. Any marks on the face will be transferred to the work. Also, sharp edges tend to cut into the metal being worked and may cause cracks to form in the workpiece. The face is hardened and tempered to resist the blows of the <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer,</b> so the anvil face does not deform under repeated use. A hard anvil face also reduces the amount of force lost in each hammer blow. Hammers, tools, and work pieces of hardened steel should never directly strike the anvil face with full force, as they may damage it; this can result in chipping or deforming of the anvil face.|$|R

5000|$|On the [...] "Perseus Vase" [...] in Berlin (F1704; ca 570-560 BC), Hephaestus ritually flees his act of slicing {{open the}} head of Zeus to free Athena whose {{pregnant}} mother Zeus swallowed {{in order to prevent}} her offspring from dethroning him. Over the shoulder of Hephaestus is the instrument he has used, the double-headed axe. The more usual double-headed instrument of Hephaestus is the double-headed <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer,</b> so the symbolism is important. Zeus swallowing the goddess symbolised the progressive suppression of the earlier traditional religious beliefs, symbolically dethroning the goddess, Metis, but allowing Athene (her daughter) to be [...] "born" [...] of Zeus because her worship was so pervasive and widespread that it could not be suppressed. That is likely the reason the labrys was depicted as the instrument used by Hephaestus (who much earlier had been a consort of the Earth goddess) to release Athene.|$|R
6000|$|The hunters now {{arrived at}} an open space {{where there were}} several large umbrageous trees, and as it was {{approaching}} mid-day they resolved to rest here {{for a couple of}} hours. Birds and insects were gradually becoming more and more silent and soon afterwards the only sounds that broke upon their ears were the curious metallic notes of the urupongas, or bell-birds; which were so like to the rapid beating of a <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer</b> on an anvil, that it was with the greatest difficulty Barney was restrained from going off by himself in search of the [...] "smiddy." [...] Indeed he began to suspect that the worthy hermit was deceiving him, and was only fully convinced at last when he saw one of the birds. It was pure white, {{about the size of a}} thrush, and had a curious horn or fleshy tubercle upon its head.|$|R

In company, in solitude, on land, on shipboard; {{sometimes}} leaving me alone for months, and sometimes always with me. I have seen him, at sea, come gliding {{in the dead of}} night along the bright reflection of the moon in the calm water; and I have seen him, on quays and market-places, with his hand uplifted, towering, the centre of a busy crowd, unconscious of the terrible form that had its silent stand among them.

5000|$|In the Greek myth, Procrustes was {{a son of}} Poseidon with a stronghold on Mount Korydallos at Erineus, on {{the sacred}} way between Athens and Eleusis. There he had a bed, in which he invited every passer-by to spend the night, and where he set to work on them with his <b>smith's</b> <b>hammer,</b> to stretch them to fit. In later tellings, if the guest proved too tall, Procrustes would amputate the excess length; nobody ever fit the bed exactly. Procrustes {{continued}} his reign of terror until he was captured by Theseus, travelling to Athens along the sacred way, who [...] "fitted" [...] Procrustes to his own bed:He killed Damastes, surnamed Procrustes, by compelling him {{to make his own}} body fit his bed, as he had been wont to do with those of strangers. And he did this in imitation of Heracles. For that hero punished those who offered him violence {{in the manner in which}} they had plotted to serve him.

Other stock characters in the parade include four masked, smartly dressed [...] "old men" [...] with walking sticks. From time to time the horse falls to the ground and is then [...] "shod" [...] (the <b>smith</b> <b>hammers</b> the shoe soles of one or other of the carriers, who kick out, wildly).

60|$|The Knight {{immediately}} walked forth {{into the}} court, where {{all had been}} activity and eagerness ever since {{the arrival of the}} summons, the <b>smith</b> <b>hammering</b> ceaselessly in his forge, yet without fulfilling half the order continually shouted in his ears; Gaston d'Aubricour and Ralph Penrose directing from morning to night, in contradiction of each other, the one always laughing, the other always grumbling; the men-at-arms and retainers some obeying orders, others being scolded, the steel clanging, hammers ringing without intermission. Most of the party, such at least as could leave their employment without a sharp reprimand from {{one or the other of}} the contending authorities, the Seneschal and the Squire, were gathered round the steps, where the armourer was displaying, with many an encomium, his bundles of lances, his real Toledo blades, and his helmets of the choicest fashion. Gaston d'Aubricour and Ralph were disputing respecting a certain suit of armour, which the latter disapproved, because it had no guards for the knees, while the former contended that the only use for such protections was to disable a man from walking, and nearly from standing when once unhorsed.|$|R
25|$|Forging {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} known {{metalworking}} processes. Traditionally, forging was performed by a <b>smith</b> using <b>hammer</b> and anvil, though introducing water power to the production and working of iron in the 12th century allowed the use of large trip hammers or power hammers that exponentially increased the amount and size of iron that could be produced and forged easily. The smithy or forge has evolved over centuries to become a facility with engineered processes, production equipment, tooling, raw materials and products to meet the demands of modern industry.|$|R
5000|$|Johnston's {{complete}} {{backing of}} Roosevelt {{earned him the}} endorsements of several liberal organizations, such as the Labor Nonpartisan League (LNPL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), but these two organizations were frowned upon in South Carolina. They advanced racial integration, advocated labor militancy and were {{believed to have been}} controlled by Communists. <b>Smith</b> <b>hammered</b> Johnston for having these ties claiming that Johnston [...] "endorsed the nigger, and went one hundred percent for anything belonging to the New Deal, right or wrong, because he does not have guts to disagree." [...] Smith then boasted of his endorsement by the racially exclusive American Federation of Labor (AFL) and stress that a vote for Johnston would embolster the CIO to force the employment of blacks in factories alongside whites. Though Johnston did not defend rights for African Americans, he would largely ignore the issue of white supremacy, believing that improving the public welfare was more important, while Smith had campaigned for over thirty years on a two plank platform to [...] "keep the Negro down and the price of cotton up" [...] and had further demonstrated he intended to continue the fight to preserve racial segregation when {{he walked out of the}} 1936 Democratic National Convention after learning that a black minister was going to deliver the invocation.|$|R
