5|$|Despite {{deuterium}} being {{a valuable}} commodity, Archer is <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of basic medical supplies and the run-down {{nature of the}} colony. The reason becomes apparent when seven Klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their 'regular arrangement'. When Tessic informs Korok (Robertson Dean), {{the leader of the}} Klingons, {{that they do not have}} all the deuterium because two pumps were not working, Korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order. Later, when Tucker and Archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the Klingons, Tessic tell them to take their 200 liters and leave. However, leaving does not sit well with Archer and he convinces the leader to resist with their support.|$|E
5|$|Douglas and Jean MacArthur {{spent their}} last years {{together}} in the penthouse of the Waldorf Towers, {{a part of the}} Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He was elected {{chairman of the board of}} Remington Rand. In that year, he earned a salary of $68,000 (equivalent to $612,000 in 2016), in addition to $20,000 pay and allowances as a General of the Army. The Waldorf became the setting for an annual birthday party on 26 January thrown by the general's former deputy chief engineer, Major General Leif J. Sverdrup. At the 1960 celebration for MacArthur's 80th birthday, many of his friends were <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> general's obviously deteriorating health. The next day, he collapsed and was rushed into surgery at St. Luke's Hospital to control a severely swollen prostate.|$|E
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E
60|$|She was <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> hearing <b>the</b> bell ring, {{away in the}} kitchen, the {{children}} came scudding along the passage in delicious alarm.|$|R
60|$|She <b>startled</b> me <b>by</b> <b>the</b> assent that flashed out {{upon her}} face. But she said nothing, and stood waiting.|$|R
60|$|There {{were no more}} deaths. The most awful cases {{began to}} mend with an immediacy that was <b>startling.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> third day, men {{who had not been}} off their backs for weeks crawled out of their bunks and tottered around on crutches. And on that day, the sun, two months then on its journey into {{northern}} declination, peeped cheerfully over the crest of the canyon for the first time.|$|R
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{earthquake}} sequences in the Wes Craven film New Nightmare were filmed a month prior to the Northridge quake. The real quake struck only weeks before filming was completed. Subsequently, a team was sent out to film footage of the quake-damaged areas of the city. The cast and crew had initially thought that the scenes that were filmed before the real quake struck were a bit overdone, but upon viewing the footage after {{the earthquake}}, they were reportedly <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> realism of it.|$|E
25|$|Tallahassee raids a {{deep fried}} Twinkies stand {{in search of}} his snack. During this, Columbus is <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> noises of a rat and accidentally shoots at the last {{remaining}} box of Twinkies in the pantry, destroying all the cakes and making them inedible. Luckily, Little Rock has gotten a Twinkie beforehand and gives it to Tallahassee. The movie ends with the group leaving Pacific Playland as Columbus realizes without relating to other people, that you might as well be a zombie, and that he now has what he's always wanted: a family.|$|E
60|$|He had sat <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hearth a long, long time, {{absorbed in}} his thoughts, not once looking round toward the bed, {{when he was}} <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> hearing <b>the</b> sound of his grandfather's voice once more.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the sorrowing ones were <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> hearing <b>the</b> {{voice of the}} man whom they {{had every reason to}} call their enemy, and an instant later Uncle Nathan stood before them.|$|R

25|$|The {{details of}} {{the image on the}} shroud are not easily seen with the naked eye, but they can be more clearly {{revealed}} through photography. In May 1898 Italian photographer Secondo Pia was allowed to photograph the shroud. He took the first photograph of the shroud on 28 May 1898. Pia was <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> visible image of the negative plate, implying that the shroud is effectively a negative of some kind. Pia was at first accused of doctoring his photographs, but he was vindicated in 1931 when another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the shroud and obtained results similar to Pia's. In 1978, ultraviolet photographs were taken of the shroud.|$|E
25|$|A second mostly {{complete}} skeleton (AMNH5886) {{was found}} in 1904 in Hell Creek Formation rocks at Crooked Creek in central Montana by Oscar Hunter, a rancher. Upon finding the partially exposed specimen, he and a companion argued {{about whether or not}} the remains were recent or fossil. Hunter demonstrated that they were brittle and thus stone by kicking the tops off the vertebrae, an act later lamented by the eventual collector Barnum Brown. Another cowboy, Alfred Sensiba, bought the specimen from Hunter for a pistol, and later sold it to Brown, who excavated it for the American Museum of Natural History in 1906. This specimen had a nearly complete vertebral column, permitting the restoration of Cope's specimen. In 1907, these two specimens were mounted side-by-side in the American Museum of Natural History, under the name Trachodon mirabilis. Cope's specimen is positioned on all fours with its head down, as if feeding, because it has the better skull, while Brown's specimen, with a less perfect skull, is posed bipedally with the head less accessible. Henry Fairfield Osborn described the tableau as representing the two animals feeding along a marsh, the standing individual having been <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> approach of a Tyrannosaurus. Impressions of appropriate plant remains and shells based on associated fossils were included on the base of the group, including ginkgo leaves, Sequoia cones, and horsetail rushes.|$|E
500|$|Those on Carpathia were <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{scene that}} greeted {{them as the}} sun came up: [...] "fields of ice on which, like points on the landscape, rested innumerable pyramids of ice." [...] Captain Arthur Rostron of Carpathia saw ice all around, {{including}} 20large bergs measuring up to [...] high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from Titanic. It appeared to Carpathias passengers that their ship {{was in the middle}} of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs appearing like hills in the distance.|$|E

6000|$|... "Will {{you go to}} bed, Sam?" [...] asked Emily, {{holding out}} her arms to him, and {{immediately}} <b>startling</b> him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> terrible gentleness of her persuasion. He retreated behind Lettie.|$|R
60|$|This {{question}} was asked when an hour had been spent in almost perfect silence <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{occupants of the}} lean-to, and the boy was <b>startled</b> both, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name and the voice.|$|R
500|$|About [...] {{outside the}} town, the main columns reunited with the advance parties. [...] They were <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden {{appearance}} of 50 armed men, {{but they were}} American. [...] Led by Adam Stephen, they had not known about the plan to attack Trenton, and had attacked a Hessian outpost. [...] Washington feared the Hessians would {{have been put on}} guard, and shouted at Stephen, [...] "You sir! You Sir, may have ruined all my plans by having them put on their guard." [...] Despite this, Washington ordered the advance continue to Trenton. In the event, Rall thought the first raid was the attack which Grant had warned him about, and {{that there would be no}} further action that day.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the novel came in 1959, when Achebe heard {{the story of a}} Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer. He drew further {{inspiration}} a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by archaeologist Thurstan Shaw; Achebe was <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cultural sophistication of the artifacts. When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers (not unlike the fictional Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger referenced at the end of Things Fall Apart), Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on Arrow of God in earnest. Like Achebe's previous works, Arrow was roundly praised by critics. A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called [...] "certain structural weaknesses".|$|E
500|$|Seifert's {{performance}} in the game received high praise from reviewers. GameSpot's Justin Clark felt that the performance [...] "anchored" [...] the game. Katie Smith of Adventure Gamers wrote that Seifert is convincing in the role, particularly with small details such as body language, but was <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of emotion. Game Informers Wallace echoed similar remarks, noting that Seifert [...] "nailed the role". Rock, Paper, Shotguns Smith wrote that [...] "the whole thing might collapse" [...] without Seifert's [...] "convincing" [...] performance. IGN's Albert named the acting [...] "believable", stating that Seifert's performance is [...] "appropriately both grounded and absurd". Joe Donnelly of Digital Spy wrote that Seifert's performance {{has the potential to}} inspire similar games, and Andy Kelly of PC Gamer called the performance [...] "understated, realistic, and complex". Burns of VideoGamer.com felt generally impressed by Seifert's performance, but noted some [...] "occasional bad acting".|$|E

60|$|Approaching the village, he {{had been}} <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> seeing <b>the</b> dark gentleman (a total {{stranger}} to him) stretched prostrate on the grass at the roadside--so {{far as he could}} judge, in a swoon. Having a flask with brandy in it, he revived the fainting man, and led him to the inn.|$|R
500|$|After lunch, Ellen takes a nap. [...] When she awakes, {{she finds}} Bruce missing and wanders {{into the woods}} looking for him. [...] To her horror, she finds Bruce's dead body, horribly {{mutilated}} with apparent knife wounds. [...] She is then <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of a demonic entity hiding within the woods, and quickly runs back to the cabin. While fleeing, she is attacked by unseen forces. She runs back to the cabin and screams to be let in immediately, being let in just as the entity is approaching her. Ellen tells her friends that Bruce has been murdered, but Scotty dismisses the whole thing as a joke and goes to find Bruce. Shelly - Scotty's girlfriend -, and Ellen are concerned when Scotty doesn't return right away. Shelly walks outside to begin {{a search for the}} missing men, but a possessed Bruce assaults and strangles her, eventually stabbing her in the neck and killing her with the dagger that he found, moaning [...] "join us." ...|$|E
500|$|The huge war party {{crossed into}} central Texas and first {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Victoria, August 6. Although rangers had found the tracks of a gigantic war party coming out of West Texas, and were shadowing the onrushing Comanches, {{part of the war}} party broke off and attacked Victoria before the citizens could be warned. One resident wrote, [...] "We of Victoria were <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> apparitions presented by the sudden appearance of six hundred mounted Comanches in the immediate outskirts of the village." [...] The citizens of Victoria hid in the buildings, and the Comanches, after killing a dozen or so townspeople and riding up and down, departed Victoria when rifle fire from the buildings began to make the riding dangerous. The war party intended to gather horses and loot the coastal towns, which were not as prepared for the Comanches as the central Texas cities. After the attack on Victoria, the Comanches camped the night of August 6 on nearby Spring Creek.|$|E
500|$|Yoshimura {{included}} a B story of Lewis and Falsone looking for Lange's girlfriend to provide comic relief {{and so that}} the entire episode would not be confined to the subway platform location. Yoshimura wanted the two detectives to also discuss the nature of mortality and death, but deliberately included black humor in their dialogue and made sure the characters did not act [...] "teary-eyed [...] philosophical", because he believed it would be clichéd and an inaccurate depiction of how real detectives would behave. Some viewers were offended or <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> flippant nature of the discussions about death between the two characters. Lange's girlfriend jogged behind Lewis and Falsone during {{a scene in which}} the two detectives were distracted in a discussion; Yoshimura deliberately included this in the episode to create a moment of irony. The line by Falsone to a jogger, [...] "Are you sure you're not Sarah?", and Lewis' mocking reaction to the question, were both ad-libbed by the actors.|$|E
6000|$|A {{thrill of}} thunder in my hair: [...] Though {{blackening}} clouds be plain, [...] Still I am stung and <b>startled</b> [...] <b>By</b> <b>the</b> first drop of the rain: [...] Romance and pride and passion pass [...] And these are what remain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said I, rising. I {{held out}} my hand from the shadow. I was <b>startled</b> myself <b>by</b> <b>the</b> white sympathy it seemed to express, {{extended}} towards him in the moonlight. He gripped it, and cleaved {{to me for a}} moment, then he was gone.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was leaning}} on the terrace of the Kronprinzen-Hof at Rolandseck one hot summer afternoon, lazily {{watching}} the groups of tourists strolling along the road that ran between the Hof and the Rhine. There was certainly little in the place or its atmosphere to recall the Greyport episode of twenty years before, when I was suddenly <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> hearing <b>the</b> name of [...] "Sarah Walker." ...|$|R
500|$|Wenger's methods had {{the desired}} effect – Nagoya won 17 of their {{following}} 27 games to finish runners-up in 1995. He shortly received the J. League Manager of the Year award for 1995, while Stojković claimed the player's honour. In January 1996, Wenger guided the club to their first piece of silverware as Nagoya defeated Sanfrecce Hiroshima to win the Emperor's Cup. Two months later they triumphed in the Super Cup, beating Yokohama Marinos 2–0. The success bolstered Nagoya's status in Japanese football, as well as Wenger's reputation; he was somewhat <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> praise and idolisation that came his way. Midway through the 1996 league season, Wenger's former club Strasbourg enquired {{about the possibility of}} him returning to manage them. He turned down the offer as he was earlier approached by Arsenal. Dein had remained in contact with Wenger after their first meeting, and frequently sent him video tapes of matches to garner his opinions; [...] "He was my personal pundit," [...] the vice-chairman recalled. The Arsenal board rebuffed Dein's suggestion to appoint Wenger as early as 1995, but concerns over George Graham's successor Bruce Rioch meant they were more open-minded about hiring him since his stint in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Production in Sydney {{commenced}} {{the week}} beginning 1 October and lasted for 18 days. The main cast and Sean Pertwee were flown out {{along with a}} skeleton crew. Additional staff were drawn from those already working for Granada Australia, the Australian production arm of Granada Productions, as flying a complete British crew overseas would have been prohibitively expensive. Filming locations included Hyde Park, Kirribilli, Double Bay and the Northern Beaches. The scenes of Shawn's barbecue were filmed in Palm Beach and the facade of a terraced house in Paddington was used for an establishing scene of Lucy's apartment. The wedding scenes were set in the grounds of Strickland House, Vaucluse. Another scene was filmed on location outside the Sydney Opera House. While preparing for the scene, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst were distracted {{by a group of}} British tourists yelling that Karen should leave David after David's affair in Series 3. The group remained quiet when the scene was being shot. Karen and David's apartment was filmed at a building near Luna Park in Milsons Point. A stunt team co-ordinated the fight scene between Mark and David but could not convincingly choreograph a headbutt between Mark and David. The stunt co-ordinator and Pertwee, who was already experienced in stunt fighting, agreed Pertwee would get a better reaction from Bathurst by almost headbutting his face for real, instead of [...] "hitting air". Initially <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> move, Bathurst conceded that it was better for him to be surprised as he might have flinched if he had known what Pertwee was about to do. Hermione Norris found the scene upsetting insofar as it was unusual to see Robert Bathurst playing David in such an emotional state.|$|E

60|$|Just as {{the church}} clocks were {{striking}} four I was <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> seeing <b>the</b> room door open. It was only Dusty Sal (as they call her in the house), the maid-of-all-work.
