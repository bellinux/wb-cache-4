500|$|Hu wrote a {{detailed}} memoir {{of her life}} in the 1980s, in which she harshly criticized her own politics. She described herself as [...] "immature", relying on [...] "enthusiasm rather than analysis", which pushed her to [...] "join whatever cause that <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> just". She also considered the Red Guards who had tormented her during the Cultural Revolution similarly immature and easily manipulated. Her memoir rarely mentions Mao Zedong, but frequently praises Premier Zhou Enlai, as many other writers did after the Cultural Revolution, contrasting the vengeful Mao with the humane Zhou. She explicitly criticized the morality of Chen Yi for the way he treated her in 1949.|$|E
500|$|Catherine de' Medici {{was closely}} {{involved}} {{in planning and}} supervising the building. De l'Orme records, for example, that {{she told him to}} take down some Ionic columns that <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> too plain. She also insisted on large panels between the dormers to make room for inscriptions. Only a part of de l'Orme's scheme was ever built: the lower section of a central pavilion, containing an oval staircase, and a wing on either side. Though work on de l'Orme's design was abandoned in 1572, two years after his death, it is nonetheless held in high regard. According to Thomson, [...] "The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens, the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts [...] and the Château de la Punta in Corsica show that the columns, pilasters, dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non-figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture".• [...] Pons, 79. Counts Jérome and Charles Pozzo di Borgo bought sections of the ruins during the demolition of the Tuileries in 1883 and used them to construct the château de la Punta in Corsica, overlooking the gulf of Ajaccio (1885–7).|$|E
2500|$|Her {{first stage}} {{name as a}} dancer was [...] "Jennasis", which she later used as {{the name of a}} {{business}} that she incorporated ("Jennasis Killing Co."). [...] As for picking her permanent professional name, she said, [...] "I {{had to come up with}} a good name. [...] I didn't want a porno name. [...] So I sat down, opened up the phone book and thumbed to the J's, cause I wanted it to match my first name." [...] She saw 'James', but rejected [...] "Jenna James" [...] because it [...] "sounds too porno". [...] Right under that was 'Jameson' which <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> being the name of the whiskey she likes and thought [...] "Ok, that's perfect." [...] That night at work she saw her brother and asked him what he thought of the name [...] "Jenna Jameson". [...] He said, [...] "I'm drinking Jameson right now." [...] And the name stuck after that.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{young lady}} could be {{reminded}} {{by such a}} remark that she usually <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> friend <b>as</b> pretty. [...] "Do they have their flowers?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The song which Uvavnuk {{generally}} sang, {{and which}} she sang quite suddenly the first evening, without knowing why, after the meteor had <b>struck</b> <b>her,</b> was <b>as</b> follows: ...|$|R
60|$|In {{her present}} mood this <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> only <b>as</b> {{persistent}} and somewhat egotistical. But {{she felt herself}} now on ground where she could deal firmly with him.|$|R
60|$|She {{noticed her}} father’s look of relief, and it <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> being significant.|$|E
6000|$|She {{found herself}} reduced simply to [...] "Please don't talk of all that"; a speech which hardly <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> {{improvement}} on the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--I don't know." [...] But {{she caught}} {{even as she}} spoke a rat-tat-tat of the knocker, which <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a sign. [...] "Ah there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{answered}} with a quick laugh; {{the tone of his}} remark <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> almost <b>as</b> the accent of comedy. [...] "Do you suppose if I were not I'd tell you?" ...|$|R
60|$|The pause {{seemed to}} lengthen, between them, and Marjorie's remark {{when she made}} it at last <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> even <b>as</b> she made it as being but poorly conceived. She had some weak idea of being self-depreciatory.|$|R
6000|$|But Noel {{shook her}} head. At that moment she <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> father <b>as</b> startlingly grown-up-so composed, swaying above {{that young man}} at her feet, whose sunny face was all adoration. 'No longer a child!' he thought. 'Dear Nollie!' ...|$|R
60|$|Mamie obediently departed. Later, when Keggs was {{spreading}} {{the news of}} Kirk's departure in the servants' hall, she remembered that his manner had <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> strange.|$|E
60|$|Flora {{smiled and}} drove away shortly afterward, {{considering}} what he had said. She had noticed a trace of confusion in his manner and it <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> significant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why are {{you reading}} your will?" [...] she asked again, {{beginning}} to tremble, for her nerves were afire, and this simple accident <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> something awful and ominous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come hither, Robert"--said Mrs. Willoughby, {{pointing}} to a chair at her side--with a gravity that <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> son <b>as</b> unusual--"I have brought you here to listen {{to one of the}} old-fashioned lectures, of which you got so many when a boy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Arnold {{managed to}} beach and destroy {{four of the}} galleys and his own flagship, , {{while most of the}} {{remaining}} ships escaped upriver. Only Washington, {{at the rear of the}} van, was captured by the enemy; she <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> colors, <b>as</b> Arnold reported later, [...] "... after receiving a few broadsides." ...|$|R
60|$|If Elizabeth could {{but have}} heard this! Such {{personal}} praise might have <b>struck</b> <b>her,</b> especially <b>as</b> {{it did not}} appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened. But everything must take its chance. The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also to marry. As for herself, she might always command a home with Lady Russell.|$|R
60|$|But her own existence, and not Mr. Melbury's, was {{the centre}} of Marty's consciousness, {{and it was in}} {{relation}} to this that the matter <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> she slowly withdrew.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Beale was {{prepared}} with a reply that <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> absolutely magnificent. [...] "You shall have such lessons as you've never had in all your life. You shall go to courses." ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{interested}} by the swearing of the witnesses. The kissing {{of the book}} <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> particularly odd, and then the policemen gave their evidence in staccato jerks and stereotyped phrases.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} Ian awoke, and hastened {{to the cave}} where the old hag was sitting, and he <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> dead <b>as</b> she was, before she could cast spells on him. Next he {{sprinkled}} the water over the heroes, who came to life again, and together they all journeyed {{to the other side}} of the island, and there the raven met them.|$|R
60|$|But {{already she}} had {{recovered}} from this sudden attack of faintness and dizziness, of which, with characteristic impatience for all feminine weaknesses, {{she was now}} thoroughly ashamed. Her nervous system had received so many severe shocks {{in the course of}} this terrible and memorable day, that it was small wonder that this last awful blow <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> physically <b>as</b> well as mentally.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie debated, {{then after}} an instant took her cue from Mrs. Beale's absence of anger, which <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> the more <b>as</b> {{she had felt}} how much of her courage she needed. [...] "From Mrs. Wix," [...] she admitted.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I didn't {{love the}} man I was engaged to," [...] she said. She met {{his eyes for}} a moment, and could not {{interpret}} their expression. They <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> cold and indifferent.|$|E
60|$|It <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> {{slightly}} comic, {{not knowing}} that the little scene was the outcome of that word. In truth, the contrast between Miltoun and his parents at this moment was almost ludicrous.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was passing}} him when {{suddenly}} he <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> so forlorn {{that she was}} inspired to say: [...] "No one has ever loved me--not in that way--if that's what you mean. Nobody, would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Cacique {{is a man}} of discretion," [...] {{observed}} the captain, with all his usual dryness of manner, [...] "and will, doubtless, recollect his obligations to posterity and himself, though he be found entangled in the mazes of a combat. But I marvel that he does not return, for some time has now elapsed since the schooner <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> flag, <b>as</b> my own eyes have witnessed." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1807, {{when the}} captain of United States frigate Chesapeake refused to permit {{officers}} of HMS Leopard to search her for deserters from the Royal Navy, Leopard ranged alongside Chesapeake and fired into her for ten minutes until Chesapeake <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> colors <b>as</b> a token of surrender. The British {{refused to accept the}} ship as a prize of war, the two nations being at peace. Log of U.S. frigate Chesapeake: [...] "Having one Gun ready fired and hauld down our Colours. the Leopard ceased firing and sent her Boat on board." ...|$|R
60|$|The meagreness of the {{furniture}} and tableware never <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> so forcibly <b>as</b> now, lost in the big new house. Intellectual poverty was shown also {{in the absence of}} books and newspapers, for John Dutcher read little, even of political newspapers, and magazines were quite outside his experimental knowledge till Rose brought a few home with her in her later vacations.|$|R
60|$|Helen colored, and as {{she turned}} her head it <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> portentous that she glanced towards the saffron streak that glimmered in the West. When she looked back, however, her face was calm.|$|E
60|$|The action <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> theatrical, {{her mind}} being filled with another picture, {{that of a}} man {{motionless}} and erect, with pale, expressionless face, which yet had meant so much more of reality to her.|$|E
60|$|His {{companion}} {{was still}} puzzled. She {{could find no}} fault with him for being modest about his exploit, but that he should {{make it clear that}} he did not require her gratitude <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> unnecessary.|$|E
6000|$|She read it half aloud, {{mingled with}} commentary, as she proceeded, and {{once or twice}} came to a pause over an {{illegible}} word, on which occasions her visitor helped her to the word without looking at the letter. This circumstance <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> at last <b>as</b> somewhat singular, for she looked up suddenly, and said, [...] "You appear, sir, {{to be familiar with}} the contents of my letter." ...|$|R
500|$|Flambeaus foretopmast was {{in danger}} of being {{dismasted}} from damage it had received from Enterprise, so the French captain sent men aloft to try to repair it. However after a sudden gust of wind the mast flew off the ship carrying six French sailors with it. [...] Enterprise ceased her attacks upon Flambeau and sent out a boat to rescue the French sailors adrift on the topmast. After rescuing the French topmen, Enterprise caught up with the French brig and came alongside. Before the action could continue the French captain <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> colours <b>as</b> Flambeaus medicine chest had been destroyed and the hull compromised multiple times.|$|R
6000|$|A vague {{idea came}} across Lizzie's {{mind that this}} glowing {{language}} had {{a taste of the}} Bible about it, and that, therefore, it was in some degree impersonal, and intended to be pious. She did not relish piety at such a crisis as this, and was, therefore, for a moment inclined to be cold. But she liked being called a flower, and was not quite sure whether she remembered her Bible rightly. The words which <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> ear <b>as</b> familiar might have come from Juan and Haidee, and if so, nothing could be more opportune. [...] "Do you expect me to give you answer now, Mr. Emilius?" ...|$|R
