40|$|Abstract. Echinococcus multilocularis, the causative {{agent of}} {{alveolar}} echinococcosis, is spreading geographically in Europe, and prevalence rates in foxes, the final host, are increasing. Concomitantly, {{the rate of}} newly diagnosed human infections has already doubled in Germany. We report a cluster of alveolar echinococcosis in 24 animals of different Old World monkey species (15 cynomolgus monkeys, 5 rhesus monkeys, and 4 lion-tailed macaques) in northern Germany. The cluster described is the largest ever recorded in a single center. Cynomolgus monkeys were very susceptible and constituted the monkey species at highest risk, indicating that this species could act as a <b>sentinel</b> <b>animal</b> for the transmission of alveolar echinococcosis in zoological gardens or similar institutions...|$|E
40|$|Genotoxic air {{pollution}} is ubiquitous in urban and industrial areas. A variety of studies has linked human exposure to {{air pollution}} {{with a number}} of different somatic cell endpoints including cancer. However, the potential for inducing mutations in the human germline remains unclear. <b>Sentinel</b> <b>animal</b> studies of germline mutations at tandem-repeat loci (specifically minisatellites and expanded simple tandem repeats) have recently provided proof of principle that germline mutations can be induced in vertebrates (birds and mice) by air pollution under ambient conditions. Although humans may also be susceptible to induced germline mutations in polluted areas, uncertainties regarding causative agents, doses, and mutational mechanisms at repetitive DNA loci currently preclude extrapolation from animal data to the evaluation of human risk. Nevertheless, several recent studies have linked air pollution exposure to DNA damage in human sperm, indicating that our germ cells are not impervious to the genotoxic effects of air pollution. Thus, both <b>sentinel</b> <b>animal</b> and human studies have raised the possibility that ambient air pollution may increase human germline mutation rates, especially at repetitive DNA loci. Given that some human genetic conditions appear to be modulated by length mutations at tandem-repeat loci (e. g. HRAS 1 cancers, type 1 diabetes, etc.), there is an urgent need for extensive study in this area. Research should be primarily focused upon: (1) the direct measurement of mutation frequencies at repetitive DNA loci in human male germ cells as a function of air pollution exposure, (2) large-scale epidemiology studies of inherited disorders and tandem-repeat associated genetic conditions and air pollution, and (3) the characterization of mutational mechanisms at hypervariable tandem-repeat loci...|$|E
40|$|The {{threat of}} {{smallpox}} release and {{use as a}} bioweapon has encouraged the search for new vaccines and antiviral drugs, as well as development of new small-animal models in which their efficacy can be determined. Here, we reinvestigate a rabbit model in which the intradermal infection of rabbits with very low doses of either rabbitpox virus (RPV) or vaccinia virus Western Reserve (VV-WR) recapitulates many of the clinical features of human smallpox. Following intradermal inoculation with RPV, rabbits develop systemic disease characterized by extensive viremia, numerous secondary lesions on the skin and mucocutaneous tissues, severe respiratory disease, death by 9 days postinfection, and, importantly, natural aerosol transmission between animals. Contrary to previous reports, intradermal infection with VV-WR also resulted in a very similar lethal systemic disease in rabbits, again with natural aerosol transmission between <b>animals.</b> When <b>sentinel</b> and index <b>animals</b> were cohoused, transmission rates approached 100 % with either virus, with <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> exhibiting a similar, severe disease. Lower rates of transmission were observed when index and <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> were housed in separate cages. <b>Sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> infected with RPV with one exception succumbed to the disease. However, the majority of VV-WR-infected <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals,</b> while becoming seriously ill, survived. Finally, we tested {{the efficacy of the}} drug 1 -O-hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir in the RPV/rabbit model and found that an oral dose of 5 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days beginning 1 day before infection was able to completely protect rabbits from lethal disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We used <b>sentinel</b> <b>animal</b> {{enclosures}} {{to measure}} the rate of infestation by the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans, in an urban community of Arequipa, Peru, and to evaluate the effect of deltamethrin-impregnated netting on that rate. Impregnated netting decreased the rate of infestation of sentinel enclosures (rate ratio, 0. 23; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 13 – 0. 38; P < 0. 001), controlling for the density of surrounding vector populations and the distance of these to the sentinel enclosures. Most migrant insects were early-stage nymphs, which {{are less likely to}} carry the parasitic agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi. Spread of the vector in the city therefore likely precedes spread of the parasite. Netting was particularly effective against adult insects and late-stage nymphs; taking into account population structure, netting decreased the reproductive value of migrant populations from 443. 6 to 40. 5. Impregnated netting can slow the spread of T. infestans and is a potentially valuable tool in the control of Chagas disease...|$|E

Two groups of chickens on six farms were compared in this study: (i) young, 2 – 3 month-old broiler-type chickens reared as <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> on the farms and (ii) adult chickens reared on the same farms for more than one year. Seroconversion rates of 7. 0 % or 5. 7 % were observed in sentinel broiler chickens reared for a period of 74 days (January–April 2010) or 88 days (August–November 2010) respectively, as shown by a T. gondii specific immunofluorescent antibody test. Fifty-three percent (17 of 32) of adult chickens were positive and showed higher titres than <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals.</b> Isolation of T. gondii from tissues (brain and heart) of serologically positive chickens was achieved from six of seven free-range adult birds with IFAT titres of 200 and higher. The isolated parasites were analysed by multi-locus polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The isolated T. gondii showed three different genotypes: two genotypes consisted in atypical allele combinations, and the remaining genotype had exclusively clonal type II alleles. All isolates obtained at a single farm, corresponded to the same genotype. The T. gondii genotypes observed are identical to those described in cats, dogs, chickens and capybaras elsewhere in South America.

Serum {{was obtained from}} 114 roe deer, and 513 Ixodes ricinus, predominantly females (72 %), were obtained from 47 animals (41 %). The polymerase chain reaction was used to detect DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato {{in a total of}} 190 ticks, comprising 106 engorged ticks and 84 non-engorged ticks. Borrelia DNA was detected in 24 engorged ticks (23 %) and 26 non-engorged ticks (31 %). This difference was not significant (P = 0. 25). Four species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato were identified in the ticks. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii and group VS 116. B. afzelii was most commonly found and present in 13 mixed infections, and in 28 single infections.

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, vector-borne {{diseases}} have been spreading into countries previously free of these agents. It is necessary for a surveillance method to be tailored to the biology of these agents in order to detect their incursion. Using a sentinel herd system, {{it is possible to}} target high-risk areas where occurrence is most probably due to vector presence. Since the 1970 s, diseases such as Akabane, vesicular stomatitis and Bluetongue disease have successfully been monitored using cattle herds as sentinels in many countries such as Saudi Arabia, Australia, China, Indonesia, Sultanate of Oman and most recently in countries in Western Europe. This paper reviews {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} sentinel herd surveillance systems in general. In order to determine their efficacy, the following criteria were found to be essential: the choice of sentinel locations, <b>sentinel</b> <b>animal,</b> seasonality of sampling and diagnostic testing methods. We conclude that due to its ability to focus on a specific disease, sentinel herd systems have been successful in the early detection of the spread of a targeted agent.

40|$|International {{audience}} 5 -[(4 -bromophenyl) methyl]- 2 -phenyl- 5 H-imidazo[4, 5 -c]pyridine (BPIP) is {{a representative}} molecule {{of a novel}} class of highly active inhibitors of the replication of Classical swine fever virus (CSFV). We recently demonstrated in a proof of concept study that the molecule has a marked effect on viral replication in CSFV-infected pigs. Here, the effect of antiviral treatment on virus transmission to untreated sentinel pigs was studied. Therefore, BPIP-treated pigs (n= 4), intra- muscularly infected with CSFV, were placed into contact with untreated sentinel pigs (n= 4). Efficient transmission of CSFV from four untreated seeder pigs to four untreated sentinels was observed. In contrast, only two out of four <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> in contact with BPIP-treated seeder animals developed a short transient infection, of which one was likely the result of sentinel to sentinel transmission. A significant lower viral genome load was measured in tonsils of sentinels in contact with BPIP treated seeder animals compared to the positive control group (p= 0. 015). Although no significant difference (p= 0. 126) {{in the time of}} onset of viraemia could be detected between the groups of contact animals, a tendency towards the reduction of virus transmission was observed. Since <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> were left untreated in this exploratory trial, the study can be regarded as a worst case scenario and gives therefore an underestimation of the potential efficacy of the activity of BPIP on virus transmission...|$|R

Two groups of 6 carrier animals received either a non-medicated feed (control group) or feed medicated with 400 ppm of tilmicosin phosphate (treated group) for 30 d. Three sentinel pigs were then introduced in each group and left for 29 d. The presence of A. pleuropneumoniae in tonsils was monitored using several techniques, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

40|$|Mechanisms for {{monitoring}} Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus activity include surveillance of human cases, surveillance for activity in <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals,</b> monitoring of mosquito vectors and monitoring of weather conditions. The monitoring of human cases {{is only one}} possible trigger for public health action and the additional surveillance systems are used in concert to signal the risk of human disease, often before the appearance of human cases. Mosquito vector surveillance includes mosquito trapping for speciation and enumeration of mosquitoes to monitor population sizes and relative composition. Virus isolation from mosquitoes can also be undertaken. Monitoring of weather conditions and vector surveillance determines {{whether there is a}} potential for MVE activity to occur. Virus isolation from trapped mosquitoes is necessary to define whether MVE is actually present, but is difficult to deliver in a timely fashion in some jurisdictions. Monitoring of <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> indicates whether MVE transmission to vertebrates is actually occurring. Meteorological surveillance can assist in the prediction of potential MVE virus activity by signalling conditions that have been associated with outbreaks of Murray Valley encephalitis in humans in the past. Predictive models of MVE virus activity for south-eastern Australia have been developed, but due to the infrequency of outbreaks, are yet to be demonstrated as useful for the forecasting of major outbreaks. Surveillance mechanisms vary across the jurisdictions. Surveillance of human disease occurs in all States and Territories by reporting of cases to health authorities. Sentinel flocks of chickens are maintained in 4 jurisdictions (Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Victoria and New South Wales) with collaborations between Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Mosquito monitoring complements the surveillance of <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> in these jurisdictions. In addition, other mosquito monitoring programs exist in other States (including South Australia and Queensland). Public health control measures may include advice to the general public and mosquito management programs to reduce the numbers of both mosquito larvae and adult vectors. Strategic plans for public health action in the event of MVE virus activity are currently developed or being developed in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. A southern tri-State agreement exists between health departments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care. All partners have agreed to co-operate and provide assistance in predicting and combatting outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease in south-eastern Australia.

The frequency of micronucleus was quantified to group the sampled goats into MN-positive and MN-negative groups for further analysis. Results: MN was positive in 21 % of the sampled goats with varying frequency ranging from (6 - 15 % count per 2000 cells examined). Bi-nucleation, multi-nucleation and high mitotic index were also observed and quantified. The packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume and neutrophil count were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in the MN-positive groups while anemia was reported in 33. 3 % of the MN-positive goats. Conclusion: The finding indicates the prevalence and frequency of micronucleus as a biomarker of genotoxicity and an indicator of exposure to environmental genotoxic subtances. Hence, this highlights the relevance of these goats as important <b>sentinel</b> <b>animal</b> model. These findings, therefore, serve as a preliminary data for further studies on the latent genotoxic environmental contaminants and their potential deleterious impact.

40|$|As a {{class of}} {{brominated}} flame-retardants (BFRs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used in industrial products. PBDEs have been detected in local terrestrial biota from the Laizhou Bay in China. They can induce various toxiciides, such as hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and endocrine disrupting effects in animals. In this work, we characterized the dose-responsive effects of 2, 2 ', 4, 4 '-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 47) in earthworrn Eisenia fetida using an integrated proteomic and metabolomic approach. Metabolic responses indicated that BDE 47 mainly caused disturbance in osmotic regulation and energy metabolism marked by differentially altered betaine, amino acids, ATP, glucose, maltose and succinate in E. fetida. Proteomic responses revealed that BDE 47 induced cell apoptosis (or injury), oxidative stress, disturbance in protein biosynthesis and energy metabolism in E. fetida in terms of differential proteomic biomarkers. Especially, the increased ATP was confirmed by up-regulated nucleoside diphosphate kinase A and ATP synthase in 1 and 100 mu g/L of BDE 47 -treated groups, respectively. In addition, several metabolic biomarkers including betaine, glycine and 2 -hexyl- 5 -ethyl- 3 -furansulfonate were relatively stable in all BIDE 47 -exposed groups. This work demonstrated that proteomics and metabolomics could partially validate one another and their combination could better understand toxicological effects of environmental pollutants. Biological significance As {{a class of}} brominated flame-retardants (BFRs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used in industrial products and have been detected in local terrestrial biota from the Laizhou Bay in China.

40|$|Monkeypox (MPX) is a {{zoonotic}} disease endemic in Central and West Africa and {{is caused by}} Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the most virulent Orthopoxvirus affecting humans since the eradication of Variola virus (VARV). Many aspects of the MPXV transmission cycle, including the natural host of the virus, remain unknown. African rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.) are considered potential reservoirs of MPXV, as serosurveillance data in Central Africa has confirmed the circulation of the virus in these rodent species [1, 2]. In {{order to understand the}} tissue tropism and clinical signs associated with infection with MPXV in these species, wild-caught rope squirrels were experimentally infected via intranasal and intradermal exposure with a recombinant MPXV strain from Central Africa engineered to express the luciferase gene. After infection, we monitored viral replication and shedding via in vivo bioluminescent imaging, viral culture and real time PCR. MPXV infection in African rope squirrels caused mortality and moderate to severe morbidity, with clinical signs including pox lesions in the skin, eyes, mouth and nose, dyspnea, and profuse nasal discharge. Both intranasal and intradermal exposures induced high levels of viremia, fast systemic spread, and long periods of viral shedding. Shedding and luminescence peaked at day 6 post infection and was still detectable after 15 days. Interestingly, one <b>sentinel</b> <b>animal,</b> housed in the same room but in a separate cage, also developed severe MPX disease and was euthanized. This study indicates that MPXV causes significant pathology in African rope squirrels and infected rope squirrels shed large quantities of virus, supporting their role as a potential source of MPXV transmission to humans and other animals in endemic MPX regions...|$|E

30|$|Imaging {{platforms}} {{can easily}} become hubs for (potentially) pathogenic microorganisms. Several precautions help to minimize this risk. Animal facilities, and in particular, those transferring animals to others, should monitor the facility {{according to a}} list of specified pathogens and keep book in health certificates [17]. Several organizations offer analytical services to test <b>sentinel</b> <b>animals</b> or excreta for contamination with defined microorganisms. Before exchanging animals between facilities, the health certificates need to be exchanged, and only if the receiving facility’s negative list of pathogens is tested negative over a defined time period in the source facility/facilities, the animals can be transferred. Alternatively, and if infrastructure and risk assessment allow, rooms with differing hygiene levels or quarantine rooms can be defined and common instruments cleaned and decontaminated accordingly. However, it should be kept in mind that any infection or its treatment could affect the imaging results.|$|R
