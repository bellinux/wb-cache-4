5|$|Heinrich von Treitschke's History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, {{published}} in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges {{the history of}} Prussia over the history of other German states, and it {{tells the story of}} the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this Borussian myth (Borussia is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this. According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. The story continues by drawing on Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon's power in 1815, at Waterloo, creating <b>some</b> <b>semblance</b> of economic unity, and uniting Germans under one proud flag after 1871.|$|E

60|$|Arriving in England {{at the end}} of July 1884, Stevenson took up his {{quarters}} first for a few weeks at Richmond. He was compelled to abandon the hope of making his permanent home at Hyères, partly by the renewed failure there of his own health, partly by a bad outbreak of cholera which occurred in the old Provençal town about the time he left it. After consultation with several doctors, all of whom held out hopes of ultimate recovery despite the gravity of his present symptoms, he moved to Bournemouth. Here he found in the heaths and pinewoods <b>some</b> distant <b>semblance</b> of the landscape of his native Scotland, and in the sandy curves of the Channel coast a passable substitute for the bays and promontories of his beloved Mediterranean. At all events, he liked the place well enough to be willing to try it for a home; and such it became for all but three years, from September 1884 to August 1887. These, although in the matter of health the worst and most trying years of his life, were in the matter of work some of the most active and successful. For the first two or three months the Stevensons occupied a lodging on the West Cliff called Wensleydale; for the next five, from mid-November 1884 to mid-April 1885, they were tenants of a house named Bonallie Towers, pleasantly situated amid the pinewoods of Branksome Park, and by its name recalling familiar Midlothian associations. Lastly, about Easter 1885, they entered into occupation of a house of their own, given by the elder Mr. Stevenson as a special gift to his daughter-in-law, and renamed by its new occupants Skerryvore, in reminiscence of one of the great lighthouse works carried out by the family firm off the Scottish coast.|$|R

5000|$|Hauptamt II {{officials}} under Viktor Brack {{played a}} vital role in organizing the killing of mentally ill and physically handicapped people in the Action T4 [...] "euthanasia" [...] programme, especially the child [...] "euthanasia" [...] from 1939. By a (backdated) decree of 1 September, Hitler appointed Bouhler and his personal physician Karl Brandt to manage the euthanasia program, where they would oversee the murder of physically and/or mentally disabled persons. The implementation of the killing operations were left to subordinates such as Brack and SA-Oberführer Werner Blankenburg. Besides Hitler's Chancellery, only a handful of personnel were privy to {{the inner workings of the}} euthanasia program so as to maintain secrecy, which is part of the reason Hitler chose Bouhler, as he knew the KdF [...] "could direct the killings without involving too many people and without becoming too visible." [...] During the killing phase related to euthanizing children, the KdF chose the cover title, Reich Committee for the Scientific Registration of Severe Hereditary Ailments, which only actually existed on paper; code names were also employed by members of the KdF for matters dealing with euthanasia. In order to provide <b>some</b> additional <b>semblance</b> of legitimacy to the operation, three doctors or [...] "certifiers" [...] also had to concur over any diagnosis before a [...] "merciful death" [...] could be administered, which included the final signature of a psychiatrist—all of which really boiled down to the economic considerations regarding the person's ability to work. To execute the deportations, the Gemeinnützige Krankentransport GmbH camouflage organization was established, residing on Tiergartenstraße No. 4. Just like earlier euthanasia operations, secrecy was again paramount, as Hitler explicitly told Bouhler concerning Aktion T4, [...] "the Führer's Chancellery must under no circumstances be seen to be active in this matter." [...] Many KdF employees who participated in T4 later joined the Operation Reinhard killings executed under Odilo Globocnik in the Polish General Gouvernement.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{exploitation}} {{movies in the}} original sense continued to appear: 1961's Damaged Goods, a cautionary tale about a young lady whose boyfriend’s promiscuity leads to venereal disease, comes complete with enormous, grotesque closeups of VD's physical manifestations. At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a closely related and similarly venerable tradition: “nudie" [...] films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, This Nude World, which promised an [...] "Authentic Trip Through an American Nudist Colony!", was [...] "Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!" [...] In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters specifically devoted themselves to [...] "adult" [...] product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with <b>some</b> greater <b>semblance</b> of plots. Best known was Russ Meyer, who released his first successful narrative nudie, The Immoral Mr. Teas, in 1959. Five years later, on a sub-$100,000 budget, Meyer came out with Lorna, [...] "a harder-edged film that combined sex with gritty realism and violence." [...] Meyer would build an underground reputation as a talented director with movies such as Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) and Vixen! (1968), the sort of films, virtually ignored by the mainstream press, that had become known as sexploitation pictures. Another leading director in the genre was Joseph Sarno, who had his first commercial success in 1963 with Sin in the Suburbs. Many of his subsequent films, including the artistically crafted Red Roses of Passion (1966) and Odd Triangle (1968), examined the hesitant transformation of sexual mores among the American middle class. Films such as Meyer's and Sarno's—though not sexually explicit during this period—were largely relegated to the fringe circuit of [...] "adult" [...] theaters, while AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1966), starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, played drive-ins and other relatively reputable venues. Roger Corman's The Trip (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor Jack Nicholson, never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout. The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer.|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} pottery I make is {{work which}} is profoundly {{influenced by the}} groupings of objects that I have both consciously and unconsciously looked at in my eleven years of retail experience at Menards. Most of these objects are unaesthetic individually, but when stacked and grouped together, become unusually compelling when seen from a distance, or {{in the field of}} peripheral vision. When I understood that this aspect of my life was informing my work, I became more attentive to the details like the negative spaces created around and between objects, and the intervals and spacings in and around objects. I became further aware of the dissonance and consonance of color relationships which happen in these compositions, and in their proximity to the colors offorms around and near them, as well as, issues of texture, and whether the objects are glossy, matte, or somewhere in between. Through this awareness of my environment, a large portion of my own work has come to be about how objects interrelate when combined in various ways, and how these combinations create meaning and context over and above their formal and functional properties. Being a skilled craftsman allows me to direct the viewers attention away from questioning whether or not the objects are well made. This is where I stand my ground most firmly. I will not tolerate shoddy workmanship. This causes me to work within a range of control, in small series 2 ̆ 7 which deviate from each other only slightly. This also means my work evolves less dramatically. Although my objects appear similar one to another within a group, by highlighting crevices, edges and protrusions with glaze and the effects of atmospheric firing, I accentuate the sense of what clay does. Even when I choose not to fire in an atmospheric kiln, I use glazes I have developed or altered to show the subtleties in the form, and react to nuances in a similar manner. Clay responds to the way one touches it, and records information about what has been done to it in the process, much like human skin. I direct process, controlling how the clay frays at the edges, curls around itself and tears under movement, making each object unique and lively. I retain just enough control in the process of making and working to allow the objects <b>some</b> small <b>semblance</b> of freedom to retain their essence of the handmade. In many cases this necessitates the making of specialized tools, equipment, glazes, and the use of other materials like wood and steel to accomplish the goals I set out for my work...|$|R

The Tuscan Guelphs refused to attend the ceremony, and began preparing for resistance to Henry’s imperial dreams. As part of his program of political rehabilitation, he recalled the Visconti, the ousted former rulers of Milan from exile. Guido della Torre, who had thrown the Visconti out of Milan, objected and organised a revolt against Henry that was ruthlessly put down, and the Visconti were returned to power, with Henry appointing Matteo I Visconti as the Imperial vicar of Milan. He also imposed his brother-in-law, Amadeus of Savoy, as the vicar-general in Lombardy. These measures, plus a massive levy imposed on the Italian towns, caused the Guelph cities to turn against Henry, and he encountered further resistance when he sought to enforce imperial claims on what had become communal lands and rights, and attempted to replace communal regulations with imperial laws.
