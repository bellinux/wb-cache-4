Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the <b>swelling</b> {{of the area}} around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the <b>swelling.</b> The area of <b>swelling</b> may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E

50|$|Researchers have {{attempted}} to determine {{the characteristics of the}} primate species displaying these exaggerated <b>swellings.</b> It has been identified that species which exhibit exaggerated sexual <b>swellings</b> predominantly live in multi-male social systems; large social groups with multiple adults of both sexes, as well as their offspring. Indeed, species with such <b>swellings</b> have twice as many males per group than those without. Furthermore, whilst 71% of Old World primate species living in multi-male groups show exaggerated <b>swellings,</b> no females living within single-male groups do. In some instances, however, sexual <b>swellings</b> can be seen in primate societies with alternative mating systems; for example, female langur monkeys exhibit <b>swellings</b> but live within polygamous single-male groups.|$|R

5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and <b>swelling</b> of the graphite moderator {{known as the}} Wigner effect. The <b>swelling</b> damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E
50|$|Primates {{with exaggerated}} sexual <b>swellings</b> also {{demonstrate}} non-seasonal breeding patterns, longer mating periods and longer ovulation cycles. Specifically, of the 23 species which are both non-seasonal breeders {{and live in}} multi-male societies, 91% have sexual <b>swellings.</b> Nonetheless, nonseasonal reproductive environments are not a necessary precursor for the selection of sexual <b>swellings.</b> Indeed, females who are seasonal breeders, such as the female Barbary macaques, also exhibit exaggerated sexual <b>swellings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Though much is {{understood}} {{about the physical}} characteristics of sexual <b>swellings,</b> their exact functional significance remains controversial. The role of sexual selection {{in the evolution of}} these <b>swellings</b> features in many hypotheses, and has, since Darwin, been assumed to play a significant role. Hypothesised functions of sexual <b>swellings</b> often focus on <b>swellings</b> in terms of female mating strategies. These range from advertising fertility and quality (e.g. Reliable Indicator), maximising potential mates to confuse paternity of offspring (e.g. Many-Males), to aiding in a female's assessment of the best possible mating partners (e.g. Best-Male), and even assuring paternity certainty (e.g. Obvious-Ovulation), and all aim to account for aspects of exaggerated sexual <b>swellings.</b> This section covers the range of hypotheses that provide explanations of proposed functions for these <b>swellings.</b>|$|R

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the <b>swelling</b> has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle <b>swelling</b> directly.|$|E

50|$|Sexual <b>swellings</b> are water-filled edemas of {{mainly the}} {{external}} or internal genitalia of female primates. However, the <b>swellings</b> can also {{extend to the}} skin of the circumanal, subcausal and paracallosal regions. Such <b>swellings</b> can be categorized into two groups: small and exaggerated. Small <b>swellings</b> are characterised by a moderate size and pinkness of the genitalia, and can be found in Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, prosimians and gibbons. In contrast, exaggerated <b>swellings</b> are larger in size, and their prevalence is mainly restricted to Old World primate species. For instance, they occur in all species of Cercocebus, Mandrillus, Theropithecus, Papio and Pan, and in most macaques, colobines and guenons.|$|R

40|$|SummaryHereditary angio-oedema {{is caused}} by a {{heterozygous}} deficiency of C 1 inhibitor. This inhibitor regulates several inflammatory pathways, and patients with hereditary angio-oedema have intermittent cutaneous or mucosal <b>swellings</b> because of a failure to control local production of bradykinin. <b>Swellings</b> typically evolve in several hours and persist for a few days. In addition to orofacial angio-oedema, painless <b>swellings</b> affect peripheries, which causes disfigurement or interference with work and other activities of daily living. Angio-oedema affecting the gastrointestinal tract or abdominal viscera causes severe pain often with vomiting due to oedematous bowel obstruction. About 2 % of <b>swellings</b> involve the larynx and can be fatal if untreated. About 50 % of patients have laryngeal <b>swellings</b> that are potentially fatal despite prophylaxis. In this Seminar we review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of hereditary angio-oedema, with specific emphasis on the new treatments available for acute <b>swellings...</b>|$|R
50|$|Though heavily investigated, the {{ultimate}} function of sexual <b>swellings</b> remains unknown. Over the last 50 years, eight principal explanations have been proposed, each claiming {{to account for}} the function of exaggerated <b>swellings.</b> Alone, however, no single hypothesis is believed {{to account for the}} function of sexual swellings; a combination of these theories may be more appropriate. In line with this ideal, the most recent account regarding the function of sexual <b>swellings</b> (the graded-signals hypothesis) combines several existing theories in the attempt to provide a more comprehensive account of sexual <b>swellings.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, <b>swelling</b> and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term <b>swelling</b> and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E

5000|$|An altered {{version of}} Holland and Rice’s chase-away model is cited {{to explain the}} {{function}} of sexual <b>swellings.</b> The chase-away model is governed {{by the idea of}} [...] "sensory exploitation", in which traits evolve to greatly stimulate the perceivers’ sensory system. As a result, these traits serve to manipulate a perceiver’s behaviour in favour of the signaller. In the specific case of sexual <b>swellings,</b> it is a male’s inherent preference for large <b>swellings</b> as a signal of fertility is exploited to combat male resistance to mate Therefore, small sexual <b>swellings</b> are thought to have become exaggerated as a form of antagonistic coevolution.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the arrangement of synapses on local axon collaterals of Golgi-stained pyramidal neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex. As synaptic markers we considered axonal <b>swellings</b> visible at high magnification under the light microscope. Such axonal <b>swellings</b> coincide with synaptic boutons, as has been demonstrated {{in a number of}} combined light and electron microscopic studies. These studies also indicated that, in most cases, one bouton corresponds precisely to one synapse. Golgi-impregnated axonal trees of 20 neocortical pyramidal neurons were drawn with a camera lucida. Axonal <b>swellings</b> were marked on the drawings. Most <b>swellings</b> were lsquoen passantrsquo; occasionally, they were situated at the tip of short, spine-like processes. On axon collaterals, the average interval between <b>swellings</b> was 4. 5 mgrm. On the axonal main stem, the <b>swellings</b> were always less densely packed than on the collaterals. Statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of the <b>swellings</b> did not reveal any special patterns. Instead, the arrangement of <b>swellings</b> on individual collaterals follows a Poisson distribution. Moreover, the same holds to a large extent for the entire collection of pyramidal cell collaterals. This suggests that a single Poisson process, characterized by only one rate parameter (number of synapses per unit length), describes most of the spatial distribution of synapses along pyramidal cell collaterals. These findings do not speak in favour of a pronounced target specificity of pyramidal neurons at the synaptic level. Instead, our results support a probabilistic model of cortical connectivity...|$|R
5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing <b>swelling</b> and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and <b>swelling.</b> Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or <b>swelling</b> {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the <b>swelling</b> may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E
