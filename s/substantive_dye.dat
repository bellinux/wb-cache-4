5000|$|<b>Substantive</b> <b>dye</b> is a dye that {{adheres to}} its substrate, {{typically}} a textile, by non-ionic forces. The amount of this attraction {{is known as}} [...] "substantivity": the higher the substantivity the greater the attraction of the dye for the fiber. Substantive dyes work best on textiles with high contents of cellulose, i.e. cotton. In contrast to direct dyes, wool and leather goods are dyed {{by the process of}} ion exchange, exploiting the cationic nature of proteins near neutral pH. The development of substantive dyes helped make mordant dyes obsolete.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The study {{investigated}} the effects of different methods of application of selected mordants on dyeing woven cotton with dyes from the stem bark of Albizia coriaria. The methods of application of mordants used includes; pre-mordanting, simultaneous mordanting and post-mordanting. The effects on cotton analyzed are color fastness to; light, washing, wet and dry rubbing and color characteristics on CIELab color coordinates. Aqueous extraction method was used to extract the dye. Some selected mordants were used for dyeing viz; alum, ferrous sulphate 1, and iron water. In the control dyeing {{without the use of}} mordants, very good fastness were registered with the following fastness ratings; for washing (4 - 5), dry rubbing (5), wet rubbing (5) and light (4). The natural dye is a <b>substantive</b> <b>dye</b> since it registered very good fastness grades without the use of mordants. The use of mordants improved color fastness to light from ratings of (4) to (5) and (6) for iron water and ferrous sulphate and a poor fastness of (3) was recorded for alum. Post-mordanting method registered the best overall fastness results and the best color strengths K/S values and color saturation values C. However, the most brilliant colors were registered with simultaneous mordanting method with all mordants. However, there was no observable effect of mordanting methods on the redness or yellowness of color. Index Terms- Albizia Coriaria, color fastness, mordanting, <b>substantive</b> <b>dye.</b> I...|$|E

40|$|The color {{which is}} {{obtained}} from the leaves of Henna, that is, Lawsonia inermis L., is used frequently in hair coloring. It is the chemical lawsone {{that is responsible for}} the reddish brown color. Its content makes it a <b>substantive</b> <b>dye</b> for dyeing the textile materials. This work concerns with the extraction and purification of natural dyestuff from a plant Lawsonia inermis L. and dyeing of cotton and silk fabric in exhaust dyeing method. The dye portion is isolated from the total extract by column chromatography and is evaluated by dyeing cotton and silk under different dyeing conditions. The color strength and fastness properties of the dye are undertaken by changing mordant and techniques of mordanting. The changes of colors have been noticed by using different types of mordant. The dye exhaustion percentage, wash, rubbing, and light fastness results reveal that the extract of henna can be used for coloration of cotton and silk fabric...|$|E
30|$|A mordant is a {{substance}} that can form complexes between dye and fiber to increase affinity, substantivity, and fastness properties (Dean 2014; Haar et al. 2013; Prabhu and Bhute 2012). Potassium aluminum sulfate is the commonly used metallic mordant for protein fibers with aluminum acetate seeing increased use for cellulose fibers (Brown et al. 2010; Haar et al. 2013). The more toxic metallic mordants of copper, tin, and chrome are not typically used by today’s craft and artisan dyer, yet these chemicals are still being included in some natural dye research. Natural or biomordants from aluminum accumulating plants and high tannin content plants are being explored as substitutes for the manufactured metallic mordants along with other alternative materials and methods (Cunningham et al. 2011; Flint 2001; Ismal et al. 2014; Kadolph and Casselman 2004; Vankar et al. 2008). Trees with high tannin content are often classified as a <b>substantive</b> <b>dye</b> which do not require a metallic mordant, but may {{also be used as}} a mordant depending on their tannin amount and chemical structure (Dean 2014; Ismal et al. 2014; Prabhu and Bhute 2012). However, the addition of an aluminum metallic mordant when dyeing with tree parts can improve colorfastness properties and shift color hue (Cardon 2007; Casselman 1993; Doty and Haar 2012).|$|E

5000|$|Some dyestuffs, such as indigo and lichens, {{will give}} good color when used alone; these dyes are called direct <b>dyes</b> or <b>substantive</b> <b>dyes.</b> The {{majority}} of plant dyes, however, also {{require the use}} of a mordant, a chemical used to [...] "fix" [...] the color in the textile fibres.

40|$|Abstract: Direct or <b>substantive</b> <b>dyes</b> {{are widely}} used in the dyeing process of {{cellulosic}} fibres because of their easy handling. In contrast to natural dyes which must be mordanted {{in order to be}} applied on the same kind of substrates, direct dyes can be used directly. These dyes contain solubilizing sulfonic acid groups that are ionized in aqueous solution, and therefore the dye molecule is present in the dyebath as the anion. As result, an electrolyte must be added to the dye liquor because cellulose fibers have a negative surface charge in water, which would repel the dye anion. The cations of the electrolyte neutralize the negative charge and favor the adsorbtion of the dye ions on the fiber. The dye sorption can be described with the help of Nernst, Freundlich or Langmuir adsorption isotherms. The aim of the present work was to establish the influence of two important parameters (temperature and electrolyte concentration) on the dyeing of a cellulosic substrate- mercerized cotton- with one disazo direct dyes, through the study of the equilibrium isotherms. The dyeings were carried out at three different temperatures: 60 o, 86 o and 96 oC and at two sodium chloride concentrations: 4 g/L and 10 g/L. The study of the dyeing process was performed by comparing the experimental isotherms of the studied dyes with the classical sorption isotherms: Nernst, Freundlich and Langmuir. The most appropriate sorption model was established by linear regression analysis. Better statistical results were obtained in the case of Langmuir adsorption model...|$|R
50|$|Although {{almost all}} dyeing {{can be done}} in a vat, the term vat dye is used to {{describe}} a chemical class of dyes that are applied to cellulosic fibre (i.e.. cotton) using a redox reaction as described below. Because of the use of caustic soda, and the very high pH of the dye bath in the dyeing process, wool cannot be dyed using vat dyestuffs. Wool is soluble in caustic soda solutions.It is possible to dye wool at room temperatures with indigo (vat blue 1) and other low <b>substantive</b> vat <b>dyes</b> using soda ash as the alkali source with very little strength loss. Vat red 10, vat violet 13 and vat orange 1 can be applied in this manner as well.|$|R
30|$|Reactive dyes are {{the most}} <b>substantive</b> of <b>dyes</b> used on cotton because of their {{covalent}} bonding with glucoside hydroxyls. As a result, these dyes {{are the most}} resistant to extraction or destruction of all dye types. An aqueous solution of a strong base is typically used to remove the dyes from the cotton fiber. Complete extraction of reactive dyes was reported from bulk cotton treated with 1.5 % aqueous NaOH at 100 °C for 20  min (Dockery et al. 2009). The alcohol groups on the glucose units in the cellulose backbone of cotton act as a weak acid and are ionized under alkaline conditions. As cotton fibers partially dissolve in concentrated sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures, fabric strength loss occurred. As such, during alkaline dye reductive process fabric strength loss occurred. Strength loss of stripped fabric increased {{with the increase of}} stripping action provided by the elevated temperature and concentration of hydrose and caustic soda. Increased weight losses of stripped fabrics are the consequences of higher strength loss due to similar way.|$|R

On the way of our efforts, elucidating the dyeing properties of some fluorescent <b>dyes,</b> chiefly the <b>substantive</b> cotton <b>dyes</b> of stilben series, we have found some fundamental phenomena concerning the relationship between the intensity of fluorescence and the quantity of dyestuff dyed on the cotton fiber. Our chief results may be summerized as follows. 1) Fluorescence of the optical whitening agent on fibers as well as in solution, decreases its intensity as the concentration increases over a certain limit : so-called concentration quenching. 2) Quantitative relationship between the quantity of dyestuff on fiber and the intensity of fluorescence has been determined. 3) The difficulty of determining the apparent brightness of the dyed fibers was discussed. 4) Sensitizing effects of fluorescence by some neutral salts and soaps, are observed and this pr eliminary report is presented...|$|R

H 577 P ITC 2016 Boonroengxviii, 203 pages :illustrationsNowadays, the {{interest}} in natural dyes for textile application has been increasing due to the carcinogenic problems of certain petroleum-based synthetic dyes to human beings and animals and their difficulty in decomposition. In this work, curcumin was selected as a <b>substantive</b> natural <b>dye</b> which could be a potential alternative to synthetic yellow dye for textile coloration. The aims of the research are to investigate the dyeability of curcumin and to further develop useful functions and properties based on the chemical modification of curcumin. The research work started with the extraction of the curcumin from dry turmeric powder. The curcumin dye was then applied to dye cotton and other 3 synthetic substrates using conventional dyeing methods. The colors of the dyed samples were different shade of yellow with medium color strength. Polyester fabrics and acrylic yarns dyed exhibited satisfactory results of colorfastness to laundering and other, i. e., PLA and cotton exhibited low colorfastness to laundering. To improve dyeability and antibacterial activity of curcumin dye, the incorporation of N-phthaloyl glycine moiety into the structure of curcumin was attempted. Monoester curcumin with molecular weight of 555. 53 was obtained as a major product. The modified curcumin with N-phtaloyl protecting group was investigated for its dyeability and antibacterial activity. Color of monoester curcumin on polyester fabric was greenish yellow but remained unchanged as concentration of monoester curcumin increased. Its color strength on polyester fabric {{compared to that of}} curcumin-dyed polyester fabric was lower. These dyeing characteristics were in consistence with the occurrence of hypsochromic (blue) shift and hypochromic effect as indicated by the absorbance values of monoester curcumin. For antibacterial activity, monoester curcumin exhibited lower antibacterial activity than unmodified curcumin possibly due to the disappearance of a phenolic group. In another chemical modification of curcumin, glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTMAC) was chosen to introduce the quaternary amino moiety onto curcumin molecules via etherification reaction. The major product was characterized and identified as a quaternary ammonium cationized curcumin. As the result of the absorbance measurement, the maximum absorption wavelength of the GTMAC-modified curcumin or CurGTMAC was shifted to the region of ultraviolet radiation at 346 nm possibly due to the replacement of hydrogen atom of a phenolic group of curcumin with a quaternary ammonium group. From in vitro cytotoxicity test using 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and skin irritation test according to ISO 10993 - 10 : 2010, neither skin irritation nor obvious sign of cytotoxicity to the normal human skin fibroblast cells up to 125 μg/ml was observed. To increase the fixation between CurGTMAC and cotton, citric acid (CA) was primarily introduced to treat cotton fabric. Unreacted carboxyl group of citric acid remaining on CA-treated cotton may become ionized and subsequently react with CurGTMAC molecules in water during dyeing process. The color of dyed cotton was yellow with less saturation (C*) and more greenish tint compared to that of the unmodified curcumin-dyed cotton. The color strength (K/S) value at the concentration of 2 % o. w. f. of dyed cotton at the maximum absorption wavelength was 1. 95. In consequence of hypsochromic shift to near UV region with a high molar extinction coefficient (εmolar) of 1, 844 M⁻¹cm⁻¹, the treated cotton dyed with CurGTAMC was investigated for UV absorbing properties. The UPF rating of the treated cotton dyed with 1 % o. w. f. of CurGTMAC was higher than 100 according to AS/NZS 4399 : 1996. After 6 accelerated laundering cycles, equivalent to 30 home laundering cycles, UPF rating remained higher than 40 indicating the durability of UV-protection of the dyed cotton against accelerated laundering. With the knowledge of antibacterial property for curcumin, dyed samples were evaluated for their antibacterial property against both S. aureus and E. coli. The results showed that both curcumin and CurGTMAC provided bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal properties and CurGTMAC showed higher percentage of bacterial reduction than curcumin. The reaction of curcumin with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride in an aqueous system can be an indication of the successful use of renewable resources; that is curcumin and water. The use of water as a reaction media is currently gaining an importance in organic synthesis since it is more environmentally friendly and contributes less pollution to the environment compared to the use of volatile organic solvents. Moreover, the modification reaction conducted in this work could produce the modified curcumin possessing better properties in water solubility, dyeability, and antibacterial property on cotton and gaining additional UV protective property. It also can be an initiation to develop natural dyes to be more valuable and useful than their original structures. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.
