It was definitely {{not the first time}} he had astonished his opponents or the spectators. He was three or four years younger than the others. It was impossible not to realize that we were witnessing <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his work}} as a barrister, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. His first play was The Moscow Doctor, based on a novel by Seton Merriman which he had rewritten; it ran for over a week in Brighton. He desired to have an {{original}} work performed, however, and to this end wrote The River over a period of 20 years before taking it to St James's Theatre, where it was accepted and performed in June 1925. The play starred Owen Nares and initially went well, but foundered in the second act due to the plot requiring the most popular actors to be taken off stage - the character played by Nares, for example, broke his leg. Reviews compared the plot to <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boy's Own Paper. The play lasted only a month before being cancelled, but Hastings was able to sell the film rights for £2,000, and it was turned into a Hollywood film called The Notorious Lady starring Lewis Stone and Barbara Bedford.|$|E

25|$|Hip-hop being tolerated by the {{government}} of Cuba is <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary, because performers are provided with venues and equipment by {{the government}}. The Cuban rap and hip-hop scene sought out the involvement of the Ministry of Culture in the production and promotion of their music, which would otherwise have been impossible to accomplish. After the Cuban government provided lukewarm endorsement, the Cuban Rap Agency provided the Cuban rap scene, in 2002, with a state-sponsored record label, magazine, and Cuba's own hip-hop festival.|$|E
25|$|Day {{five of the}} {{proceedings}} saw conflict as the prosecution again attempted to introduce evidence {{that had not been}} shared with both the court and the defense during pre-trial. The defense objected vehemently with defense lawyer Peter Althin equating the tactic to <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Perry Mason TV show. “Suddenly, the door opens and in walks an entirely new witness.” The presiding judge stopped the case to deliberate the matter and found in favor of the defense, instructing the prosecution to immediately hand over all material they planned to use.|$|E
25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corner of their eye that really is not there. Most persons {{come to terms with}} the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E

That was the turning point as we started the new wave rock, and the band was taking a roller-coaster in music searching for <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary”, says Sigtryggur Baldursson.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a victory}} {{propelled}} {{him into a}} different league of steeplechases, horses and trainers. Christopher Green was granted a passport in 1850 which may well mean he was riding abroad. He rode, and won, often for 'Mr Carew' and Ben Land snr. {{and he is now}} mainly mentioned by the sporting press only when <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary happened. For a while, though, Green had been wanting to set up a training establishment on his own account and so moved back to Littleport in the Isle of Ely (his father's birthplace) where 'he soon got the management of several steeple chase horses' but found 'it was easier to find stabling than a country to train over'. He soon made the acquaintance of Henry Jones of Aps (or Apes) Hall, Littleport which became a long-standing relationship of friendship rather than one of pure business. In the 1850s, Green and Jones, as co-owners, bought Tomyrus (foaled 1851) who had a successful flat and hurdles career. Prince Charlie, Camel, Hester, Avenger, Gownsman 'and other good horses' were all descended from Tomyrus and gave Jones fame and success.|$|E

Literary critic Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times described Constable Carl, the policeman who pursues Dominic and Danny, as not unlike Victor Hugo’s obsessive Inspector Javert in Les Misérables. Foden said Irving's manipulation of the character's identities was [...] "nothing less than show-stopping".|$|E

500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{reviewed}} [...] "Exile" [...] for TrekNation, {{and found}} that it reminded her of the Voyager episode [...] "" [...] where a lonely alien contacts Tuvok whilst pretending to be a character on the holodeck.

She said that Tarquin's castle reminded her of a Disney Castle while other elements such as his communications device, were similar to <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Lord of the Rings. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", said that [...] "Exile" [...] was a well rounded episode but thought that it did not [...] "venture as far as it could've and perhaps should've".

500|$|Singer-songwriter David Gray {{commented that}} the great {{achievement}} of The Basement Tapes is that Dylan found {{a way out of}} the anguish and verbal complexity that had characterized his mid-sixties albums such as Blonde on Blonde: [...] "It's the sound of Dylan letting his guard down. 'Clothes Line Saga' and all those ridiculous songs, he's obviously just making it all up, they were having such a great time. The sound of The Band is so antiquated like <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gold Rush and Dylan fits in because he's this storyteller with an ancient heart. At the time everything he did was so scrutinized, yet somehow he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again. You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don't ever hear again." [...] "He mocks his own inertia and impotence", writes critic Mike Marqusee, [...] "but with a much gentler touch than in Blonde on Blonde. In place of that album's strangled urgency, Dylan adopts a laconic humor, a deadpan tone that speaks of resignation and self-preservation in the face of absurdity and betrayal." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Latessa, {{professor}} {{and head of}} division of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated. Latessa stated that the prisoners may {{think that they are}} getting <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performances, when, in reality, they are not. He described it as having a potentially harmful effect. The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like substance abuse or family reunification programs, should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor. The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to {{be an integral part of}} rehabilitation. [...] "It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance", Thomeczeck argued. [...] "In more ways than one, it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration. It's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually. That's good, isn't it?". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Now that's a 'breakout' hit: The clip of inmates at a high-security prison in the Philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] has nabbed more than 42 million views since 2007." ...|$|E
