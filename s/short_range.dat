5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a <b>short</b> <b>range</b> FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but <b>short</b> <b>range</b> units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, {{both the}} Sea Eagle anti-ship missile and the ALARM {{anti-radiation}} missile that previously equipped the RSAF's Tornados had been withdrawn from service. As of 2010, Saudi Arabia has signed several contracts for new weapon systems to be fitted to their Tornado and Typhoon fleets, {{such as the}} <b>short</b> <b>range</b> air-to-air IRIS-T missile, and the Brimstone and Storm Shadow cruise missiles.|$|E

5|$|This officer, to {{encourage}} his regiment; {{which had never}} before been in action, and which had been ordered to lie down to protect itself from the enemy's fire, arose to his feet, advanced in front of the line, and himself fired several shots at the enemy at <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> being fully exposed to their fire at the time.|$|E
5|$|With La Haye Sainte captured, Ney {{then moved}} skirmishers and horse {{artillery}} up towards Wellington's centre. French artillery began to pulverise the infantry squares at <b>short</b> <b>range</b> with canister.

5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the <b>short</b> <b>range</b> from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{surrender}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} battleships of the Atlantic Fleet {{were used}} as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France. Wisconsin and her sisters were not so employed, however, owing to their <b>short</b> <b>range</b> and small size, which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations. Wisconsin instead steamed to Cuba for training with the Atlantic Fleet into 1919. She went on a midshipmen training cruise to the Caribbean in mid-1919. On 15 May 1920, Wisconsin was decommissioned; she was reclassified as BB-9 on 17 July. She was eventually sold on 26 January 1922 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the <b>short</b> <b>range</b> of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E

Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very <b>short</b> <b>range</b> battlefield systems that fit in a backpack.|$|E
5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was armed with a 76.2mm gun, the gun struggled against uparmoured Panzer IVs, and the frontal armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable. Only SU-122 and the SU-152 {{had the power to}} destroy the Tiger at <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> but they were not equal to the Tiger's 88mm gun at long range, and there were very few SU-122 and the SU-152 at Kursk.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's Hornets {{have been}} fitted with several {{different}} types of air-to-air weapons. The aircraft are equipped with an internal M61A1 cannon for use against air and ground targets; 578 rounds can be carried for this weapon. During the initial years of the Hornet's service, the aircraft were equipped with AIM-9M Sidewinder <b>short</b> <b>range</b> air-to-air missiles and AIM-7M Sparrow medium-range air-to-air missiles. The Sparrows were replaced by the AIM-120 AMRAAM in 2002, and in 2004 the Sidewinders were replaced by ASRAAMs. The older missiles are occasionally used in training exercises, however.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both <b>short</b> <b>range</b> forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons had a <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, {{and for the}} men {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E
5|$|When an {{aircraft}} carrier deploys, it takes a Strike Group, made up of several other warships and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of <b>short</b> <b>range</b> defensive weapons, used as a {{last line of defense}} against enemy missiles and aircraft. An aircraft carrier, as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An aircraft carrier is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically has a huge target value.|$|E

5|$|As the Yorkists {{reformed}} {{their ranks}} {{to receive the}} Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the left wing to save the situation. By engaging in the fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at <b>short</b> <b>range.</b> The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was forced to give ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left had less momentum {{than the rest of}} its formation, skewing the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{surrender}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} battleships of the Atlantic Fleet {{were used}} as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France. Ohio and her sisters were not so employed, however, owing to their <b>short</b> <b>range</b> and small size, which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations. Instead, she was sent to Philadelphia on 28 November and remained inactive there until 7 January 1919, when she was placed back in reserve. On 17 July, the ship was reclassified as BB-12. Following the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated significant reductions in naval armaments, Ohio was stricken from the naval register on 31 May 1922 and sold for scrap on 24 March 1923.|$|E
