40|$|Background: <b>Southern</b> <b>caracaras</b> are {{medium-sized}} raptors {{with a large}} range {{stretching to}} {{the southern tip of}} South America. An aberrant, leucistic plumage is found commonly along the coast of Chubut Province (Patagonia, Argentina). Leucistic birds do not produce dark melanin in their feathers. However, they are not albinos because their eyes are not red. No genetic studies of caracara plumages are known. Hypothesis: The high frequency of leucistic birds in Chubut Province arises because of natural selection. Methods: Map the distribution of leucistic individuals relative to normal individuals. Combine a variety of anecdotal natural history observations, collected over 20 years, into a logical inference. Observations: Leucistic caracaras were found only along a 250 -km stretch of rocky oceanic islands and continental outcrops with large seabird colonies in Chubut Province.

50|$|The {{northern}} caracara has {{a length}} of 49 - 58 cm, a wingspan of 107 - 130 cm, and weighs 800 - 1355 g. Average weight is higher {{in the north of}} the range, smaller in the tropics. In Florida, 21 male birds averaged 1117 g and 18 female birds averaged 1200 g. In Panama, males were found to average 834 g and females averaged 953 g. Among caracaras, it is second in size only to the <b>southern</b> <b>caracara.</b> Broad-winged and long-tailed, it also has long legs and frequently walks and runs on the ground. It is very cross-shaped in flight. The adult has a black body, wings, crest and crown. The neck, rump, and conspicuous wing patches are white, and the tail is white with black barring and a broad terminal band. The breast is white, finely barred with black. The bill is thick, grey and hooked, and the legs are yellow. The cere and facial skin are deep yellow to orange-red depending on age and mood. Sexes are similar, but immature birds are browner, have a buff neck and throat, a pale breast streaked/mottled with brown, greyish-white legs and greyish or dull pinkish-purple facial skin and cere.

5000|$|A bold, {{opportunistic}} raptor, the <b>southern</b> crested <b>caracara</b> {{is often}} seen walking around on the ground looking for food. It mainly feeds on carcasses of dead animals, but will steal food from other raptors, raid bird nests, and take live prey if the possibility arises (mostly insects or other small prey, but at least up {{to the size of}} a snowy egret). It is dominant over the black and turkey vulture at carcasses. It is typically solitary, but several individuals may gather at a large food source (e.g. dumps). Breeding takes place in the austral spring/summer in the southern part of its range, but timing is less strict in warmer regions. The nest is a large open structure, typically placed on the top of a tree or palm, but sometimes on the ground. Average clutch size is two eggs.|$|R
30|$|The {{assemblage}} on altitudinal grasslands {{was similar}} to that found by Petersen et al. (2011). Black Vultures, caracaras, and American Kestrels were the most abundant species, while the Accipitridae (hawks, harriers, kites, and eagles) showed lower abundances. The dominance of one or two vulture species, and the <b>Southern</b> and Chimango <b>caracaras,</b> is a common pattern of abundance in many raptor assemblages in the grasslands of southern South America (Don√°zar et al. 1993; Bellati 2000; Carrete et al. 2009).

40|$|The <b>Southern</b> <b>Caracara</b> (Caracara plancus) {{has one of}} {{the most}} diversified diets and {{versatile}} foraging tactics among the Falconiformes. I present here a general view of the feeding habits of this falconid in Brazil, with about 10 main food types and a similar number of foraging tactics. Additionally, I comment on the feeding habits of the Caracarini and note that the trophic versatility of C. plancus is a feature shared with other species of this group that dwell in open areas. Phylogenetic studies place C. plancus as one of the basalmost species within the group, which may indicate that wide diet and behavioural versatility of the Caracarini are ancestral traits. The two Milvago species and Daptrius ater seem to be more specialised in some features (e. g., habitual tick-cleaning), but Phalcoboenus has a trophic pattern similar to that of Caracara though it forages cooperatively...|$|E
40|$|Some {{bird species}} feed on {{external}} parasites, such as ticks and flies, {{on the body}} of mammals (hosts or clients). So called cleaner birds that occur in Brazil were reviewed recently, but gathering of significant new data indicates the need for an update and a brief reappraisal of such association. New records raise the number of known clients for some cleaning birds. The <b>Southern</b> <b>Caracara</b> (Caracara plancus) picks ticks on cattle, and the Black Caracara (Daptrius ater) picks ticks on capybaras. The Wattled Jacana (Jacana jacana) picks ticks, horseflies, arthropods and organic debris on capybaras, and tick-picking on capybaras by the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) is substantiated by photographs. The Cattle Tyrant (Machetornis rixosa) deftly catches horseflies on capybaras, and these latter clients are recorded posing for the Giant Cowbird (Molothrus oryzivorus), which also pick parasites from the marsh deer. The Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) definitely picks ticks directly on cattle. With the new records, some poorly documented or controversial issues in the literature are here confirmed, a hypothesis is validated, and a suggestion is invalidated...|$|E
30|$|The {{efficiency}} of roadside point transects for estimating abundance could {{be related to}} better stationary scanning of the sample area for raptors rather than observers constantly moving along the route. The time spent scanning each unit of area (e.g., a hectare) in roadside strip transects tends to be shorter than when conducting roadside point transects, reducing the probability of detecting inconspicuous raptors. However, roadside point transects tend to increase the probability of individual detection, particularly of raptors perched in less exposed sites (e.g., in a tree with dense foliage, on a fence, or on the ground), where the sighting of raptors might be more difficult (Diesel 1984). Increasing the duration of the survey may compensate for differences in the probability of detection among species with different foraging behaviors. Most species, both those that usually soar and have active flight-foraging behaviors (e.g., vultures and the Black-chested Buzzard-eagle) and those that forage on the ground or from a perch (e.g., Savanna Hawk and <b>Southern</b> <b>Caracara),</b> were more abundant in the roadside point transects than strip transects, suggesting that the former is less sensitive to species behavior.|$|E
40|$|Histological {{studies in}} wild birds are still incipient, {{taking into account}} the great {{diversity}} of species and the difficulty to obtain material for analysis.

30|$|The {{assemblage}} on {{the coastal}} plain was characterized by species associated with wet habitats and that are also tolerant of human disturbance. The most abundant species, the Black Vulture and <b>Southern</b> <b>Caracara,</b> are both regularly found in urban and agricultural areas (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Alencar-Carvalho and Marini 2007), although the latter {{is also found in}} natural grasslands (Filloy and Bellocq 2007; Pedrana et al. 2008). The American Kestrel and Roadside Hawk are abundant in Rio Grande do Sul (Belton 1984). They are food and habitat generalists (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), show a high tolerance to human disturbance, and are even found inside big cities (Belton 1984; Scherer et al. 2005). The Snail Kite and Savanna Hawk are common in coastal areas of southern Brazil and Uruguay (Belton 1984; Albuquerque et al. 1986; Arballo and Cravino 1999; Zilio et al. 2012). These species were abundant on {{the coastal plain}}, surely favored due to the availability of marshes and rice fields in the region. The Long-winged Harrier had a similar pattern of distribution, being more abundant on the coastal plain than on altitudinal grasslands, agreeing with Albuquerque et al. (1986) who found high abundances further to the south. The occurrence of Long-winged Harriers was positively associated with marshes (Pedrana et al. 2008), a common habitat type on the coastal plain, but a habitat type less frequently encountered in altitudinal grasslands (F Zilio personal observation).|$|E
40|$|Studies on the sociality of {{heterospecific}} assemblages {{of birds}} have promoted {{a greater understanding}} of the types of interactions and survivorship between coexisting species. This study verified the group compositions in bird assemblages and analyzed the sociality of migratory and resident species on sandy beaches of southeastern Brazil. A transect was established on the median portion of beaches and all the groups of bird species (monospecific, heterospecific) and solitary individuals were registered four days per month from November 2006 to April 2007. The sociality of each species was calculated by its frequency in heterospecific groups, its proportional number of contacts with other species in heterospecific groups, and the number of species that it associated with. Semipalmated Sandpiper Calidris pusilla (Linnaeus, 1766) and Semipalmated Plover Charadrius semipalmatus Bonaparte, 1825 (both migratory) had the highest degree of sociality and did not show a preference to associate with either residents or migratory species. Sanderling Calidris alba (Pallas, 1764) (migratory) occupied the third position in the sociality rank and associated with migratory species frequently. <b>Southern</b> <b>Caracara</b> Carara plancus (Miller, 1777) and Black Vulture Coragyps atratus (Beschstein, 1793) (both resident) were uniquely found among heterospecific groups with necrophagous and resident species.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the species composition, relative abundance, habitat use, and seasonal variability of raptor assemblages in the Flooding Pampas of Argentina, {{which represents the}} southeastern part of the biome known as the Rio de la Plata Grasslands. We conducted seasonal roadside surveys to detect raptors in modified and natural habitats over a 3 -yr period from spring 2006 through autumn 2009. We classified raptor species according to their relative abundances and occurrence frequencies, and compared the assemblage composition among land-cover types (croplands, grazing fields, periurban areas, and grasslands) and seasons. The raptor assemblage in the Flooding Pampas comprised 16 species, representing approximately 43 % of all raptor species in the biome. The Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) was the dominant species in all land-cover types and seasons. The <b>Southern</b> <b>Caracara</b> (Caracara plancus), American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), and Roadside Hawk (Rupornis magnirostris) were all abundant and very frequently observed species, whereas Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), White-tailed Kite (Elanus leucurus), and Long-winged Harrier (Circus buffoni) were less abundant but recorded during most surveys. The remaining raptors (Aplomado Falcon [Falco femoralis], Cinereous Harrier [Circus cinereus], Short-eared Owl [Asio flammeus], Sharp-shinned Hawk [Accipiter striatus], and Snail Kite [Rostrhamus sociabilis]) were much less abundant in the study area. We also recorded four other raptor species (Variable Hawk [Geranoaetus polyosoma], Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle [G. melanoleucus], Striped Owl [Asio clamator], and Barn Owl [Tyto alba]), but only outside of the standard transect surveys. Species composition differed among land-cover types, but we detected no distinct overall seasonal patterns except that species diversity indices were lower in autumn and especially, spring. Milvago chimango was important to determine similarity in assemblage composition within land-cover types, but other less abundant species, such as C. plancus, A. cunicularia, and R. magnirostris, were more important to differentiate land-cover types based on raptor composition. Species diversity was highest in grazing fields and grasslands, and lowest in periurban areas. Our results suggest that although some raptor species appear to benefit from land-cover patterns in the study area, man...|$|E
