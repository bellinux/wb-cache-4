Adequate interaction {{of these materials}} with {{the human body and}} its capability to reach the desired service level are determined by the surface preparation. The goal of the present work is to relate the surface roughness parameters with the localized corrosion resistance of AISI 316 LVM stainless <b>steel</b> <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> for different times and passivated with nitric acid. At intermediate blasting times the roughness parameters attain an extreme value and this surface condition corresponds with the maximum pitting corrosion resistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of measurement of the thickness of uniform thin films on solid substrates by null ellipsometry is severely limited when the substrate is rough. It is impossible to separate these two effects experimentally with the null ellipsometer, {{and there is no}} theoretical basis or generally used model available to separate these effects. Thus, a dual rotating‐compensator Mueller matrix ellipsometer has been constructed to carry out film thickness measurements on rough substrates. Measurements were made on a set of specially prepared specimens of 8630 <b>steel,</b> roughened by <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> with aluminum oxide. <b>Grit</b> sizes and <b>blasting</b> pressures were varied to produce 11 different roughness values ranging from 0. 01 to 1. 295 μm Ra, as measured with a stylus tracer device. Upon each of the 11 roughness groups, films of magnesium fluoride were overlaid to thicknesses of 89, 180, 254, and 315 nm. One set of specimens was left uncoated. Experimental results for film thickness measurements on rough surfaces matched the ideal (for smooth surfaces) form well for roughnesses up to 0. 13 μm Ra, at most angles of incidence. For rougher specimens, significant deviations in results were observed for all but the largest angles of incidence. The nonideal data were attributed to the cross‐polarization effects of surface geometry, and apparent depolarization. The resolution of thickness measurements was 1 nm for polished specimens, and decreased continuously to 10 nm for the roughest specimens examined. ...|$|R

Particular emphasis {{has been paid to the}} influence of the substrate roughness prior to HVOF deposition, as a mean of improving the mechanical bonding of the coating, on the fatigue life of the coated system. Fatigue tests were conducted under rotating bending conditions (R = − 1), employing samples with different surface roughness, including as-polished, fine-grinding with abrasive paper grit 400 and coated and <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> with alumina particles of two different sizes (< 1 and < 3 mm, respectively) and coated. For comparative purposes, tests were also carried out on as-grit blasted specimens employing alumina particles of 3 mm in size. Fatigue tests were carried out at maximum alternating stresses in the range of 358 – 588 MPa, depending on the condition of the material, in order that the number of cycles to fracture varied in the range of 105 to 106. Selected samples tested at different applied stresses were analyzed after fracture by SEM techniques, which allowed the determination of the crack nucleation and propagation sequence. The results indicate that the presence of the cermet coating gives rise to a delay in the initiation of fatigue cracks at deep notches and alumina particles embedded at the <b>steel</b> substrate after <b>grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> leading to an insignificant fatigue strength debit of the coated specimens, in comparison with the as-polished ones.

Ovine Total Hip Replacement surgery was performed with roughened femoral heads {{in order to enhance}} wear debris generation in vivo. The resistance to aseptic loosening of acetabular components with different surface coatings was investigated. Implants remained in vivo for 1 year. Sheep were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six experimental groups where the acetabular cup was fixed utilising an: (a) cemented polyethylene acetabular cup, (b) metal backed <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface, (c) metal backed plasma sprayed titanium porous coating, (d) metal backed sintered beaded coating, (e) Hydroxyapatite (HA) -coated <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface (f) and HA-coated porous components. Ground Reaction Force (GRF) was used to asses the functional performance of the implants and data was collected pre-operatively and at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks post op. Wear debris generated was analysed and radiographs taken prior to preparation of thin sections. Fibrous tissue (FT) thickness and bone contact at 1 mm intervals along the acetabular bone-implant interface was calculated. GRF data demonstrated significant differences between experimental groups. In all groups there was an increase in the function of the hip after surgery and up to 24 weeks but thereafter the function of the group with the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface reduced whereas the function of the other groups did not significantly change. Average wear particles generated were < 1 microm in size. The cemented group demonstrated a significantly thicker average FT layer (2. 69 mm) when compared with all other groups (p< 0. 05 in all cases) except the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> group (1. 56 mm). HA porous coated cups demonstrated significantly least fibrous tissue adjacent to its interface when compared with all other groups (cemented p< 0. 05, <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> p= 0. 029, porous p< 0. 05, sintered beads p< 0. 05 and HA <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> p< 0. 05). Significantly increased bone contact to HA-coated porous cups (73. 33 %) when compared with all groups was identified except HA-coated <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> cups where no significant difference was demonstrated. Radiographic signs of loosening were visible in all groups except the HA-coated porous group.

Adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of MG 63 cells was determined after one week of culture. The macro-scaled roughness of the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> zirconia discs, independent of the surface treatment, was within a narrow range and only slightly smoother than titanium discs. However, the alkaline- and acid-etching led to an increase of the micro-roughness of the surface. The surface modifications had no effect on cell spreading and did not cause significant change in the expression of differentiation markers.

Materials and Methods: Fifty cast commercially pure titanium discs (9 mm × 2 mm) were divided into five groups (n = 10), which received the following surface treatments: Control group (no surface treatment), group 1 (<b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles and application of alloy primer), group 2 (<b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles and chemical treatment using 1 N HCl), group 3 (chemical treatment using 1 N HCl and application of alloy primer), and group 4 (<b>Grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles, chemical treatment using 1 N HCl and application of alloy primer). Superbond C and B resin cement was applied to the treated titanium surfaces including controls. SBSs were determined after thermocycling for 5000 cycles. Data (megapascal) were analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferroni test. Results: Group 4 (<b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles, chemical treatment using 1 N hydrochloric acid, and application of alloy primer) produced the highest bond strength followed by group 1, group 3, group 2, and the control group which showed the least bond strength. Conclusion: (1) Air-abrasion with alumina particles increases the micromechanical retention of the resin to titanium. (2) The alloy primer promotes wettability, which increases the adhesive bonding of resin cement to titanium.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to carry out a {{comparison}} of <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and other surface pretreatment processes and identify the relation between <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> parameters and coating adhesion, because it can be assumed that the adhesion between substrate and coating strongly depends on the physical properties of the substrate surface. By this way, in order to improve the bonding between substrate and coating, it is necessary to study the influence of different surface pre-treatment parameters and to compare different pre-treatment techniques. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> water jet blasting and mechanicals processes (milling and grinding) have been studied. In order to compare them, the roughness of the surface, the adhesive straights, the topography, the contact surface and the residual stresses have been the considered parameters to carry out the research. Two different substrates have been studied, AlMg 7 and St_ 42. For <b>grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> five different blasting parameters have been analyzed and combined to obtain reliable results, attack angle, air pressure, lineal velocity, number of passes, and distance between substrate and nozzle. After measuring the obtained values, the most influence parameters were recombined and analyzed to obtain better surface conditions. In the case of mechanicals processes (milling and grinding), the samples were studied for different mechanical parameters, analyzed and compared with the other surface pretreatments in order to obtain the most suitable method. For water jet blasting, eight samples were sent to WLH (University of Hannover) to be treated. To carry out the pretreatment, the velocity of the water jet blasting was modify while the other blasting parameters remained constant, in order to compare the obtained values of roughness, adhesion, activate area and residual stresses for water jet with <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and mechanical processes. The next conclusions can be assumed: The roughness is not so important than the topography to obtain the best adhesive bonding between the substrate and the coating, and the best bonding was obtained for homogeneous topographies (obtained for water jet <b>blasting</b> and <b>grit</b> <b>blasting).</b> Comparing the surface pretreatments is observed that water jet blasting is the surface pretreatment method which leads to the highest bonding between substrate and coating. It can be assumed that a higher contact surface area leads to a better adhesion between substrate and coating. The residual stresses strongly depend on the surface pretreatment used. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasting</b> leads to the highest compressive stresses while water jet blasting almost does not cause variations and grinding obtains the same values than for a raw surface (untreated surface).

Contact angle of liquids with different hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity were measured. 128 mini implants, differing in surface treatment, were placed into the tibias and femurs of 8 adult male New Zealand white rabbits. Biomechanical properties (Removal torque and hardness) measurements and histomorphometric observations were measured. Results: Ra and Rq of groups were: Machined (1. 17 ± 0. 11, 2. 59 ± 0. 09) Acid etched (1. 82 ± 0. 04, 3. 17 ± 0. 13), <b>Grit</b> <b>blasted</b> (4. 83 ± 0. 23, 7. 04 ± 0. 08), <b>Grit</b> <b>blasted</b> + Acid etched (3. 64 ± 0. 03, 4. 95 ± 0. 04) respectively.

Hardness of the bone near the implant bone interface is 20 to 25 % less hard than bone 1 mm away from it in both Femur and Tibia. Conclusion: Surface roughness and wettability of mini implants influences their biological response. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasted</b> and acid etched mini implants had lowest contact angle for different liquids tested and highest removal torques...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in order to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel substrate coated with a Ni-base alloy known commercially as Colmonoy 88, deposited by HVOF spray technique. Fatigue tests were conducted under axial conditions (R = 0. 1), employing samples of the substrate material in the as-polished condition, after <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> with alumina particles and after <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and coating with a deposit of about 250 μm thick. The fatigue tests were conducted at maximum stresses {{in the range of}} 380 – 533 MPa, depending on the condition of the material. A detailed fractographic analysis of some selected samples tested at different stresses was carried out, aimed mainly at determining the crack nucleation and propagation sequence. The results indicate that the deposition of such a coating leads to a fatigue strength debit of the substrate in the range of 10 – 20 % and a similar debit in fatigue limit of not, vert, similar 11 – 13 %. It has been found that <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> is the process responsible for the fatigue strength debit observed in the coated samples. Fatigue cracks have been observed to initiate at the substrate–coating interface and at the free surface of the coating, mainly close to alumina particles embedded on the substrate and sharp notches produced during the process. The fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of the coated specimens points out the characteristic heterogeneous nature of the coating, particularly regarding some of its mechanical properties, such as fracture toughness...|$|R
40|$|Putty {{has been}} used for ages to seal the {{connection}} between glass plates and glazing bars in window frames or iron and glass roofs. Nowadays, putty can be replaced by adhesive, to make the two materials structurally work together. To gain insight in the structural behaviour, this article examines the magnitude of the stresses that can be transmitted between glass panels and historic iron which are bonded with modern adhesive. Experiments on single-lap joints were carried out to determine the influence of parameters, specific for renovation, on the shear strength. The material of the substrate (modern construction steel/ 19 th century mild steel), its surface roughness (obtained by <b>grit</b> <b>blasting)</b> and its treatment (application of zinc-phosphate epoxy paint) were tested. All substrates were bonded with an MS polymer adhesive. The experiments demonstrated that a variation in surface roughness has a small effect on the average shear strength, which is positive for the renovation practice. However, the time period between <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and bonding/applying a paint layer seemed crucial...|$|R
