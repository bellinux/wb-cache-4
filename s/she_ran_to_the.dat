500|$|The main {{set list}} for the {{residency}} included songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. The show began with Gaga appearing {{on top of the}} platforms and danced towards her piano to perform an acoustic version of [...] "Born This Way", before proceeding to dance on the rafters with her backup troupe to [...] "Black Jesus + Amen Fashion" [...] in her purple leotard and jacket. A costume change ensued and Gaga performed [...] "Monster" [...] wearing a crimson leather body suit and roses atop her head. She played the rose-adorned keytar and gradually segued into [...] "Bad Romance". Middle of the performance, <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of the stage to climb a ladder to the mezannine floors, where she sang the final chorus and [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] followed with energetic dance moves.|$|E
500|$|While most of {{the other}} songs on the Spice album {{required}} two or three days of studio time, [...] "Wannabe" [...] was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Victoria Adams missed {{most of the}} writing session and communicated {{with the rest of the}} group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' down the phone is not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition was the sound of Brown's footsteps as <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> microphone.|$|E
500|$|The {{family had}} been briefly {{separated}} in April 1918 when the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and Maria to Yekaterinburg. Alexei and the three other young women remained behind because Alexei had suffered another attack of hemophilia. The Empress chose Maria to accompany her because [...] "Olga's spirits were too low" [...] and level-headed Tatiana was needed {{to take care of}} Alexei. In May 1918 the remaining children and servants boarded the ship Rus that ferried them from Tobolsk to Yekaterinburg. Aboard ship, Olga was distressed when she saw one of the guards slip from a ladder and injure his foot. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man and explained that she had been a nurse during the war and wanted to look at his foot. He refused her offer of treatment. All through the afternoon, Olga fretted over the guard, whom she called [...] "her poor fellow." [...] At Tobolsk Olga and her sisters had sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from the Bolsheviks, since Alexandra had written to warn them that upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, she, Nicholas and Maria had been aggressively searched and belongings confiscated.|$|E

2500|$|At 2:30a.m. on March 19, the {{attending}} nurse noticed that Joan's vital signs indicated sudden heart failure. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room's doorway and shouted to the nurses' station {{to have the}} resident on duty come immediately with cardiac failure equipment. [...] As she did this, Joan slightly raised her head, gasping her husband's name. [...] As she tried to breathe, a flood of blood rushed from her mouth. The resident tried to save her by injecting adrenaline into her heart; {{but he was not}} successful.|$|E
2500|$|She {{managed to}} get up and told the assailant, [...] "Go ahead and kill me." [...] She ran half a mile, believing she was being chased, to a Beverly {{residence}} at 805 Blanton Street, where she screamed for help and banged on the front door. A car passed but did not stop when she called after it. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the house and woke up the owners, who then notified authorities. Bowie County Sheriff W. H. [...] "Bill" [...] Presley and three other officers arrived at the scene, but the attacker had already driven off. They found Hollis' pants 100yards away from the attack.|$|E
2500|$|On March 31, Selena woke {{up early}} to meet Saldivar {{at the motel}} where she was staying. She met with Saldivar, who delayed the {{transfer}} of papers with a story about having been raped in Mexico. Selena took Saldivar to a local hospital, where doctors {{found no evidence of}} rape. When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. As she turned to leave, Saldivar reached into her handbag, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 [...]38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldivar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour.|$|E

Instead of stabbing air, the boy stabs his mother and she dies.|$|R
2500|$|On Friday, May 3, {{sometime}} before 9 p.m., Virgil Starks, age 37, a farmer and welder, {{was in his}} modest, yet modern ranch-style house on his 500-acre farm off Highway 67 East, almost [...] northeast of Texarkana. He turned on his favorite weekly radio show and his wife, Katie, age 36, gave him a heating pad for his sore back. He sat in his armchair in the sitting room, which was just off {{of the kitchen and}} the bedroom. While Katie was in her bedroom lying on the bed in her nightgown, she heard something from the backyard and asked Virgil to turn down the radio. Seconds later, while Virgil was reading the May 3rd edition of the Texarkana Gazette, two shots were fired into {{the back of his head}} from a closed double-window [...] away. Katie did not hear the gunshots; instead, she heard what [...] "sounded like the breaking of glass". She thought Virgil dropped something and went to see what happened. As she entered the doorway to the living room, she saw Virgil standing up and then suddenly slump back into his chair. She saw blood then ran to him and lifted up his head.
