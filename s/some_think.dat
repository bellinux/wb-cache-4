5|$|A {{reference}} to The Simpsons appearance in The Tracey Ullman Show is made when the Griffins are shown as {{characters in the}} show. Family Guy producer David A.

5|$|As a child, Tolkien was {{bitten by}} a large baboon spider in the garden, an event <b>some</b> <b>think</b> later echoed in his stories, {{although}} he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his kraal to show him off, returning him the next morning.|$|E

5|$|Spiroplasma is a cell wall–deficient {{bacterium}} {{related to}} Mycoplasma, which <b>some</b> <b>think</b> {{may be the}} cause of the TSEs. The lack of a cell wall means it is not susceptible to conventional antibiotics such as penicillin, which target cell wall synthesis. Frank O. Bastian of Louisiana State University first discovered Spiroplasma-like inclusions in the brain of a CJD patient during an autopsy in 1979 and has hypothesized that this bacterium could possibly {{be the cause of}} the TSEs.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near the inner Solar System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as <b>some</b> <b>think</b> it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4, which <b>some</b> <b>think</b> was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates more problems than it solves.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{point out}} that the story is linked to the {{preceding}} account of Solomon's dream in Gibeon, by the common pattern of prophetic dream and its subsequent fulfillment. <b>Some</b> <b>think</b> this proximity of the stories results from the work of a redactor. On the other hand, according to Saul Zalewski, the two accounts are inseparable and form a literary unified unit.|$|E

25|$|Space {{manufacturing}} {{could enable}} self-replication. <b>Some</b> <b>think</b> it {{the ultimate goal}} because it allows an exponential increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth. It {{could be argued that}} the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of self-replication. Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as integrated circuits, medicines, genetic material and tools.|$|E
25|$|Springing out of Second Temple Judaism, from Christianity's {{earliest}} days, Christians accepted non-Jews (Gentiles) {{without requiring}} them to fully adopt Jewish customs (such as circumcision). The parallels in the Jewish faith are the Proselytes, Godfearers, and Noahide Law, see also Biblical law in Christianity. <b>Some</b> <b>think</b> that conflict with Jewish religious authorities quickly led to the expulsion of the Christians from the synagogues in Jerusalem (see also Council of Jamnia and List of events in early Christianity).|$|E
25|$|Having {{had enough}} of Caligula’s anger at her criticisms and of his behavior, she {{committed}} suicide. Suetonius’s Caligula, clause 23, mentions how he might have poisoned her.When his grandmother Antonia asked for a private interview, he refused it except {{in the presence of}} the prefect Macro, and by such indignities and annoyances he caused her death; although <b>some</b> <b>think</b> that he also gave her poison. After she was dead, he paid her no honour, but viewed her burning pyre from his dining-room.|$|E

25|$|He had {{a horror}} of physicians, who were chiefly Greeks.

25|$|It is not {{yet clear}} whether or not {{vitamins}} and supplements should be administered in dogs—opinions among veterinarians vary widely. While <b>some</b> <b>think</b> that vitamins and supplements are necessary and can improve the health of a dog, others believe that they are unnecessary and may harm the dog. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), dogs receive a complete and balanced diet from the commercially processed dog food alone.

Other planets and moons in the Solar System and other planetary systems are being examined for evidence of having once supported simple life, and projects such as SETI are trying to detect radio transmissions from possible alien civilizations.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no known}} fully {{accurate}} history of broomball. The {{consensus is that}} modern broomball originated in Canada. <b>Some</b> <b>think</b> it came about by trying to play ice hockey without ice skates. The first recorded broomball games in North America were in Perdue, Saskatchewan on March 5, 1909, although {{there is some evidence}} to suggest broomball was being played {{in a small town in}} Massey, Ontario. These games, however, were played on a football field as early as the 1890s. From Canada the game spread south to the United States, becoming especially popular in Minnesota, where by the 1960s a broomball community was thriving.|$|E
25|$|Shasta Hall, {{many people}} say, is haunted.

Now a popular coffee spot, the Roundhouse was controversial when {{it was built in}} 1969. Its design put off many people, and President Robert Johns apparently arranged for its construction without the approval of the CSU Board of Trustees. Sequoia Hall was originally constructed to have an attractive white cement finish, but the funding ran short. Today the building stands with plain concrete.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{primitive}} marginocephalians were bipedal or facultative quadrupedal, and derived {{individuals were}} obligate quadrupedal. This is especially prominent in Ceratopsia, where only the primitive Psittacosaurus is bipedal. All the derived forms were strong quadrupeds, although their stance is controversial. <b>Some</b> <b>think</b> they were fairly columnar, with front limbs erect under the body, {{which would have}} been more efficient for speed. Others think the legs were more sprawling, as evidenced by the shape of the forelimb bones. Although not as fast, this posture would have been efficient for grazing vegetation on the ground. Less is known about bipedal pachycephalosaur locomotion, although they must have had a fairly broad girth in order to make room for their enlarged gut.|$|E
