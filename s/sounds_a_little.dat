500|$|Later {{reviews of}} Ramones tended {{to praise the}} album's {{influence}} on rock music. In 1995, Jeff Tamarkin of The AllMusic Guide to Rock said that the album ignited the punk rock era, writing: [...] "rock's mainstream didn't know what hit it." [...] In 2001, April Long of NME rewarded the album with a perfect score, remarking that the Ramones were [...] "arguably the most influential band ever," [...] despite their lack of mainstream acceptance. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic also deemed the album influential, saying [...] "In comparison {{to some of the}} music the album inspired, The Ramones <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tame—it's a little too clean, and compared to their insanely fast live albums, it even <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slow." [...] The album's sound was considered by Erlewine to be [...] "all about speed, hooks, stupidity, and simplicity." ...|$|E

Commenting on his writing for trio and quartet, Taborn stated that [...] "I like multiple kinds of rhythmic things. On their own, they're not so complicated, {{but when you}} fit them together, it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] mysterious. A lot of that writing extends from my trio writing, where I'm writing things that are ...|$|E
500|$|... "Throb" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Billboard, while reviewing the album on its twentieth anniversary, said, [...] "If the production <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dated now, the overtly sexual vibes on this track are pretty timeless – and still risqué {{for the early}} 90s." [...] Robert Christgau called the song [...] "orgiastic". MuuMuse gave a positive review for [...] "Throb", defining it as [...] "a '90's purist's house track, featuring classic dance rhythms and beat breaks". The reviewer continued saying the song is [...] "a much grittier experience than the slinky seduction" [...] of Madonna's [...] "Erotica" [...] single released the year before, and finished saying [...] "Surprisingly however, the track has aged brilliantly, and listening to it now is still an overly enjoyable experience".|$|E

500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] has {{similarities}} to DJ Snake and Lil Jon's [...] "Turn Down for What" [...] (2013) with Madonna's vocals reminiscent of singer Miley Cyrus' autotuned rapping. The song has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning" [...] dubstep composition. It {{begins with the}} sound of acoustic guitar reminiscent of Avicii's single [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] (2012), as Madonna coos in the background, [...] "You're gonna love this", but quickly transitions into what critic Sasha Geffen calls [...] "past stadium-filling EDM" [...] and into [...] "a genre that more commonly fills the headphones of kids surfing obscure music blogs late at night. It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like vaporwave". The track deviates from a traditional song structure and hook, instead featuring harsh cuts, synths and Madonna singing in a nasal tone. Minaj raps in the track, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like, [...] "I just wanna have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight", [...] "alternating between pitch-shifted shrieks of 'Who do you think you are??' and the sing-songy title taunt." [...] Regarding her profuse usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] in the song (along with another song [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] from Rebel Heart), Madonna defended her decision to Billboard, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{composition}} is [...] "uplifting and euphoric" [...] in nature, far-reaching {{with a number}} of melodic effects generated by electronic music. A cinematic visualization with the track is accomplished by different chord progressions, making the whole song sound compact. [...] "Ghosttown" [...] begins with sounds of single organ chords and a dusty drum beat. Instead of being a straight-up pop ballad, the composition <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "edgy", due to the usage of synth percussion and vocoder effects. Chris Rosa from VH1 stated that the song [...] "features tight production and an ear-crashing chorus that is pure pop bliss", while Elysa Gardner from USA Today described the song as a mixture of [...] "disarmingly earnest sweetness with a stark, chilly arrangement". The chorus appears after 40 seconds in the song, with a distortion filled pause, a thumping beat and a repetitive chord progression. [...] "Ghosttown" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 79 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from F3 to B4. The song has a basic sequence of Dm–F–C–Gm during the verses and B–F–C–Dm during the chorus as its chord progression. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon engineered and mixed the track, while Ron Taylor did additional Pro Tools editing of Madonna's vocals and Evignan provided background vocals on the song.|$|E

500|$|However, NBC {{eventually}} {{opted not}} to put the show on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the premiere of the third season {{until the beginning of}} 2011. This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. [...] NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating, but said: [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> corny, maybe even a little community theater-ish, but when we got the bad news our thinking was to just put our heads down and keep making the best show we could." [...] Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said it gave them the luxury of time to go back and reedit episodes or shoot and add new material.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too Slayer.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|All pizmonim can be {{classified}} under different maqams (musical modes), {{of which there are}} about ten in common use. Maqam ajam, which <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like a Western major scale, is the thematic maqam that contains many holiday melodies. Maqam hijaz, which corresponds to the Phrygian dominant scale, is the thematic maqam that contains many sad melodies. [...] Maqam sikah (or sigah), containing many three-quarter-tone intervals, is used for the cantillation of the Torah. Maqam saba is the maqam used for circumcisions.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Hum!' murmured the curate; {{there was}} really nothing {{questionable}} in that, {{but he was just}} slightly prejudiced against a man who made such <b>a</b> quotation; it <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> priggish.|$|R

2500|$|Falco {{was born}} Johann Hölzel on 19 February 1957 to Alois Hölzel and Maria Hölzel in a working class {{district}} of Vienna. Maria would later recall {{that she had}} been pregnant with triplets. As it was a dizygotic pregnancy, she miscarried the identical twins during the third month and Falco, who was conceived via a separate ovum, survived. Falco mused that [...] "three souls in one breast <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over dramatic, but I do sense them sometimes. In my moodiness. I'll be really up and then right after I'll be really down." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sammi Cheng was {{previously}} named Twinnie Cheng. Contrary to popular belief, [...] "Twinnie" [...] {{is not her}} birth name. The name came about when Sammi was still in school and her English Language teacher wanted everyone in class to have an English name. When Sammi turned to her sister for help, her sister {{came up with the}} name [...] "Twinnie". The name was later changed to [...] "Sammi" [...] as [...] "Sammi" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like [...] "Sau Man". Cheng received her education at SKH St. Peter's Primary School and Tang Shiu Kin Victoria Government Secondary School.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing the 20th Anniversary reissue, Michael Christopher of The Phoenix {{rated the}} album 3.5 out of 4 stars stating while the bonus track [...] "Piss" [...] doesn't match {{up to the}} rest of the material, the groove that flows through the {{original}} record is the muscle behind what mattered most. Denise Falzon of Exclaim! stated that the reissue <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cleaner from the enhanced production quality. She noted that [...] "Piss" [...] does sound oddly out of place on the reissue, but the release is worthwhile for the DVD showcasing the band's dynamic live performance. In 2005, Vulgar Display of Power was ranked number 333 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.|$|E

2500|$|CNN also {{profiled}} Emily. University of Pennsylvania Physiology professor Kevin Foskett {{said in the}} article, [...] "Emily and {{her family}} want research focused on her mutation to be as focused and accelerated as possible. At one level, that <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> selfish, until you realize that her type of mutation, a 'nonsense' mutation ... is responsible for disease in many other genetically inherited forms of disease... Emily's story is compelling. [...] If you've met Emily... you cant help but become engaged and energized." [...] Emily said in that piece, [...] "Obviously our prayer and dream {{is to have a}} breakthrough. [...] But we also realize that it might not happen, or it might not happen in time for me. And I think that in the worst case scenario, even if it never could help me, there is a peace I get from at least knowing I'm doing everything I can, and it's not for lack of trying." ...|$|E
