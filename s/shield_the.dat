5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E

5|$|Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, {{related in}} his memoirs that the Russian left was {{shifting}} position when the French Army arrived sooner than expected; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort to <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> redeployment of the Russian left.

5|$|Ex-spies and ex-spouses Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter {{are on the}} run {{trying to}} uncover a {{conspiracy}} against them.

50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> re-forged, <b>the</b> player {{character}} {{travels to}} Valdis' stronghold known as Zaramoth's Horns. <b>The</b> <b>shield</b> protects {{him from the}} Dark Wizards, but the battle with Valdis himself proves to be a stalemate until the old man appears and takes <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> from <b>the</b> player character. He gives <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> to Valdis, revealing {{that he is a}} Dark Wizard. Valdis tries to destroy <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> with <b>the</b> Sword of Zaramoth, but when he strikes <b>the</b> <b>shield,</b> his sword shatters instead. Valdis and the player character resume the battle, in which Valdis is killed.|$|R
50|$|Autoroutes are {{identified}} by blue-and-red <b>shields.</b> <b>The</b> red header of <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> contains a white image representing a highway overpass, {{and the blue}} lower portion of <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> contains <b>the</b> Autoroute's number in white, along with a fleur-de-lis, which is a provincial symbol of Quebec.|$|R

5|$|The pallium is a {{distinctive}} vestment of metropolitan archbishops, {{and may be}} found in their bearings as well as the corporate arms of archdioceses, displayed either above or below the <b>shield.</b> <b>The</b> pallium is sometimes seen within the shield itself.

50|$|The {{previous}} 1969 Army heraldic regulations also {{envisioned the}} existence of personal coats of arms for certain general officers.

5|$|At 05:10, four German torpedo boats {{reached the}} Eastern Task Force and {{launched}} fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies.

Allied losses to mines included USS Corry off Utah and USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft. In addition, many landing craft were lost.|$|E

5000|$|The {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> in <b>the</b> flag {{is determined by}} first measuring two shield widths (5/7 of the flag width, or 5/14 of the flag length) {{from the edge of}} the fly, and then centering <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> in <b>the</b> remainder of the field.
