You have {{proposed}} to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up. <b>So</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> get the money?

5000|$|He said: “It {{is as if}} that I see her {{wearing a}} Zubadi garment with a thick hem and ridding a gray camel. There was {{in her hand and}} around her a whip with spread out plaits. She was roaring as if she was a {{stallion}} growling in it’s shaqshaqa , and (I hear her) say: ‘O people, guard against (the punishment from) your Lord; surely the violence of the hour is a grievous thing. Surely Allah has made clear the truth, showed the evidence, lighted the path, and hoisted the flag. He has neither left you in a vague error nor in gloomy days. <b>So</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want (to go)? May Allah have mercy on you! Do you want to escape from the Commander of the faithful, (Imam Ali) Or (do you want) to escape from the battle? Or (do you want to) turn away from Islam? Or (do you want to) renounce the truth? Have you not heard Allah, the Great and Almighty, say: And most certainly We will try you until We have known these among you who exert themselves hard, and the patient, and made your case manifest. ’ Then she raised her head towards the heaven and said: ‘O Allah, I have lost patience! Certainty has become weak. Terror has spread. In your hands, O Lord, are the reins of hearts. Therefore, gather the word on piety, unite the hearts on guidance, and return the right to its owners. Come, may Allah have mercy on you, to the just Imam, the faithful guardian (of authority), and the greatest testifier of the truth. Surely the Battle of Badr has brought about these grudges. These spites date back to the pre-Islamic period. The Battle of Uhud has brought about this malice. Mu’awiya employed them {{at the time of the}} inattentiveness, that he may take vengeance (on us) for the Banu ‘Abd Shams.’” ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{know that}} the people of Sham as if they were asses taking flight, that had fled from a lion, that they do not know in which way of the ways in the earth they are driven. They have sold the {{hereafter}} for the life in this world, bought misguidance for guidance, and sold certainty for blindness. Shortly after that they will become repentant. When regret occurs, they will ask for forgiveness. Surely, by Allah, whoever deviates from the truth falls into falsehood, and whoever does not dwell in the Garden dwells in the Fire. O People, surely the sane regard the lifetime in the world as short, so they refuse it. They find slow the period of the hereafter, so they strive for it. By Allah, O people, were it not for that the rights became invalid, the criminal punishments were cancelled, the oppressive appeared, Satan’s word became strong, we would not prefer coming to death to the easy, agreeable life. <b>So</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want (to go)? May Allah have mercy on you! (Do you want to turn away) from the cousin of Allah’s Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, his son-in-law, and father of his grandsons? He (Imam Ali) was created from his (the Prophet) clay and branched from his plant. He (the Prophet) singled him (Imam Ali) with his secret, regarded him as the gate of the city of his knowledge, informed the Muslims of love for him, showed the hypocrites through their detesting him. He (Imam Ali) still supported him (the Prophet) through helping him and followed the Sunna of his straightness. He did not resort to the pleasure of the self while he split the tops of the heads, broke the idols, prayed when people were polytheists and obeyed when people were doubters. He was so until he killed those who fought him in single combat at the battle of Badr, destroyed the people (who took part at the battle) of Uhud, and defeated the gathering of Hawazin. I wonder at those events that planted in the hearts of the people hypocrisy, apostasy, and division. I have exerted myself in speaking (to you) and gone too far in advising (you). Success is with Allah. Peace, Allah’s mercy, and His blessings be on you!’ ...|$|E

Without a doubt, you might be overwhelmed as I was. Upon receiving my marching orders to begin counting our main campus collection, I looked around and just stared at row upon row, and shelf upon shelf, cabinet upon cabinet filled with books, video cassette tapes, audio cassette tapes, and books; oh the books. Not to forget slides, microfilm, compact discs, etc. <b>So,</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> begin? For me, I chose to begin counting the section closest to my desk.

The article that follows is a brief description of our library inventory project. All who participated became better acquainted with our main campus collection.
