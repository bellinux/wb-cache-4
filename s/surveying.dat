5|$|Washington's {{introduction}} to <b>surveying</b> began {{at an early}} age through school exercises that taught him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at <b>surveying</b> occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional <b>surveying</b> party to lay out large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where the young Washington gained invaluable experience in the field.|$|E

5|$|The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge {{is out of}} {{alignment}} with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 to 2.2 {{miles east of the}} Texas line.

In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate <b>surveying</b> equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian. <b>Surveying</b> techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east.

50|$|Initially, the Australian <b>Survey</b> Corps {{continued}} its mapping for the defence of Australia, proceeded with basic <b>survey</b> triangulation and provided training cadre for new field and training units. In January 1940, Field <b>Survey</b> Units RAE (Militia) {{were established in}} 1st Military District - Queensland, 2nd Military District - New South Wales and 3rd Military District - Victoria to accelerate the mapping effort. Deputy Assistant Directors - <b>Survey</b> were appointed to Military District Headquarters to advise on <b>survey</b> needs and to liaise with State agencies. In April 1940 the 2/1 Corps Field <b>Survey</b> Company RAE was raised {{as part of the}} 2nd Australian Imperial Force for service overseas and a <b>Survey</b> staff was appointed to the formation (Corps) headquarters. In September 1940 significant expansion of the Australian <b>Survey</b> Corps was approved by Cabinet to include a <b>Survey</b> Directorate on Army Headquarters (AHQ) and higher formation headquarters, an AHQ <b>Survey</b> Company, an AHQ Cartographic Company, regional command field <b>survey</b> companies, a <b>Survey</b> Section 7th Military District (Darwin) and a Corps <b>Survey</b> Mobile Reproduction Section. Four militia Field <b>Survey</b> Companies were established in the regional commands (1 Field <b>Survey</b> Coy - Queensland, 2 Field <b>Survey</b> Coy - New South Wales, 3 Field <b>Survey</b> Coy - Victoria, 4 Field <b>Survey</b> Coy - Western Australia) absorbing the Australian <b>Survey</b> Corps Sections and the Field <b>Survey</b> Units RAE (M) in the Commands.|$|R
