5|$|A <b>searchlight</b> was loaned to Jodrell Bank in 1946 by the Army; a {{broadside}} array was constructed on the mount of this <b>searchlight</b> by J. Clegg, {{consisting of a}} number of Yagi antennas. This was first used for astronomical observations in October 1946.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{the site}} was used for bomb {{disposal}} and as the location for a <b>searchlight</b> battery.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, 41 <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment was {{reformed}} in the Territorial Army as 576 (5th Bn, The North Staffordshire Regiment) <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment RA (TA), later becoming 576 Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment (576 LAA/SL). When AA Command was disbanded in 1955 and {{the number}} of air defence units reduced, 576 LAA/SL Regiment was amalgamated with 349 (Lancashire Yeomanry) LAA and 493 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiments as 441 LAA/SL Regiment.|$|E
50|$|German <b>searchlights</b> of the Second World War {{were used}} to detect and track enemy {{aircraft}} at night. They were used in three main sizes, 60, 150 and 200 centimetres. After {{the end of the}} First World War, German development of <b>searchlights</b> was effectively stopped by the Treaty of Versailles, it resumed in 1927. At the outset of the war, <b>searchlights</b> were combined with acoustic direction-finders, with the direction-finders guiding the <b>searchlights</b> to the right part of the sky, where they swept until they found the target. Later in the war, the <b>searchlights</b> were radar-directed. The <b>searchlights</b> were based around extremely high-powered Carbon Arc lamps.|$|R
50|$|A few {{obsolete}} 110 centimetre <b>searchlights</b> {{and captured}} French 200 cm and 240 cm <b>searchlights</b> were also used.|$|R

5|$|The 41st (5th North Staffordshire Regiment) <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment, Royal Engineers, {{previously}} the 5th North Staffords, {{served in}} Anti-Aircraft Command {{as part of}} the air defence of the Midlands from 1939 to 1944. The regiment became the first complete <b>searchlight</b> regiment to land in Normandy after the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944. It served with 21st Army Group, as part of 31st (North Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, {{until the end of the}} war in Europe and then undertook garrison duty in Lower Saxony.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} designs for pillbox-like {{structures}} for various purposes including light anti-aircraft positions, observation posts and <b>searchlight</b> positions {{to illuminate the}} shoreline.|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of <b>searchlights</b> using carbon arc {{technology}} occurred during the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War. The Royal Navy used <b>searchlights</b> in 1882 to prevent Egyptian forces from staffing artillery batteries at Alexandria. Later that same year, the French and British forces landed troops under <b>searchlights.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} reach bombers now flying at {{increasingly}} higher altitudes, more powerful <b>searchlights</b> were needed. In 1943, the first 200-centimetre Scheinwerfer-43 <b>searchlights,</b> with 2.7 billion Hefner candlepower (2.4 gigacandela) were delivered to troops. Powered by a 120-kilowatt generator, these <b>searchlights</b> could detect targets at distances of up to 13 km.|$|R
50|$|<b>Searchlights</b> {{were used}} {{extensively}} in defense against nighttime bomber raids during the Second World War. Controlled by sound locators and radars, <b>searchlights</b> could track bombers, indicating targets to anti-aircraft guns and night fighters and dazzling crews.|$|R
5|$|At {{least six}} of the U.S. ships—including Laffey, O'Bannon, Atlanta, SanFrancisco, Portland, and Helena—fired at Akatsuki, which drew {{attention}} to herself with her illuminated <b>searchlight.</b> The Japanese destroyer was hit repeatedly and blew up and sank within a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Swakeleys House was requisitioned by the {{military}} and a <b>searchlight</b> battery established in the grounds. The house was Grade I listed in 1956, and the head gardener's cottage on the junction of Swakeleys Road and The Avenue was Grade II listed in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red <b>searchlight</b> for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system. The infrared lamp {{in the nose}} was used to illuminate the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR <b>searchlight</b> (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E

5|$|Nate Parker (born November 18, 1979) is an American actor, director, producer, writer, {{and musical}} {{performer}} who {{has appeared in}} Beyond the Lights, Red Tails, The Secret Life of Bees, The Great Debaters, Arbitrage, Non-Stop, Felon, and Pride. Parker's directorial debut feature film, The Birth of a Nation, in which he also starred, made history at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival when Fox <b>Searchlight</b> Pictures acquired the distribution rights for $17.5 million, breaking {{the record for the}} most paid for a Sundance Film Festival production, surpassing Little Miss Sunshine, which had been acquired by <b>Searchlight</b> for $10 million ten years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Because The Birth of a Nation {{attracted}} increased scrutiny due {{to possible}} Oscar nominations, {{and the film}} itself depicts a brutal rape, there was significant press coverage about damage control by Fox <b>Searchlight</b> Pictures, the studio releasing the film. Interviews in Variety and Deadline were a focus, as was Parker's response to the event in a Facebook post.|$|E
5|$|Holofcener {{wrote the}} script, which was partly {{inspired}} {{by her own}} life, after she was approached by two producers from Fox <b>Searchlight</b> Pictures who offered to produce her next project. It was filmed in Los Angeles on a budget of $8 million. Gandolfini died after the film was completed but before it was released; Holofcener dedicated the film to him.|$|E
50|$|Navies {{were the}} first {{military}} forces to adopt the newly developed electric Arc lamp <b>Searchlights</b> (S/Ls) in the later 19th Century, to illuminate potential targets at night. Before the Bombardment of Alexandria in 1882, the Royal Navy force employed its <b>searchlights</b> to prove that Ahmed ‘Urabi's troops were strengthening the fortifications at night {{in defiance of the}} British ultimatum. Similarly, <b>searchlights</b> were also used to defend Ports against incursions by warships at night: in Britain this role became the responsibility of the fortress engineers and electrical engineers of the Royal Engineers (RE).|$|R

5|$|On 3 November 1941 MacLachlan was {{promoted}} to squadron leader, and was given command of No. 1 Squadron at Redhill Aerodrome, equipped with the Hawker Hurricane Mk. IIc for night intruder operations over western Europe. MacLachlan was assigned his personal aircraft, Hurricane BD983/JX-Q. He painted an emblem showing a left arm with a cannon shell passing through it and the fingers giving the V sign. The squadron spent the winter, 1941–2 in intensive night fighter training with <b>searchlight</b> and ground control station. In February 1942 he attended the <b>Searchlight</b> School at Shrivenham. In his absence he missed the Channel Dash and subsequent air battle during which the squadron lost two pilots. The squadron scored its first success on 1 April—his 23rd birthday—when Karel Kuttelwascher—with whom he often flew—destroyed two Ju 88s. MacLachlan found locating German aircraft in the dark difficult, though he himself claimed a locomotive damaged on the night and left two of its wagons destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Territorial Force was reconstituted as the Territorial Army in 1920, and the 5th and 6th battalions were reformed, {{still with}} the 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade of 46th (North Midland) Division. In 1936, the 5th Battalion was {{converted}} to an anti-aircraft <b>searchlight</b> unit of the Royal Engineers as 41st (North Staffordshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion while remaining 'part of the corps of the North Staffordshire Regiment'. It {{was transferred to the}} Royal Artillery in August 1940 as the 41st (5th North Staffordshire) <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment TA. In the same year the remaining 6th Battalion was transferred to 166th Infantry Brigade, 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division after the HQ of the 46th Division became 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division. Throughout {{the spring and summer of}} 1939, due to the increasing threat posed by Nazi Germany, the size of the Territorial Army was doubled, and the 6th Battalion formed a duplicate 7th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} {{during the war}} are not entirely clear. Photographic evidence shows that four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her <b>searchlight</b> platform and the other pair on the bridge wings, although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
