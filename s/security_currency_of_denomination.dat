40|$|This paper explores some {{implications}} of the use <b>of</b> national <b>currencies</b> as international reserves. First, a closed economy overlapping-generations model is developed to derive time-consistent tax and inflation policies for a government that is financing a given stream of expenditures. Second, the effects of allowing a government to hold a foreign currency as a reserve asset and to have its currency held as a reserve asset abroad are considered. The use <b>of</b> national <b>currencies</b> as <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>denomination</b> for international lending creates an incentive for the governments whose currencies are used to alter their inflation rates to extract resources {{from the rest of}} the world. When reserves are constrained to be nonnegative the use <b>of</b> national <b>currencies</b> as international reserves raises the inflation rate in reserve issuing countries but does not effect theiInflation rate in reserve holders.

40|$|This Paper {{proposes a}} new {{framework}} for interpreting a currency crisis {{associated with a}} fiscal imbalance, which we find appropriate {{for the analysis of}} contemporary economies with outstanding public debt. Unlike the first-generation literature on speculative attacks, we do not assume that money growth finances the imbalance and that governments face exogenous borrowing constraints. In our model, the cause of a devaluation is a fiscal policy switch, from a policy-backing government debt fully with taxes, to one using taxes and unanticipated inflation. Its timing depends on the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy, where the latter is modelled in terms of interest rate rules. Real debt acts as leverage, and the rate of devaluation is smaller when nominal liabilities are a larger fraction of the total. The focus of our analysis <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> crises is on <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>denomination</b> and maturity <b>of</b> government debt; the government's willingness to tolerate high interest rates; the possibility of coordination problems among holders <b>of</b> government debt. <b>currency</b> crisis; fiscal theory of the price level; speculative attack...|$|R
