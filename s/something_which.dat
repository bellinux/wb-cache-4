5|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} the accident, airlines started using Type IV deicing fluid, which is more effective than both Type I and Type II fluids. Type IV fluids stick to aircraft for up to two hours. Chicago O'Hare International Airport was the first to introduce deicing facilities at the runway, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> has now become commonplace.|$|E

5|$|Aston {{commented that}} {{throughout}} his life he suffered from poor health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read the autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, who {{had gone through the}} same experience, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> he believed aided his recovery more than anything else.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker's {{successful}} leadership race {{had been}} run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon {{after taking the}} leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director {{of the party and}} national campaign manager. Grosart appointed a national campaign committee, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational key to success in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 to wage the campaign—half what it had in 1953. Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party's financing.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 70s, {{efforts were}} {{primarily}} concentrated on Line E, which was re-routed from its terminus at Constitución to {{the centre of}} the city at the Plaza de Mayo in an attempt to boost passenger figures, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> proved to be successful. The segment was opened by president Arturo Illia in 1966 and Spain offered CAF-General Eléctrica Española trains in order to cancel part of the debt it had accrued with Argentina; trains which continue to serve on the line today. The line was extended westward to José María Moreno in 1973, in what would be the only expansion of the decade.|$|E

5|$|In February 1972, Nixon and {{his wife}} {{traveled}} to China. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40hours in preparation. Upon touching down, the President and First Lady emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Nixon {{made a point of}} shaking Zhou's hand, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva. Over 100television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print. It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised.|$|E
5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was <b>something</b> <b>which</b> JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.|$|E
5|$|Nuyts {{acquired}} some notoriety while Governor for apparently taking native {{women to}} his bed, {{and having a}} translator hide under the bed to interpret his pillow-talk. He was also accused of profiting from private trade, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> was forbidden under company rules. Some sources claim that he officially married a native Formosan woman during this time, but as he was still legally married to his first wife Cornelia, this seems unlikely.|$|E

5|$|On {{returning}} from his unsuccessful mission to Japan, Nuyts {{took up his}} position as the third Governor of Formosa, with his residence in Fort Zeelandia in Tayouan (modern-day Anping). One of his early aims was to force an opening for the Dutch to trade in China — <b>something</b> <b>which</b> had eluded them since they arrived in East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release him until he agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges. More than thirty years later {{it was to be}} Zheng's son Koxinga who ended the reign of the Dutch on Formosa.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was {{to turn it into}} a federal prison, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about turning it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided that it did not want to build a federal prison on the grounds of the former air base.|$|E
5|$|Stieger, Voracek, and Formann {{recommend}} that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest {{it may be useful}} to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic optimism, feedback sensitivity, self-regulation, and defensiveness.|$|E

5|$|The cantata was {{commissioned}} by the minister {{of one of the}} churches in Mühlhausen, the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on Luther's German version of Psalm 130 and also incorporates the words of a chorale. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale into larger structures. Bach also shows his interest in counterpoint, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> was characteristic of him throughout his career.|$|E
