5|$|The {{positive}} {{economic outlook}} for Greece—based {{on the return}} of <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> real GDP growth across {{the first three quarters}} of 2014—was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in Q4-2014. This new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to the premature snap parliamentary election called by the Greek parliament in December 2014 and the following formation of a Syriza-led government refusing to accept respecting the terms of its current bailout agreement. The rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to Greece under its current programme, until such time as the Greek government either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors. This rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis (both for the Greek government and Greek financial system), resulting in plummeting stock prices at the Athens Stock Exchange while interest rates for the Greek government at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source.|$|E

40|$|Government {{statistical}} {{agencies are}} required to <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjust</b> non-stationary time series resulting from aggregation {{of a number of}} cross-sectional time series. Traditionally, this has been achieved using the X- 11 or X 12 -ARIMA process by using either direct or indirect seasonal adjustment. However, neither of these methods utilizes the multivariate system of time series which underlies the aggregated series. This paper compares a model-based univariate approach to seasonal adjustment with a model-based multivariate approach. Firstly, the univariate basic structural model (BSM) is applied directly to the aggregated series to obtain estimates of the seasonal components. Secondly, the multivariate basic structural model is applied to a transformed system of cross-sectional series to also obtain estimates of the seasonal components of the aggregated series. The prediction mean squared errors resulting from each method are compared by calculating their relative efficiency. Results indicate that gains are achievable using the multivariate approach according to the relative values of the parameters of the cross-sectional series...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we reevaluate the {{evidence}} of seasonality in prices which we find to be substantially greater than previous research has indicated. That is, seasonal price movements have become more prominent in the relatively stable inflation environment that has prevailed since 1982. One main conclusion is drawn from this analysis: The amount of seasonality in prices differs greatly by item, {{making it difficult to}} generalize about seasonal price movements. A casual reading fails to reveal an easily identifiable origin of the seasonal variation of prices. That is, seasonality in consumer prices is predominantly idiosyncratic in nature, a result that contrasts with studies demonstrating a common seasonal cycle in real economic variables. This finding has an important practical implication: Given the selective, disaggregated approach taken by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to <b>adjust</b> data <b>seasonally,</b> the existence of idiosyncratic seasonality increases the likelihood of allowing noise in the aggregate CPI at a seasonal frequency. This argues in favor of <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusting</b> the index after aggregation. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of {{underlying}} inflation and the properties of various measures of underlying inflation in the Australian context. Underlying inflation measures are routinely calculated and monitored by central banks in many countries, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. Alternative measurement concepts are explored, {{and a range of}} measures that have been calculated for Australia are discussed and evaluated on the basis of statistical criteria. These criteria capture the intuition that a good measure of underlying inflation should be less volatile than CPI (or headline) inflation, be unbiased with respect to CPI inflation, and capture the ‘trend’ in CPI inflation so that, on average, CPI inflation will tend to adjust towards the measure of underlying inflation. In the Australian context, statistical measures of underlying inflation, such as the trimmed mean or weighted median, perform fairly satisfactorily against these criteria. The performance of these measures can be further improved by <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusting</b> prices at the CPI component level. Although underlying inflation measures have become less necessary in the past decade as inflation itself has become less volatile, these findings suggest that underlying inflation measures can still add value to the analysis of inflationary trends. underlying inflation; core inflation; trimmed mean; weighted median; volatility-weighted measures...|$|R

Traditionally, this has been achieved using the X- 11 or X 12 -ARIMA process by using either direct or indirect seasonal adjustment. However, neither of these methods utilizes the multivari-ate system of time series which underlies the aggregate series. Model-based ARIMA methods for multivariate time series have been discussed previously in the literature but require stationary time series. This paper looks at the application of the basic structural model to the multivariate system of the cross-sectional series to obtain the estimate of the seasonal component of the aggregate series. The accuracy of this multivariate approach is compared to the accuracy of the seasonal component using a univariate (or direct) approach. By decomposing the error structure into common and specific effects, the model is a blend of traditional structural time series models and dynamic error components models. The link between the series is modeled by the covariance of the disturbances driving the series which is the variance parameter of the common effect. Estimation of the components is carried out by firstly writing the model in state space form and then applying the Kalman filter and smoother. An experimental study determines if and when gains are achieved for different designs of the cross-sectional series underlying the same aggregate series. 1...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{consists}} of three papers on empirical asset pricing. The first two papers explore the ways through which mutual fund companies impact the market. The last one explores a strategic behavior of firms toward investors. In my first paper, I examine the price impact of portfolio balancing by professional investment managers. I find that asset managers tend to rebalance their portfolios <b>seasonally,</b> <b>adjusting</b> around the earnings announcement periods of the underlying, and in turn causing fluctuations in the cross section of assets beyond those documented in the literature. The asset management industry trades more with outside market participants during the earnings season {{than the rest of}} the quarter. Consequently, these trades have price impact and generate a seasonal variation in Momentum returns across the cross section of equities. The second paper explores the intermediation of profits by asset managers to investors. Asset managers distribute capital gains and dividends at fixed dates even though the accrual of gains and dividends occur throughout the year. I exploit this staggered nature of capital distribution in asset intermediation to study the influence of institutional money management on asset prices. These results indicate that institutional structures contribute to the daily variation of stock market returns and that manager preference has significant impact over the co-movement of his managed assets. My third paper is joint work with Dong Lou and Lauren Cohen. We explore a mechanism through which investors take correlated shortcuts, and present strong evidence that firm managers undertake actions in response to these shortcuts. Specifically, we exploit a regulatory provision governing firm classification into industries, wherein a firm’s primary industry is determined by the segment with the highest sales. We find that investors overly rely on this classification: Firms just above the industry classification cutoff have significantly higher betas with respect to that industry...|$|R
