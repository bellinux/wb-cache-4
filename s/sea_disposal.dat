50|$|The Brent Spar, a {{platform}} designed for storage and offloading {{of crude oil}} products, was installed in the Brent Field in June 1976. The attempted deep <b>sea</b> <b>disposal</b> of the platform in the 1990s created a huge backlash by Greenpeace. The Spar was eventually dismantled and pieces were used {{as a foundation for}} a quay in Norway.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 November 1996, {{a special}} {{meeting of the}} Contracting Parties adopted the [...] "1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972" [...] which is to replace the 1972 Convention, subject to ratification. In line with UNCED's Agenda 21, the 1996 Protocol {{reflects}} the global trend towards precaution and prevention with the parties agreeing to move from controlled dispersal at sea {{of a variety of}} land-generated wastes towards integrated land-based solutions for most, and controlled <b>sea</b> <b>disposal</b> of few, remaining categories of wastes or other matter.|$|E
5000|$|The second option {{involved}} towing the decommissioned platform {{into deep}} {{water in the}} North Atlantic, positioning explosives around the waterline, then detonating them, in order to breach the hull and sink the platform. The facility would then fall to the seabed and release its contents over a restricted area. Due to the uncertainty associated with detonating explosives, {{a number of possible}} scenarios were envisaged. First, the structure would fall to the seabed in one piece, releasing its contaminants slowly, and affecting the seabed for around 500 m [...] "down-current". Second, the structure might disintegrate as it fell through the water column. This would release contaminants in a single burst, and have an effect for 1000 m [...] "down current" [...] of the final resting place, although this would last for a shorter time than in the first instance. Third, the structure could fail catastrophically when the explosives detonated, releasing its contaminants into the surface waters. This would affect sea birds and on the fishing industry in that area. The cost of this option was estimated at between £17M and £20M.Shell proposed that deep <b>sea</b> <b>disposal</b> was the best option for Brent Spar, arguing that their decision had been made on sound scientific principles and data. Dismantling the platform on-shore was more complex from an engineering point of view than disposal at sea. Shell also cited the lower risk to {{the health and safety of}} the workforce with deep <b>sea</b> <b>disposal.</b> Environmentally, Shell considered that sinking would have only a localised effect in a remote deep sea region which had little resource value. It was considered that this option would be acceptable to the public, to Her Majesty's Government and to regional authorities. Shell acknowledged that sinking the Brent Spar at sea was also the cheaper option.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{incidents}} {{which led to the}} creation of the Basel Convention was the Khian <b>Sea</b> waste <b>disposal</b> incident, in which a ship carrying incinerator ash from the city of Philadelphia in the United States dumped half of its load on a beach in Haiti before being forced away. It sailed for many months, changing its name several times. Unable to unload the cargo in any port, the crew was believed to have dumped much of it at sea.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} {{incinerator}} ash being dumped onto the Global South from the Global North in an unjust trade exchange is the Khian <b>Sea</b> waste <b>disposal</b> incident. Carrying 14,000 tons of ash from an incinerator in Philadelphia, the cargo ship, Khian Sea, was {{to dispose of}} its waste. However, upon being rejected by The Dominican Republic, Panama, Honduras, Bermuda, Guinea Bissau, and the Dutch Antilles, the crew finally dumped {{a portion of the}} ash near Haiti. After changing the name of the ship twice to try and conceal the original identity, Senegal, Morocco, Yemen, Sri Lanka, and Singapore still banned the ship’s entry. Upon consistent rejections, the ash {{is believed to have been}} disposed of in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Following this disaster of handling hazardous waste, the Haitian government banned all waste imports leading a movement to recognize all of the disastrous consequences of this global waste trade. Based on the Khian <b>Sea</b> waste <b>disposal</b> incident and similar events, the Basel Convention was written to resist what is known to developing countries as ‘toxic colonialism.’ It was open for signature in March 1989 and went into effect in May 1992. The U.S. has signed the treaty, but has yet to ratify it.|$|R

One-ton containers {{were used for}} bulk storage of CWM and were the largest containers sea disposed. Disposal depths ranged from 300 to 17, 000 feet. Based on a Type D container assembly drawing, three independent analyses (one corrosion and two structural) were performed on the containers to address the corrosion resistance from prolonged exposure to sea water and the structural response during the descent. Corrosion predictions were made using information about corrosion rates and the disposal environment.

Tabular data summarize costs and operation magnitades at the installations. A pattern is established for standardizing the reporting of fixed costs and equipment unsage costs. The economy of solid waste volume reduction is analyzed. Material costs are listed. An outline for recording monthly waste disposal costs is presented.

Included are the steps taken which established a policy, the resulting strategy and the unique and innovative means by which the plan was implemented. The objective was to reduce the financial liability of the waste contained within the drums by removing those portions that had already decayed, segregating the waste in terms of non disposable and disposable isotopes, size reduction and long-term storage of the residues in a retrievable waste form. As part of this process the Company established a UK strategy which would ensure that the Company was self sufficient in radioactive waste handling storage facilities until the provision of a national facility, currently predicted to be approximately 2040...|$|E

The objective of the research is to investigate the best brine disposal option in Gaza Strip. Five options for the disposal of brine were studied: 1) disposal of brine to the sea; 2) discharge of brine to wastewater plant; 3) deep well injection; 4) evaporation pond and 5) land irrigation.

40|$|Phylum-level {{meta-analysis}} {{was applied}} to 192 samples {{from a variety of}} dredgings disposal and relocation sites around the coast of England and Wales. No consistent relationship was found between the disturbance status of macrobenthic communities within disposal sites and the nature or amount of dredgings disposed. Differences between samples within and outside disposal sites were generally smaller than differences between different sites and various patterns of impact were detected. It is concluded that dredgings disposal has two contrasting impacts on benthic communities. One, associated with organic enrichment, leads to communities dominated by annelids and nematodes. The other, associated with intense physical disturbance, favours large motile or armoured forms, such as bivalve molluscs and crustaceans. These effects may act antagonistically, and in a phylum-level meta-analysis may cancel each other out. None of the samples examined from offshore disposal sites was grossly disturbed, in terms of the proportional contribution to production from different phyla, and overall most samples ranged from moderately disturbed to undisturbed. The ecological impacts associated with the intertidal placement of material (beneficial use schemes) were comparable to those observed for the conventional <b>sea</b> <b>disposal</b> sites...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Guilan province, {{with unique}} {{environmental}} values {{is located in}} southwest of the Caspian <b>Sea.</b> <b>Disposal</b> of untreated domestic, industrial and agricultural sewage {{to the surface of}} water pollutes the coastal waters of the Caspian Sea.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the microbial contamination of water in the Caspian shores of Guilan province. Materials and methods: In this study 21 littoral swimming areas in Guilan were studied regarding microbial contamination by microbial indicators of fecal and total coliform with pH, temperature and turbidity during 2009 - 2010. In each swimming area six samples were taken during the study period. The data from the total of 122 samples were analyzed using statistical software.

The contamination of the investigated dredge material was low according to the limited set of chemical parameters that was analysed, Nevertheless the three bioassays showed that some of the dredge material samples significantly affected the survival of oyster larvae and the amphipod B. sarsi, as well as the aerial survival time of mussels, Toxicity was reduced at the off-shore disposal site, probably due to the dispersal of the most polluted finer sediment fractions by strong residual currents, It is concluded that the sediment bioassays used for this study are a meaningful tool that should be incorparated in decision making frameworks for the management of dredge material.

However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|R
40|$|Management of sediments from coastal areas, {{contaminated}} with heavy metals and organic substances, {{is a very}} critical issue. Management decisions are usually based on total pollutant concentrations and various guidelines that are used by different countries. Heavy metals can be mobilized from polluted sediments if {{they are exposed to}} changing environmental conditions that occur during excavation, <b>disposal</b> at <b>sea,</b> or <b>disposal</b> in confined facilities. This paper examines the changes in heavy metals partitioning to binding phases in contaminated marine sediments and the release of metals to the environment. Environmental conditions are simulated by submitting sediments to a modified elutriation test with oxygenated and deoxygenated seawater. A sequential extraction procedure is used to determine the binding fractions of heavy metals in the sediments. Fractionation analysis of excavated marine sediments from the port of Piraeus, Greece showed that copper is primarily associated with organic matter, whereas lead and zinc are primarily associated with iron oxides. Under anoxic conditions, the metals bound to the various binding fractions remain practically stable. On the other hand, under oxic conditions, an increase in the concentration of metals associated with carbonates and a decrease in the concentration of metals associated with organic matter and iron oxides were observed. Both under oxic and anoxic conditions, actual metal mobility was very low and less than 0. 5 % of total metal mass was found in the dissolved phase. Copyright © 2009 by ASTM International...|$|R
