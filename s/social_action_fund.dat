40|$|This publication, Who has the yam {{and who has}} the knife, {{seeks to}} {{illustrate}} and address the creative tension needed to ensure an equitable distribution of power over the development process, by examining how putting the yam (resources) and the knife (the Financing Agreement) {{in the hands of}} the central, and district bureaucracies, and communities respectively can contribute to democratic decentralization. Three <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Funds</b> (SAFs) in Africa are examined in this regard - in Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda. The Community Sub-project Cycle (CPSC), an integral part of the SAFs, is analyzed to show how a demand-driven process with in-built mutual accountability can result in communities realizing their aspirations while remaining accountable to government, and vice versa. The more formal way of capturing the issue would be to ask if governance can be broadened and deepened so that community needs become an intrinsic and measurable part of district and national plans. This"party line"on decentralization is that it is, in general, the way to go - all hindrances to it must be addressed and removed. The question that is very rarely asked is - how does this square with some of the Bank's other dominating approaches, such as Community-Driven Development ? This publication, based on experience from the field, outlines and responds to the challenges posed by this"dual"development. By putting some flesh on the bones of the"party line,"it provokes the intelligence without insulting it, and tells us that often, the real"poverty"is that of ideas and vision. ...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} a community-based participatory action research (PAR) project involving approximately 658 young mothers and over 1200 {{of their children}} living in the three war-torn countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Northern Uganda. Instead of using internationally-defined notions and adult-centric statements about what reintegration is, we sought to understand reintegration from the young mothers’ perspectives, learning from them about what constitutes successful reintegration {{for themselves and their}} children. The project supported the young mothers in implementing actions that they thought would assist them in achieving their notion of successful reintegration. The project was implemented through an academic-NGO partnership that brought together a team from 10 non-governmental organizations, three African academics and four Western academics collaborating on the project over the course of nearly four years. A central goal of the project was to support the implementation of the Paris Principles by providing inputs from the field about how to do reintegration with a strong emphasis on participation in different country contexts. The project centrally involves young mothers as highly-active participants who take leadership roles in program development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, working to reduce the powerful stigma they face through their garnering of local resources. The project works to develop organizational capacity to implement programs using highly participatory approaches. Underpinning all our work was the principle of “Do No Harm. ” Operationally, the project took place in twenty field sites in the three countries. At each field site, agency partners established groups of approximately thirty young mothers who joined together to work collaboratively to identify the problems they and their children were facing and implement initiatives to try and mitigate those problems. Problems identified across the twenty sites were remarkably similar, reflecting difficulties with social stigma, access to education for the participants and their children, access to affordable medical care, and sustainable livelihoods. With local supports and <b>social</b> <b>action</b> <b>funds,</b> young mothers’ groups prioritized their problems and came up with ways of addressing these challenges. Creative <b>social</b> <b>action</b> initiatives included hiring a nurse to teach about hygiene and sanitation, micro-credit to support individual petty trading, opening group businesses like a restaurant or a weaving cooperative, and building a collective groundnut farm on land donated by community members. In addition to the support experienced through the group process, these actions worked to increase the well being of the young mothers and their children and to bring them into the fold of the community. The findings of this multi-year project are highlighted below, followed by recommendations to practitioners, donors, and policy makers operating in the field of reintegration and post-conflict child protection.

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of 'inclusive neoliberalism' that currently characterises international development places a {{particular emphasis on}} community-based responses to the often structural problems of poverty and exclusion.

40|$|Despite their {{explicit}} {{focus on}} reaching the poor, many community driven development (CDD) {{projects have been}} found to be only mildly pro-poor in their funding allocations. This paper presents evidence of an explanation that has been overlooked in the CDD literature to date: the requirement that beneficiaries must apply for projects in order to receive support. The authors first examine data on the universe of project applications and funding under Tanzania's flagship CDD program, Tanzania's <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Fund,</b> and then use a census of 100 program villages to examine the determinants of both program awareness and program participation at the household level. The data paint a consistent picture at both levels: wealth, access to information, and political capital are important correlates of the ability to navigate the application process successfully. The centrally dictated features of this decentralized program appear to be the most effective mechanisms in directing funds to the poor. The results suggest that unless demand-driven projects can develop ways of soliciting engagement from a broader cross-section of the population, they are unlikely to achieve truly progressive targeting.

40|$|The {{philosophy}} of ‘community development ’ {{relates to the}} concept of ‘locality’ and people. In essence it underscores the indispensability of local needs, aspirations and local resource mobilization within geographically and socially defined spheres. Through an appraisal of community involvement in various projects, this paper interrogates the virtues of community development practices in Malawi in the last 40 years. While acknowledging that community development or local participation, as it is popularly known, is ideal in many development activities, this paper argues that participation is not a magic pill for rural development. Participation in gravity water and <b>social</b> <b>action</b> <b>fund</b> projects, among others, provide instances for appreciating the opportunities and the challenges of community development. One such challenge is the absence of projects that are in every sense community-driven. With few exceptions, there is no participation that is truly voluntary. Vulnerability to poverty and lack of resources at community levels defeat efforts towards genuine community development. This is a similar outcome to projects implemented under coercive rule.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{approach to}} human behaviour under scrutiny: {{an overview of}} arguments for the autonomy of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> Abstract. The article reviews and re-examines some arguments against the treatment of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> within the economic approach {{as an extension of}} economic behaviour/ rationality and thus against its denial of the speci®c, irreducible nature of the extra-economic. A major argument is that <b>social</b> <b>action</b> is a sui generis phenomenon that cannot be reduced with theoretical impunity to its economic modalities. <b>Social</b> <b>action</b> is characterized by substantial autonomy relative to economic behaviour/ rationality. Arguments about the autonomous character of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> seek to remedy the indiscriminate extension of the economic approach beyond the ®eld of economy to all human behaviour construed as consistent utility maximization. These arguments adduce certain classes of factors (socio-psychological, socio-cultural, socio-systemic and others) contributing toward the autonomy of <b>social</b> <b>action.</b> In addition, the economic-approach treatment of the human actor as Homo economicus is reversed by conceiving the economy as a domain of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> of which economic behaviour is a special case.

40|$|This {{case study}} reviews the lessons {{arising from the}} design and {{implementation}} of the Northern Uganda <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Fund</b> (NUSAF) Project in conditions of ongoing conflict and post-conflict recovery. While Uganda is not classified as a LICUS state, poverty levels, social indicators and economic conditions in the 18 districts of northern Uganda are comparable to those obtaining in many LICUS contexts, largely as a consequence of prolonged conflict in much of the region. NUSAF is premised on a demand-driven approach in which local communities identify, plan and implement sub-projects that improve local infrastructure, promote livelihood opportunities, and resolve conflict. The $ 133. 5 million project is funded by an IDA loan of $ 100 million, together with a government commitment of $ 13. 5 million, and local contributions of $ 20 million. NUSAF was initiated in mid- 2002 after an intensive two-year design process with three main objectives: reduced poverty, improved governance, and positive spill-over effects through conflict mitigation. The study focuses on how the lessons from earlier interventions in northern Uganda influenced the design of NUSAF, and reviews the lessons to date from scaling-up and implementing a demand-driven approach in conditions of ongoing conflict. Available evidence points to considerable demand from communities for project resources and rapid implementation of infrastructure and income generation projects, confirming the validity of working through local governments, NGOs and community organisations as an appropriate response to problems of endemic poverty, weak capacity and the legacy of violent conflict. ...|$|E
40|$|Rampant {{levels of}} AIDS and poverty have made many {{children}} in sub-Saharan Africa the primary caregivers of their ageing or ailing guardians. This paper {{reports on a}} <b>social</b> <b>action</b> <b>fund</b> initiative that brought caregiving children together to set-up and run income generating activities as a group {{with the aim of}} strengthening their coping capabilities. To further our understanding of child-led microfinance activities, this paper explores how intra-community relations can both facilitate and undermine child-led activities, and how these activities in turn can further strengthen some intra-community relations. Twenty-one children (aged 12 - 17) and six guardians participated in this study. Data included draw-and-write compositions (n= 21), essays (n= 16), workshop notes and proposals (n= 8) and in-depth interviews (n= 16). A thematic analysis revealed that the children actively drew on the expertise and involvement of some guardians in the project as well as on each other, developing supportive peer relations that helped strengthen their coping capabilities. However, the children's disenfranchised position in the community meant that some adults took advantage of the child-led activities for their own personal gain. Some children also showed a lack of commitment to collective work, undermining the morale of their more active peers. Nevertheless, both guardians and the children themselves began to look at caregiving children differently as their engagement in the project began to earn them respect from the community - changing guardian/child relations. The paper concludes that microfinance interventions targeting children and young people must consider children's relationships {{with each other and with}} adults as key determinants of Project success. © 2010 Taylor and Francis...|$|E

At inception in 1989, the GAZEL Cohort Study included 20 625 volunteers working at EDF-GDF then aged from 35 to 50 years (15 011 men and 5614 women). The cohort is broadly diverse in terms of social, economic, and occupational status, health, and health-related behavior. The data collected routinely cover diverse dimensions and come from different sources: annual self-administered questionnaire (morbidity, lifestyles, life events, etc.); personnel department of EDF-GDF for social, demographic, and occupational characteristics; EDF-GDF special social insurance fund (for sickness absences and cancer and ischemic heart disease registries), occupational medicine (occupational exposure and working conditions), <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Fund</b> (healthcare utilization), Health Screening Centers for standardized health examination and the constitution of a biobank, and the National Death Register (causes of death).

Today, more than 40 projects on diversified themes have been set up in the GAZEL Cohort Study by some 30 French and foreign teams. Different health problems taking into account behavioral, social, psychological and medical occupational risk factors have been the object of research projects in the cohort.

40|$|Due to the {{increased}} family poverty, Jamaica and Tanzania, among other strategies, decided to introduce the Conditional Cash Transfers programs (CCTs) in reducing the magnitude of poverty for marginalized groups. Jamaica introduced the Program of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH) in 2002 to address poverty among {{the young and the}} elderly in rural areas, among female-headed households and among large families. Tanzania under Tanzania <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Fund</b> phase one (TASAF 1) established the Community-Based Conditional Cash Transfers Program in 2008 to alleviate poverty among the marginalized groups. It is against this background that this study was formulated to review literature on the role played by Conditional Cash Transfers in the process of poverty alleviation, which focused on most vulnerable children in both countries. The study focused on Conditional Cash Transfers to poor families living with most vulnerable children succeeded in investing in human capital using the capability approach in breaking down the intergenerational cycle of poverty. The study found that, the provision of Conditional Cash Transfers enabled poor families to increasingly enrolling their school going children as well as paying visits to health centres. However, these results cannot sufficiently explain the final outcomes (achievements) in schools. For instance, the capacity of children to get high scores and proceedings to the next class and their health status could have been explained by other factors than the CCTs. The study also found that the targeting strategies used in these programs are inadequate since some of the most vulnerable children like, street children, are not living with families. However, since donor driven programs lead to weak implementation, for these programs to maintain sustainability, both countries should increase social protection budgets and involve communities to full participation from the beginning to the post completion follow up to check on the quality of services provided.

40|$|Vulnerability {{appears to}} be rising for many Malawians, whose {{exposure}} to livelihood shocks is increasing while their ability to cope is decreasing. The {{first part of this}} report draws on recently published studies and analysis of the 2004 / 05 Integrated Household Survey dataset to explore the nature of vulnerability in Malawi. Most livelihoods in Malawi depend on agriculture, but agricultural vulnerability is extremely high due to erratic rainfall, inequality in landholdings, constrained access to inputs, limited diversification and weak markets. Noneconomic factors that compound economic risks include demographic and health risks, gendered vulnerabilities, social change and governance failures. Economic vulnerability, defined as the risk of future monetary poverty, is high because of the heavy concentration of Malawians clustered close to the poverty line, and because of the frequency and severity of covariant shocks such as droughts, floods and food price fluctuations, as well as idiosyncratic shocks such as accidents, illness and death of family members. The economic, demographic and social impacts of HIV/AIDS are especially devastating. Monetary and subjective indicators of vulnerability are related to demographic characteristics (female- and older-headed households, orphans), lack of assets, geographic location (with a north-south gradient of rising vulnerability) and multiple shocks. Policy priorities derived from this analysis include: stabilise food prices, enhance access to agricultural inputs, and identify labour-saving technologies for labour-constrained households. More generally, social protection and livelihood promotion measures, together with an enabling environment, are central to addressing vulnerability in Malawi. The second part of this report reviews a range of ongoing and discontinued social protection mechanisms in Malawi. Free inputs distribution (‘Starter Packs’) followed the abolition of fertiliser subsidies in the 1990 s, and had positive impacts on food production and prices. Public works programmes (food-, cash- or inputs-for-work), social funds (the Malawi <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Fund)</b> and food transfers (food aid, school feeding) also have long histories in Malawi, but have demonstrated limited impacts. Finally, unconditional cash transfers are increasingly popular, which this review endorses with the qualification that ongoing pilot projects need to be institutionalised within a comprehensive, government owned, national social protection strategy.

40|$|Poverty mapping applies {{models of}} {{household}} welfare developed from detailed household consumption and expenditure {{surveys to the}} extensive but less detailed data from national censuses. A poverty map for Malawi, developed by drawing upon information from the 1997 – 98 Malawi Integrated Household Survey with the 1998 Malawi Population and Housing Census, provides aggregate estimates of household welfare and poverty at a highly disaggregated level—down {{to the level of}} local government wards. Given the close association between welfare and food security in most Malawi households, such a detailed poverty map can be of considerable value to development and relief organizations, as they plan and target activities to improve the ability of poor households to cope with food scarcity. This paper assesses the value of the Malawi poverty map with reference to two activities of the World Food Programme (WFP) in Malawi: the Food for Assets and Development (FFASD) public works program and the Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) food insecurity information generation system. First, the poverty targeting efficiency of the FFASD program is evaluated using the poverty map to determine whether the FFASD projects are preferentially located in areas where disproportionate numbers of the poor are found. This is done in part by comparing the poverty targeting efficiency of the WFP program to that of the Malawi <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Fund</b> Public Works Programme projects. Second, WFP employs the VAM methodology to determine how and where to employ its resources from year to year. The potential value of the poverty map as a component of the VAM process in Malawi is then considered. The results indicate that the poverty map is an effective and objective way to geographically target projects and programs on a poverty basis in Malawi. In assessing household vulnerability to food insecurity, the poverty map serves as a useful proxy indicator of spatial variability in the ability of the population to cope with food scarcity. Poverty maps, in those countries were they are available, should be a privileged data source for undertaking any national vulnerability analyses. However, the poverty map needs to be used with complementary data to better understand the risks households face that might result in food scarcity and the actual mechanisms households use to cope with such stresses.
