500|$|In {{contrast}} to her character in Little Children , Winslet next {{took on a}} part she could [...] "fully embrace and really adore" [...] in Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy The Holiday. She played Iris, a Britisher who temporarily exchanges homes with an American (played by Cameron Diaz) during the Christmas holiday season. The film became Winslet's biggest commercial success in nine years, grossing over US$205 million worldwide. The critic Justin Chang thought that the film was formulaic yet pleasing, and took note of Winslet's radiance and charm. In her final release of the year, Winslet voiced Rita, a scavenging <b>sewer</b> <b>rat,</b> in the animated film Flushed Away. Winslet's sole project of 2007 was as the narrator for the English version of the French children's film The Fox and the Child.|$|E
2500|$|Basil {{was first}} modeled on Bing Crosby, but the animators {{eventually}} took inspiration from Leslie Howard. Initially, Ratigan {{had been designed}} as thin, weasely, and ratlike. Following the screening of Champagne for Caesar, Glen Keane noted that following the casting of Price, [...] "is expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character." [...] Additionally, during one story meeting, Glen Keane decided to base the stature of Ratigan on then-Disney CEO Ron Miller, who was a 6'6" [...] former football player for the Los Angeles Rams. Furthermore, Keane lifted his personality as he was thumbing through these [...] "photographs of people of London in the 1800s, of railroad men, {{and there was this}} one guy smoking a cigar — he had a top hat and there was just something about this guy — this Ratigan...this rat sucking the cigar, completely dressed to the hilt, he was sharp and perfect — he's a <b>sewer</b> <b>rat</b> dressed like a king and he lives as a king!" [...] The following supervising animators included Mark Henn for Basil, Hendel Butoy for Dawson, Rob Minkoff for Olivia, Andreas Deja for Queen Moustoria, Ruben Aquino for Mrs. Judson, and Mike Gabriel for Toby and Felicia.|$|E

6000|$|The sheets {{dropped from}} his hand. Very slowly he was {{grasping}} the appalling fact {{that on the}} floor beside his chair lay the life or death of yet another man; that by taking this confession he had taken into his own hands the fate of the vagabond lying under sentence of death; that he could not give him back his life without incurring the smirch of this disgrace, without even endangering himself. If he let this confession reach the authorities, he could never escape the gravest suspicion that he had known of the whole affair during these two months. He would have to attend the inquest, be recognised by that policeman as having come to the archway to see where the body had lain, as having visited the girl the very evening after the murder. Who would believe in the mere coincidence of such visits {{on the part of the}} murderer's brother. But apart from that suspicion, the fearful scandal which so sensational an affair must make would mar his career, his life, his young daughter's life! Larry's suicide with this girl would make sensation enough as it was; but nothing to that other. Such a death had its romance; involved him in no way save as a mourner, could perhaps even be hushed up! The other--nothing could hush that up, nothing prevent its ringing to the house-tops. He got up from his chair, and for many minutes roamed the room unable to get his mind to bear on the issue. Images kept starting up before him. The face of the man who handed him wig and gown each morning, puffy and curious, with a leer on it he had never noticed before; his young daughter's lifted eyebrows, mouth drooping, eyes troubled; the tiny gilt crucifix glinting in the hollow of the dead girl's arm; the sightless look in Larry's unclosed eyes; even his own thumb and finger pulling the lids down. And then he saw a street and endless people passing, turning to stare at him. And, stopping in his tramp, he said aloud: [...] "Let them go to hell! Seven days' wonder!" [...] Was he not trustee to that confession! Trustee! After all he had done nothing to be ashamed of, even if he had kept knowledge dark. A brother! Who could blame him? And he picked up those sheets of paper. But, like a great murky hand, the scandal spread itself about him; its coarse malignant voice seemed shouting: [...] "Paiper!... Paiper!... Glove Lane Murder!... Suicide and confession of brother of well-known K.C..... Well-known K.C.'s brother.... Murder and suicide.... Paiper!" [...] Was he to let loose that flood of foulness? Was he, who had done nothing, to smirch his own little daughter's life; to smirch his dead brother, their dead mother--himself, his own valuable, important future? And all for a <b>sewer</b> <b>rat!</b> Let him hang, let the fellow hang if he must! And that was not certain. Appeal! Petition! He might--he should be saved! To have got thus far, and then, by his own action, topple himself down! ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} 50 {{years of the}} 19th century the {{population}} of London more than doubled from 1 million to 2.3 million.

Known for their Dadaist-inspired between-song routines, one reviewer described their performance while opening for Buffalo Springfield at San Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium as being like [...] "the Three Stooges playing strip poker with Iggy and the Stooges."

The enormous popularity of the book in France spurred the nascent historical preservation movement in that country and strongly encouraged Gothic revival architecture. Ultimately it led to major renovations at Notre-Dame in the 19th century led by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Much of the cathedral's present appearance {{is a result of}} this renovation.|$|R

50|$|A {{good example}} of this is the albino rat which possesses, in the wild a {{notoriously}} fatal genetic make-up making it much easier to identify to predators, a coat which drew interest in breeders so as to distinguish them from their more unhygienic-looking sewer counterparts prevalent in major cities in the 1800s. So numerous were rats in industrial cities, they became the subject of a sport based on their extermination, rat-baiting. The albino rat thus became distinguished from the regular unsightly <b>sewer</b> <b>rat</b> and even became sold as pets, the owning of one as a child allegedly the basis for Beatrix Potter's book Samuel Whiskers.|$|E
50|$|Six {{religious}} {{members of}} the community live at the convent: the mother Superior, four other nuns and the chaplain. To reinforce their vows of humility, the Mother Superior has given the other nuns repulsive new names: Sister Manure, Sister Damned, Sister Snake and Sister <b>Sewer</b> <b>Rat.</b> With few opportunities for spiritual ministry, the nuns have begun to indulge in their own idiosyncratic pursuits in order to pass the time. The nurturing Sister Damned compulsively cleans the convent and coddles all the animals under her care, including an overgrown pet tiger that she treats like a son, playing the bongos for him. The ascetic Sister Manure is consumed by thoughts of penitence and corporal self-sacrifice and cooks between LSD hallucinations. She murdered somebody and as the mother superior lied under oath to save her from jail, she is very devoted to her. The overcurious Sister <b>Sewer</b> <b>Rat</b> gardens and secretly, under the pen name Concha Torres, writes lurid novels about the wayward souls who visit the convent. She smuggles the novels out of the convent through her sister's periodic visits. The unassuming Sister Snake, {{with the help of the}} priest, tailors seasonal fashion collections for dressing the statues of the Virgin Mary. Her piety is a cover up for her romantic love for the chain-smoking chaplain. The mother Superior is a heavy drug user and a lesbian, whose charitable work is a means of meeting needy young women. She admits, “From admiring them so much I have become one of them”.|$|E

However, in 20 albino rats treated with corticosteroids (betamethazone) we found 8 positive (40 %) and in 20 albino mice treated by the same way, 9 were positive for P. carinii (45 %).
