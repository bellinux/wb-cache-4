50|$|Baselines {{themselves}} are valued {{not only to}} use to identify the notable <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> product(s) but also provide historical views of how work product elements have proceeded together over time. When an historical baseline is retrieved, {{the state of the}} work product(s) in that subset share the same significance in their history of changes; that allows project leaders to compare the relative progress of single parts of a project to the project as whole, which allows project leaders to identify individual items that lag or lead in progress toward better functionality or performance. For this reason, baseline identification, monitoring, and retrieval are {{critical to the success of}} configuration management. Once retrieved, the baseline may be compared to a particular configuration or another baseline.|$|E

According to the second assumption, as y goes to zero (during a distraction), l0(y) goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> before the inhibition can reach zero. For a work interval starting at t0 with inhibition level y0=Y(t0) the transition rate at time t0+t is given by λ1(t) = l1(y0+a1t).

Chapter 2 contains the general discussion <b>of</b> the 16 <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> which may establish themselves for a blade screw. The existence of the vortex ring state and the whirling phenomenon are established. All the fundamental functions which enter the blade-screw theory are submitted to a general analytical discussion.

40|$|Open audio/video links as {{means for}} coordination- two case studies From the {{multitude}} of workplace studies {{that we have seen}} during the last decades, {{it has been shown that}} a common environment to a large extent supports coordination of work. The use of common artifacts and awareness of the co-workers activities effortlessly afford communication of the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Inevitably, a question arises: how can we get similar support for distributed groups? One idea has been to use a continuously open video and/or audio link, i. e. a media space, to support the informal coordination possibilities that are lacking in a distributed setting. In this paper, two cases from air traffic control are presented, where the long-term use of video and audio links plays an important role for communicating realtime updates of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The possibility to overhear and oversee what the colleagues are doing in remote positions reduces to a large extent the amount of obtrusive and time-consuming phone calls. The features and the successful use of these so-called focused media spaces are discussed in this paper...|$|E
