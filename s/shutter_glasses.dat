25|$|As astronauts {{frequently}} have motion sickness, NASA has done extensive {{research on the}} causes and treatments for motion sickness. One very promising looking treatment is for the person suffering from motion sickness to wear LCD <b>shutter</b> <b>glasses</b> that create a stroboscopic vision of 4Hz with a dwell of 10 milliseconds.|$|E

25|$|Nintendo began {{experimenting with}} {{stereoscopic}} 3D video game {{technology in the}} 1980s. The Famicom 3D System, an accessory consisting of liquid crystal <b>shutter</b> <b>glasses,</b> was Nintendo's first product that enabled stereoscopic 3D effects. Although very few titles were released, Nintendo helped design one—called —which was co-developed by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory and released in 1988. The Famicom 3D System failed to garner market interest and was never released outside Japan.|$|E
50|$|Regarding how {{a signal}} once it's decoded {{is sent to}} the display, current {{stereoscopic}} systems use a frame-sequential 3D signal. Left and right frames are sent alternately to the display and by diverse systems like <b>shuttered</b> <b>glasses</b> or polarized glasses are then shown to each eye. This involves that the real frame frequency halves the video frame frequency.|$|R
50|$|The major {{advantage}} of the <b>shutter</b> <b>glass</b> system was that it allowed the same display {{to be used for}} multiple unrelated images, one of which was visible without any glasses at all. Unfortunately, the contrast ratio of the public image is only 1/2 the available contrast ratio of the CRT when driven with only a public image.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a case study}} that assessed the strenghts and weaknesses of 30 display modes: perspective viewing, anaglyph stereo and <b>shutter</b> <b>glass</b> stereo. We fol-lowed the hypothesis that stereo viewing allows a faster and more accurate recognition than the anaglyph and the perspective viewing. For our case study, we used organic molecules. Although these have inherent spatial informa-tion we think that results of this experiments are applicable to the visualization of abstract information spaces in VL. ...|$|R
500|$|Shoot 'em ups such as SNK's Ikari Warriors (1986) {{featuring}} {{characters on}} foot, rather than spacecraft, became {{popular in the}} mid-1980s {{in the wake of}} action movies such as [...] The origins of this type go back to Sheriff by Nintendo, released in 1979. Taito's Front Line (1982) established the upwards-scrolling formula later popularized by Commando, in 1985. Commando also drew comparisons to Rambo and indeed contemporary critics considered military themes and protagonists similar to Rambo or Schwarzenegger prerequisites for a shoot 'em up, as opposed to an action-adventure game. In 1986, Arsys Software released WiBArm, a shooter that switched between a 2D side-scrolling view in outdoor areas to a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, while bosses were fought in an arena-style 2D battle, with the game featuring a variety of weapons and equipment. In 1987, Square's 3-D WorldRunner was an early stereoscopic 3-D shooter played from a third-person perspective, followed later that year by its sequel JJ, and the following year by Space Harrier 3-D which used the SegaScope 3-D <b>shutter</b> <b>glasses.</b> That same year, Sega's Thunder Blade switched between both a top-down view and a third-person view, and introduced the use of force feedback, where the joystick vibrates. Also in 1987, Konami created Contra as an coin-op arcade game that was particularly acclaimed for its multi-directional aiming and two player cooperative gameplay. However, by the early 1990s and the popularity of 16-bit consoles, the scrolling shooter genre was overcrowded, with developers struggling to make their games stand out (one exception being the inventive Gunstar Heroes, by Treasure).|$|E

The small statue of a dancer had previously been used in his 1904 film The Ballet-Master's Dream, while the lamppost prop was recycled from his 1905 film Unexpected Fireworks. The posters on the outside wall, ostensibly campaigning for political candidates, are in fact private jokes: the candidates' names are given as [...] "Claudel", the name of Méliès's set painter; [...] "L.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{developed}} an system which combines realtime dynamic simulations, 3 D display, and magnetic lev-itation to provide high-fidelity co-located haptic and graphic interaction. Haptic interaction is generated by a horizontal array of cylindrical coils which act in combination to produce arbitrary forces and torques in any direction on magnets fixed to an instrument handle held by the user, according to the position and orientation sensed by a motion tracking sensor and the dynamics of a realtime physical simulation. Co-located graphics are provided by a thin flat screen placed directly above the coil array so that the 3 D display of virtual objects shares the same volume as the motion range of the handheld instrument. <b>Shuttered</b> <b>glasses</b> and a head tracking system are used to preserve the alignment of the displayed environment and the interaction handle according to the user’s head position. Interactive demonstration environments include rigid bodies with solid contacts, suspended mass-spring-damper assemblies, and deformable surfaces. Keywords-haptics, interaction, simulation I...|$|R

In this study such results accuracy and time of eighty-one users were measured performing realistic 3 D tasks to research the structures of organic molecules. A subsequent comparison of cost vs. performance can represent a meaningful help for decision-making of users and designers. The experiment was designed and conducted in cooperation of computer and chemical scientists.
