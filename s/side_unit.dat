40|$|Abstract- Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) is {{a special}} type of Intelligent Transport System (ITS), where the mobile nodes are cars, two wheelers, trucks, buses etc., that move on well {{organized}} and predefined roads in both direction at very high speed. Following traffic rules, the vehicles provide communication with each other directly (Inter Vehicle Communication- IVC) or indirectly through the Road <b>Side</b> <b>Unit</b> (RSU). Usually vehicles, which move outside the city area, do not get the response from the Road <b>Side</b> <b>Unit,</b> as its availability is limited in that area. For this purpose an attempt {{has been made to}} create a new clustering concept, which {{can be applied to the}} newly created Simple High Way Mobility Model, to increase the speed of the vehicle communication.

Specifically, when employing TDMA for vehicular communications, the upper bound of delay can be guaranteed and packet collisions rarely happen even in high vehicle density due to a well-organized time schedule [6, 7].

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} an aggregator controlling a mixed portfolio of conventional power generators and demand <b>side</b> <b>units.</b> The generators are controllable within certain power and ramp limitations while the demand <b>side</b> <b>units</b> {{are characterized by}} flexible consumptions and therefore can be treated as energy storages of limited capacity. We {{address the problem of}} reducing the load on the conventional generators by letting the flexible consumers participate in the provision of primary frequency reserve. In particular, it is desired that the flexible consumers compensate for rapid grid frequency changes. In this work, we design an aggregator control strategy based on closed-loop model predictive control. The controller is able to mobilize the flexible consumers ahead of time such that we are able to reduce the load on the conventional generators by more extensive use of the demand <b>side</b> <b>units.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the relation between}} message delivery delay and reliability for the communication between a vehicle and a road <b>side</b> <b>unit</b> (RSU). We focus on sparse vehicular sensor networks (VSNs), where timely message delivery and reliable transmission are of significant importance. We present a mathematical framework for the message delivery delay distribution for a two-lane road, where vehicles in one direction act as message carriers for {{the ones in the}} other direction and have the freedom to leave the road from randomly distributed road junctions with a certain probability. Packet generator vehicles store the original packets till meeting an RSU while sending multiple copies of each packet to packet carrier vehicles. Our analysis offers an analytical tool for an intelligent transportation system (ITS) service provider to determine the minimum RSU density required to cover a road for meeting a probabilistic requirement of the message delay. Extensive computer simulation results show the accuracy of our analysis and clearly indicate the relation of packet delay and the number of packet replicas.

40|$|VANET is {{the special}} type of MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Networks) where the mobile nodes are {{vehicles}} that move on roads {{at very high}} speed following traffic rules; they provide communication between vehicle and vehicle (V 2 V) and Vehicle and Road side infrastructural unit (V 2 I). This paper explores {{the possibility of using}} VANET in inter vehicular communication. An attempt has been made earlier to create a new cluster model for efficient communication among the VANET nodes by the author [1]. A new clustering model has been created after taking the Simple Highway Vehicular model concept into consideration. This paper focuses the development of a clustering framework for data communication among the VANET nodes and the service discovery in Highway VANET model where the vehicles are moving outside the city.

30|$|The {{development}} of VANETs {{is motivated by}} the desire to disseminate road safety information among vehicles to prevent accidents and improve the road safety. All data collected from the sensors on a vehicle can be displayed to the driver or sent to a road <b>side</b> <b>unit</b> (RSU) or be broadcasted to neighbouring vehicles depending on certain requirements [12].

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a secure {{cooperative}} data downloading framework for paid services in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In our framework, vehicles download data when they pass by a road <b>side</b> <b>unit</b> (RSU) and then share the data after they travel {{out of the}} RSU’s coverage. A fundamental issue of cooperative data downloading is how vehicles effectively share data with each other. We develop an application layer data sharing protocol which coordinates the vehicles to relay data for sharing according to their positions. Such coordinated sharing can avoid collisions in the medium access control (MAC) layer and the hidden terminal issue in multi-hop transmissions. A salient feature of the proposed sharing protocol {{is that it can}} guarantee the receipt of the requested data file for each applicant vehicle passing a road <b>side</b> <b>unit.</b> Moreover, we also address secu-rity and privacy issues in the process of data downloading and sharing, ensuring applicants ’ exclusive access to the applied data and privacy of the vehicles involved in the application. We carry out NS 2 simulations to thoroughly examine the performance of the proposed cooperative downloading protocol implemented over an 802. 11 p based VANETs.

40|$|Communication network {{plays an}} {{important}} role in providing safe vehicular movement. The main achievement of VANET is providing comfort and safety for passengers. In addition to that, various transactions like information on accident, road condition, petrol bank details, menu in the restaurant, and discount sales can be provided to the drivers and passengers. The speed and time in which the message is sent and received plays an essential part in the Intelligent Transport System (ITS). For this the VANET requires efficient and reliable methods for data communication. Most of the earlier research works deal with the transaction based services provided by road <b>side</b> <b>unit.</b> Moreover the earlier works concentrate on the Intelligent Transport System limited to the city areas where road side units are available in plenty.
