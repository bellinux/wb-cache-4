40|$|AbstractThis review {{summarizes}} over 160 studies {{focused on}} soil contamination near non-ferrous metal smelters. The methods of these investigations were examined {{with an emphasis}} on the combinations of traditional (geo) chemical approaches with various mineralogical and metal isotope techniques that are particularly helpful for depicting the fate of smelter-derived contamination in the soil. Differences in the distributions and binding of metal(loid) s in smelter-affected soils from temperate and (sub) tropical climatic zones indicate the greater vulnerability of the latter. Prevailing wind direction is a key factor affecting the dispersion of smelter emissions and their subsequent deposition into the soils, with greater importance found especially in arid areas. Whereas the greatest contamination is generally observed in the surface soil layers, downward migration of metal(loid) s in the soil profiles has been documented at numerous sites. Contamination of smelter soils significantly affects both plants and soil organisms, but suitable remediation techniques (such as chemical <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> by amendments) can be used for reducing the bioavailability of contaminants...|$|E

The improvement of the physical characteristics of clay soils related to subgrade construction can be achieved by mixing lime of certain proportion into the soil. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the amount of lime required for subgrade stabilization which have high clay content in Pulau Laut, South Kalimantan The investigation reveals the following : 1. The efective amount of lime <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> is 7 percent of the dry weight of the soil, resulting in the following physical properties :- Bearing capacity is 167 kg/cm 2 at air dry condition,- Percent of swell is 2. 3,- Plasticity index is 25. 5, and- pH is 9. 00. 2.

Although the effects of non-traditional additives on the geotechnical properties of tropical soils have been subject of investigation in recent years, the effects of magnesium chloride (MgCl 2) on the macro- and micro-structural characteristics of peat soil have not been fully studied. This study investigates the effect of MgCl 2 on the physico-chemical characteristics of tropical peat. Unconfined compression strength tests were performed as an index of soil improvement in treated samples. In addition, the micro-structural characteristics of untreated and treated peat were investigated using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques such as X-ray diffractometry, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller surface area analysis. From an engineering point of view, the results indicated that the strength of MgCl 2 -stabilized peat improved significantly. The degree of improvement was approximately six times stronger than untreated peat, after a 7 -day curing period. Additionally, the micro-structural study revealed that the stabilization process led to a few changes in the mineralogical, morphological, and molecular characteristics of the selected peat.

In Italy, they generate some two million tons of waste materials per year; from an international point of view, only a minor part of these wastes is reused as marginal materials. In road construction the recycling of electric-arc furnace slag is very interesting because of the significant environmental considerations connected with this matter. The Authors propose the use of EAF slag for the <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils,</b> giving at the same time a complete survey of the percentages of use and of the deriving benefits. Therefore, chosen a study soil, three different binary mixes soil-EAF slag are analyzed with slag percentages equal to 10 %, 15 % and 20 %, and finally the 20 % percentage is considered the best. Subsequently, the study considers two additional ternary mixtures, soil-EAF slag-hydrated lime, with optimal percentage of slag equal to 20 % and hydrated lime equal to 2 % and 4 %. The analysis of the five admixtures prepared, from the point of view of compaction tests, CBR tests in optimal conditions and after water imbibitions and compression test with free lateral expansion, allowed an investigation on the performances of each of them and the conclusion on useful design indications for the use of such slag in road constructions...|$|E

It has been well established that the size, shape, and arrangement of soil particles will affect the treatment process of natural soil with stabilizers. Also, the degree of enhancement is dependent on the morphology of the new formed products that bond the soil particles together. In this paper, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test was performed as an index of soil improvement on liquid-stabilized (TX- 85) mix designs. The time-dependent change in shear properties and compressibility behavior of treated soil was also studied using standard direct shear and consolidation tests. To better understand the structure and surface morphology of treated particles, FESEM, N 2 -BET and particle size distribution analysis were performed on soil-stabilizer matrix. From engineering point of view, the UCS results indicated that the degree of improvement for TX- 85 -stabilized laterite soil was approximately four times greater than the natural soil in a 7 -day curing time period. Also, increased compressibility resistance of treated samples with curing time was evident. Based on the results, it was found that the stabilization process modifies the porous network of laterite soil. In addition, new white layers of reaction products were formed on the surface of clay particles...|$|E

The practical data obtained by the authors has proven that impregnation of soils both improves their bearing capacity and converts them into structural elements.

40|$|Abstract: Soil {{stabilized}} with fly ash is {{the most}} frequently used method in improvement of the geotechnical properties of soil in South Africa and it is increasingly gaining interest internationally. However, South Africa has several standards and regulations for the use of fly ash and other by products in the soil stabilization process as well as in concrete production. Activated fly ash has not been explored for <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> in South Africa. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to empirically evaluate the use of chemically activated class „F‟ fly ash obtained from Lethabo power plant in South Africa. The use of the activated fly ash could improve the geotechnical properties [including consistency limits, compaction properties, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), elasticity modulus, durability, california bearing ratio (CBR) and hydraulic conductivity]of the two different fine-grained soils tested in this study. A Red soil sample collected from Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa was studied in two combinations; a proportion of 50 % Kaolinite + 50 % Red soil = Kaolinite soil and 30 % Bentonite + 20 % Kaolinite + 50 % Red soil = Bentonite soil. Soils used in the study were built up from the red soil with different proportions to Bentonite and Kaolinite clays.

40|$|Wildfire {{has become}} a major {{disturbance}} agent in Mediterranean area, with Galicia in the north-west of Spain having the most frequent fires. In order to combat soil erosion, different post-fire stabilization treatments can be applied, like adding different mulch materials. In a laboratory experiment we evaluated the effect of adding plant residues, commonly used in post-fire rehabilitation (wheat straw, coconut fibre, Eucalyptus bark and wood chips), at two different rates on the microbial response (respiration, bacterial and fungal growth, using leucine and acetate-in-ergosterol incorporation, and biomass and community structure by means of phospholipids fatty acid analysis) in an acid forest soil affected by a high intensity wildfire. We expected fungal growth to be favoured compared to bacterial growth after adding plant material with high C/N content, especially at the higher rate. Compared to unburnt soil, burnt soil had higher pH (increasing from 4. 4 to 5. 8) and more extractable (available) C, resulting in a relatively higher increase in bacterial compared to fungal growth. Adding Eucalyptus residues to burnt soil, especially wood chips, favoured fungal growth, especially at the higher rate. Straw addition favoured both fungal and bacterial growth and was the substrate most available for decomposition, as indicated by the higher soil respiration rates. Coconut fibre contained less available C. Adding Eucalyptus residue, at both rates, and coconut fibres at the high rate, initially inhibited bacterial growth, resulting in at most a 14 day lag period. Aiming at high fungal to bacterial growth in order to maximize <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> through fungi suggest Eucalyptus residues to the prime choice for further studies on effective mulching agents, although coconut fibres, with low degradation rates, may also be a suitable choice. Nevertheless, besides aspects related to soil quality, additional information concerning the efficiency of these materials to control post-fire soil erosion should also be considered before their implementation under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{can be used}} to {{remediate}} polluted soil {{or water}} (phytoremediation) by extracting and / or degrading pollu-tants[1 - 2]and for <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> and ediments[3](phytostabilization) in order to prevent erosion and to minimize the re-lease of contaminants from the solid matrix. A broad range of inorganic and organic pollutants can thus be processed by usingsuitable plants that are tolerant of the pollutants, generate high biomass, and are effective in uptake. As an example, water hyacinths can be used for extracting and degrading cyanide from gold mining process water that usually contains cyanide spe-cies and heavy metals in concentrations of toxicological concern. We determined a lethal dose (LC 50) of about 13 mg cya-nide / L for the water hyacinths and observed that under field conditions in a pilot scale wetland the plants became more effec-tive after several applications in degrading cyanide even at high concentrations. Experiments with radio-labelled cyanide re-vealed that the carbon and nitrogen of cyanide in the plants were used to biosynthesize asparagine; thus the toxic cyanide was effectively transformed into a non-toxic, natural product[4]. Waste disposal sites can be remediated with plants both with re-spect to leaching - the percolating water may contain high concentrations of pollutants and with respect to the stabilization of slopes in order to reduce erosion. We used the concept of dense vegetation on an industrial waste site and grew douglas firs that perform high evapo-transpiration rates throughout the year and thus reduce the amount of leachate from the dump site. For stabilization of the slopes it is possible to first install a stable, diamond-shaped network of living plants (willows), levelup the network with soil and spray a mixture of suitable seeds of grass, shrubs or trees (truck wet application) which will further stabilize the soil during growth. This technique can be applied also to river banks for erosion control...|$|E

The results showed a strong variability in GRSP (6. 6 - 36. 8 mg g(- 1)), Cu content (62 - 831 mg kg(- 1) for the total Cu and 5. 8 - 326 mg kg(- 1) for the available Cu) and pH (4. 2 - 5. 5) in the different plant and rhizospheric zones analyzed. A strong relationship between the GRSP with the soil Cu and Zn contents was found (r= 0. 89 and 0. 76 for Cu and Zn respectively, p< 0. 001). The GRSP-bound Cu ranged from 3. 76 to 89. 0 mg g(- 1) soil and represents 1. 44 - 27. 5 % of the total Cu content in soil. Moreover, the WSA reached 89 % in P. viridis R. For this plant, the C contained in GRSP represented up to 89 % of SOC, and this coincided with the most extreme conditions of soil degradation within the ecosystem (the highest content of heavy metals and low pH values).

40|$|The <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> {{roadside}} embankments is a {{major challenge}} for land managers worldwide. While most studies focused on the short-term influence of revegetation measures (such as planting or hydroseeding) on soil stabilization, {{little is known about}} the long-term effect of successional dynamics occurring along roadsides. Our aim is to explore the influence of a vegetation successional dynamic on the <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> aggregates, a proxy for soil stability, along a 70 -years roadside chronosequence. We selected 24 plots (16 x 4 m) on embankments along roadsides in the Mediterranean region (South France), spread into 5 age-classes (0 - 10; 11 - 20; 21 - 30; 31 - 40 and > 40 years-old, Fig. 1). [br/] We measured soil aggregate stability and several soil (soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen, soil texture, pH, CEC) and vegetation (root morphology, root mass density, plant community composition) characteristics. We found that soil aggregate stability varied significantly along the successional gradient, from unstable in early-successional plots (0 - 10 years-old) to very stable in late-successional plots (> 40 years-old). More precisely, soil aggregates first appeared stable in the 31 - 40 years-old age class, reflecting that efficient <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> embankments by vegetation dynamics required about 3 decades (Fig. 2). We notice that the most critical period for embankment stability is restricted to the 0 - 10 years-old class, characterized by unstable aggregates and thus high erosive risk, while moderate stability is reached from 11 - 20 years-old class. This highlights the importance to invest in revegetation measures in the first decade after roadside construction. Along the gradient, the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> organic carbon related to plant community dynamics appeared as the major factor driving the <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> aggregates. The increase in root density also enhanced soil aggregate stability. Remarkably, the replacement of herbs species by shrubs and tree species as the succession proceeded was not related to any destabilization <b>of</b> the <b>soils,</b> even though the direct soil coverage is usually reduced by encroachment. To conclude, vegetation successional dynamics are responsible for the long-term stabilization soil aggregates on roadside embankments...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the mechanisms responsible for the strengthening of “geomimetic” materials, especially the chemical bonding between clay and humic substances. The mineral matter is lateritic clay which mainly consists in kaolinite, goethite, hematite and quartz. The other starting products are fulvic acid (FA) and lime. The preparation of these geomimetic materials is inspired from the natural <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> by humic substances occurring over thousands of years. The present process involves acidic and alkaline reactions followed by a curing period of 18 days at 60 °C under a water saturated atmosphere. The acceleration of the strengthening process usually observed in soils makes this an original process for treatment of soils. The consolidation of the “geomimetic” materials could result from two major phenomena: (i) chemical bonding at the interface between the clay particles and iron compounds and the functional groups of the fulvic acid, (ii) a partial dissolution of the clay grains followed by the precipitation of the cementitious phases, namely calcium silicate hydrates, calcium aluminate hydrates and mixed calcium silicum and aluminum hydrates. Indeed, the decrease of the BET specific area of the lateritic clay after 24 h of reaction with FA added to the structural reorganization observed between 900 and 1000 °C in the “geomimetic” material, and to the results of adsorption measurements, confirm the formation of organo-ferric complexes [1]. The presence of iron oxides in clay, in the form of goethite, appears to be another parameter in favor of a ligand exchange process and the creation of binding bridges between FA and the mineral matter. Indeed all faces of goethite are likely to be involved in complexation reactions whereas in lateritic clay only lateral faces could be involved [2]. The results of the adsorption experiments realized at a local scale will improve our understandings about the process of adsorption of FA on lateritic clays and its involvement in the strengthening process of materials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- All machine {{foundations}} except {{very small}} ones {{should be regarded}} as engineering problem to be dealt with cautiously. The larger ones give rise to enormous dynamic loads, causing vibrations, which the designer must take into account. Care must be taken to ensure smooth running of machine by avoiding harmful vibrations in the base or in the sub-soil or if the foundation does not rest on the ground, in the floor which supports it and may transmit vibrations to the surroundings. Foundation vibrations may result in differential settlement of foundation, deformation and cracks which may greatly disturb the operation of the machine. Potential uneven wear may result in running hot or even in shaft failure with subsequent standstillness of the machine and perhaps the shutdown of works involving serious loss in production. Vibrations may be particularly harmful where the gas pipelines are connected to the foundations, because the vibrations may impair the tightness of the pipe joints, with possible gas leakage and explosion causing considerable damage. Workers health too requires avoidance of vibrations. Care must be taken that laboratories using precision instruments are sited sufficiently far away to avoid soil vibrations. The presence of heavy road and rail traffic in close vicinity of industrial as well as office and residential areas has amplified the vibration problem. Particularly dangerous oscillations may arise if tower like industrial structures such as silos and chimneystacks are subjected to periodic forces. Prior attention must be given to eliminate the harmful oscillations or reducing them to acceptable limits. In the present paper, an overview of various vibration isolation techniques has been carried out. Most of the available methods for active isolation, i. e. isolation at the source and passive isolation, i. e. isolation at the receiver have been discussed. These methods include inner balancing in machines, isolation by location, <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils,</b> use of structural measures and seismic mountings.

30|$|Soil {{improvement}} can {{be undertaken}} {{by a variety}} of ground improvement techniques such as compaction, reinforcement, drainage, and addition of natural and synthetic materials or a combination of physical and chemical methods [4, 16]. Chemical stabilization or addition of different natural and synthetic material to the soil has been experienced in recent years. Lime, cement and pozzolanic materials are the most common construction materials which are extensively used for <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils.</b> Recently different modern technologies such as nanoparticles were used for stabilization of the soils [3]. Sakr et al. [18] studied the geotechnical and mineralogical properties of a lime treated high organic soft clay soil and showed that with increasing the curing age and lime percent, unconfined compressive strength increases. Furthermore, the required lime content for satisfactorily stabilization of the high organic soft clay was found to be 7 %. Amer et al. [7] showed that with the addition of 6 % lime, both the swell percent and swell pressure reduced to zero. Rabbani et al. [15] evaluated the use of Grand Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) and lime in stabilizing desert silty sand for possible use in geotechnical engineering applications, especially for roadways and railways constructions. Results indicated that the swelling behavior of mixtures was decreased effectively. Thus mixture of GGBFS and lime can be suggested to improve engineering characteristic of desert silty sands. Ji-ru and Xing [11] investigated the individual and admixed effects of lime and fly ash on the geotechnical characteristics of expansive soil. The results of experiment showed that as the amount of lime and fly ash is increased, there is an apparent reduction in maximum dry density, free swell and swelling capacity under 50  kPa pressure, and a corresponding increase in the percentage of coarse particles, optimum moisture content and CBR value. Mohamedzein et al. [13] presented that the engineering properties of the desert sands can be improved significantly by the addition of incinerator ash. Saltan and Findik [19] used the pumice of the Isparta–Karakaya as stabilization material in the subbase layer and showed that pumice can be used as subbase material of highway and the stabilization material when building highway and every kind of road. Lin et al. [12] used sewage sludge ash (SSA) and hydrated lime to stabilize soft cohesive subgrade soil. To do this, five different ratios of sludge ash to hydrated lime including; 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 % by weight were added to the cohesive soil. The results indicated that the unconfined compressive strength of treated specimens increased from three to seven times. Also, it was observed that 95 % of CBR values of treated samples were close to high bearing capacity subgrade soil materials. Zhang et al. [20] presented that lignin has a great potential to improve engineering properties of silt and shows a promising prospect as a new environmentally friendly soil stabilizer. Curing time and lignin content have significant influence on the basic engineering properties and microstructural characteristics of the lignin stabilized silt. The optimum content of lignin for foundation silt in Jiangsu Province of China is approximately 12 %. Bagherian et al. [9] studied the effects of rice husk ash (RHA) on Atterberg limits, compaction characteristic, shear strength and bearing capacity of soils. They showed that by adding of 4 – 6 % of lime and various percentages of RHA to the soil, CBR values increases significantly. Baghdadi and Rahman [8] studied the effects of cement kiln dust (CKD) on geotechnical properties of dune sand. The results of tests showed that by addition of CKD, compressive strength and CBR values increases significantly. Chen and Lin [10] mixed incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) with cement in a ratio of 4 : 1 and added this mixture with a soft and cohesive subgrade soil in four different rates of 2, 4, 8 and 16 % They showed that unconfined compressive strength of specimens with the ISSA/cement addition improved approximately 3 – 7 times. In some samples, the ISSA/cement additive improved the CBR values by up to 30 times. Sewage sludge ash (SSA) is also a kind of synthetic pozzolanic materials which could be used successfully used for <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> [14]. In this research the effects of a natural pozzolan and lime were investigated for stabilization of a silty sand soil.|$|E

Although linking members of bacterial communities in soils with their function {{has proven to be}} still difficult through their phylogenetically diversity [34], not cultivability [35] and functional redundancy [36], some substantial soil functions could be dedicated to specific soil bacteria phyla. For instance, beta-Proteobacteria were linked to autotrophic ammonia oxidation (nitrification) [37], Actinobacteria to decomposition and humus formation [21], Acidobacteria to organic carbon transformation [20, 38, 39], alpha-Proteobacteria to CO 2 -fixation, carbon degradation and sulphur cycling [38], and Bacteroidetes to chitin degradation [38] in soils.|$|R
30|$|The high {{content of}} clay can possess shrink-swell {{properties}} brought {{by changes in}} moisture content. To conquer this negative aspect of the stabilization is to convert the soil to a rigid or granular mass by binding the soil particles sufficiently strong to resist the internal swelling pressure of the clay [25]. Alternatively, to reduce the shrink-swell potential, the movement of moisture within the clay soil must be reduced, which {{can be achieved by}} blocking the pores. There is no appropriate conventional method of stabilization to overcome the disruptive effects of moisture in clay. Studies concerning to fly ash and lime utilization for soil stabilization have been performed by the earlier investigators [5, 15, 17]. The plasticity characteristics and swell potential of clayey soil can decrease with the increase in fly ash contents. Addition of fly ash more than 20 % to clay soil are comparable with lime addition rates of 8 % in reducing the plasticity and swell potential of a soil consisting of 85 % kaolinite and 15 % bentonite [3]. Similarly the plasticity index, activity and swelling potential of the samples decreased with the % of fly ash increases. The changes in the physical and swelling properties of clay soil are a result of the following: formation of additional silt size particles due to chemical reactions that cause immediate flocculation of clay particles, time-dependent pozzolanic actions and self-hardening properties of fly ash [3]. The physical and chemical mechanisms of short and long term reactions involved in the lime <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> or soil-fly ash mixtures have been extensively described [2, 8]. The rate of decrease in swell potential has been noticed with the increased curing period of fly ash mixed clayey soils. After curing the fly ash mixed clay samples for 7  days, the swell potential noticed are 4.8 % and 3.7 % respectively for fly ash proportions of 15 and 20 %. Thirty days cured samples showed the swell potential nearly zero for both 15 and 20 % fly ash proportions. Also, it was interesting to see that the compression and recompression index of fly ash mixed clay soils have decreased with the increased curing period and fly ash proportion [18].|$|E

Ravines Azañero IreneLa presente tesis está orientada a mostrar técnicas distintas a las convencionales en el mejoramiento de la subrasante en vías de acceso, en zonas donde los suelos son blandos y de mala calidad, mediante el uso de geomallas multiaxiales para la estabilización de suelos. El presente documento muestra el diseño de subrasante con y sin geomalla multiaxial tomando como ámbito de aplicación un tramo de la calle Alemania – La molina - Cajamarca, cuyo suelo es del tipo limo arcilloso (CL), con valores de CBR de 2. 5 % y con presencia de agua. La utilización de geomallas multiaxiales en esta zona es {{inevitable}} para la estabilización de los suelos utilizando los parámetros de diseño necesarios como CBR, carga axial, presión de inflado de llantas, profundidad máxima de ahuellamientos y número de ejes pasantes; datos que luego fueron procesados con el software Spectra Pave 4. 0. Como resultado se obtuvo el incremento de la capacidad de soporte de la subrasante y la reducción del espesor de mejoramiento, comparado con un diseño patrón, registrando un ahorro de material de 54 % y 72 % con las geomallas multiaxiales tipo Tx 140 y Tx 160 respectivamente. ABSTRACT The present {{thesis is}} orientated to show technologies {{different from the}} conventional ones in {{the improvement of the}} sublow one in exit ramps, in zones where the soils are soft and of bad quality, by means of the use of multiaxial geogrids for the <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils.</b> The present document shows the design of sublow with and without multiaxial geogrid taking a section of the street as an area of application Germany - Three mills - Cajamarca, whose soil is of the type clayey slime (CL), with CBR's values of 2. 5 % and with water presence. The utilization of multiaxial geogrids in this zone is inevitable for the stabilization of the soils using the necessary design parameters like CBR, axial load, pressure of inflated of rims, maximum depth of ahuellamientos and number of axes assistants, information that then there was processed by the software Spectra Pave 4. 0. Since result obtained the increase of the capacity of support of the sublow one and the reduction of the thickness of improvement, comparing with a design boss, registering a saving material of 54 % and 72 % with the multiaxial geogrids type Tx 140 and Tx 160 respectively.

Over {{millions}} of years have undergone significant ch an g e s brought about by numerous geological phenomena aimed at your balance, some internal order, creating new geological formations and other external order smoothing formations previously created. From t h e tectonic standpoint, Angola {{is located in a}} relatively stable area which gives it a certain p ri v i l e g e w h e n compared with some Asian countries or even Americans where quite often occur earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. However, the same cannot be said in relation to the occurrence of an external geodynamics phenomena, such as the ravines, which in recent years has taken shape in many provinces, especially due to anthropogenic activity, giving rise to geological hazards, increasing the risk of damage in buildings and others infrastructures, losses direct or indirect in economic activities and loss of human lives. We understand that the reducing of these risks starts, in particular, by their identification, for later take preventive measures. This work is the result of some research work carried out by the authors through erosion courses of s o i l and <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> subject to erosion phenomena, carried out by Engineering Laboratory of Angola (LEA). For the realization of this work, we resorted to cartographic data query, literature, listening to s o m e o f the provincial representatives and local residents, as well as the observation in lo co o f s o m e af f e ct ed areas. The results allow us to infer that the main provinces affected by ravine phenomenon are located in Central and Northern highlands, {{as well as in the}} eastern region, and more recently in Cuando-Cub an go province. Not ruling out, however, other regions, such as in Luanda and Cabinda [1]. Relatively the causes, we can say that the ravines in Angola are primarily due to the combination of three natural factors: climate, topography and type of soil [2]. When we add the anthropogenic activit y, namely the execution of construction works, the drainage system obstructio n, exploration of m i n e ral s, agriculture and fires, it is verified an increasing of the phenomenon, often requiring immedi at e act i o n. These interventions can be done through structural or engineering measures and by the stabilization measures on the degraded soil cover [3]. We present an example of stabilization measures throu g h t h e deployment of a local vegetation called Pennisetum purpureum. It is expected that the results may contribute to a better understanding of the causes of the ravine phenomenon in Angola and that the adopted stabilization method can be adapted in other affected provinces in order to prevent and making the contention of the ravines...|$|E
30|$|Light {{fraction}} of SOM {{not only is}} sensitive to changes in management practices (Cambardella and Elliott 1992; Bremer et al. 1994) but also correlates well with the rate of nitrogen (N) mineralization (Hassink 1995; Barrios et al. 1996). The importance of LF (including free and occluded organic C within aggregates) is widely recognized for its role in formation and stability <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> structure, especially in <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> macroaggregates (> 250  mm) (Miller and Jastrow 1990; Kay 1998).

30|$|The {{fractionation}} of water-stable aggregates {{and density}} fractionation may thus {{be helpful for}} an improved understanding of carbon dynamics affected by soil management, since aggregate and density fractions are more sensitive to changes in soil management than total OC (Oades 1988; Pikul et al. 2007; Puget et al. 2000; Von Lützow et al. 2006). For example, Puget et al. (2000) concluded that water-stable macroaggregates were enriched in younger organic materials and have faster turnover times than microaggregates.
