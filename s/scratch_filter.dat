Successful restorations {{are dependent on}} efficiency of curing light unit, eg. the intensity of emitted light and its wave length. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficiency units of curing, in private dental offices in Tehran. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross sectional study, light curing devices in 240 private dental offices were evaluated randomly. Light intensity was measured by radiometer, debris on the fan and cracks and <b>scratches</b> on the <b>filter</b> were directly observed and the age of the device, frequency of changing the bulb and satisfaction of the dentist with regard to the light curing unit were recorded in a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Spearman and t test, with p&lt; 0. 05 as the level of significance. Results: The results showed that 53. 8 % of the units had intensities more than 300 mW/cm 2. The intensity of 30. 4 % of curing light units were between 20 and 300 mW/cm 2 and 15. 8 % had intensities lower than "n 200 mW/cm 2. There was a negative relation between light intensity and the age of the unit, frequency of bulb changing or <b>scratches</b> on the <b>filter</b> and debris on the fan. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the light intensities of about 46 % of light curing units used in private dental practices and clinics were inadequate. Since factors like aging of the curing light unit, frequent bulb changing, increasing the amount of debris on the fan and <b>scratches</b> on the <b>filter</b> reduce the light intensity, regular quality control of these devices is essential...|$|R
40|$|Old digital {{pictures}} or scanned images of old paper based images {{tend to have}} annoying scratches. This effects {{the overall quality of}} the image, both quantitively and visually. To remove these scratches and to generate a perfect noise and scratch free image, a novel method is presented in this paper. This approach not only detects scratches in an image but also removes them effectively. The method starts with a scratched digital version of an image then it removes noises after which region of <b>scratch</b> are identified. <b>Filtering</b> is an important step in this proposed method. Here filtering is a two level process after which a specific superimposing method is been applied to reconstruct the scratch and noise free image...|$|R
40|$|Cluster {{analysis}} over Moving Object Databases (MODs) is {{a challenging}} research topic that has {{attracted the attention}} of the mobility data mining community. In this paper, we study the temporal-constrained sub-trajectory cluster analysis problem, where the aim is to discover clusters of sub-trajectories given an ad-hoc, user-specified temporal constraint within the dataset's lifetime. The problem is challenging because: (a) the time window is not known in advance, instead it is specified at query time, and (b) the MOD is continuously updated with new trajectories. Existing solutions first filter the trajectory database according to the temporal constraint, and then apply a clustering algorithm from <b>scratch</b> on the <b>filtered</b> data. However, this approach is extremely inefficient, when considering explorative data analysis where multiple clustering tasks need to be performed over different temporal subsets of the database, while the database is updated with new trajectories. To address this problem, we propose an incremental and scalable solution to the problem, which is built upon a novel indexing structure, called Representative Trajectory Tree (ReTraTree). ReTraTree acts as an effective spatio-temporal partitioning technique; partitions in ReTraTree correspond to groupings of sub-trajectories, which are incrementally maintained and assigned to representative (sub-) trajectories. Due to the proposed organization of sub-trajectories, the problem under study can be efficiently solved as simply as executing a query operator on ReTraTree, while insertion of new trajectories is supported. Our extensive experimental study performed on real and synthetic datasets shows that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art in-DBMS solution supported by PostgreSQL by orders of magnitude...|$|R
