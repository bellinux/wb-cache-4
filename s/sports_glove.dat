Therefore, the unique design of this glove strives to restrict abnormal motion of the fingers, while maintaining functional, physiological movement of the athlete’s hand during sports activity...|$|E

Thirteen female participants between the ages of 40 - 65 years with hand size medium (M) performed a relaxed hand posture and two dynamic postures which were relevant to key sport activities. There were significant differences in the skin relaxed-strain ratio between the experimental postures, especially in phalangeal and metacarpal regions with exception in (third finger-metacarpal region). The {{results of this study suggest}} that the metacarpal region had significantly larger skin relaxed-strain ratio than the phalangeal region and metacarpal-carpal region.

50|$|Lacrosse gloves {{are heavily}} padded, {{protective}} gloves worn by men's lacrosse players.

A goaltender's gloves may have extra padding for the thumb to protect against injury from shots.
