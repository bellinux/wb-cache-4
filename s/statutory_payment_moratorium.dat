2500|$|The Wells and Chapman {{families}} received £11,000 {{in compensation}} {{for the deaths of}} their daughters. This was a <b>statutory</b> <b>payment</b> administered by a non-departmental public body, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. The compensation tariffs are set by the UK Parliament and administered by the Civil Service. The compensation was widely criticised in the media; the director of the Victims of Crime Trust, Clive Elliott, described it as a [...] "pittance". The media highlighted the much higher payouts that could be paid to victims of other crimes, as well as payouts which have been made in civil law, and that the maximum possible payout anyone could have received under the scheme at the time was £500,000.|$|R
5000|$|Following on {{from the}} {{innovations}} of the LOF 1980, the 1989 International Salvage Convention permitted salvage rewards {{to be made to}} salvors who acted to limit damage to the coastal environment after oil spills. Articles 13 & 14 of the Convention made provision for [...] "Special Compensation", but the UK House of Lords case of the Nagasaki Spirit [...] revealed that the Convention had been poorly drafted, thereby limiting the amount that environmental salvors could be paid to mere [...] "out-of-pocket expenses", with no allowance for any profit margin. As an antidote to this, the marine insurance industry and P&I Clubs jointly developed the [...] "SCOPIC clause", which is a codicil that may be appended to an LOF and invoked should the <b>statutory</b> <b>payment</b> provisions prove inadequate. The first SCOPIC clause was in 2000, and there have been several iterations since.|$|R

5000|$|Dealing {{with the}} {{pressing}} matter of war reparations {{had been a}} priority for the Cuno government from the day it took office, as it had earlier been for the Wirth government. The new government continued to follow the policies of its predecessor on this issue. The goal was to convince the Allies to accept an extended <b>payment</b> <b>moratorium</b> {{for three to four}} years that would allow the Germans to stabilize their economy and currency first before resuming transfers. However, the French had budget problems of their own and refused to compromise on this, holding the German side to earlier agreements. The French government of prime minister/foreign minister Raymond Poincaré was convinced that Germany (and its industry) was unwilling rather than unable to make the reparations. A debt moratorium was considered possible only if France would be able to obtain [...] "productive collateral" [...] (such as direct Allied control over the coal mines of the Ruhr). On 26 December 1923, the reparations commission formally found that Germany had culpably failed to comply with its obligations concerning the delivery of wood, against the vote of the British commissioner. Similarly, it found on 9 January 1923 that the 1922 deliveries of coal to France had been deficient. Two days later French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr.|$|R

40|$|In 2006, Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s Court of Appeal had {{to decide}} whether it was lawful for an {{employer}} to deliberately adopt a strategy {{to avoid having to}} make a <b>statutory</b> <b>payment</b> to an employee. The employer 2 ̆ 7 s liability to make that payment was contingent on the employee completing a prescribed period of continuous service. The employer engaged the employee under successive, non-continuous contracts of employment, each for a shorter duration than the prescribed period to prevent his liability for the payment from crystallising. The Court of Appeal held that there was nothing unlawful in an employer arranging his affairs so as to prevent his liability for the payment from even arising. This article analyses the case concerned and expounds how the foregoing decision could see employers avoiding a whole range of employee rights and benefits under the Employment Ordinance. The article views such conduct as negating the legislative intention and as being contrary to the norms of justice. To rectify the situation as it currently stands, we propose an amendment to the Employment Ordinance to prohibit such avoidance...|$|R
40|$|Wage {{supplements}} in {{the form}} of private fringe benefits and statutory contributions to social welfare account for around 25 per cent of the typical firm's total labour costs throughout OECD countries. Yet the relative emphasis on private and <b>statutory</b> <b>payments</b> differs from country to country. For example, the ratio of statutory contributions to private fringes (excluding holiday payments) was 5 0 in the FRG compared to 0. 9 in the USA in 1981. This paper critically assesses the economic arguments for and against both forms of non-wage payment. On the private side, the discussion concentrates on human capital anti union median voter explanations for private fringe payments. Attention is also given to the implications of favourable corporate and individual tax concessions with respect both to the demand for private fringes and to the evaluation of their human capital effects. On the statutory side, social security contributions are discussed in relation to general social welfare, government employment policy and employer-union relations. As part of the general assessment, it is argued that governments should provide a Fiscal framework in this area which is designed to stimulate more effective individual and firm-level choice between equivalent forms of private and statutory supplementary compensation...|$|R
30|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons why youth {{unemployment}} rates may be higher than adult rates. In the internal labour market, youths will generally have less specific human capital relevant to the particular firm for whom they work and also less general work skills. Even without a formal last-in first-out (LIFO) policy, firms may take the view that the future benefit of further investment in young workers is outweighed by its current costs. Further, liquidity concerns cause firms to seek layoffs among younger workers first, particularly where <b>statutory</b> redundancy <b>payments</b> are seniority weighted, {{as is the case in}} most countries.|$|R

40|$|I {{deal with}} tax system of Czech Republic. Tax {{problems}} are very wide and complicated theme. I {{focus only on}} basic structure of the tax system. At first I describe theoretical and then practical aspects of the tax system. I describe types of taxes, calculation of taxes, accounting records and changes in recent years. Knowledge is applied to a specific accounting entity. This accounting entity is self-employed in part mediation of trade and services. The tax is compulsory, irretrievable, non-equivalent and non-specific, <b>statutory</b> <b>payment</b> which accrues to the state budget. It must be defined by law. Majority of the people will pay {{as little as possible}} on taxes and it is rational economic behaviour of taxpayer. The tax system of The Czech Republic consists of direct taxes (income and property taxes), indirect taxes (selective, consumer and universal taxes) and other taxes (social insurance premiums, local taxes). In the practical part I analyze the basic problems such as record in the accounting system, income tax of natural persons (options for calculating), tax deductible expenses (composition and major share), flat tax (calculation and comparison with other kind of taxes), health and social insurance (paid advances in the year 2009 and calculations of advances for the year 2010), road tax (calculations of advances in the year 2009), limit for value added tax etc. Structure of the tax system in case of Mr. Benes is not so complicated. I would like to demonstrate the basic problems which them each businessman can come into contact. This problems concern most of self-employed and I would like to arrive at a recommendation what to pay attention...|$|R

5000|$|In Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali 2002 1 AC 251 an {{employee}} made redundant by BCCI, claimed the usual <b>statutory</b> <b>payments</b> and, {{under the aegis}} of ACAS, signed an agreement to accept a sum [...] "in full and final settlement of all or any claims� of whatsoever nature that exist or may exist against BCCI." [...] The House of Lords held that this exclusion clause did not prevent employees from reopening their agreements when, following BCCI's collapse, it became clear that {{a significant part of the}} bank's business had been run dishonestly and the employees found that they were stigmatised for having worked there. When the parties signed the release, they could not have realistically supposed that a claim for damages in respect of disadvantage and stigma was a possibility. Accordingly, they claimed they could not have intended the release to apply to such a claim. But in earlier proceedings on the question of damages, the formidable practical obstacles presented by the limiting principles of causation, remoteness, and the duty of the claimant to mitigate any losses proved insurmountable. In 1999 Lightman J. tried five representative cases out of the 369 which had been initiated by former BCCI employees. None of them succeeded in proving that their unemployment was attributable to stigma. Indeed, subject to the anti-discrimination laws, a prospective employer is under no particular duty to employ anyone who attends for interview. Four of the cases tried by Lightman J. appear to have concerned employees who were dismissed by the liquidators when the bank collapsed in 1991. Those made redundant in 1990 faced the additional hurdle of having to explain why their unemployment was attributable to stigma when they were unable to find jobs for a year before any stigma attached to them.|$|R
40|$|This study {{described}} the demographic and medical {{characteristics of a}} population of patients with HIV/AIDS attending the department of Genito-Urinary Medicine (GUM) at a major Dublin hospital. The study population&# 39;s utilisation of statutory and voluntary medical and social services at primary care level, satisfaction with services received and perceived need for services examined. The information obtained was used to make recommendations concerning the provision of care to patients with HIV/AIDS. The study was carried out between February and November 1994. Data was collected from a consecutive sample of eighty inpatients using n interviewer-administered questionnaire which contained both closed and open questions. The first forty patients interviewed were reviewed six months following the initial interview to document changes in physical condition and uptake of medical services over that time period. Data for {{the second part of}} the study was obtained by review of the patients&# 39; medical case notes and interview with the individual hospital medical social worker assigned to each patient. Over ninety percent of respondents were from the Greater Dublin Area. Almost three quarters were intravenous drug users (IVDUs), and the majority of these patients came from south inner city Dublin. The methodology was biased towards sampling patients with advanced disease and 73 % had CDC Stage 4 disease. Twenty percent required some assistance with the activities of daily living when first interviewed. Most were reliant on informal carers. Social and physical dependency increased substantially over the six month period of the follow-up study of forty patients. Financial difficulties were identified as a particular area of need. Only ten percent of those interviewed were in current employment and over 80 % were dependent on <b>statutory</b> <b>payments.</b> There is a need for greater co-ordination between the providers of services to patients HIV/AIDS and an improved system of data collection regarding patients&# 39; uptake of services and unmet needs is required to assist in future service planning.

50|$|The Minimum Wages Act 1948 is an Act of Parliament {{concerning}} Indian {{labour law}} {{that sets the}} minimum wages that must be paid to skilled and unskilled labours. The Indian Constitution has defined a 'living wage' that {{is the level of}} income for a worker which will ensure a basic standard of living including good health, dignity, comfort, education and provide for any contingency. However, to keep in mind an industry's capacity to pay the constitution has defined a 'fair wage'. Fair wage is that level of wage that not just maintains a level of employment, but seeks to increase it keeping in perspective the industry’s capacity to pay. To achieve this in its first session during November 1948, the Central Advisory Council appointed a Tripartite Committee of Fair Wage. This committee came up with the concept of Minimum Wages. A minimum wage is such a wage that it not only guarantees bare subsistence and preserves efficiency but also provides for education, medical requirements and some level of comfort. India introduced the Minimum Wages Act in 1948, giving both the Central government and State government jurisdiction in fixing wages. The act is legally non-binding, but <b>statutory.</b> <b>Payment</b> of wages below the minimum wage rate amounts to forced labour. Wage Boards are set up to review the industry’s capacity to pay and fix minimum wages such that they at least cover a family of four’s requirements of calories, shelter, clothing, education, medical assistance, and entertainment. Under the law, wage rates in scheduled employments differ across states, sectors, skills, regions and occupations owing to difference in costs of living, regional industries' capacity to pay, consumption patterns, etc. Hence, there is no single uniform minimum wage rate across the country and the structure has become overly complex. The highest minimum wage rate as updated in 2012 is Rs. 322/day in Andaman and Nicobar to Rs. 38/day in Tripura.|$|R

40|$|Employment Protection {{rules have}} two {{separate}} dimensions: a transfer {{from the firm}} to the worker to be laid off and a tax paid outside the firm-worker pair. It is well established that with full wage flexibility <b>statutory</b> severance <b>payments</b> (pure transfers) between employers and dismissed employees are neutral (Lazear 1988, 1990). Most of the existing literature makes the implicit assumption that, {{in the presence of}} wage rigidity, such mandatory transfers have the same real effects as firing taxes. This paper shows, {{in the context of a}} search model, that this presumption is in general misplaced. It is only correct in the case of extreme wage rigidity, whereas when some (but not full) flexibility in the wage setting at the level of an individual employer-worker match is allowed, the impact of severance payments on unemployment duration and incidence is qualitatively different from that of firing taxes (and its sign depends on the nature of the wage rigidity) ...|$|R

2500|$|Because {{the federal}} {{government}} is legally obligated to provide Medicare benefits to older and disabled Americans, it cannot cut costs by restricting eligibility or benefits, except by going through a difficult legislative process, or by revising its interpretation of medical necessity. By statute, Medicare may only pay for items and services that are [...] "reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member", unless there is another <b>statutory</b> authorization for <b>payment.</b> Cutting costs by cutting benefits is difficult, but the program can also achieve substantial economies of scale in terms of the prices it pays for health care and administrative expenses—and, as a result, private insurers’ costs have grown almost 60% more than Medicare’s since 1970. Medicare’s cost growth is now the same as GDP growth and expected to stay well below private insurance’s for the next decade.|$|R
5000|$|Notable {{among the}} Senate {{modifications}} of the Neutrality Treaty were two amendments incorporating the October 1977 Statement of Understanding, and interpreting the [...] "expeditious" [...] transit of United States and Panamanian warships {{in times of}} war as being preferential. Another modification, commonly known as the DeConcini Condition, stated that [...] "if the Canal is closed, or its operations are interfered with United States and Panama shall each have the right to take such steps as each deems necessary, ... including {{the use of military force}} in the Republic of Panama, to reopen the Canal or restore the operations of the Canal". Modifications of the Panama Canal Treaty included a reservation requiring <b>statutory</b> authorization for <b>payments</b> to Panama set forth in Article XIII and another stating that any action taken by the United States to secure accessibility to the Canal [...] "shall not have as its purpose or be interpreted as a right of intervention in the internal affairs of the Republic of Panama or interference with its political independence or sovereign integrity". Reservations attached to both treaties made the United States provision of economic and military assistance, as detailed in the ancillary agreements attached to the treaties, nonobligatory.|$|R
40|$|Some {{developed}} countries have drawn lip construction-specific <b>statutory</b> security of <b>payment</b> acts/legislations typically known as Construction Contracts Act to eliminate poor payment practices and to assist continuous uninterrupted construction works. Malaysia too cannot {{pretend not to}} have these problems. This paper presents findings of a study conducted amongst Malaysian contractors with the aims to determine the seriousness of late and non- payment problems; to identify the main causes and effects of late and non-payment; and to identify ways to sustain the payment flows in the Malaysian construction industry. The study focused on contractual payments from the paymaster (government or private) to the contractors. The main factors for late and nonpayment {{in the construction industry}} identified from the study include: delay in certification, paymaster's poor financial management, local culture/attitude, pay master's failure to implement good governance in business, underpayment of certified amounts by the pay master and the use of 'pay when paid' clauses in contracts. The research findings show that late and non-payment can create cash flow problems, stress and financial hardship on the contractors. Amongst the most appropriate solutions to overcome the problem of late and non-payment faced by local contractors include: a right to regular periodic payment, a right to a defined time frame (or payment and a right to a speedy dispute resolution mechanism. Promptness of submitting, processing, issuing interim payment certificates and honouring the certificates are extremely important issues in relation to progress payment claims. Perhaps, an increased sense of professionalism in construction industry could overcome some of the problems related to late and non- payment issues...|$|R
