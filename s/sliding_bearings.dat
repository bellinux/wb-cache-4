40|$|<b>Sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> are an {{important}} part of many large and critical components. They are widely used in power equipment, high-capacity pumps, compressors, electric motors and internal combustion engines (ICE).

40|$|Case StudySilicon carbide (SiC) {{is known}} for its {{superior}} abrasion resistance, and is widely used in pumps as a material for water-lubricated <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings.</b> Ultra pure water (UPW), with a specific resistance of greater than 10 M?/cm, is often used for purposes such as washing water in semiconductor manufacturing processes and recirculation water in nuclear power generation plants. However, in cases where SiC <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> are lubricated with ultra pure water, abnormal wear is occasionally found. Such a problem is not seen with normal water lubrication. The abnormal wear when lubricated with UPW is caused by oxidation of the SiC surface and generation of silicon dioxide.

The author tries to improve the availability of thermoplastic massive <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> with radial realization under different operation conditions. Experiments with initial lubrication and start-stop operation are described. The wear behavior of thermoplastic massive <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> is determined with run-up and run-out experiments. The experiments concerning to the <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> are realized on special test stands. This considers the fact that proceedings in thermoplastic <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are a part of}} complex tribologic systems. Short-time experiments provide sufficiently exact statements according to specific wear rates. If the thermoplastic sliding bearing works at its maximum load, the chemical degradation of the plastics and a reduction of the durability of the storage material may be observed. An initial lubrication with fat decreases the medium-coefficient of friction, the specific shear rate and storage temperatures. Non lubricated HT thermoplastic sleeve bearings can be used successfully at start-stop operations. In comparison to endurance tests with non lubricated HT thermoplastic sleeve bearings, little medium coefficients of friction and little specific wear rates are established in start-stop operation. Endurance tests with non lubricated sheathed bearings provide little medium coefficients of friction in comparison to non lubricated sleeve bearings. The specific wear rate is higher {{as in the case of}} sleeve bearings. The basic estimations with respect to the endurance tests with non lubricated sleeve bearings are transferable to the start-stop experiments. 114 figs., 37 tabs., 152 refs.
