40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to discover the}} factors, both historic and sociological, for the reorganization of the Polyvalente Restigouche Senior High School Complex of Campbellton, New Brunswick from a single bilingual high school into two unilingual high schools. This history traces {{the development of a}} territory by two language groups whose wishes were to educate their children in their own languages, preserving their cultures and religions. Each developed an educational system, but the services and facilities offered by the two groups were not equal. [...] In the nineteen sixties, the government, in an effort to equalize services, changed the educational financing system and constructed many new schools, one of which was the Polyvalente Restigouche Senior High Complex on which this study is based. This school housed both language groups as a bilingual school. It remained as such for only three years, after which it was divided on language lines into two unilingual schools. During the three years, the Francophone community became more ethnocentric and with the threat of loss of their language organized to obtain a unilingual French high school. This they were able to accomplish through group <b>solidarity</b> and <b>political</b> <b>action.</b> A comparison is made between this and a similar occurrence in Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, studied by Danielle Jutneau Lee and Jean Lapointe. [...] This study is important, as with total immersion classes in French for English students, there will be a new need for bilingual high schools in the future...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} {{processes by which}} Central American women and men face unprecedented forms of violence and exploitation as they migrate through Mexico. Central Americans are regularly subject to abuse, extortion, rape, kidnapping, dismemberment and death as multiple actors profit off of their bodies, labor and lives. In turn, {{the political economy of}} violence and security along the migrant journey permeates into local Mexican communities, creating new tensions and social ruptures. Going beyond a simple accounting of abuse, I engage ethnography as a lens through which to understand the social effects of historical and contemporary processes of war, displacement, economic restructuring and social dislocation as people move through local spaces. Throughout the journey, the logics of migration and violence rework social relations based on race, gender and nationality where migrants are both victims of and agents within the often de-humanizing processes of human mobility. I use a lens of gender in particular to understand the ways larger processes impact the intimate spaces of people's lives and the intimate labors they perform as parents, migrants, partners, laborers and activists. I also examine the ways violence is not simply destructive, but also generates new possibilities for <b>solidarity</b> and <b>political</b> <b>action</b> through social movements around humanitarianism and migrant rights. In particular, I examine the emergence of a movement of Catholic-based migrant shelters and a transnational feminist movement of mothers and families of disappeared migrants...|$|R

40|$|Since de-collectivization and {{economic}} liberalisation {{in the early}} 1980 s, people from villages and small towns have been flowing into cities in China. The rural-urban migration has arisen along with the great socio-economic restructuring in contemporary China. Excluded by the state’s household registration system and capitalist market, rural migrants are often seen as the symptom of China’s pathological transformation. However, based on an ethnography of rural migrants in Shanghai, my dissertation suggests that these migrants understand the great socio-economic transformation {{as an opportunity for}} entrepreneurship. My dissertation argues that rural migrants’ entrepreneurial aspirations should not be understood as the power effects of neoliberalism on subject-making; rather they are related to their understanding of the emerging society and their position within it with reference to the money economy. My dissertation presents an analysis of rural migrants’ own understandings of the great socio-economic transformations that have taken place in contemporary China. With labour migration and the expanding money economy, an ambivalent “society” emerges from family, community and state. The economy [...] -the operation of the market, the circulation of money, the organization of labour [...] -overlaps with family and state, and destabilizes the moral unity and power hierarchy of them respectively. My ethnographic analysis demonstrates that money mediates my informants’ understandings of the emerging society. Money here is not the specific medium of the economic sphere but enables the emergent society to develop its own contingency. The emergent society promises inclusion through entrepreneurship but also involves dangerous frauds. The relationship between the economy and society should not be understood in terms of moral embeddedness and the control of power but in terms of contingency. The person is included in the emergent society not through moral <b>solidarity</b> and <b>political</b> <b>action</b> but through entrepreneurial aspiration. Entrepreneurial aspirations are not personal dreams, nor the specific cultural practices of particular groups, but a structural feature of the great transformation of society in contemporary China...|$|R

Scholz notes that effective <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> can only occur through a [...] "genuine mutually shared commitment to a cause."

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} three independent {{lines of}} investigation {{on the social}} psychology of <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. Rather than developing a grand theory, I focus on adapting current perspectives in the social psychology of emotion, automaticity, goals and mental simulation {{to the study of}} <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. The approach taken is eclectic both theoretically and methodologically. In Chapter 1, I review the social psychology of <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. In doing so, I conceptualise <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change and explore current explanations of these phenomena. I also introduce moral emotions, automaticity and imagination in order to mark the way for the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 2, I examine the role of the moral emotions in <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. Specifically, I explore the antecedents and consequences of anger, sympathy, and admiration. Drawing on theories of intergroup relations and emotion, I show that legitimate status, competence, and warmth all elicit admiration. Notably, admiration towards the authorities and centres of group power inhibits <b>political</b> <b>action</b> aimed at challenging the social order. However, when the target of admiration is a subversive hero or “martyr”, admiration uniquely predict willingness to challenge the status quo. In Chapter 3 I investigate the role of automaticity in <b>political</b> <b>action.</b> More specifically, I develop a dual process account of <b>political</b> <b>action.</b> I demonstrate that controlled (vs. automatic) processes lead to an increase in <b>political</b> <b>action</b> tendencies in members of a disadvantaged group. Notably, automatic protest attitudes influence <b>political</b> <b>action</b> through anger. That is, the more positive one’s automatic protest attitudes are the more anger they feel in relation to group grievances. Notably, automatic attitudes are more likely to predict <b>political</b> <b>action</b> when one is low in the motivation and ability to deliberate on political issues. In Chapter 4 I examine the role of imagination in <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. I demonstrate that being able to imagine a particular social change goal (e. g., revolution or reform) uniquely predict <b>political</b> <b>action</b> tendencies aimed at that goal. Notably, imagination also qualifies the influence of efficacy and anger on politic action tendencies. Put simply, anger only predicts <b>political</b> <b>action</b> for collective mobility when group members can imagine this social change goal. In addition, efficacy only predicts action aimed at revolution when one can imagine an alternative social system (e. g., economy). In Chapter 5 I draw some conclusions, and discuss the limitations and issues that arise from the work presented here. Finally, I propose some avenues for future research. In iii addition, I put forward a typology of social change in the hope that it will engender future work on the social psychology of <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change...|$|R

40|$|This chapter’s title {{would appear}} to provide an inauspicious frame for a {{discussion}} of the relationship between gay and lesbian writing and postmodernism. On the one hand, it projects a linear history which imagines sexual minorities advancing from marginalization and oppression and towards mainstream recognition and success. On the other, it seems to go nowhere at all, suggesting that gay and lesbian culture is coterminous with New York City. The account that follows then promises to be one that denies difference and ignores discontinuity – not exactly moves ordinarily associated with postmodern narrative and politics. But while the Stonewall riots of 1969 have commonly been understood as a historical watershed, indeed, the moment at which sexual minorities in the West began to take control of their own history, they are also frequently invoked precisely to express concerns about the way other configurations of same-sex intimacy – in particular, those of earlier times and of places outside of the American metropolis – have been occulted by this master narrative. And then Tony Kushner’s celebrated epic play Angels in America (1990, 1992) is not meant to mark some terminal point at which gay cultural production has become part of the establishment firmament or has developed fully fledged postmodern credentials. Rather, the play typifies the way gay and lesbian writing from this period elaborates multiple histories, competing ideological paradigms and interactions across non-contiguous spaces, even while remaining committed to a clear sense of futurity and a politics rooted in a specific community. Indeed, the similarities between the gay liberation movement, which arose immediately after the Stonewall riots, and Angels – both for instance articulate the situated knowledge of sexual dissidents, while simultaneously offering up millenarian visions to the world – indicate how this chapter is little concerned to chart the progress of a putatively postmodern mode of gay and lesbian writing. Instead, it examines a range of material by British and American authors in order to highlight the close affinities yet frequently ambivalent involvement between gay and lesbian culture and postmodernism. Most of the works discussed below – novels, biography, poetry, as well as Kushner’s play – revel in the pleasures of postmodern textual manoeuvres, and recognize their utility: their potential for subversion, and their capacity to foreground contingency, diversity and dissonance. These impulses sometimes coincide with, but often run counter to, other needs – to account for embodiment, in particular the embodiment of sexual desire, and to claim a cultural inheritance and articulate a coherent collective identity which might provide the basis for <b>solidarity</b> and <b>political</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R
