Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> look good.

To do so they formed the Aerojet Engineering Corporation in March 1942, in which Parsons, Forman, Malina, von Kármán, and Summerfield each {{invested}} $250, opening their offices on Colorado Boulevard and bringing in Amo Smith as their engineer. Andrew G. Haley was recruited by von Kármán as their lawyer and treasurer. Although Aerojet was a for-profit operation that provided technology for military means, the founders' mentality was rooted in the ideal of using rockets for peaceful space exploration. As Haley recounted von Kármán requesting: [...] "we will make the rockets—you must make the corporation and obtain the money.

[...] Brunner says poll workers have sometimes cast ballots on machines in their homes. [...] She issued the following directive on the matter: [...] "We want Ohio’s voters {{and the rest of the}} nation to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment, ballots and supplies.

2500|$|This {{algorithm}} {{looks at}} things differently {{by using a}} result from graph theory which helps improve on the LB of the TSP which originated from doubling {{the cost of the}} minimum spanning tree.

By triangular inequality we know that the TSP tour can be no longer than the Eulerian tour and as such we have a LB for the TSP. Such a method is described below.|$|E
2500|$|The Republican {{senators}} Lindsey Graham and Jon Kyl {{have been}} criticized for their amicus curiae brief filed in the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006) case, in which they argued that the Detainee Treatment Act's passage sufficed to deny the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the case. Language in the Congressional Record, which is cited in the majority opinion, was inserted by Graham and Kyl into the Record for the day on which the amendment passed after the legislation had already been enacted. The language in question was worded in such a manner as to imply it had been recorded in live debate. The revised Record contains such phrasing as Kyl's [...] "Mr. President, I <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are nearing the end of our allotted time" [...] and Sen. Sam Brownback's [...] "If I might interrupt". Brownback has not responded to press inquiries. Justice Scalia's dissent noted this incident as an example on which he has based his longstanding hostility to the use of legislative history in court decisions.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace {{had been}} working for Darwin, sending {{domestic}} fowl specimens from Indonesia, and a letter he had written in October reached Darwin at the spa. On 1 May Darwin replied, agreeing with Wallace's 1855 paper [...] "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species": [...] "I can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have thought much alike & to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions. ... This summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first-note-book, on the question how & in what way do species & varieties differ from each other.— I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that though I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years." [...] He agreed with Wallace that [...] "climatal conditions" [...] had little effect, and wrote [...] "It is really impossible to explain my views in the compass of a letter on the causes & means of variation in a state of nature; but I have slowly adopted a distinct & tangible idea.— Whether true or false others must judge".|$|E
2500|$|Maiorescu himself {{suggested}} that Pogor's Bucklean discovery facilitated Junimisms transformation into a socio-political movement. Other such influences came from Schopenhauer, and from John Stuart Mill's Subjection of Women. Buckle influenced the main Junimist historical narratives, from Maiorescu's historical lectures to A. D. Xenopol's own History of Civilizations. Pogor's own belief, namely that Romania was essentially peripheral to European civilization, was not readily welcomed {{by the national}} conservative faction at Junimea. A glimpse of this is provided by a maverick Junimist, George Panu, as a purported clash between Pogor and the autochthonist Eminescu. According to Panu, Pogor openly ridiculed national historians: [...] "What's all this {{about the history of}} the Romanians? Can't you <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have no history? A people which has no literature, art, or past civilization—such a people is not worth the attention of historians... At a time when France could produce Molière and Racine the Romanians were in a state of utter barbarism." [...] Eminescu retorted, promptly and (Panu notes) violently: [...] "What you call barbarism, I call the settled wisdom of a people that develops in conformity with its own genius and shuns any mixing with foreigners" [...] (alternatively translated as: [...] "the wisdom of a nation, which progresses according to the rhythm of its own genius, away from any foreign interference").|$|E
2500|$|There is no human-rights {{organization}} or anti-corruption group in Equatorial Guinea. The human-rights group EG Justice, {{which focuses on}} such issues in the country, is based abroad. Its executive director, Tutu Alicante, has lived in U.S. exile since age 19 and describes his country has having two realities. [...] "It has the highest GDP per capita but also the widest {{gap between rich and}} poor people." [...] Despite being [...] "on paper the richest country on the continent on a per capita basis, on a par with many European nations," [...] he told The Guardian in 2014, Equatorial Guinea has [...] "one of the highest income and standard of living disparities....The income per capita is one which should allow people to have the same access to healthcare etc. as most European nations. Then you look at the rates of access to water, access to adequate healthcare, access to education, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and you <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are basically where the DRC is, where Haiti is. The gap between the income and the access to basic needs and rights is astronomical." [...] The reason for the absence of human-rights or anti-corruption groups, he has explained, is that the country is small, and any institution, such as a church, [...] "that the government perceives as sufficiently powerful is immediately co-opted" [...] or [...] "completely undermined." [...] Also, there are no labor unions, and any meeting of over five people requires a government permit.|$|E
