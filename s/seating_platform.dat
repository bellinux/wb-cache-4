500|$|The {{upper floor}} rooms display more artistic and {{precious}} objects. In {{the main hall}} are two architectural models of the Grand Palace, the first representing the Grand Palace {{during the reign of}} King Rama I, and another in the reign of King Rama V. Behind these are numerous Buddha images and commemorative coins. In the doorway leading to the main hall is a small mother-of-pearl <b>seating</b> <b>platform</b> known as Phra Thaen Song Sabai (พระแท่นทรงสบาย), which was once located in the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall. The platform was used for informal audiences and dates from the time of King Rama I. [...] At the end of the main hall stands the Phra Thaen Manangsila Throne (พระแท่นมนังคศิลาอาสน์; [...] ), which is believed to date to the Sukhothai Kingdom and was brought back to Bangkok, from Sukhothai, by King Rama IV, when he was still a monk. Against the walls {{on either side of the}} hall are four different Buddha images of Javanese style; they were purchased by King Rama V. The room to the right of the Manangsila Throne displays the various seasonal robes of the Emerald Buddha. To the left of the main hall is an lacquer ware screen depicting the crowning of Shiva, king of the gods. The screen was formerly kept in the Phra Thinang Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat; it was saved from the fire apparently by the hands of King Rama I himself. The rest of the upper floor displays various objets d′art (such as a model of Mount Kailasa) and more Buddha images.|$|E
5000|$|The Textile Field/Gill Stadium {{grandstand}} {{was designed}} by Amoskeag engineers and constructed of brick, in the style and color of the mills in Amoskeag's millyard. For safety, concrete ramps were constructed along the sides and rear of the grandstand and steel trusses and posts to support the roof. Although portions of the roof, floor, {{and some of the}} posts supporting the <b>seating</b> <b>platform</b> were of wood, publications from the period of construction--including the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company's employee newspaper, the Amoskeag Bulletin--considered it a [...] "fireproof" [...] concrete-and-steel grandstand like those being constructed in major-league cities between 1909 and 1915.

40|$|A {{device for}} {{enabling}} a wheelchair user {{to enter and}} exit the wheelchair includes a stabilizing frame. The stabilizing frame has two slide rails to which a base plate is movingly attached. An electric motor drives a leadscrew, causing the base plate to move along the slide rails. A telescopic column is vertically mounted onto the base plate. The seat assembly, including handlebars and a <b>seat</b> <b>platform,</b> is rotationally attached {{to the top of}} the telescopic column. The telescopic column is extended and collapsed by a linear actuator, raising and lowering the seat assembly. A stationary non-rotational rod is vertically mounted onto the telescopic column. When a user sitting on the <b>seat</b> <b>platform</b> exerts a moment force on the stationary rod, the seat assembly rotates about the stationary rod.

50|$|For {{the first}} four years of the show's life, the Kelly show was made from a very small general purpose studio at UTV's (known until 1993 as Ulster Television) {{headquarters}} in Havelock House, Belfast. The studio could only fit a very small set and a very small audience. To accommodate the audience, the audience <b>seating</b> <b>platform</b> was built over the scenery doors to the studio, meaning some members of the audience would be sitting very close to the doors and close to the hot studio lights in those early years. In 1993 Ulster Television was relaunched as UTV and unveiled a new 2,500 Sq Ft studio which could now accommodate a proper studio audience of around 100-120 with a new built in audience <b>seating</b> <b>platform,</b> which was ideal for the show.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesDue to its hardness, {{zirconia}} abutments may {{damage the}} titanium of the implant's connection during its clinical use. This study aimed {{to assess the}} wear of the <b>seating</b> <b>platforms</b> of externally hexed titanium implants when connected to zirconia abutments comparing to titanium abutments, after thermocycling and mechanical loading (TCML). MethodsSix BNT® S 4 external connection implants (Phibo® Dental Solutions, Barcelona, Spain) were selected and {{divided into two groups}} (n= 3) : TiCE, screwed to titanium abutments and ZrCE, screwed to zirconia abutments. The samples underwent thermocycling (5000 cycles; 5 – 55 °C) and mechanical loading (1. 2 × 106 cycles; 88. 8 N; 4 Hz). Before and after TCML, the <b>seating</b> <b>platforms</b> of the implants were analyzed by 3 D profilometry in two areas to measure their topography based on the superficial analysis parameters (Sa and Sz) parameters, and were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data were statistically analyzed by Mann–Whitney test (p 0. 05 and p= 0. 059). The abutment's material (titanium/zirconia) did not statistically significantly influence the Sa and Sz values after TCML (p= 0. 886 > 0. 05 and p= 0. 200, respectively). However, the SEM analysis reveals a mild wear in some vertices of the hex when connected to zirconia abutments. ConclusionsAfter simulating five years of clinical use, the externally hexed implants, analyzed by 3 D profilometry, showed similar wear patterns in the corresponding <b>seating</b> <b>platforms</b> when connected to zirconia or titanium abutments. The SEM images showed zirconia particles being transferred to the implant, which requires further study...|$|R

5000|$|Related to bass shakers are a newer type of {{transducer}} {{referred to}} as linear actuators. These piston-like electromagnetic devices transmit motion in a direct fashion by lifting home theater seating in the vertical plane rather than transferring vibrations (by mounting within a <b>seat,</b> <b>platform</b> or floor). This technology is said to transmit a high-fidelity sound-motion augmentation, whereas [...] "Shakers" [...] may require heavy equalization and/or multiple units to approach a realistic effect.|$|R

5000|$|The {{history of}} the kotatsu begins in the Muromachi era during the fourteenth century. Its origins begin with the Japanese cooking hearth, known as the irori. Charcoal was the primary method of cooking and heating in the {{traditional}} Japanese household and was used to heat the irori. By the fourteenth century in Japan, a <b>seating</b> <b>platform</b> {{was introduced to the}} irori and its cooking function became separated from its seating function. On top of the wooden platform a quilt was placed, known as an oki that trapped and localized the heat of the charcoal burner. This early ancestor to the modern kotatsu was called a hori-gotatsu. The word hori-gotatsu (...) is derived from the kanji [...] (hori) meaning ditch, digging, [...] (ko) meaning torch or fire, and [...] (tatsu) meaning foot warmer.|$|E

Another platform was welded to the rear to hold the generator and a motorcycle. The bus was painted by the various Pranksters in a variety of psychedelic colors and designs. The paint was not day-glo (which was not yet common in 1964) but primary colors, and the peace symbol wasn't yet evident. The word 'Sunshine' was written in blue, but it was too early to refer to orange sunshine LSD or Kesey's not-yet-conceived daughter Sunshine.The bus was named by artist Roy Sebern, who first painted the word “Furthur” (with two U's, quickly corrected) on the destination placard as a kind of one-word poem and inspiration to keep going whenever the bus broke down. The misspelled name is still often used, as in Wolfe's book.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ground floor}} of the museum {{displays}} a varied selection of artefacts. These included certain architectural elements, which were removed from various buildings within the Grand Palace during different renovations, as well as were the stone Buddha images and Chinese statues. They included many figures from Thai literature, the Ramakien, such as Supanmacha and Hanuman. The stone figures date from the reign of King Rama III, and were later moved to the museum to prevent damage. [...] In the central hall are the bones of white elephants. These elephants were not actually white but have certain special characteristics such as pinkish colouring and cream eyes. The White elephant was an important symbol of kingship; the more the monarch possessed the greater was his prestige. This belief and veneration of the animal is common to many other South-east Asian cultures. The upper floor rooms display more artistic and precious objects. In the main hall are two architectural models of the Grand Palace, the first representing the Grand Palace {{during the reign of}} King Rama I, and another in the reign of King Rama V.
