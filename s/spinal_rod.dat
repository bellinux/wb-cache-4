The attenuation effect of these rods has not been completely studied for patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>rods</b> and requiring <b>spinal</b> radiotherapy. AimThe {{purpose of the current}} study was to investigate the dosimetric perturbation effect of metallic <b>spinal</b> <b>rods</b> in different photon beams. Materials/MethodsThree photon beams of 6, 9 and 15 MV were modelled using MCNP 4 C Monte Carlo (MC) code. The geometry consisted of two <b>spinal</b> <b>rods</b> at a depth of 4 cm and a water phantom was used for MC calculations. The beam profiles at depths of 5. 5, 6. 5 and 7. 5 cm were calculated. ResultsDose reductions of 10. 2 – 11. 2 % and 5 – 6. 2 % were observed for steel and titanium rods respectively. The insertion of metallic rods into the photon beams did not change the spinal cord received dose but the effect of both types of rods on the target region behind the rods cannot be ignored, especially for steel rods. ConclusionsOur results suggest that for reliable spinal radiotherapy the dose attenuation effect of <b>spinal</b> <b>rods</b> {{must be taken into account}} in treatment planning calculations...|$|R

NiTi <b>spinal</b> <b>rods</b> with 50. 8 % Ni were treated by nitrogen PIII at 40 kV with 100 Hz. Seventeen patients with spinal scoliosis were surgically treated by either Ti alloy rods or nitrogen plasma implanted NiTi rods. The mean age at operation was 16. 6 years. The mean number of treated spinal segments was 9. Blood samples were collected as baseline before surgery and up to 1 year post-surgery. Nickel levels were assayed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Twelve patients (7 M and 5 F, 6 =NiTi and 6 =Ti) were followed up for 6 months, and five patients (2 M and 3 F, 2 =NiTi and 3 =Ti) had completed 1 -year follow-up. In all cases, at Day 1 after surgery, patients who had NiTi rods implanted had a 2. 5 times increase in the Ni level, compared with before surgery. However, all were within recommended safe limits. The Ni levels returned to baseline in all subjects between 7 days to 1 month post-surgery. No clinical signs and symptoms of Ni allergy or toxicity was observed.

Methods: A finite element study compared a validated instrumented L 2 –L 4 segment undergoing standing, upper body flexion and extension to ISO 12189 standards model under a compressive load. A bridge instrumentation, with screws only at cranial and caudal levels, and a full stabilization, using screws at every level, are considered for both conditions. The internal loads on the <b>spinal</b> <b>rod</b> and the stress values on the implant are analysed in detail.

Choosing softer/stiffer springs would involve higher/lower loads on every component. Conclusions: ISO model predicts the effects of using both a full and a bridge posterior instrumentation.

The concave and convex rod shapes from patients with thoracic AIS (n = 49) were traced prior to insertion. Postoperative sagittal rod shape was determined by computed tomography.

Multiple stepwise linear regression {{analysis was used to}} identify variables independently predictive of change in rod contour (Δθ). Average Δθ at the concave and convex side were 13. 6 ° ± 7. 5 ° and 4. 3 ° ± 4. 8 °, respectively. The Δθ at the concave side was significantly greater than that of the convex side (P < 0. 0001) and significantly correlated with Risser sign (P = 0. 032), the preoperative main thoracic Cobb angle (P = 0. 031), the preoperative TK angle (P = 0. 012), and the number of facetectomy levels (P = 0. 007). Furthermore, a Δθ at the concave side ≥ 14 ° significantly correlated with the postoperative TK angle (P = 0. 003), the number of facetectomy levels (P = 0. 021), and screw density at the concave side (P = 0. 008). Rod deformation at the concave side suggests that corrective forces acting on that side are greater than on the convex side.

40|$|Titanium and its alloys are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fixation rod materials in spinal fusion surgery because of their biocompatibility, stability, and endurance. However, titanium {{may not be the best}} rod material for patients as it can cause adjacent segment degeneration (ASD), in which the spinal segments adjacent to the instrumented segment or segments experience increased force loading and begin to deteriorate. Through analysis of various studies, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), nitinol, and silicon nitride were found to be possible alternative spinal fusion fixation rod materials. To determine which of these materials is best suited for use as a <b>spinal</b> <b>rod</b> material, the osteointegration, current availability, stiffness, durability, corrosion resistance, and clinical efficacy of each material was analyzed. Although silicon nitride had strong osteointegrative properties, no testing could be found evaluating the material as a spinal fusion rod, indicating its current unavailability. Even though nitinol was determined to have better osteointegrative properties than PEEK, PEEK has an elastic modulus close to bone, a reinforcing material, carbon fiber, that allows for customization of the elastic modulus, no risk of corrosion, and strong clinical results. By implementing PEEK fixation rods in spinal fusion surgeries instead of titanium rods, the incidence of ASD may decrease as well as the risk of rod corrosion. [URL]...|$|E

In order to apply the cavitation peening for the small rod, whose diameter is only 5. 5 mm, the cavitating region was concentrated by increasing the ambient pressure. The depth profiles of the resulting residual stress were evaluated by X-ray diffraction following layer removal by electropolishing. The results show that cavitation peening creates compressive residual stress deeper into the rod, even though the stress value at the near surface is saturated due to initial processing using glass shot peening. The depth of the compressive residual stress continuously increases from 44 μm to 230 μm with an increase in the cavitation peen ing processing time.

Previously, we successfully demonstrated the Ni suppression on superficial layer by plasma surface treatment.

The <b>rods</b> embedded with <b>spinal</b> functional unit were undergone static and dynamic compressive bending tests under temperature control according to ASTM F 1717 - 01. Five models were used in the static test. For the dynamic test, two models were used {{for each of the three}} loading levels (75 %, 50 % and 25 % of ultimate load). The fatigue strength was equal to the loading level with two models endured five million cycles without failure. All samples were plastically deformed without failure after the static test. The average ultimate load was equal to 516. 2 N (SD = 18. 1 N). For the dynamic test at 75 %, there was unilateral fracture of nitinol rod in each model after half million cycles. Bilateral fracture near the rod and screw junction in both models was occurred at 50 % after million cycles. The last two models were loaded for over five million cycles without failure at 25 %. The fatigue strength was equal to 25 % ultimate load, i. e. 129. 0 N. Our results are comparable to the existing implants and considerable for clinical trial.

The authors have manufactured a nickel-titanium rod (NTR) with super-elastic properties to allow gradual correction. The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NTR as compared to traditional rods (TRs). METHODS: Patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and Lenke 1 curves were randomized (1 : 1) at surgery to receive either the NTR or TR. Anteroposterior and lateral standing radiographs were obtained preoperative, postoperative day 1 and 7, week 4, 12 and 24, year 1, 2 and 5. Parameters assessed include primary and secondary Cobb angles, kyphosis, rib hump, truncal shift, listing, shoulder height, clavicle angle and T 1 tilt. Sagittal profiles were subcategorized into Types A (35 °). SRS- 30 scores, nickel serum levels and any adverse effects or complications were noted. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with AIS (mean age: 15 years) were recruited with minimum 5 years follow-up. All radiographic parameters were similar between the two groups. Unlike TR, the NTR group had 33 % of subjects with preoperative A profiles become B or C at 5 -year follow-up. Nickel levels remained normal, there were no allergic reactions, wound complications, loss of balance, implant breakages or non-union. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized pilot trial showed that the NTR has potential to gradually correct the spinal curve over time, result in comparable correction to TR and may improve sagittal correction...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: There {{is still}} some {{controversy}} regarding the optimal biomechanical concept for spinopelvic stabilization following total sacrectomy for malignancy. Strains at specific anatomical sites at pelvis/sacrum and implants interfaces have been poorly investigated. Herein, we compared and analyzed the strains applied at key points at the bone-implant interface in four different spinopelvic constructs following total sacrectomy; consequently, we defined a balanced architecture for spinopelvic fusion in that situation. Methods: Six human cadaveric specimens, from second lumbar vertebra to proximal femur, were {{used to compare the}} partial strains at specific sites in a total sacrectomy model. Test constructs included: (1) intact pelvis (control), (2) sacral-rod reconstruction (SRR), (3) bilateral fibular flap reconstruction (BFFR), (4) four-rods reconstruction (FRR), and (5) improved compound reconstruction (ICR). Strains were measured by bonded strain gauges onto the surface of three specific sites (pubic rami, arcuate lines, and posterior spinal rods) under a 500 N axial load.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical performance, radiological outcome and safety of the Memory Metal Spinal System, used in a PLIF procedure, in the treatment of spondylolisthesis, symptomatic spinal stenosis or degenerative disc disease in human subjects.

40|$|As spine {{deformities}} scoliosis and kyphosis {{progress in}} severity, surgical treatment is often required. Implant rods are attached by bone screws to the spinal vertebrae to correct these deformities and stabilize the spine. It {{can be difficult}} to cut these rods to the ideal length before implantation and sometimes these rods are too long and must be cut in-situ. Also, when revision surgery is performed to replace a rod section, in-situ rod cutting must be performed. The rods are difficult to cut and only manual rod cutting tools are available. These rod cutters are physically demanding to use and difficult to position while avoiding any spurious with the exposed spine. There is a clear need for an improved in-situ rod cutter. Thus, the objective of this thesis is to develop a new and improved design for an in-situ rod cutter. Experimental work was done to show that shear cutting and bolt-cutting techniques produced the most desirable results for cutting spinal rods in-situ. The shear cutting techniques required slightly less force than bolt cutting techniques and produced a cleaner rod cut with less deformation. It was found that cutting force increased with the diameter of the <b>spinal</b> <b>rod,</b> regardless of the rod material. Constraints and criteria were established to guide the design of a new in-situ rod cutter. It was decided that any attempt at designing a new in-situ cutter must include a non-manual power source for operation. Two design alternatives, a shear cutting design and bolt-cutting design were presented and scored in an engineering design process. A shear cutter design was initially chosen and work was done to implement the shear cutter design. However, the prototype fractured in initial testing and the shear cutter design was abandoned. A bolt-cutter design was then developed and a 3 D printed prototype was made to demonstrate the mechanism involved. Analysis was performed to estimate the mechanical advantage of the mechanism used to amplify the force applied by a pneumatic cylinder used as the power source. Further development was required to implement the bolt-cutting design but initial progress in this design project was achieved. It is recommended that stress analysis, prototyping and testing be done to move this design towards application in spinal surgery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Some tetraplegic {{patients}} {{may wish to}} undergo urological procedures without anaesthesia, but these patients can develop autonomic dysreflexia if cystoscopy and vesical lithotripsy are performed without anaesthesia. Case presentation We describe three tetraplegic patients, who developed autonomic dysreflexia when cystoscopy and laser lithotripsy were carried out without anesthesia. In two patients, who declined anaesthesia, blood pressure increased to more than 200 / 110 mmHg during cystoscopy. One of these patients developed severe bleeding from bladder mucosa and lithotripsy was abandoned. Laser lithotripsy was carried out under subarachnoid block a week later in this patient, and this patient did not develop autonomic dysreflexia. The third patient with C- 3 tetraplegia had undergone correction of kyphoscoliotic deformity of spine with <b>spinal</b> <b>rods</b> and pedicular screws from the level of T- 2 to S- 2. Pulmonary function test revealed moderate to severe restricted curve. This patient developed vesical calculus and {{did not wish to}} have general anaesthesia because of possible need for respiratory support post-operatively. Subarachnoid block was not considered in view of previous spinal fixation. When cystoscopy and laser lithotripsy were carried out under sedation, blood pressure increased from 110 / 50 mmHg to 160 / 80 mmHg. Conclusion These cases show that tetraplegic patients are likely to develop autonomic dysreflexia during cystoscopy and vesical lithotripsy, performed without anaesthesia. Health professionals should educate spinal cord injury patients regarding risks of autonomic dysreflexia, when urological procedures are carried out without anaesthesia. If spinal cord injury patients are made aware of potentially life-threatening complications of autonomic dysreflexia, {{they are less likely to}} decline anaesthesia for urological procedures. Subrachnoid block or epidural meperidine blocks nociceptive impulses from urinary bladder and prevents occurrence of autonomic dysreflexia. If spinal cord injury patients with lesions above T- 6 decline anaesthesia, nifedipine 10 mg should be given sublingually prior to cystoscopy to prevent increase in blood pressure due to autonomic dysreflexia. </p...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. January 2016. Major: Biomedical Engineering. Advisors: Victor Barocas, Joan Bechtold. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 36 pages. Background: Early onset scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity {{of the spine}} and trunk – diagnosed {{before the age of}} 10 – and occurs in 3 to 5 out of 100, 000 infant and juvenile populations. Surgical intervention is often necessary for pediatric patients with severe curvatures. During thesis procedures, <b>spinal</b> <b>rods</b> – known as pediatric non-fusion devices (i. e. growing rods) – are placed in the patients to allow for spinal growth. ASTM standards exist for fusion constructs. Growing-rod constructs place greater demands on the rods as no fusion is performed and the rods are continually loaded. Also, the constructs are serially lengthened at 6 -month intervals placing additional demands on the construct. Currently, there are no standards on how to develop and utilize a finite element model – to predict durability of commonly used constructs within the patient. Methods: Finite element models representing static compression bending were implemented using Abaqus CAE (Dassault Systemés Simulia Corporation, Providence, Rhode Island). The model geometry and loading was based on ASTM standard 1537 and 136. The models were created with C 3 D 8 R type elements. The model applied a controlled displacement until failure or contact occurred between the superior and inferior UHMWPE blocks. Failure was defined as the point at which permanent deformation of the construct occurs, due to fracture, plastic deformation, or slip. Eight constructs were analyzed based on the rod material (titanium and cobalt chrome), active length (76 -mm and 376 -mm), and construct type (F 1717 and growing-rod). Results: The force-displacement curves and maximum principle stress for each whole model were evaluated. The longer active lengths required a smaller force for failure. Failure at the pedicle screw head was found on each model. Conclusions: A new ASTM standard for growing-rod constructs should be created based off of a longer active length, the overlap of the rod connectors, and location of the rod connectors...|$|R

40|$|Background: Spinal {{systems that}} are {{currently}} available for correction of spinal deformities or degeneration such as lumbar spondylolisthesis or degenerative disc disease use components manufactured from stainless steel or titanium and typically comprise two spinal rods with associated connection devices (for example: DePuy Spines Titanium Moss Miami Spinal System). The Memory Metal Spinal System of this study consists of a single square <b>spinal</b> <b>rod</b> made of a nickel titanium alloy (Nitinol) {{used in conjunction with}} connecting transverse bridges and pedicle screws made of Ti-alloy. Nitinol is best known for its shape memory effect, but is also characterized by its higher flexibility when compared to either stainless steel or titanium. A higher fusion rate with less degeneration of adjacent segments may result because of the elastic properties of the memory metal. In addition, the use of a single, unilateral rod may be of great value for a TLIF procedure. Our objective is to evaluate the mechanical properties of the new Memory Metal Spinal System compared to the Titanium Moss Miami Spinal System. Methods: An in-vitro mechanical evaluation of the lumbar Memory Metal Spinal System was conducted. The test protocol followed ASTM Standard F 1717 - 96, "Standard Test Methods for Static and Fatigue for Spinal Implant Constructs in a Corpectomy Model. " 1. Static axial testing in a load to failure mode in compression bending, 2. Static testing in a load to failure mode in torsion, 3. Cyclical testing to estimate the maximum run out load value at 5. 0 x 10 (boolean AND) 6 cycles. Results: In the biomechanical testing for static axial compression bending there was no statistical difference between the 2 % yield strength and the stiffness of the two types of spinal constructs. In axial compression bending fatigue testing, the Memory Metal Spinal System construct showed a 50 % increase in fatigue life compared to the Titanium Moss Miami Spinal System. In static torsional testing the Memory Metal Spinal System constructs showed an average 220 % increase in torsional yield strength, and an average 30 % increase in torsional stiffness. Conclusions: The in-vitro mechanical evaluation of the lumbar Memory Metal Spinal System showed good results when compared to a currently available spinal implant system.

40|$|Vertical sacral {{fracture}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} difficult fractures to treat. Posterior fixation using <b>spinal</b> dual <b>rods</b> is a novel method for treating this fracture, but its biomechanical strength has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical strength produced by posterior fixation using spinal instrumentation. Sacral fractures were created in eight pelvic bone models and classified into a posterior plate fixation group [P group, n＝ 4] and a spinal instrumentation group [R group, n＝ 4]. The biomechanical strength was tested by pushing down on the S 1 vertebra from the top. The mean maximum loads were 1, 057. 4 N and 1, 489. 4 N in the P and R groups, respectively (p＝ 0. 014). The loads applied to the construct at displacements of 5 mm and 7. 5 mm from the start of the universal testing machine loading were also significantly higher in the R group. The mean stiffness levels in the P and R groups were 88. 3 N/mm and 119. 6 N/mm, respectively (p＝ 0. 014). Posterior fixation using spinal instrumentation is biomechanically stronger than conventional posterior plate fixation. This procedure may be the optimal method for treating unstable sacral fracture fixation...|$|R
40|$|Solid implant rods made of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (ELI) are {{currently}} used in spinal implant devices. Due {{to the high}} stiffness of these solid rods, the implant devices are unable the meet the needs for increased flexibility {{over a wide range}} of human activities owing to changes in lifestyles and in human work environments, thereby, necessitating the need for more flexible rods. Hence, designing, developing, manufacturing and testing flexible <b>spinal</b> implant <b>rods</b> is the aim of this project. In this project, increased flexibility has been achieved by reducing the cross-section of the solid rods. Since reduction in cross-section leads to reduced load bearing capacity, the fatigue endurance level of the flexible rods is lowered. In order to increase the endurance levels of these flexible rods, Laser Shock Peening (LSP) has been used. As a part of this project, the Ohio Center for Laser Shock Processing of Advanced Materials and Devices (LSP Center) has been set-up at the University of Cincinnati through the Ohio State Third Frontier Wrights Projects funding. This project is a collaborative effort between the LSP Center and X-Spine Systems Inc., an implant devices manufacturer based in Miamisburg, Ohio. All the experimental and modeling work pertaining to this project were carried out at the LS...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT Monoenergetic imaging with dual-energy CT {{has been}} {{proposed}} to reduce metallic artifacts in comparison with conventional polychromatic CT. The {{purpose of this study}} is to systematically evaluate and define the optimal dual-energy CT imaging parameters for specific cervical spinal implant alloy compositions. METHODS <b>Spinal</b> fixation <b>rods</b> of cobalt-chromium or titanium alloy inserted into the cervical spine section of an Alderson Rando anthropomorphic phantom were imaged ex vivo with fast-kilovoltage switching CT at 80 and 140 peak kV. The collimation width and field of view were varied between 20 and 40 mm and medium to large, respectively. Extrapolated monoenergetic images were generated at 70, 90, 110, and 130 kiloelectron volts (keV). The standard deviation of voxel intensities along a circular line profile around the spine was used as an index of the magnitude of metallic artifact. RESULTS The metallic artifact was more conspicuous around the fixation rods made of cobalt-chromium than those of titanium alloy. The magnitude of metallic artifact seen with titanium fixation rods was minimized at monoenergies of 90 keV and higher, using a collimation width of 20 mm and large field of view. The magnitude of metallic artifact with cobalt-chromium fixation rods was minimized at monoenergies of 110 keV and higher; collimation width or field of view had no effect. CONCLUSIONS Optimization of acquisition settings used with monoenergetic CT studies might yield reduced metallic artifacts...|$|R
40|$|Lumbar {{arthrodesis}} or spinal fusion {{is usually}} performed to relieve back pain and regain functionality from ruptured discs, disc degenerative disease, trauma and scoliosis. Metal rods are often {{fixed to the}} spine with screws or hooks, while fusion develops on the affected vertebrae. Fusion is determined by visual examination of radiographic images (X-ray), computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), yet these inspection procedures are subjective methods of review. They do not objectively confirm the presence of spinal fusion, {{which can lead to}} exploratory surgery to determine if fusion has occurred. Therefore, a need has arisen to develop an objective method that will offer unbiased information for the determination of fusion. Discussed herein is a housing and sensor designed to be used in conjunction with telemetric circuitry that will attach to the <b>spinal</b> instrumentation <b>rods.</b> The housing will transmit strain to an internatal capacitive MEMS-based sensor that will relay strain magnitudes via telemetry. Observed reductions of bending strain will indicate a successful fusion. These objective assessments will reduce the incidence of costly exploratory surgeries where fusion is in question. The housing design was fabricated using Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) material, which was selected for its physical properties and its ability to be implanted for long durations. The housing was tested under cyclical, static and maximum strain transfer loading configurations in the Material Testing System (MTS). Results from these tests demonstrated that the housing transferred 102...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: This 2 -year {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the efficacy of a bioactive three-dimensional (3 D) fabric disc for lumbar intervertebral disc replacement. The authors used a bioresorbable <b>spinal</b> fixation <b>rod</b> consisting of a forged composite of particulate unsintered hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide acid (HA/PLLA) for stability augmentation. The biomechanical and histological alterations as well as possible device-related loosening were examined at 2 years postoperatively. METHODS: Two lumbar intervertebral discs (L 2 - 3 and L 4 - 5) were replaced with the 3 D fabric discs, which were augmented by two titanium screws and a spanning bioresorbable rod (HA/PLLA). The segmental biomechanics and interface bone ingrowth were investigated at 6, 15, and 24 months postoperatively, and results were compared with the other two surgical groups (3 D fabric disc alone; 3 D fabric disc with additional anterior instrumentation stabilization). The 3 D fabric disc and HA/PLLA-spinal segments demonstrated segmental mobility at 15 and 24 months; however, the range of motion (ROM) in flexion-extension decreased to 49 and 40 %, respectively, despite statistically equivalent preserved torsional ROM. Histologically there was excellent osseous fusion at the 3 D fabric disc surface-vertebral body interface. At 2 years posttreatment, no adverse tissue reaction nor aseptic loosening of the device was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Intervertebral disc replacement with the 3 D fabric disc was viable and when used in conjunction with the bioresorbable HA/PLLA spinal augmentation. Further refinements of device design to create a stand-alone type are necessary to obviate the need for additional spinal stabilization...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This study {{investigated}} whether ultrasound (U/ S) {{is an alternative}} to radiography when measuring magnetically controlled growth rod (MCGR) length {{in order to reduce}} radiation exposure. Distractible <b>spinal</b> growth <b>rods</b> are the gold standard when treating early-onset scoliosis (EOS). Methods This was a prospective series. Patients were already undergoing EOS treatment using MCGRs. Forty-eight data points measured using radiography and U/S were compared. Each U/S data point was measured three times by three observers to assess intra- and inter-observer reliability. The radiation dose of the pre-lengthening and post-lengthening radiographs was recorded. Results The average rod lengths were 1. 322 cm with U/S and 1. 329 cm with radiography. The ICC (radiography vs. U/S) was 0. 992 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 976, 1. 000). The inter- and intra-rater reliability of U/S had an ICC of 0. 987 (95 % CI 0. 966, 1. 000) and 0. 983 (95 % CI 0. 956, 1. 000), respectively. The mean total effective radiation dose of the pre-lengthening and post-lengthening PA spinal radiographs was 0. 26 mSv with a mean attributable lifetime cancer risk of one in 39, 686 per lengthening. Conclusion U/S highly agrees with radiography when measuring MCGR length. It has a high inter- and intra-observer reliability and does not require radiation exposure. Although U/S allows accurate MCGR measurement and soft tissue assessment, patients will still need occasional radiographs to assess spine bony elements, overall spinal balance and scoliosis correction. Combining radiography and U/S allows patient monitoring and accurate MCGR measurement whilst decreasing patients’ radiation exposure.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionA {{number of}} {{techniques}} {{have been described}} {{in the management of}} thoracolumbar spinal fractures, testimony to the absence of consensus on their treatment. For the past few years, minimally invasive techniques have been developed to limit surgery-related iatrogenic injury. The objective {{of this study was to}} report the results of percutaneous management of these lesions and the technical progress made based on our experience. Patients and methodsTwenty-nine patients presenting an A 3 fracture, with a mean age of 51 years, were included in this study. All had a balloon kyphoplasty and percutaneous osteosynthesis. Of the first 22 cases, kyphoplasty was the initial procedure performed associated with reduction maneuvers using distraction. Assessment was clinical (neurological status and pain intensity) and radiological (implant positioning, cement leakage, restoration of local kyphosis and any loss of correction). ResultsIn the overall series, the mean local kyphosis correction was 11 ° with a 2 ° angle loss at the last follow-up. Pain assessment showed significant improvement, decreasing from 6 / 10 to 1 / 10 on discharge. The mean hospital stay lasted 4 days. On the follow-up radiological exams, no cases of extrapedicular screw migration were noted; in two cases, lateral cement leakage was found. The results were equivalent in terms of correction no matter which procedure was performed first, although for the second part of the series the technology was available to bend the <b>spinal</b> fixation <b>rod</b> to the desired curve. DiscussionThe results of this study support the growing interest in minimally invasive techniques in the management of spinal injuries with no neurological deficit. In addition, the evolving material makes it possible to come close to conventional techniques, including reduction maneuvers, while limiting muscle injury by using a purely percutaneous approach. Rigorous patient selection is necessary and the time to learn the procedure must be taken into account. Studies with a longer follow-up are required to confirm the stability of the correction over time. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Retrospective observational study...|$|R
40|$|Scoliosis in skeletally {{immature}} {{children is}} often treated by implantation of a rod to straighten the spine. Rods can be distracted (lengthened) as the spine grows, but patients need many invasive operations under general anaesthesia. Such operations are costly and associated with negative psychosocial outcomes. We assessed the eff ectiveness {{and safety of}} a new magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) for non-invasive outpatient distractions. Methods We implanted the MCGR in fi ve patients, two of whom have now reached 24 months' follow-up. Each patient underwent monthly outpatient distractions. We used radiography to measure {{the magnitude of the}} <b>spinal</b> curvature, <b>rod</b> distraction length, and spinal length. We assessed clinical outcome by measuring the degree of pain, function, mental health, satisfaction with treatment, and procedure-related complications. Findings In the two patients with 24 months' follow-up, the mean degree of scoliosis, measured by Cobb angle, was 67 ° (SD 10 °) before implantation and 29 ° (4 °) at 24 months. Length of the instrumented segment of the spine increased by a mean of 1 · 9 mm (0 · 4 mm) with each distraction. Mean predicted versus actual rod distraction lengths were 2 · 3 mm (1 · 2 mm) versus 1 · 4 mm (0 · 7 mm) for patient 1, and 2 · 0 mm (0 · 2 mm) and 2 · 1 mm (0 · 7 mm) versus 1 · 9 mm (0 · 6 mm) and 1 · 7 mm (0 · 8 mm) for patient 2 's right and left rods, respectively. Throughout follow-up, both patients had no pain, had good functional outcome, and were satisfi ed with the procedure. No MCGR-related complications were noted. Interpretation The MCGR procedure can be safely and eff ectively used in outpatient settings, and minimises surgical scarring and psychological distress, improves quality of life, and is more cost-eff ective than is the traditional growing rod procedure. The technique could be used for non-invasive correction of abnormalities in other disorders. postprin...|$|R
40|$|Scoliosis is a {{three-dimensional}} deformity {{of the spine}} most prevalent in adolescent females. As the etiology is often unknown, treatment focusses on preventing curve progression and ranges from observation for mild cases to brace treatment and eventually surgery for the worst cases. This report consists of three different studies, which are aimed to develop a patient specific method to improve the efficacy of brace treatment for scoliosis patients. The first study consists of a literature review of applications of the Finite Element Method (FEM) in scoliosis research, {{with a focus on}} brace treatment. It is concluded that the finite element method has great potential to improve both surgical and brace treatment. However, it has only been applied in a few commercially available braces. Current methods are still quite inaccurate, and thus recommendations are made {{to improve the quality of}} FEM models. The second study aims to establish the forces experienced by <b>spinal</b> implant <b>rods</b> during intra-operative scoliosis correction, in order to validate and improve an existing FEM model of the scoliotic spine. The forces that were found were inconclusive, due to various measurement uncertainties. Therefore, validation of the FEM model based on this data was not possible. However, recommendations were made to improve the study, such that conclusive results should be found. In the final study a patient-specific FEM model of the scoliotic spine is developed and simulated to establish the location, magnitude and direction of force application for optimal curve correction. By varying the angle of the thoracic force vector over a 180 ° range in the transverse plane, the curve correction was established for these angles for four patients. The influence of the lumbar force on curve correction was found to be minimal. An optimization algorithm was subsequently employed to more establish the optimal force direction. The algorithm allowed more variables to be evaluated on a smaller scale, while maintaining a low computational cost. From the three studies it is concluded that FEM models of the spine can be a valuable addition to scoliosis studies. However, spinal behaviour is complex, and many elements such as material properties and interpersonal variation in stiffness remain unknown.

40|$|Many {{patients}} receiving external beam radiation therapy have metal implants {{that can affect}} their treatment, and these metal implants can degrade the accuracy of dose calculations. Dose calculation errors result from limitations of modern dose calculation algorithms in modeling metal/tissue interface effects. Metals also cause streak artifacts in the computed tomography (CT) images that are used for treatment planning, and these artifacts can also degrade dose calculation accuracy. Metal based-energy deposition kernels are a potential solution for the calculation errors associated with {{the limitations of the}} convolution/superposition (C/S) dose calculation method as they better model photon interactions and scatter in metals than water-based kernels, while CT metal artifact reduction methods have the potential to decrease calculation errors associated with imaging artifacts. In this work, several metal-based energy deposition kernels (titanium, silver, and gold) were generated and characterized. These metal-based kernels exhibited more lateral scatter, more backscatter, and less energy deposited in the forward direction than water-based kernels, implying that simply scaling water kernels according to the local density encountered is inadequate for describing photon interactions in metals. These metal kernels were then implemented into a commercial collapsed cone C/S algorithm to investigate their dosimetric impact. In comparison to water-based kernels, metal kernels resulted in better prediction of the backscatter dose enhancement upstream of metals but decreased accuracy directly downstream of metals. When used for clinical dose calculations, the dosimetric benefit of using metal kernels was small (generally limited to a 0. 5 % decrease in calculation error for IMRT treatment plans). In addition to metal kernels in the dose calculation algorithm, several commercial CT metal artifact reduction methods were investigated for their success in reducing dose calculation errors: the Philips O-MAR algorithm, GE’s monochromatic gemstone spectral imaging using dual-energy CT data (GSI), and dual-energy CT imaging with a dedicated artifact reduction algorithm (MARs). Each artifact reduction method was evaluated using several implants commonly encountered in radiation oncology (hip prosthesis, <b>spinal</b> fixation <b>rods,</b> and dental fillings), and its dosimetric impact was evaluated using two clinical cases. Though not always the most successful method, O-MAR was the most consistent and thus safest candidate for all-purpose metal artifact reduction in CT simulation imaging. GSI monochromatic imaging was beneficial for smaller, low Z implants but was not able to reduce the severe artifacts caused by larger, high Z implants and had very little effect on calculation accuracy. The MARs algorithm showed great success in certain scenarios (hip prosthesis and dental fillings) but also exhibited behaviors that are undesirable (i. e., metal distortion) and can actually result in increased errors in comparison to uncorrected CT images. Consequently, the MARs algorithm should be used with abundant caution for dose calculations...|$|R
