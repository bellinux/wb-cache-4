In April 2013 the locomotive class received its TSI certificate and the manufacturer hopes that it will receive national service certifications soon (especially for Czech Republic, Austria and Poland).|$|E

40|$|Cloud <b>service</b> <b>certification</b> aims at {{automatically}} validating {{whether a}} cloud service satisfies a predefined set of requirements. To that end, certification systems collect and evaluate sensitive data {{from various sources}} of a cloud service. At the same time, the certification system itself has to be resilient to attacks to generate trustworthy statements about the cloud service. Thus system architects {{are faced with the}} task of assessing the trustworthiness of different certification system designs. To cope with that challenge, we propose a method to model different architecture variants of cloud <b>service</b> <b>certification</b> systems and analyze threats these systems face. By applying our method to a specific cloud <b>service</b> <b>certification</b> system, we show how threats to such systems can be derived in a standardized way that allows us to evaluate different architecture configurations...|$|E

40|$|Certification {{of cloud}} {{services}} aims at increasing {{the trust of}} customers towards cloud services and providing comparability between cloud services. Applying the concept of certification to cloud services requires systems which continuously detect ongoing changes of the service and assess their impact on customer requirements. In this paper, we propose eight language classes for cloud <b>service</b> <b>certification</b> systems to facilitate research in design and implementation of these systems. To that end, we draw on language classes developed for signature-based intrusion detection systems and apply them to cloud <b>service</b> <b>certification</b> systems...|$|E

50|$|Environmental {{certification}} {{is a form}} {{of environmental}} regulation and development where a company can voluntarily choose to comply with predefined processes or objectives set forth by the <b>certification</b> <b>service.</b> Most <b>certification</b> <b>services</b> have a logo (commonly known as an ecolabel) which can be applied to products certified under their standards.

40|$|Through {{automatically}} checking whether {{cloud services}} satisfy customers' requirements, cloud <b>service</b> <b>certification</b> promises cloud providers competitive advantages, e. g. by attracting new customers. However, certification can increase costs of cloud providers, creating incentives for fraudulent providers to save costs by only pretending to satisfy customers' requirements. Opportunistic providers are fraudulent providers who will only cheat {{if they are}} not caught. In this paper, we propose an approach to support cloud <b>service</b> <b>certification</b> of opportunistic providers. To that end, we introduce a method to model the behavior of opportunistic providers and propose a framework supporting test-based certification which builds on randomized testing and is non-invasive. We show how our framework reduces the willingness of opportunistic providers to cheat, and present experimental results of tests supporting the certification of requirements related to resource availability, resource provisioning, and quality of service...|$|E

However, most requirements derived from existing standards such as ISO- 27001 : 2013 are generic, often times inherently ambiguous and thus cannot be validated automatically. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a bottom-up approach using low-level metrics available through widely deployed implementations of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) components. We further present examples how these low-level metrics can serve to construct complex metrics to support validation of generic requirements...|$|E
