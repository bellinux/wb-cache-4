On the practical method, some preliminary examinations were done by the fair prospect on the method of side trawling type and <b>stern</b> <b>trawling</b> type, during 1 ~ 3 knots (towing speed) ...|$|E
40|$|Twin {{trawling}}; a {{new concept}} in shrimp trawling is described in this paper. It essentially involves towing of two trawls of equal size connected in sequence at the inner head and foot rope legs and using a pair of outer otter boards and central neutral door or dummy door with triple bridles and single tow warp. A comparative study with conventional <b>stern</b> <b>trawling</b> using a standard 13. 7 m four seam shrimp trawl and two 6 8 m standard four seam trawls as twin-rig has shown considerable reduction in the utilization of power (20 %) with better efficiency in shrimp fishing...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} the management process established {{for a new}} deep-water (600 – 800 m) trawl fishery in Brazil, including {{a review of the}} biological elements upon which management measures were recommended. This fishery was established in slope areas of southeastern and southern sectors of Brazilian coast during the last quarter of 2002 when profitable concentrations of “carabineiro” shrimp (Aristaeopsis edwardsiana), “moruno” shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea) and “alistado” shrimp (Aristeus antillensis) were found by foreign <b>stern</b> <b>trawl</b> vessels. These vessels were chartered by Brazilian companies whose contracts were supported by a development plan of the Brazilian Government. A complete fishery evaluation, including stock assessment, potential yields estimation and biomass dynamics analysis of “carabineiro” shrimp, the main species caught, was conducted and has resulted on the development of a management plan, which incorporates technical points of reference, criteria for fishery diagnosis and decision making, and exclusive management measures. The main proposed management measures include a total allowable catch of 60 ton. year- 1 to be harvested by a maximum of two national vessels, operating in a fishing area rotation scheme. The plan addresses also fishing exclusion areas (that include seamounts), bathymetric and by-catch limits, fishing gear restrictions, VMS (Vessel Monitoring System), logbooks and onboard observers...|$|R

It {{was designed as a}} yacht, but with a <b>stern</b> rigged for <b>trawling.</b> Construction began in 1897 and the ship was launched in 1899. (Expeditions began before that, in 1898, using the small sailing vessel Pomor, which had been purchased in Norway.) ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Stern</b> {{trawlers}} have <b>trawls</b> {{which are}} deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers {{often have a}} ramp, though pelagic and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair trawlers. The superstructure is forward with an aft working deck. At the stern are gallows or a gantry for operating otter boards.|$|R
40|$|The {{training}} ship KEITEN MARU (854. 55 gross ton) {{of the faculty}} of fisheries Kagoshima University, constructed in 1974, is a complete superstructure vessel of <b>stern</b> <b>trawling</b> type. In tuna fishing, this type of vesseles has a difficulty in dipping up fish, because of the height from the sea level to the deck. So, a gear of dipping up tuna with a basket which is made of 9 mm across round iron steel, was devised and experimented, and the obtained results are as follows; This Gear － 1) doesn't hurt fish. 2) economizes labour. 3) is easy in handling, and the cost is low. 4) doesn't take space in storing. 5) is of no use for such fishes as marlin...|$|E
40|$|Factory {{trawlers}} are {{the most}} controversial vessel group in Norwegian fisheries. At the time the fleet emerged, <b>stern</b> <b>trawling</b> in combination with on-board processing of cod fillets {{was regarded as a}} major innovation. However, the deep-sea fleet was intended to be a stable supplier of fish to the land-based industry. Factory trawlers were {{not a part of the}} political project. On the contrary, the vessels represented a serious departure from the traditional employment system for the fisheries' dependent districts. Factory trawlers have, since the seventies, been regarded as the main enemy to the coastal vessels and the land-based industry. The vessels have been subject to a profound debate about several built-in contradictory goals for the fisheries policy, such as the ideal of employment for all and the need for a profitable sector without state subsidies. Despite a series of policy-driven initiatives to remove the factory trawlers, the fleet has been one of the most profitable vessel groups in the Norwegian fisheries. Nonetheless, the fleet is now marginalised in the number of vessels and transformed into an obedient supplier of round fish to the land-based industry. In this article, we outline the history of the Norwegian factory trawlers and how the fleet was subject to a series of critical changes reflecting the complexity of the vessels.

40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} in trawl catches {{and its influence}} on energy efficiency of trawler operations are discussed in this paper, based on data on landings of a Japanese factory trawler which operated in the Indian waters during 1992 - 93. The factory vessel equipped for <b>stern</b> <b>trawling</b> had a length overall of 110 m, GT of 5460 and installed engine power of 5700 hp. Operations were conducted off west coast of India between 31 and 278 m depth contours, using a 80. 4 m high opening bottom trawl with an adjusted vertical opening of 7. 6  0. 9 m. The catch data was grouped according to the median towing hour, {{by the time of}} the day. CPUE obtained was 3713. 4 kg. h- 1 for day time operations and 1536. 6 kg. h- 1 for night-time operations. Mean daily catches were 31367 kg. day- 1 (SE: 2743) for day time operations and 9430 kg. day- 1 (SE: 966) for night-time operations. Fuel consumption were 0. 399 and 0. 982 kg fuel. kg fish- 1, respectively for day and night-time operations. Total catch and catch components such as threadfin bream, bulls eye, hairtails, trevelly, lizard fish showed significant improvement during day-time operations while swarming crabs showed a significant improvement in the night-time operations. The difference in catch rates between day and night could be attributed to diurnal {{variation in}} the spatial distribution and schooling behaviour of the catch categories, their differential behaviour in the vicinity of trawl systems under varying light levels of day and night and consequent effect on catching efficiency and size selectivity at different stages in the capture process. The results obtained in addition to its importance in the operational planning of trawling in order to realise objectives of maximising catch per unit effort and minimising fuel consumption per unit volume of fish caught, has added significance in the use of bottom trawl surveys in stock abundance estimates...|$|E
40|$|The Training ship "Seisui Maru" was {{designed}} to reduce the noise and vibration level of each room concerned; to make a suitable environment for the precision machines, and student training and study. After she was completed in July 1980, the noise and vibretion level was measured on the sea, measuring {{was carried out in}} the center of each room and a microphone was set on the floor at a height of 1. 2 ～ 1. 5 m and a vibration pick-up was set directly on the floor. Consequently we have obtained the following data proving the efficiency of the sound-proofing materials; 1) Navigating with the main engine and the dynamo engine. a) In the laboratory, the wheel house, and the student-room, the noise level was 61 ～ 66 dB (A) and the vertical vibration level was 62 ～ 73 dB. b) In the engine control room the noise level was 75 ～ 80 dB (A) and the vertical vibration level was 65 ～ 72 dB. c) The worst room (in condition) was the mess room and the chief engineer's room with the noise level at 72 ～ 81 dB (A) and the vertical vibration level at 65 ～ 81 dB. 2) Operating only the dynamo engine and the air-conditioner. a) In the laboratory, the wheel house,and the student-room,the noise level was 56 ～ 61 dB (A) and the vretical vibration level was 50 ～ 56 dB. b) In the engine control room the noise level was 76 dB (A) and the vertical vibration level was 60 dB. c) The worst room (in condition) was the galley and the chief engineer's room with the noise level at 75 dB (A) and vertical vibration level at 65 ～ 67 dB. 3) Operating the bowthruster. a) In the laboratory the noise level was 63 ～ 69 dB (A) and the vertical vibration level was 59 ～ 62 dB. b) In the student mess room the noise level was 64 ～ 77 dB (A) and the vertical vibration level was 65 ～ 68 dB. We also measured the noise level on the land while she was moored to the wharf. As regards the noise level outside the ship, we got the figure of 60 dB (A) and less at the scene only 20 meters away from the ship. We found that the noise from the engine room is related to the layout of the room and passageways which is valuable data for the designinig of small-type vessels. * Principal items of the training ship "Seisui Maru" Mie Univercity.
