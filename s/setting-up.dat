5|$|Liverpool's {{opponent}} in the fourth round was Leeds United. The match was played at Elland Road on 27 January 2001 {{in front of a}} near-capacity crowd of 37,108. The home team enjoyed much of the possession, but struggled to find a breakthrough as Liverpool's defence stood firm. Two minutes before full-time, Barmby, on as a substitute, scored the winning goal, rebounding a shot that came off the post. Barmby then turned provider for Liverpool's second, <b>setting-up</b> Heskey to score.|$|E
5|$|Baggio {{maintained}} {{a high level}} of performance under new coach Gianni De Biasi. Baggio managed 12 goals and 9 assists during the 2002–03 season, helping Brescia to an eighth-place finish and another UEFA Intertoto Cup spot. He scored his 300th career goal from a penalty on 15 December 2002, in Brescia's 3–1 home victory over Perugia, also <b>setting-up</b> one of Igli Tare's goals. Baggio was the first player in over 50 years to reach this milestone, and with 318 goals, he is the fourth-highest scoring Italian player in all competitions, behind only Silvio Piola, Alessandro Del Piero and Giuseppe Meazza.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{appointed}} team captain for the 1992–93 season. He had a dominant season, winning the only European club trophy {{of his career}} after helping Juventus to the UEFA Cup final, in which he scored twice and assisted another goal over both legs, defeating Borussia Dortmund 6–1 on aggregate. En route to the final, Baggio scored two goals in the 2–1 home victory against Paris Saint-Germain, in {{the first leg of}} the semi-final, and he went on to score the only goal in the return leg. Juventus also reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing on away goals to local rivals and winners Torino. Juventus finished fourth in Serie A that season, although they managed a 3–1 away win against the Serie A champions Milan, with Baggio scoring a memorable individual goal while also <b>setting-up</b> Andreas Möller's first goal of the match. One of the highlights of the season involved Baggio scoring four goals in open play against Udinese in a 5–0 Juventus home win. Baggio was once again runner-up for the Serie A capocannoniere title with 21 goals and 6 assists. He scored a personal best 30 goals in all club competitions that season, in addition to five goals with the Italy national team. During the 1993 calendar year, Baggio managed a personal record 39 goals across all competitions, scoring 23 goals in Serie A, 3 in the Coppa Italia, 8 goals in European competitions and 5 goals for Italy, helping his national side qualify for the World Cup. Baggio's performances throughout the year earned him both the European Footballer of the Year, with 142 points from a possible 150, and the FIFA World Player of the Year awards. He was also awarded the Onze d'Or, and the World Soccer Player of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|Pirlo led Milan {{in minutes}} {{played for the}} 2006–07 season with 2,782 across 52 appearances, as {{he went on to}} win his second UEFA Champions League title with Milan, also helping his team to a fourth-place finish in Serie A, and another Coppa Italia semi-final. In the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final against Manchester United, Pirlo set up Seedorf's goal, as Milan progressed on to the final. In the 2007 Champions League Final in Athens, Pirlo {{assisted}} Inzaghi's first goal, helping Milan to defeat Liverpool 2–1, avenging their 2005 final defeat in Istanbul. During the 2007–08 season, Pirlo won his second UEFA Super Cup with Milan, assisting Milan's second goal in the final, and winning the Man of the Match award; he also contributed to the club's first ever FIFA World Club Cup title in 2007, once again <b>setting-up</b> Milan's second goal in the final. In October 2007, he was nominated for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year, and the 2007 IFFHS World's Best Playmaker Awards, but they were all won by Milan teammate Kaká, as Pirlo placed 5th in the Ballon d'or, 7th in the FIFA World Player of the Year, and 2nd in the World's Best Playmaker Awards. Despite a strong start, Milan suffered a dip in form {{during the second half of}} the season, finishing the league in fifth place, failing to qualify for the UEFA Champions' League; Milan also suffered eliminations in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League and the Coppa Italia that season. The following season, Milan managed a second-place finish in Serie A, alongside Juventus, and behind local rivals Inter, whilst they were eliminated in the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup, and the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia.|$|E

The series was the fourth overall between the two Pennsylvania clubs and the first since 2000.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{had never}} made much secret that his support of the left-wing Aneurin Bevan was opportunistic. When Bevan {{resigned}} from the Shadow Cabinet (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) in spring 1954 over Labour's support for the <b>setting-up</b> of SEATO, Wilson, who had been runner-up in the elections, stepped up to fill the vacant place. He was supported in this by Richard Crossman but his actions angered Bevan and the other Bevanites.|$|E
25|$|The <b>setting-up</b> of a {{free trade}} zone {{has led to the}} installation, under more {{favourable}} conditions, of infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. The Madeira Free Trade Zone, also called the Madeira International Business Centre, being a tax-privileged economic area, provides an incentive for companies, offering them financial and tax advantages via a whole range of activities exercised in the Industrial Free Zone, the Off-Shore Financial Centre, the International Shipping Register organisation, and the International Service Centre.|$|E
25|$|After {{five years}} of failing {{to qualify for the}} Memorial Cup, the Rockets broke the slump in 2015 after {{defeating}} the Brandon Wheat Kings 4–0 in the WHL finals. They went on to record one win and two losses in the tournament, clinching a spot in the tournament semi-finals. The Rockets then routed the Quebec Remparts 9–3 in the semi-finals, <b>setting-up</b> a game against the Oshawa Generals. Kelowna and Oshawa played hard and forced an overtime. Kelowna then lost the game when Anthony Cirelli, only 1 minute 28 seconds into overtime, banged in a rebound from Carlisle against Jackson Whistle.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{missed out}} in its {{bid for a}} single seat due to a weak {{campaign}} from the government in negotiations, despite widespread support from the people. The Belgian government eventually pushed its campaign and started large-scale construction, renting office space in {{the east of the}} city for use by the institutions. On 11 February 1958, the six governments concluded an unofficial agreement on the <b>setting-up</b> of community offices. On the principle that it would take two years after a final agreement to prepare the appropriate office space, full services were set up in Brussels in expectation of a report from the Committee of Experts looking into the matter of a final seat.|$|E
25|$|Residents {{of western}} North Carolina, what is today {{the state of}} Tennessee, sought to {{separate}} and become the State of Franklin. A former delegate, Arthur Campbell, wanted to join Virginia's adjacent Washington County {{as part of the}} scheme in 1785. Henry had Campbell removed as a militia officer and from his other county offices, as well as ousting Campbell's supporters, replacing them with residents of known loyalty. Although Henry urged leniency in his report to the General Assembly that October, stating that the Washington County separatists had been led astray by anxiety because of the poor economy, he had the legislature pass a Treason Act forbidding the <b>setting-up</b> of a rival government within Virginia territory.|$|E
25|$|The Cistercian monks {{set about}} proﬁtably using {{the land they}} had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and {{versatile}} way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting of vines {{on the slopes of}} the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of orchards, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe-making, the <b>setting-up</b> of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, grain growing, timber rafting and ﬁshing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the Köppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep slope vineyards between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the Middle Ages, the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad Kösen and Roßbach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in wine making, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (country wine, around 1340).|$|E
25|$|In July 1852 {{a public}} meeting {{took place in}} East Grinstead to discuss the <b>setting-up</b> of a railway company which would build a line to Three Bridges. The {{majority}} of landowners affected were in favour and a contractor, a Mr Hale, agreed {{to carry out the}} works for £40,000. Unfortunately, he was killed in accident shortly afterwards. A company, the East Grinstead Railway Company (EGR), was incorporated in November to promote a bill authorising a railway between Three Bridges and East Grinstead. The bill was not opposed by the LBR which was more than happy for a third party to bear the construction costs; furthermore, the LBR ensured that a provision was inserted in the bill allowing it to purchase the line at any time within ten years of construction, and until then to pay the EGR an annual rental of £2,000 while it worked the line on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|While Australia {{struggled}} {{in the early}} stages of the tour, Campese's form was lauded by British critics. Campese played in Australia's first match on tour, lost 10-21 against London. In the second game on tour against Northern Division, lost 9-15, Campese scored a try {{in the early stages}} on the game. Campese scored three tries in a 37-9 victory over England B - Australia's third match on tour. Campese, along with Wallaby captain Nick Farr-Jones, was then rested and selected on the bench for Australia's fourth match on tour, a 10-16 loss to South-West Division. Bolsted by the return of Michael Lynagh to the Australia national rugby union team, Campese regained selection for Australia's fifth provincial game against Midlands Division, in which he was instrumental in <b>setting-up</b> Brad Girvan for a try in the 60th minute: “The Wallabies were on the defensive until Campese cut his way upfield before unloading to winger James Grant, who passed back inside to Girvan.” In the sixth match on tour against England Students, Campese scored two tries, kicked three conversions and two penalties, scoring 20 points in a 36-13 victory.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the sudden}} {{transfer}} of Java and Sumatra from General Douglas MacArthur's American-controlled Southwest Pacific Command to Lord Louis Mountbatten's British-controlled Southeast Asian Command, the first Allied soldiers (1st Battalion of Seaforth Highlanders) did not arrive in Jakarta until late September 1945. British forces began to occupy major Indonesian cities in October 1945. The {{commander of the}} British 23rd Division, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison, set up command in the former governor-general's palace in Jakarta. Christison stated his intentions were to free all Allied prisoners-of-war, and to allow the return of Indonesia to its pre-war status, as a colony of Netherlands. The Republican government were willing {{to cooperate with the}} release and repatriation of Allied civilian and military POWs, <b>setting-up</b> the Committee for the Repatriation of Japanese and Allied Prisoners of Wars and Internees (Panitia Oeroesan Pengangkoetan Djepang dan APWI/POPDA) for this purpose. POPDA, in cooperation with the British, repatriated more than 70,000 Japanese and Allied POWs and internees by the end of 1946. However, due to the relative weakness of the military of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno sought independence by gaining international recognition for his new country rather than engage in battle with British and Dutch military forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{most serious}} {{demographic}} imbalance {{is between the}} mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, L'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement {{of the population of}} Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanisation of the entire coastal strip especially in the province of Teramo and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and a demographic ageing, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L'Aquila which is the lowest of the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation {{as a result of the}} absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, on the other hand, there is such a jumble of accommodation and activities that the environment has been changed with negative effects. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the <b>setting-up</b> of industrial zones, some of which (Vasto, Avezzano, Carsoli, Gissi, Val Vibrata, Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others (Val Pescara, L'Aquila) have run into trouble after initial success. The zones of Sulmona and Guardiagrele have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{enormous}} diversity of funeral art from traditional societies across the world, {{much of it in}} perishable materials, and some is mentioned elsewhere in the article. [...] In traditional African societies, masks often have a specific association with death, and some types may be worn mainly or exclusively for funeral ceremonies. The funeral ceremonies of the Indigenous Australians typically feature body painting; the Yolngu and Tiwi people create carved pukumani burial poles from ironwood trunks, while elaborately carved burial trees have been used in south-eastern Australia. [...] The Toraja people of central Sulawesi are famous for their burial practices, which include the <b>setting-up</b> of effigies of the dead on cliffs. [...] The 19th- and 20th-century royal Kasubi Tombs in Uganda, destroyed by fire in 2010, were a circular compound of thatched buildings similar to those inhabited by the earlier Kabakas when alive, but with special characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries the <b>setting-up</b> {{of grammar}} schools became a common act of charity by nobles, wealthy {{merchant}}s and guilds; for example Spalding Grammar School, founded by John Gamlyn and John Blanche in 1588, and Blundell's School, founded in 1604 by wealthy Tiverton merchant Peter Blundell. Many {{of these are}} still commemorated in annual [...] "Founder's Day" [...] services and ceremonies at surviving schools. The usual pattern was to create an endowment to pay the wages of a master to instruct local boys in Latin and sometimes Greek without charge.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928 the Soviet [...] People's Commissar for Education, Anatoly Lunacharsky, {{pressured}} by leftist Marxists, {{agreed to an}} entirely anti-religious education system from the first grade up, however, he still warned against a general expulsion of teachers with religious beliefs due to the shortage of atheist teachers. In 1929 an Agitprop conference resolved to intensify anti-religious work throughout the education system. This led to the <b>setting-up</b> of anti-religious sections at all research and higher-education teaching institutions. A special anti-religious faculty was instituted at the Institute of Red Professors in 1929.|$|E
2500|$|MacDonald {{retained}} {{an interest}} in Scottish politics. Gladstone's first Irish Home Rule Bill inspired the <b>setting-up</b> of a Scottish Home Rule Association in Edinburgh. On 6 March 1888, MacDonald {{took part in a}} meeting of London-based Scots, who, upon his motion, formed the London General Committee of Scottish Home Rule Association. For a while he supported home rule for Scotland, but found little support among London's Scots. However, MacDonald never lost his interest in Scottish politics and home rule, in Socialism: critical and constructive, published in 1921, he wrote: [...] "The Anglification of Scotland has been proceeding apace to the damage of its education, its music, its literature, its genius, and the generation that is growing up under this influence is uprooted from its past." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{biological}} {{emphasis in}} the Department was aided by the appointment of R W Russell as Professor in 1950. The expansion of the teaching staff also enabled him to develop work on human learning, perception and other areas of experimental psychology. Two consequences flowed from his work. The first was {{the establishment of a}} close working relationship with other biological departments in the College, and the second was the <b>setting-up</b> of a Medical Research Council Unit concerned largely with work on psychopharmacological problems. In 1959 Professor George Drew became Head of Department. During his tenure, the Department became a recognised biological science department, incorporated into the Faculty of Science and offering a BSc Honours Degree. Professor Drew’s own research was in the area of skilled behaviour; his work on the effect of alcohol on skills was the basic research which led to the introduction of the breathalyser into England ...|$|E

60|$|About this time, the Prince made up {{his mind}} that he could no longer stand the din and confusion, the {{everlasting}} up-setting and <b>setting-up</b> in his native city. He would go away, and see if he could find the Princess with whom he had eaten a philopena. If he should win, she would be obliged to marry him; and then, perhaps, they could settle down in some place where it was quiet and peaceful. So, on the same morning in which the Princess rode away, he put on a handsome suit of black clothes, and mounting a gentle white horse, he rode out of the city. Only one person saw him go; for, even at that early hour, the people were so busy that little attention was paid to his movements.|$|E

Mankind is divided into two classes--those who do <b>setting-up</b> exercises before breakfast and those who know they ought to but don't. To the former and more praiseworthy class Wally had belonged since boyhood. Life might be vain and the world a void, but still he touched his toes the prescribed number of times and twisted his muscular body about according to the ritual. He did so this morning a little more vigorously than usual, partly because he had sat up too late the night before and thought too much and smoked too much, with the result that he had risen heavy-eyed, at the present disgraceful hour, and partly because he hoped by wearying the flesh to still the restlessness of the spirit. Spring generally made Wally restless, but never previously had it brought him this distracted feverishness. So he lay on his back and waved his legs in the air, and it was only when he had risen and was about to go still further into the matter that he perceived Jill standing beside him.|$|E
