5000|$|In 1968, the Fairlane {{line was}} {{supplemented}} {{by the new}} Torino, and the Ranchero followed suit, becoming the largest model since the full-sized 1959. Overall, the new Ranchero was not only bigger, but also more angular than before with its more horizontal grille and horizontal headlamps; Ford and other automakers were making a switch back to horizontal quad headlamps. The interior was all new, as well, sharing the Torino/Fairlane's distinctive four-pod instrument cluster. Though the four round pods gave the illusion of an engine-turned dash, viewed from left to right, they instead featured warning lights for coolant temperature (both cold and hot) and the left turn <b>signal</b> <b>indicator</b> in the left pod with the speedometer in the second pod {{directly in front of}} the driver. Warning lights for the charging system and oil pressure, as well as the right turn <b>signal</b> <b>indicator,</b> were located third from the left. In upscale models, this pod was supplanted by a tachometer. An optional clock filled the fourth pod; a decorative [...] "clock delete" [...] panel otherwise filled the space. A seat belt warning light was a new feature, too, lighting briefly in the far left pod whenever the engine was started. The model line also featured wraparound front side marker lamps which doubled as parking lights and rear side reflectors, newly mandated by US law for the 1968 model year.|$|E

30|$|Colorimetric sensors are {{commonly}} used in water contaminant sensing based on the chromogenic reaction of colored compounds. The components and amounts of target compounds can be determined by measuring the color change of the solution [85, 86]. The Gu group reported on chromophoric Ru complex-doped MOFs (RuUiO- 67) and explored their performance as sensing probes for the colorimetric detection of Hg 2 + [87]. It was found that thiocyanate-bearing dyes in Ru(H 2 bpydc)(bpy)(NCS) 2 (H 2 L) complex could specifically interact with Hg 2 + owing to the strong affinity between Hg 2 + and the thiocyanate groups in the dyes. Thus, RuUiO- 67 served as the recognition site and <b>signal</b> <b>indicator.</b> Upon the addition of Hg 2 +, a concomitant red-to-yellow color change of the probe suspension was recognized, and the detection limit {{was determined to be}} as low as 0.5  μM for Hg 2 +.|$|E

The uptake of the nanocrystals by both HepG 2 and 3 T 3 -L 1 cells was investigated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, which showed a clear time-dependence at higher concentrations. Reconstructed 3 -D confocal microscope images exhibited that the PAAc-SiNPs were evenly distributed throughout the cytosol rather than attached to outer membrane. This study provides fundamental evidence for the safe application and further modification of silicon nanoparticles, which could broaden their application as cell markers in living systems and in micelle encapsulated drug delivery systems...|$|E

40|$|Many {{chemicals}} {{have been}} found to induce DNA damages which may lead to gene mutation and tumor generation. In this report, a microplate-based photoelectrochemical DNA sensor array was developed for the rapid and high throughput screening of DNA damaging chemicals. A 96 -well plate with built-in electrodes was fabricated on a plastic substrate by the standard electronics industry processes. The working electrode in each well was deposited with SnO 2 nanoparticles, and the resulting film was sintered at low temperatures tolerable for the plastic substrate. The film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On the plates sintered at 150 degrees C, a significant amount of photocurrent was obtained in a Ru(bpy) (3) (2 +) (bpy = 2, 2 '-bipyridine) solution. To construct a DNA sensor, poly-(diallydimethyl ammonium chloride) and double-stranded DNA were sequentially assembled on the SnO 2 electrode by electrostatic interaction, and a DNA intercalator, Ru(bpy) (2) (dppz) (2 +) (dppz = dipyrido[3, 2 -a: 2 ', 3 '-c]phenazine) was used as the photoelectrochemical <b>signal</b> <b>indicator.</b> After the DNA film was exposed to tetrafluoro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (TFBQ) or TFBQ/H 2 O 2, the photocurrent dropped by 38 % and 73 % respectively. The photocurrent reduction can be attributed to less binding of Ru(bpy) (2) (dppz) (2 +) to the electrode after DNA damage. Photocurrent measurement of the entire 96 -well plate was completed within 22 min automatically. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Non-covalent binding {{interactions}} of small molecules with DNA play {{important roles in}} regulating gene expression and gene function. In this work, a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) displacement method has been developed to investigate such interactions, particularly for weak DNA binders. This ECL method relies on a double-stranded DNA film deposited on an indium tin oxide electrode (ITO) surface by layer-by-layer self-assembly. A DNA intercalator, [Ru(bpy) (2) (dppz) ](2 +) (bpy = 2, 2 &# 39;-bipyridine, dppz = dipyrido[3, 2 -a: 2 &# 39; 3 &# 39;-c]phenazine), is employed as the ECL <b>signal</b> <b>indicator.</b> If a test compound competes with the indicator for the same binding sites in DNA, it would displace the indicator from the film and reduce ECL signal. The new method was validated by measuring five well-known DNA-binding organic molecules including quinacrine, H 33258, thiazole orange, ethidium bromide and 4, 6 -diamidine- 2 -phenylindole dihydrochloride. Due to high ECL sensitivity, only 0. 4 mu mol L(- 1) [Ru(bpy) (2) (dppz) ](2 +) was needed in the ECL displacement measurement, which is about 75 -fold less than the concentration in the voltammetric measurement. The lowered concentration permitted direct measurement of IC(50) values of eight hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in their ECL displacement curves and subsequent calculation of their binding constants with DNA. The ECL displacement method is particularly useful for investigating weak DNA binders with limited aqueous solubility. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Nanomaterials {{have been}} used {{increasingly}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications, and some of them have shown toxic effects on experimental animals and cells. In this study, a previously established photoelectrochemical DNA sensor was employed to rapidly detect DNA damage induced by polystyrene nanosphere (PSNS) suspensions. In the sensor, a double-stranded DNA film was assembled on a semiconductor electrode, and a DNA intercalator, Ru(bpy) 2 (dppz) 2 + (bpy = 2, 2 ′-bipyridine, dppz = dipyrido[3, 2 -a: 2 ′, 3 ′-c]phenazine) was used as the photoelectrochemical <b>signal</b> <b>indicator.</b> After the DNA-modified electrode was exposed to 2. 0 mg/mL PSNS suspension, photocurrent of DNA-bound Ru(bpy) 2 (dppz) 2 + decreased by about 20 %. The decrease is attributed to the chemical damage of DNA and consequently less binding of Ru(bpy) 2 (dppz) 2 + molecules to the electrode. Gel electrophoresis of DNA samples incubated with PSNS suspension confirmed DNA damage after the chemical exposure. However, in both photoelectrochemical and gel electrophoresis experiments, extensively washed PSNS did not induce any DNA damage, and the supernatant of PSNS suspension exhibited comparable DNA damage as the unwashed PSNS suspension. Furthermore, UV-visible absorption spectrum of the supernatant displayed a pattern very similar to that of styrene oxide (SO), a compound which has been shown to induce DNA damage by forming covalent DNA adducts. It is therefore suggested that styrene oxide and other residual chemicals in the PSNS may be responsible for the observed DNA damage. The results highlight the importance of full characterization of nanomaterials before their toxicity study, and demonstrate the utility of photoelectrochemical DNA sensors in the rapid assessment of DNA damage induced by chemicals and nanomaterials.

40|$|The blind's {{capacities}} {{to navigate}} {{in a particular}} place and to organize their daily activities are of vital importance for their health and well-being. Organizing any kind of simple daily activity can be especially difficult; {{it is not easy}} for the blind to distinguish the different items, such as packaged foods and drug containers just by touching with their hands. RFID, or radio frequency identification, is a technology that can provide a support for improving the organization and orientation during the daylight activities. RFID uses radio waves to deliver data from a tag, which stores information, to a reader, which can elaborate the information making decisions. This technology is very useful in many different contexts such as scanning passports, shipments and automatic highway toll collecting. As the RFID technology stands out for its inherent technical nature of any basic RFID system, it may involve additional improvements for numerous applications in the field of health care. In this paper, a RFID device designed as a support for the blind in searching some objects is presented; in particular, it has been develop for searching the medicines in a cabinet at home. The device is able to provide to the blind some pieces of information about the distance and simplify the search; besides identifying the medicines, the device is able to provide the user an acoustic signal in order to find easily the desired product as soon as possible. It is noteworthy the fact that it gives the blind some items of information about the distance of a defined object, that is how near or far it is. This application is obtained using the RSSI (Received Strength <b>Signal</b> <b>Indicator)</b> value, measuring the power of the received signal of the tag...|$|E
40|$|While modal {{identification}} is a mature subject, very few studies address {{the characterization of}} errors associated with components of a mode shape. This is particularly important in test/analysis correlation procedures, where the Modal Assurance Criterion is used to pair modes and to localize at which sensors discrepancies occur. Poor correlation is usually attributed to modeling errors, but clearly identification errors also occur. In particular with 3 D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement, many transfer functions are measured. As a result individual validation of each measurement cannot be performed manually in a reasonable time frame and a notable fraction of measurements {{is expected to be}} fairly noisy leading to poor identification of the associated mode shape components. The paper first addresses measurements and introduces multiple criteria. The error measures the difference between test and synthesized transfer functions around each resonance and can be used to localize poorly identified modal components. For intermediate error values, diagnostic of the origin of the error is needed. The level evaluates the transfer function amplitude in the vicinity of a given mode and can be used to eliminate sensors with low responses. A Noise Over <b>Signal</b> <b>indicator,</b> product of error and level, is then shown to be relevant to detect poorly excited modes and errors due to modal property shifts between test batches. Finally, a contribution is introduced to evaluate the visibility of a mode in each transfer. Using tests on a drum brake component, these indicators are shown to provide relevant insight into the quality of measurements. In a second part, test/analysis correlation is addressed with a focus on the localization of sources of poor mode shape correlation. The MACCo algorithm, which sorts sensors by the impact of their removal on a MAC computation, is shown to be particularly relevant. Combined with the error it avoids keeping erroneous modal components. Applied after removal of poor modal components, it provides spatial maps of poor correlation, which help localizing mode shape correlation errors and thus prepare the selection of model changes in updating procedures...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} can be broadly {{divided into}} two independent parts. The first three chapters analyse issues related to temporal and contemporaneous aggregation of econometric models. The fourth chapter contains an application of Bayesian techniques to investigate whether the post transition fiscal policy of Poland is sustainable {{in the long run}} and consistent with an intertemporal budget constraint. Chapter 1 surveys the econometric methodology of temporal aggregation {{for a wide range of}} univariate and multivariate time series models. A unified overview of temporal aggregation techniques for this broad class of processes is presented in the first part of the chapter and the main results are summarized. In each case, assuming to know the underlying process at the disaggregate frequency, the aim is to find the appropriate model for the aggregated data. Additional topics concerning temporal aggregation of ARIMA-GARCH models (see Drost and Nijman, 1993) are discussed and several examples presented. Systematic sampling schemes are also reviewed. Multivariate models, which show interesting features under temporal aggregation (Breitung and Swanson, 2002, Marcellino, 1999, Hafner, 2008), are examined in the second part of the chapter. In particular, the focus is on temporal aggregation of VARMA models and on the related concept of spurious instantaneous causality, which is not a time series property invariant to temporal aggregation. On the other hand, as pointed out by Marcellino (1999), other important time series features as cointegration and presence of unit roots are invariant to temporal aggregation and are not induced by it. Some empirical applications based on macroeconomic and financial data illustrate all the techniques surveyed and the main results. Chapter 2 is an attempt to monitor fiscal variables in the Euro area, building an early warning <b>signal</b> <b>indicator</b> for assessing the development of public finances in the short-run and exploiting the existence of monthly budgetary statistics from France, taken as "example country". The application is conducted focusing on the cash State deficit, looking at components from the revenue and expenditure sides. For each component, monthly ARIMA models are estimated and then temporally aggregated to the annual frequency, as the policy makers are interested in yearly predictions. The short-run forecasting exercises carried out for years 2002, 2003 and 2004 highlight the fact that the one-step-ahead predictions based on the temporally aggregated models generally outperform those delivered by standard monthly ARIMA modeling, as well as the official forecasts made available by the French government, for each of the eleven components and thus for the whole State deficit. More importantly, by the middle of the year, very accurate predictions for the current year are made available. The proposed method could be extremely useful, providing policy makers with a valuable indicator when assessing the development of public finances in the short-run (one year horizon or even less). Chapter 3 deals with the issue of forecasting contemporaneous time series aggregates. The performance of "aggregate" and "disaggregate" predictors in forecasting contemporaneously aggregated vector ARMA (VARMA) processes is compared. An aggregate predictor is built by forecasting directly the aggregate process, as it results from contemporaneous aggregation of the data generating vector process. A disaggregate predictor is a predictor obtained from aggregation of univariate forecasts for the individual components of the data generating vector process. The econometric framework is broadly based on Lütkepohl (1987). The necessary and sufficient condition for the equality of mean squared errors associated with the two competing methods in the bivariate VMA(1) case is provided. It is argued that the condition of equality of predictors as stated in Lütkepohl (1987), although necessary and sufficient for the equality of the predictors, is sufficient (but not necessary) for the equality of mean squared errors. Furthermore, it is shown that the same forecasting accuracy for the two predictors can be achieved using specific assumptions on the parameters of the VMA(1) structure. Finally, an empirical application that involves the problem of forecasting the Italian monetary aggregate M 1 on the basis of annual time series ranging from 1948 until 1998, prior to the creation of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), is presented to show the relevance of the topic. In the empirical application, the framework is further generalized to deal with heteroskedastic and cross-correlated innovations. Chapter 4 deals with a cointegration analysis applied to the empirical investigation of fiscal sustainability. The focus is on a particular country: Poland. The choice of Poland is not random. First, the motivation stems from the fact that fiscal sustainability is a central topic for most of the economies of Eastern Europe. Second, this is one of the first countries to start the transition process to a market economy (since 1989), providing a relatively favorable institutional setting within which to study fiscal sustainability (see Green, Holmes and Kowalski, 2001). The emphasis is on the feasibility of a permanent deficit in the long-run, meaning whether a government can continue to operate under its current fiscal policy indefinitely. The empirical analysis to examine debt stabilization is made up by two steps. First, a Bayesian methodology is applied to conduct inference about the cointegrating relationship between budget revenues and (inclusive of interest) expenditures and to select the cointegrating rank. This task is complicated by the conceptual difficulty linked to the choice of the prior distributions for the parameters relevant to the economic problem under study (Villani, 2005). Second, Bayesian inference is applied to the estimation of the normalized cointegrating vector between budget revenues and expenditures. With a single cointegrating equation, some known results concerning the posterior density of the cointegrating vector may be used (see Bauwens, Lubrano and Richard, 1999). The priors used in the paper leads to straightforward posterior calculations which can be easily performed. Moreover, the posterior analysis leads to a careful assessment of the magnitude of the cointegrating vector. Finally, it is shown to what extent the likelihood of the data is important in revising the available prior information, relying on numerical integration techniques based on deterministic methods.
