40|$|Lane {{departure}} warning (LDW) is {{a driver}} warning system designed {{to reduce the number}} of unintended lane departures. We addressed warning effectiveness and customer acceptance when the unintended lane departures are the result of drowsy driving. Thirty-two adults who were sleep deprived for 23 hours participated in the study and drove Ford's VIRTTEX driving simulator. Four Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for LDW were evaluated: Steering Wheel Torque, Rumble Strip Sound, <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Vibration</b> and Head Up Display. A yaw deviation technique was used to produce controlled lane departures in the first two hours of the drive while for the last 20 minutes driver-initiated lane departures were analyzed. The <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Vibration</b> HMI, accompanied by Steering Wheel Torque, was found to be the most effective HMI for LDW in a group of drowsy drivers, with faster reaction times and smaller lane excursions.

The test stimuli were sinusoidal vibrations at 22 third octave band centre frequencies in the range from 3 to 400 Hz, with acceleration amplitudes in the range from 0. 04 to 27 m/s(2) r. m. s. Multivariate regression procedures were applied to the experimentally acquired data in order to establish a regression model expressing the Borg CR 10 perceived intensity values {{as a function of the}} two independent parameters of the frequency and amplitude of vibration. The equal sensation curves suggested a non-linear dependency of the subjective perceived intensity on both frequency and amplitude. Females were found to provide higher Borg CR 10 perceived intensity values than males (p < 0. 05), particularly at the higher intensity levels above approximately 1. 0 m/s(2) r. m. s and at the higher frequencies above approximately 20 Hz.

Another {{objective is}} to assess the possible benefits of using multimodal information by combining auditory warning with simple <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>vibration</b> or motor priming. BACKGROUND: Within the context of active safety devices, the experiment dealt with moderately intrusive driving assistance devices that intervene when {{a certain level of}} risk in terms of lane departure is reached. METHOD: An analysis of the steering behavior of 20 participants following episodes of visual occlusion was carried out. Five warning and motor priming devices were compared. RESULTS: All tested devices improved the drivers' steering performance, although their effects were modulated by the drivers' risk assessment.

A combination of time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency wavelet-based analysis were used. Both the continuous wavelet transform and the discrete orthogonal wavelet transform were applied to the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> acceleration time histories in order to analyse the statistical variation in terms of both instantaneous variations, and the cycle-to-cycle variations which occur across complete thermodynamic engine cycles. The combination of orthogonal wavelet transform and time-varying auto-covariance analysis, performed across a complete engine thermodynamic cycle, was identified as the most sensitive method for describing the statistical variation in diesel idle vibration. The second-order engine harmonic H 2 was found to account for most of the vibrational energy at the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> when at idle. Amplitude modulation of the second-order engine harmonic H 2 by the half-order engine harmonic H 112 has been identified as the main characteristic of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> signature of automobiles at idle.

This system assists the steering effort of the driver using an electric motor and a gear force reduction. In a previous study, an EPS control method was proposed that used the driver&# 39;s steering input torque and vehicle velocity. In addition, many papers have introduced estimation and control methods for the EPS motor&# 39;s angular velocity or angular torque to reduce the sense difference for the HPS. Therefore, this paper proposes an advanced control strategy for EPS that uses the lateral force of the front wheels. In addition, we experimented with this proposed control algorithm using a simulation and confirmed that it reduced the assist torque and saved motor power. Although it is difficult to obtain the lateral wheel force of the tires for the proposed method, it is able to reduce the torque ripple of the EPS actuator, as well as troublesome problems with <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>vibration.</b> Moreover, this EPS control strategy can improve a vehicle&# 39;s dynamic stability...|$|E
40|$|The human {{perception}} of rotational hand-arm vibration {{has been investigated}} {{by means of a}} test rig consisting of a rigid frame, an electrodynamic shaker unit, a rigid <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> a shaft assembly, bearings and an automobile seat. Fifteen subjects were tested while seated in a driving posture. Four equal sensation tests and one annoyance threshold test were performed using sinusoidal excitation at 18 frequencies in the range from 3 to 315 Hz. In order to guarantee the generality of the equal sensation data the four tests were defined to permit checks of the possible influence of three factors: reference signal amplitude, psychophysical test procedure and temporary threshold shift (TTSv) caused by the test exposure. All equal sens ation tests used a reference sinusoid of 63 Hz at either 1. 0 or 1. 5 m/s 2 r. m. s. in amplitude. The four equal sensation curves were similar in shape and suggested a decrease in human sensitivity to hand-arm rotational vibration with increasing frequency. The slopes of the equal sensation curves changed at transition points of approximately 6. 3 and 63 Hz. A frequency weighting, called Ws, was developed for the purpose of evaluating <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rotational <b>vibration.</b> The proposed Ws has a slope of 0 dB per octave over the frequency range from 3 to 6. 3 Hz, a slope of - 6 dB per octave from 6. 3 to 50 Hz, a slope of 0 dB per octave from 50 to 160 Hz and a slope of - 10 dB per octave from 160 to 315 Hz. Ws provides a possible alternative to the existing Wh frequency weighting defined in International Standards Organisation 5349 - 1 (2001) and British Standards Institution 6842 (1987) ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{practice}} of analytical and test methods {{related to the}} analysis, testing and improvement of vehicle vibrations is overviewed. The methods are illustrated on the determination and improvement of powertrain induced <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>vibration</b> of a heavy commercial truck. More specifically, the transmissibility of powertrain idle vibration to cabin is investigated with respect to powertrain rigid body modes and modal alignment of the steering column/wheel system is considered. It is found out that roll mode of the powertrain is not separated from idle excitation for effective vibration isolation as well as steering wheel column mode {{is close to the}} 3 rd engine excitation frequency order, which results in high vibration levels. Powertrain roll mode is optimized by tuning the powertrain mount stiffness to improve the performance. Steering column mode is also separated from the 3 rd engine excitation frequency by the application of a mass absorber. It is concluded that the use of analytical and test methods to address the complex relation between design parameters and powertrain idle response is effective to optimize the system performance and evaluate the trade-offs in the vehicle design such as vibration performance and weight.

40|$|Laboratory-based {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effect of the}} frequency and scale of transient vibration events on the human detection of road surface type by means of <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>vibration.</b> The study used steering wheel tangential direction acceleration time histories which had been measured in a mid-sized European automobile that was driven over three different types of road surface. The steering acceleration stimuli were manipulated by means of the mildly non-stationary mission synthesis (MNMS) algorithm in order to produce test stimuli which were selectively modified in terms of the number, and size, of transient vibration events they contained. Fifteen test participants were exposed to both unmanipulated and manipulated steering wheel rotational vibration stimuli, and were asked to indicate, by either “yes or no”, whether the test stimuli was from a target road surface which was displayed on a board. The findings suggested that transient vibration events {{play a key role in}} the human detection of road surface type in driving situations. Improvements of up to 20 percentage points in the rate of correct detection were achieved by means of selective manipulation of the steering vibration stimuli. The results also suggested, however, that no single setting of the MNMS algorithm proved optimal for all three road surface types that were investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the human subjective response to <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>vibration</b> of the type caused by a 4 -cylinder diesel engine idle in passenger cars. Vibrotactile perception was assessed using sinusoidal amplitude modulated vibratory stimuli of constant energy level (0. 41 r. m. s. m/s 2) having a carrier frequency of 26 Hz (i. e. engine firing frequency) and modulation frequency of 6. 5 Hz (half engine order). Evaluations of seven levels of modulation depth parameter m (0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0) were performed in order to define the growth function of human perceived disturbance {{as a function of}} amplitude modulation depth. Two semantic descriptors were used (unpleasantness and roughness) and two test methods (Thurstone paired comparison and Borg CR- 10 direct evaluation scale) for a total of four tests. Each test was performed using an independent group of 25 individuals. The results suggest that there is a critical value of modulation depth m = 0. 2 below which human subjects do not perceive differences in amplitude modulation and above which the stimulus-response relationship increases monotonically with a power function. Stevens ’ power exponents suggest that the perceived unpleasantness is nonlinearly dependent on modulation depth m with an exponent greater than 1 and that the perceived roughness is dependent with an exponent close to unity...|$|E
