5000|$|Contamination control {{products}} {{have been used}} by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the commercial nuclear industry for decades to minimize contamination on radioactive equipment and surfaces and fix contamination in place. “Contamination control products” is a broad term that includes fixatives, <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings,</b> and decontamination gels. A fixative product functions as a permanent coating to stabilize residual loose/transferable radioactive contamination by fixing it in place; this aids in preventing the spread of contamination and reduces the possibility of the contamination becoming airborne, reducing workforce exposure and facilitating future deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) activities. Strippable coating products are loosely adhered paint-like films and are used for their decontamination abilities. They are applied to surfaces with loose/transferable radioactive contamination and then, once dried, are peeled off, which removes the loose/transferable contamination along with the product. The residual radioactive contamination on the surface is significantly reduced once the strippable coating is removed. Modern <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> show high decontamination efficiency and can rival traditional mechanical and chemical decontamination methods. Decontamination gels work {{in much the same way}} as other <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings.</b> The results obtained through the use of contamination control products is variable and depends on the type of substrate, the selected contamination control product, the contaminants, and the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/library/Contamination%20Control%20Fixatives%20List.pdf ...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> is an innovative technology for decontamination of nuclear plants and for any decontamination project aiming at removing surface contamination. An adhesive plastic coating is applied on the contaminated surface. The strippable coating {{is allowed to}} cure for up to 24 h, after which it can be easily peeled. The coating traps the contaminants in the polymer matrix. <b>Strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> are non-toxic and do not contain volatile compounds or heavy metals. Since the coating constitutes a solid waste, disposal is easier than treating contaminated liquid wastes, produced by the baseline technology: steam vacuum cleaning, based upon superheated pressurized water in order to remove contaminants from floors and walls. A life cycle assessment (LCA) {{has been carried out}} with the purpose of comparing the strippable coating with the steam vacuum technology. The functional unit of the study is represented by a surface of 1 m(2) to be decontaminated. The results of LCA achieved using Sima Pro 5. 0 (A (R)) software confirm the good environmental performances of <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings.</b> Taking into account both LCA and environmental costs for liquid wastes, the advantages of <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> will be more and more evident...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} for water-based <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> for surface decontamination is reported. The novelty of this work consists {{in the development of}} a new method of removing heavy metals from contaminated surfaces by using polyvinyl alcohol <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> containing bentonite clay. Viscosity measurements, evaporation rate tests, thermal analyses, FT-IR and tensile tests were performed for the optimization of the decontamination solution composition. For the decontamination experiments, copper surfaces were contaminated with mercury and, further, the decontamination water solutions containing polyvinyl alcohol, glycerol, EDTA and bentonite were applied onto these surfaces. After the removal of the polymer films, the copper coupons were subjected to SEM–EDX analysis, which revealed that introduction of bentonite in the polymer solution leads to a significant increase of the decontamination factor...|$|E

40|$|Strippable or {{temporary}} coatings {{were developed}} {{to assist in the}} decontamination of the Three Mile Island (TMI- 2) reactor. These coatings have become a viable option during the decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) of both US Department of Energy (DOE) and commercial nuclear facilities to remove or fix loose contamination on both vertical and horizontal surfaces. A variety of <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> are available to D and D professionals. However, these products exhibit a wide range of performance criteria and uses. The Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) at Florida International University (FIU) was commissioned to perform a 2 -year investigation into <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings.</b> This investigation was divided into four parts: (1) identification of commercially available strippable coating products; (2) survey of D and D professionals to determine current uses of these coatings and performance criteria; (3) design and implementation of a non-radiological testing program to evaluate the physical properties of these coatings; and (4) design and implementation of a radiological testing program to determine decontamination factors and effects of exposure to ionizing radiation.

40|$|Over {{the years}} mercury has been {{recognized}} as having serious impacts on {{human health and the}} environment. This recognition has led to numerous studies that deal with the properties of various mercury forms, the development of methods to quantify and speciate the forms, fate and transport, toxicology studies, and the development of site remediation and decontamination technologies. This report reviews several critical areas that will be used in developing technologies for cleaning mercury from mercury-contaminated surfaces of metals and porous materials found in many DOE facilities. The technologies used for decontamination of water and mixed wastes (solid) are specifically discussed. Many technologies that have recently appeared in the literature are included in the report. Current surface decontamination processes have been reviewed, and the limitations of these technologies for mercury decontamination are discussed. Based on the currently available technologies and the processes published recently in the literature, several processes, including <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings,</b> chemical cleaning with iodine/iodide lixiviant, chemisorbing surface wipes with forager sponge and grafted cotton, and surface/pore fixation through amalgamation or stabilization, have been identified as potential techniques for decontamination of mercury-contaminated metal and porous surfaces. Their potential merits and applicability are discussed. Finally, two processes, <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> and chemical cleaning with iodine/iodide lixiviant, were experimentally investigated in Phase II of this project...|$|E
40|$|Reconfiguration of the CMR Building and TA- 55 Plutonium Facility for mission {{requirements}} {{will require}} the disposal or recycle of 200 [...] 300 gloveboxes or open front hoods. These gloveboxes and open front hoods must be decontaminated to meet discharge limits for Low Level Waste. Gloveboxes and open front hoods at CMR have been painted. One of the deliverables on this project is to identify the best method for stripping the paint from large numbers of gloveboxes. Four methods being considered are the following: conventional paint stripping, dry ice pellets, <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings,</b> and high pressure water technology. The advantages of each technology will be discussed. Last, cost comparisons between the technologies will be presented...|$|E
40|$|<b>Strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> are polymer mixtures, such as {{water-based}} organic polymers, {{that are}} applied to a surface by paintbrush, roller, or spray applicator. As the polymer reacts, it attracts, absorbs, and chemically binds the contaminants; then, during the curing process, it mechanically locks the contaminants into the polymer matrix. Incorporating fiber reinforcement (such as a cotton scrim) into the coating may enhance the strength of these coatings. Once the coating dries, it can be stripped manually from the surface, In the case of auto-release coatings, the mixture cracks, flakes, and is collected by vacuuming. The surface properties of these coatings may be modified by applying a thin top coat (e. g., polyvinyl alcohol), which may provide a smoother, less permeable surface that would become less severely contaminated. In such a duplex, the thicker basis layer provides the required mechanical properties (e. g., strength and abrasion resistance), while the top layer provides protection from contamination. Once the strippable coating is removed, the loose surface contamination is removed with the coating, producing a dry, hard, non-airborne waste product. The use of <b>strippable</b> <b>coatings</b> during D&D operations has proved a viable option. These coatings {{can be used in}} the following three functions: As a protective coating, when applied to an uncontaminated surface in an area where contamination is present, so that on its removal the surface remains uncontaminated; As a decontamination agent, when applied to a contaminated surface, so that on its removal a significant decontamination of loose particulate activity is achieved; and As a fixative or tie-down coating, when applied to a contaminated surface, so that any loose contamination is tied down, thus preventing the spread of contamination during subsequent handling...|$|E
