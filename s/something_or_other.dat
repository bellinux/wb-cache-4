500|$|By 2012 Putnam {{accepted}} {{a modification of}} functionalism called [...] "liberal functionalism". The view holds that [...] "what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is the right sort of functional capacities and not the particular matter that subserves those capacities". The specification of these capacities (1) may refer to what goes on outside the organism's [...] "brain", (2) may include intentional idioms, and (3) need not describe a capacity to compute <b>something</b> <b>or</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
500|$|Sales {{were not}} as robust as hoped. In November 1928, Spargo wrote to Mint Director Grant, {{requesting}} {{information on how to}} return several thousand coins, and by 1934, a total of 11,892 pieces had been returned to the Mint for redemption and melting. Profits from the coin went to the Vermont Historical Trust, and were used to benefit museums and historical societies in the state, including the Bennington Museum. Swiatek and Breen, alluding to the scandals that embroiled other commemorative coins, noted that [...] "it is a testimony to <b>something</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> in Vermont that there was never the faintest breath of suspicion at any time about anything connected with the distribution of the coins." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cohesion}} of the track's lyrics {{with the}} video was commended by critics, with Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club noting that it allowed Beyoncé to [...] " [...] herself up in ways she's resisted before". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune who lauded the song as a [...] "soaring {{critique of the}} beauty industry", added that it was [...] "enhanced by its troubling video". Marc Hogan of Spin magazine commented that the visual expanded on {{the message of the}} song, and deemed it a [...] "powerful piece of work". Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger wrote in his review of the song that its [...] "brutal" [...] music video took the critique of perfection and physical beauty further than what the track did. [...] Brandon Sodeber of the magazine Vice called the visual the best on Beyoncé and opined that it was [...] "an incredibly affecting mini-melodrama that underlines to Beyoncé's painful awareness that being black and female means you're never enough of <b>something</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> for mainstream America". However, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the video sent mixed messages. Brent DiCrescenzo from Time Out complimented Keitel's appearance in the clip, but criticized the visual's message because he felt that it came from [...] "one of the most beautiful women in the world".|$|E

2500|$|In May 1990 The Someloves issued {{their debut}} album, <b>Something</b> <b>or</b> <b>Other,</b> which was {{produced}} by Mariani and Mather with Mitch Easter and John Villani. The album appeared on the ARIA Albums Chart Top100 and provided a single, [...] "Melt" [...] (April 1990), and an EP, Sunshine's Glove (August). McFarlane felt <b>Something</b> <b>or</b> <b>Other</b> was [...] "full of shimmering power pop melodies and glittering guitar sounds". The album and the band won West Australian Music Industry Awards that year. Various personal issues and problems {{with the idea of}} touring led to the group disbanding {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
2500|$|According to Mircea Braga, one of {{his last}} {{interviews}} shows that, while still criticized for [...] "aestheticism", Baconsky merged his lyricism with an interest in social matters. The statement reads: [...] "The writer is not a politician in the common and consecrated sense of the word. He does however have the role of a spiritual ferment [...] He must not allow people to acquire cerebral obesity. He is always dissatisfied with <b>something</b> <b>or</b> <b>other,</b> his position is that of a permanent antithesis with the surrounding reality." [...] Braga believes Baconsky's moral [...] "rigor" [...] to bear a [...] "Transylvanian sign", and to have been ultimately inspired by the philosophy of Lucian Blaga. The related anti-capitalist vision is questioned by Cernat. The critic indicates that, although sincere in its patriotism, it was also [...] "compatible" [...] with the mixture of communism and nationalism introduced by the Ceauşescu regime (see National communism), and thus similar with the philosophical discourse of Constantin Noica.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{never fully}} {{recovered}} from his failed relationship with Regine. [...] For {{a time in}} between their break-up and her marriage to Schlegel, they had polite and civil contact during daily walks and in church. [...] These were mostly non-verbal on Kierkegaard's part and caused him great anxiety. [...] It seems that he was attempting to utilize his complicated authorial method of indirect communication in his personal life, and his tormented approach caused him great distress. [...] When he absconded to Berlin in 1842 to study philosophy, he was haunted {{by a woman who}} bore an uncanny resemblance to Regine. Even while immersing himself in his studies, Regine was always on his mind: [...] "Not even here in Berlin has my, alas, all-too-inventive brain been able to refrain from scheming <b>something</b> <b>or</b> <b>other.</b> She must either love me or hate me, she knows no third possibility. Nor is there anything more harmful to a young girl than half-way situations." [...] It was during this time that Kierkegaard was formulating his own philosophy, as well as his first book, Either/Or.|$|E
