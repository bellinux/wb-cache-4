The model coefficients were derived from the combined analysis of three well correlated sets of data, thus giving a good indication for their possible general applicability. The analysis of experimental data also gave a relationship between SS and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

50|$|In a {{horizontal}} <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tank,</b> some particles may {{not follow the}} diagonal line in Fig. 1, while settling faster as they grow. So this says that particles can grow and develop a higher settling velocity if a greater depth with longer retention time. However, the collision chance would be even greater if the same retention time were spread over a longer, shallower tank. In fact, {{in order to avoid}} hydraulic short-circuiting, tanks usually are made 3-6 m deep with retention times of a few hours.|$|E
50|$|The {{settling}} velocity, {{defined as}} the residence time taken for the particles to settle in the tank, enables the calculation of tank volume. Precise design and operation of a <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tank</b> is of high importance {{in order to keep}} the amount of sediment entering the diversion system to a minimum threshold by maintaining the transport system and stream stability to remove the sediment diverted from the system. This is achieved by reducing stream velocity as low as possible for the longest period of time possible. This is feasible by widening the approach channel and lowering its floor to reduce flow velocity thus allowing sediment to settle out of suspension due to gravity. The settling behavior of heavier particulates is also affected by the turbulence.|$|E
5000|$|The driving density {{difference}} between fluids that produces intrusion motion could simply {{be due to}} chemical composition. However variations can also be caused by differences in respective fluid temperatures, dissolved matter concentrations and by particulate matter suspended in flows.Examples of particulate suspension intrusions include sediment laden river outflows within oceans, â€˜short-circuitâ€™ sewage <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tank</b> intrusions [...] and turbidity current flows over hypersaline Mediterranean pools. Examples also exist of particulate intrusions caused by the lateral spread of thermals or plumes along planes of neutral buoyancy; such as intrusions containing metalliferous sediments formed from deep ocean hydrothermal vents. Or equally crystal laden intrusions formed by plumes within volcanic magma chambers. Arguably the most striking of all gravitational intrusions, is the atmospheric gravity current generated from a large, â€˜Plineanâ€™ volcanic eruption. In which case the volcanoâ€™s overhanging â€˜umbrellaâ€™ {{is an example of}} an intrusion laterally intruding into the stratified Troposphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} sewage sludge {{produced}} from the activated sludge process is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} wastewater treated. The total sludge production consists of the sum of primary sludge from the primary <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tanks</b> as well as waste activated sludge from the bioreactors. The activated sludge process produces about 70â€“100kg/ML of waste activated sludge (that is kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3). A value of 80kg/ML is regarded as being typical. In addition, about 110â€“170kg/ML of primary sludge is produced in the primary <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tanks</b> which most - but not all - of the activated sludge process configurations use.|$|R
40|$|The Beaudesert Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), {{originally}} {{built in}} 1966 and augmented in 1977, {{is a typical}} biological trickling filter sewage treatment plant comprising primary <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tanks,</b> trickling filters and humus tanks. The plant, despite not originally being designed for nitrogen removal, has been consistently achieving over 60 % total nitrogen (TN) reduction and low effluent ammonium concentration of less than 5 mg NH 3 -N/L. Through the return of a nitrate-rich stream from the humus tanks to the primary <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tanks</b> and maintaining an adequate sludge age within the primary <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tanks,</b> the current plant is achieving a substantial degree of denitrification. Further enhanced denitrification has been achieved by raising the recycle flows and maintaining an adequate SRT. This paper describes the approach to operating a trickling filter plant to achieve nitrification and denitrification to a high level. The effectiveness {{of this approach is}} demonstrated through pilot plant trials and analysis of their corresponding results. These results show a significant improvement in nitrogen removal capability whilst maximising the asset life of existing infrastructure. This shows great potential as a retrofit option for small and rural communities with pre-existing trickling filters that require improvements in terms of nitrogen removal.

40|$|Sedimentation is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} in structural best management practices to remove pollutants from stormwater. However, concerns have been expressed about the environmental impacts that may be exerted by the trapped pollutants. This study has concentrated on stormwater ponds and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tanks</b> and reports on the accumulated metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and the associated toxicity to the bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The metal concentrations are compared with guidelines and the toxicity results are assessed in relation to samples for which metal concentrations either exceed or conform to these values. The water phase metal concentrations were highest in the ponds whereas the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tanks</b> exhibited a distinct decrease towards the outlet. However, none of the water samples demonstrated toxicity even though the concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn exceeded the threshold values for the compared guidelines. The facilities with higher traffic intensities had elevated sediment concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn which increased towards the outlet for the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tanks</b> {{in agreement with the}} highest percentage of fine particles. The sediments in both treatment facilities exhibited the expected toxic responses in line with their affinity for heavy metals but the role of organic carbon content is highlighted...|$|R
50|$|The {{removal of}} {{pollutants}} from the waste water stream involves both absorption and adsorption of organic compounds and some inorganic species such as nitrite and nitrate ions by the layer of microbial bio film. The filter media is typically chosen to provide a very high surface area to volume. Typical materials are often porous and have considerable internal surface area {{in addition to the}} external surface of the medium. Passage of the waste water over the media provides dissolved oxygen which the bio-film layer requires for the biochemical oxidation of the organic compounds and releases carbon dioxide gas, water and other oxidized end products. As the bio film layer thickens, it eventually sloughs off into the liquid flow and subsequently forms part of the secondary sludge. Typically, a trickling filter is followed by a clarifier or <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tank</b> for the separation and removal of the sloughed film. Other filters utilizing higher-density media such as sand, foam and peat moss do not produce a sludge that must be removed, but require forced air blowers and backwashing or an enclosed anaerobic environment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{anaerobic}} reactor {{was packed}} with semi-soft media, which were constructed by plastic ring and synthetic fiber string. The anoxic reactor is a completely mixed reactor while the oxic reactor is a hybrid bioreactor in which polyurethane foam carriers were added. Water from anoxic reactor, odic reactor and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tank</b> were used and had mix-ins of different amount of old and developed microbes with [...]75 concentration and 28 degree Celsius. The rate of contaminant degradation depended {{on the amount of}} microbe concentration. In the enhanced microbial community indigenous microorganisms broke down the contaminants in the coke plant wastewater, such as pyridines, and phenolic compounds. When indigenous heterotrophic microorganisms were added, they converted many large molecular compounds into smaller and simpler compounds, which could be taken from more biodegradable organic compounds. This proves that bioaugmentation {{could be used as a}} tool for the removal of unwanted compounds that are not properly removed by conventional biological treatment system. When bioaugmentation is combined with A1-A2-O system for the treatment of coke plant wastewater it is very powerful.|$|E
50|$|Particularly {{interesting}} are {{the remains}} of an aqueduct starting several kilometres away at the Baspinar spring in Denizli, and possibly having another more distant source. Unusually, to cross the valley {{to the south of}} Laodicea, instead of the usual open channel carried above the level of the city on lofty arches as was the usual practice of the Romans, an inverted siphon was employed consisting of a double pressurised pipeline, descending into the valley and back up to the city. The low arches supporting the siphon commence near the summit of a low hill to the south where the header tank was located, and thence continue to the first terminal distribution tank (castellum aquae) {{at the edge of the}} hill of the city, whose remains are visible to the east of the stadium and South Baths complex. The water was heavily charged with calcareous matter, as several of the arches are covered with a thick incrustation where leaks occurred at later times. The siphon consisted of large carved stone pipes; some of these also are much incrusted, and some completely choked up. The terminal tank has many clay pipes of various diameters for water distribution on the north, east and south sides which, because of the choking by sinter, were replaced in time. To the west of the terminal is a small fountain next to the vaulted gate. The aqueduct appears to have been destroyed by an earthquake, as the remaining arches lean bodily on one side, without being much broken. A second distribution terminal and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tank</b> is visible 400 m north of the first, to which it was connected via another siphon of travertine blocks, and this one is bigger and supplied most of the city.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, a more {{sophisticated}} system of treatment was employed. Treatment plants were built at Arnfield and Godley.
