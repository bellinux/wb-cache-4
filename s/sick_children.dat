Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia. Wade has been known for visiting other <b>sick</b> <b>children,</b> usually in private to avoid placing himself in the media spotlight.|$|E

40|$|Family centred care is {{promoted}} in children’s nursing as providing high quality care but internationally, research {{has in the}} main focused on mothers whilst fathers’ contribution to care remains relatively under explored. An ethnographic study revealed that fathers {{wanted to be with}} their <b>sick</b> <b>child</b> in hospital and made essential contributions to the whole family’s experience. Three aspects of the fathers role in caring for their <b>sick</b> <b>child</b> in hospital were identified which included: protecting, providing for the family and participating in care. Fathers want to be with and care for their <b>sick</b> <b>child</b> in hospital, yet they face challenges in doing so...|$|R
5|$|According to Fumić, {{the weaker}} and ill {{children}} were lodged with compassionate local peasants, but 350 {{of the strongest}} children were taken away by the fighters. According to Lukić, a total of 727 children were liberated from the camp, but at the first rest stop at Svetojanska, medical examinations by Davila identified about 400 weak and <b>sick</b> <b>children</b> who could no longer walk, and they were returned to Jastrebarsko. Davila estimates {{the number of children}} actually liberated from the camp at around 400.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the figures}} {{involved}} with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the Hospital for <b>Sick</b> <b>Children,</b> Edinburgh (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding. The most significant exponent was Dundee-born John Duncan (1866–1945), who was also influenced by Italian Renaissance art and French Symbolism. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects Tristan and Iseult (1912) and St Bride (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950). Duncan was {{a major contributor to}} Geddes' magazine The Evergreen. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced Robert Burns (1860–1941), E. A. Hornel (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).|$|E
5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not been set aside and no food had been prepared. The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and <b>sick</b> <b>children</b> were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had no electricity or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E

5|$|Barrett {{is married}} to Stephanie and they have two children, Grace and Andrew (born November 2007). His cousin, Scott Fletcher, also played for the Cubs, {{along with many other}} teams over his fifteen-year career. Barrett has spent a {{considerable}} portion of his personal life devoted to helping children. He runs several youth baseball programs, including one in Hawaii, which was inspired from his tenure with the Hawaiian Winter Baseball League. He also works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Cubs Care Program to help lesser fortunate and <b>sick</b> <b>children.</b> More recently, he has worked with Kerry Wood and Ryan Dempster to raise money to help Derrek Lee's daughter and research for Leber's congenital amaurosis. Michael Barrett donated $50,000 to Project 3000 and pledged an additional sum of money for every home run he hits. Barrett was also a regular guest on FOX Chicago's The Final Word television show, which is co hosted by Tom Waddle, a former Chicago Bears wide receiver.|$|E
5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to <b>sick</b> <b>children</b> being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included {{a number of significant}} figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a Celtic Revival, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the Hospital for <b>Sick</b> <b>Children,</b> Edinburgh (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the present}} {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} leukaemia are very exciting the results come at a cost to both the patient and their family. This article documents the impact of treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia on the schooling experience {{from the perspective of the}} parent, the <b>sick</b> <b>child</b> and their well siblings. The findings indicate that there are many concerns for the patient related to both absenteeism and reintegration to schooling. Although schooling provides a stabilising force in the life of the well siblings, there are also major problems associated with the absence of the parent in the educational life of the child. Suggestions for addressing these issues are made which include maintaining the connection with the <b>sick</b> <b>child</b> during hospitalisation, welcoming the <b>sick</b> <b>child</b> back at the point of reintegration, being sensitive to the <b>sick</b> <b>child's</b> need to be seen as normal and providing emotional and practical support to well siblings during the treatment experience...|$|R

5|$|Upon her {{graduation}} {{at the end}} of 1902, Mayo took up {{a position}} as a resident medical officer at the Adelaide Hospital. In February 1904, she left for England to gain practical experience. There she worked as a clinical clerk at the Hospital for <b>Sick</b> <b>Children</b> in Great Ormond Street, London. To gain experience in midwifery, she went to Coombe Women's Hospital in Dublin, and after returning to London to complete a course in tropical medicine, she travelled to India where she worked for a year as a midwife in a Cambridge Mission to Delhi hospital for women and children. In 1906, Mayo returned to Adelaide and started a private practice in premises owned by her father on Morphett Street, next to the family home. With spare time on her hands, she began laboratory work at the Adelaide Hospital and took up an appointment as honorary anaesthetist at the Adelaide Children's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd of}} people {{assembled}} below the balcony generally consisted of soldiers, merchants, craft persons, peasants, and women and <b>sick</b> <b>children.</b> As the balcony was set high, the king would stand on a platform so that people gathered below could reassure themselves that he was alive and that the empire was stable; even when the sovereign was ill. He {{felt that it was}} necessary to see them publicly {{at least once a day}} in order to maintain his control, and guard against immediate anarchy. It also had a symbolic purpose. During this time people might make personal requests directly to Akbar, or present him with petitions for some cause. Akbar, therefore, began appearing at the jharokha twice a day and would hear the complaints of the people who wished to speak to him. Sometimes, while the emperor gave his Jharokha Darshan, he would let out a thread down the jharokha so that people could tie their complaints and petitions seeking his attention and justice. It was an effective way of communication and information exchange process, which Badauni, a contemporary of Akbar noted Jharokha Darshan worked effectively under Akbar who spent about four and half hours regularly in such darshan. Akbar's paintings giving Jharokha Darshan are also popular.|$|E
