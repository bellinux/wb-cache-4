5|$|Hamurabi is a text-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} {{of land and}} resource management first developed by Doug Dyment in 1968. It was developed by Dyment at Digital Equipment Corporation as The Sumer Game before {{the rise of the}} commercial video game industry in the early history of video games as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. The Sumer Game was possibly inspired by the 1966 The Sumerian Game, a much more in-depth text-based economic simulation intended for children.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} {{the cost of}} psychotropic drugs {{and its impact on}} the Brazilian family budget in 2003 and 2009 comparatively. MethodsThis study had a cross-sectional design. Data were obtained from the Family Budget Surveys conducted in 2003 and 2009, including interviews in 48, 470 and 55, 970 homes of all Brazilian regions, respectively. The main measures are prevalence of psychotropic drug acquisition, monetary and nonmonetary expenses with psychotropic drugs, total <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> drugs, <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> health, total household spending, and estimated mean monthly household income. All incomes and expenses from the 2003 survey were adjusted by inflation. ResultsThere was a reduction in the prevalence of psychotropic drug acquisition by Brazilian households from 13. 0 % in 2003 to 11. 2 % in 2009. The mean monthly household <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs, however, rose from R $ 54. 38 in 2003 to R $ 78. 73 in 2009. The percentage of <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs from the expenses with health increased 27 %. ConclusionsThe increase in <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs can be due to a rise in their prices, the acquisition of more modern or more expensive drugs, or the increase in the number of drugs used.

5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their money to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number}} of text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|Hamurabi in {{particular}} is mostly known for its appearance in Ahl's book.

Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in 101 BASIC Computer Games as Hamurabi, and later versions of the game, even in FOCAL, referenced the new title over the old. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E
40|$|As {{state and}} local governments have devoted a rising share of their {{resources}} to crime-related programmes, concerns have arisen that <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> other programmes such as education will fall. Coupled with growing public concerns over performance of the public education system, and expectations that prison populations will rise as states pass and enforce more stringent sentencing laws, {{it is not surprising that}} some view the expansion of crime-related programmes as troublesome. One hypothesis is that education and crime-related programmes directly compete for government expenditures so that what one programme gains the other must lose as in a fixed-pie situation. A competing hypothesis is that <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> these two public programmes are unrelated and therefore higher crime-related spending may also lead to higher taxes or public debt issuance, or to reduction in <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> programmes other than education.

5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous series. Housemates were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the housemates took part in a compulsory task that determined the amount of money they were allocated to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> their shopping; if they passed, they received a luxury budget and they were allocated a basic budget if they failed. Housemates were instructed to nominate two fellow housemates for eviction each week. This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room and housemates were not allowed to discuss the nomination process or influence the nominations of others. On Day 68, Big Brother changed the rules to allow housemates to discuss nominations until further notice. The two or more housemates who gathered the most nominations per week faced a public vote and the housemate receiving the most votes was evicted from the House on the Friday and interviewed by Davina McCall. Housemates could voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who broke the rules could have been ejected by Big Brother.|$|E
