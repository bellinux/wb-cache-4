25|$|In the {{old days}} I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark {{him as a man}} of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a <b>second</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E

500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, I felt like I was making a movie. The <b>second</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> felt like I was making a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E
500|$|After {{trying out}} with the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Koufax did {{the same for the}} Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. During his Pirates tryout, Koufax's fastball broke the thumb of Sam Narron, the team's bullpen coach. Branch Rickey, then the general manager of the Pirates, told his scout Clyde Sukeforth that Koufax had the [...] "greatest arm [...] ever seen". The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a {{contract}} until after he was already committed to the Dodgers. Dodgers scout Al Campanis heard about Koufax from a local sporting goods store owner. After seeing Koufax pitch for Lafayette, Campanis invited him to an Ebbets Field tryout. With Dodgers manager Walter Alston and scouting director Fresco Thompson watching, Campanis assumed the hitter's stance while Koufax started throwing. Campanis later said, [...] "There are two times in my life the hair on my arms has stood up: The first time I saw the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the <b>second</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> saw Sandy Koufax throw a fastball." [...] The Dodgers signed Koufax for a $6,000 ($ today) salary, with a $14,000 ($ today) signing bonus. Koufax planned to use the money as tuition to finish his university education, if his baseball career failed.|$|E

On the first occasion, I poked her in the eye by accident. I actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I’d have fallen in. I just took a playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> gave her a shiner. I threw a bunch of keys which whacked her in the eye.

2500|$|... 1UP.com's Steve Watts {{compared}} Cave Johnson to the industrialist Howard Hughes. A {{writer for}} Edge {{wrote that the}} [...] "surprise star turn" [...] was J.K. Simmons as Cave Johnson. The editor described him as a [...] "gruff and acid alpha male who set up Aperture, who performs with real brio and bite" [...] and that while {{it would be hard}} to quote him, his lines were [...] "perfectly pitched, and funny to the bone". PALGN's Adam Ghiggino wrote that the dialogue of Portal 2 was funny and cited Simmons as an example. GamesRadar's Tyler Wilde called Cave [...] "bombastic" [...] and praised Simmons for [...] "perfectly" [...] portraying him. GameSpy's Will Tuttle wrote that it is [...] "hard not to feel oddly honored to take part in some of the experiments that ranged across his entire career". He also wrote of Simmons that his voice [...] "adeptly blend gravitas and silliness, and I found his segment to be just as great the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> played through the game". GamePros Will Herring wrote that Valve should be [...] "commended" [...] for the introduction of the character. Official Xbox Magazines Jon Hicks described Cave as a [...] "cigar-chewing, damn-the-expense-and-particularly-the-health-restrictions" [...] type.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the hours}} {{following}} the race, conspiracy theories emerged {{on social media}} around the circumstances concerning what happened when Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton on lap 29. They suggested the incident {{was an act of}} revenge for the collision between the German driver and Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks prior. Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart felt the move was [...] "a bit too easy" [...] and appeared to indicate the error was done on purpose: [...] "I thought [...] could have least made an effort to get round the corner. I first thought 'that's wise', because he knew it wasn't a difficult thing to believe; the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> thought: 'Hello, what's going on here?'" [...] Wolff denied the allegations that the mistake was deliberate, suggesting Rosberg was under pressure because of the Drivers' Championship battle but admitted it was not common for Rosberg to perform the same error twice: [...] "Only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea." [...] Rosberg responded by stating Hamilton's fast pace prompted him to push hard and that while he could have successfully executed the corner, there was a large probability of flat-spotting one of his tyres and driving onto the run-off area was the safer choice. He stated he had heard about the theory but that there was [...] "no possible reason" [...] for him to purposely run off the track. Television pictures apparently showed Wolff smiling after moments after Rosberg's error with the team principal asserting that the broadcast was not live and stated the transmission of pit-to-car radio about Hamilton reducing his pace to conserve tyre life for a late race attack did not indicate the whole perception.|$|E
