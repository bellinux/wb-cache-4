5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|The sensory ganglia are {{directly}} correspondent to {{dorsal root ganglia}} of <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> and are known as cranial sensory ganglia. Sensory ganglia exist for nerves with sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X. There are also parasympathetic ganglia, which {{are part of the}} autonomic nervous system for cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5000|$|Cervical <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 1, a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the {{cervical}} segment ...|$|R
5000|$|The dorsal ramus of <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> (or {{posterior}} ramus of <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve,</b> or posterior primary division) is {{the posterior}} division of a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve.</b> The dorsal ramus (Latin for branch, plural rami [...] ) is the dorsal {{branch of a}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> that forms from the dorsal root of the nerve after it emerges from the spinal cord. The <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> is formed from the dorsal and ventral rami. The dorsal ramus carries information that supplies muscles and sensation to the human back.|$|R
50|$|The {{cervical}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 2 (C2) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the cervical segment.|$|R
5|$|The pudendal nerve is paired, meaning {{there are}} two nerves, {{one on the left}} and one {{on the right side of}} the body. Each is formed as three roots {{immediately}} converge above the upper border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the coccygeus muscle. The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord, and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament. The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth sacral <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves,</b> with the primary contribution coming from the fourth.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebral}} column surrounds {{the spinal cord}} which travels within the spinal canal, formed from a central hole within each vertebra. The spinal cord {{is part of the}} central nervous system that supplies nerves and receives information from the peripheral nervous system within the body. The spinal cord consists of grey and white matter and a central cavity, the central canal. Adjacent to each vertebra emerge <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves.</b> The <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> provide sympathetic nervous supply to the body, with nerves emerging forming the sympathetic trunk and the splanchnic nerves.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spinal}} cord, α-MNs are {{located within the}} gray matter that forms the ventral horn. These α-MNs provide the motor {{component}} of the <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> that innervate muscles of the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{cervical}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 3 (C3) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the cervical segment.|$|R
50|$|The {{cervical}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 6 (C6) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the cervical segment.|$|R
50|$|The {{cervical}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 7 (C7) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the cervical segment.|$|R
25|$|Above {{and below}} each {{vertebra}} are joints called facet joints. These restrict {{the range of}} movement possible, and are joined by a thin portion of the neural arch called the pars interarticularis. In between each pair of vertebrae are two small holes called intervertebral foramina. The <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> leave the spinal cord through these holes.|$|E
25|$|The brain {{itself is}} not {{sensitive}} to pain, because it lacks pain receptors. However, several areas {{of the head and}} neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain. These include the extracranial arteries, middle meningeal artery, large veins, venous sinuses, cranial and <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves,</b> head and neck muscles, the meninges, falx cerebri, parts of the brainstem, eyes, ears, teeth and lining of the mouth. Pial arteries, rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{ejection}} reflex/Letdown reflex: In lactating (breastfeeding) mothers, oxytocin acts at the mammary glands, causing milk to be 'let down' into subareolar sinuses, {{from where}} it can be excreted via the nipple. Suckling by the infant at the nipple is relayed by <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> to the hypothalamus. The stimulation causes neurons that make oxytocin to fire action potentials in intermittent bursts; these bursts result in the secretion of pulses of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve terminals of the pituitary gland.|$|E
50|$|The {{cervical}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 8 (C8) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the cervical segment.|$|R
50|$|The {{thoracic}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 1 (T1) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the thoracic segment.|$|R

25|$|The lumbar plexus {{is formed}} lateral to the {{intervertebral}} foramina by the ventral rami {{of the first}} four lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> (L1-L4), which all pass through psoas major. The larger branches of the plexus exit the muscle to pass sharply downward to reach the abdominal wall and the thigh (under the inguinal ligament); {{with the exception of}} the obturator nerve which pass through the lesser pelvis to reach the medial part of the thigh through the obturator foramen. The nerves of the lumbar plexus pass in front of the hip joint and mainly support the anterior part of the thigh.|$|E
25|$|Since D.D. Palmer's first {{claim of}} {{restoring}} hearing to Harvey Lillard, {{there has been}} controversy about whether a link actually could exist between the spinal adjustment and return of hearing. Critics asserted that a spinal adjustment cannot affect certain areas– like the brain– because the <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> do not extend into the encephalon. Years later, V. Strang, D.C. illustrated several neurological explanations including the recognition that sympathetic nerves arising in the lateral horns of the upper thoracic levels of the spine form the upper cervical ganglion with postganglionic fibers ascending to supply, among other things, blood vessels of the brain, but still with no connection to hearing. Others, though, talked about vertebral subluxation.|$|E
25|$|The {{sides of}} the {{vertebral}} column are separated from the posterior surface by the articular processes in the cervical and thoracic regions, and by the transverse processes in the lumbar region. In the thoracic region, the {{sides of the}} bodies of the vertebrae are marked in the back by the facets for articulation with the heads of the ribs. More posteriorly are the intervertebral foramina, formed by the juxtaposition of the vertebral notches, oval in shape, smallest in the cervical and upper part of the thoracic regions, and gradually increasing in size to the last lumbar. They transmit the special <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> and are situated between the transverse processes in the cervical region, and in front of them in the thoracic and lumbar regions.|$|E

25|$|Nervous system {{injuries}} affect over 90,000 {{people every}} year. It {{is estimated that}} spinal cord injuries alone affect 10,000 each year. As {{a result of this}} high incidence of neurological injuries, nerve regeneration and repair, a subfield of neural tissue engineering, is becoming a rapidly growing field dedicated to the discovery of new ways to recover nerve functionality after injury. The nervous system is divided into two parts: the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which consists of cranial and <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> along with their associated ganglia. While the peripheral nervous system has an intrinsic ability for repair and regeneration, the central nervous system is, for the most part, incapable of self-repair and regeneration. There is currently no treatment for recovering human nerve function after injury to the central nervous system. In addition, multiple attempts at nerve re-growth across the PNS-CNS transition have not been successful. There is simply not enough knowledge about regeneration in the central nervous system. In addition, although the peripheral nervous system has the capability for regeneration, much research still {{needs to be done to}} optimize the environment for maximum regrowth potential. Neuroregeneration is important clinically, as it is part of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E
500|$|Cranial nerves are {{the nerves}} that emerge {{directly}} from the brain (including the brainstem), in contrast to <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> (which emerge from segments of the spinal cord). 10 of 12 of the cranial nerves originate in the brainstem. [...] Cranial nerves relay information between the brain {{and parts of the}} body, primarily to and from regions of the head and neck.|$|E
50|$|The {{thoracic}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 3 (T3) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the thoracic segment.|$|R
50|$|The {{thoracic}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 4 (T4) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the thoracic segment.|$|R
50|$|The {{thoracic}} <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 5 (T5) is a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> of the thoracic segment.|$|R
500|$|Cranial nerves {{are also}} present in other vertebrates. Other amniotes (non-amphibian tetrapods) have cranial nerves {{similar to those of}} humans. [...] In anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), the {{accessory}} nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII) do not exist, with the accessory nerve (XI) being {{an integral part of the}} vagus nerve (X); the hypoglossal nerve (XII) is represented by a variable number of <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> emerging from vertebral segments fused into the occiput. These two nerves only became discrete nerves in the ancestors of amniotes (non-amphibian tetrapods).|$|E
500|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> emerge {{sequentially}} {{from the}} spinal cord with the spinal nerve closest to the head (C1) emerging in the space above the first cervical vertebra. [...] The cranial nerves, however, emerge from {{the central nervous system}} above this level. Each cranial nerve is paired and is present on both sides. Depending on definition in humans there are twelve or thirteen cranial nerves pairs, which are assigned Roman numerals I–XII, sometimes also including cranial nerve zero. The numbering of the cranial nerves is based on the order in which they emerge from the brain, front to back (brainstem).|$|E
500|$|Frogs have {{a highly}} {{developed}} nervous system {{that consists of}} a brain, spinal cord and nerves. Many parts of frog brains correspond with those of humans. It consists of two olfactory lobes, two cerebral hemispheres, a pineal body, two optic lobes, a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata. Muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata regulates respiration, digestion and other automatic functions. The relative size of the cerebrum in frogs is much smaller {{than it is in}} humans. Frogs have ten pairs of cranial nerves which pass information from the outside directly to the brain, and ten pairs of <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> which pass information from the extremities to the brain through the spinal cord. [...] By contrast, all amniotes (mammals, birds and reptiles) have twelve pairs of cranial nerves.|$|E
