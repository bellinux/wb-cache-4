As a function of the dressing parameters, the result is exactly the same as the one for the giant magnon, up to non-logarithmic terms. This suggests that the <b>single</b> <b>spikes</b> should be described by an integrable spin chain closely related to the one associated to the giant magnons.

40|$|Summary: Source {{localization}} using single current dipoles esti-mates equivalent {{centers of}} the spiking gray matter. The extent of the active cortex, however, is difficult to assess from scalp EEG because of the unknown individual volume conduction. The spatial scatter of dipole localizations of <b>single</b> <b>spikes</b> has been proposed {{as a measure of}} extent. <b>Single</b> <b>spike</b> localization, however, is strongly dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that is, the ratio of spike and background EEG amplitudes. On the other hand, averag-ing of all spikes yields only the localization of equivalent centers of activity. We investigated the influence of SNR and multiple subav-erages on the estimation of spatial extent by comparing the local-ization scatter of 100 <b>single</b> <b>spikes</b> in 27 spike types of 25 epilepsy patients with 1000 different subaverages computed by random sampling and bootstrapping. Averaging increased SNR and there-fore allowed for localization not only at the spike peak but also during spike onset when less cortex is active. In several subjects with known cortical lesions, the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> scatter considerably exceeded the lesion. Single dipole scatter was highly correlated with SNR (r 0. 83, P 0. 0001) and was greatly reduced when analyzing multiple subaverages of 10, 25, 50, and 100 spikes. Thus, we found a dominant role of the SNR on the estimated extent and improvement by scatterplots based on the dipole localization of randomly sampled subaverages...|$|R
40|$|Free-electron lasers {{are based}} on the {{coherent}} emission of synchrotron ra- diation of relativistic electrons within an undulator or wiggler. The reso- nant radiation wavelength depends on the electron beam energy and can be tuned over the entire spectrum from micrometer to X-ray radiation. The basic regimes of operation are the FEL ampli er (SEED FEL) and the Self Ampli ed Spontaneous Emission (SASE) -FEL. The SEED-FEL regime is characterized by the ampli cation of a coherent seeding pulse in a single pass through a su ciently long undulator. The Self Ampli ed Spontaneous Emission (SASE) -FEL, on the other hand, uses the broadband signal of the spontaneous emission to start the FEL ampli cation. A FEL pulse generated by SEED scheme is a full coherent pulse while the SASE is a quasi-coherent pulse. The lack in the coherence properties of SASE-FEL is in the longitudinal time structure where the pulse is composed by many regions (spikes) that are independently one from each others. To obtain a full coherent laser pulse a seed pulse is needed or, in SASE mode, it can be done with very short electron bunches, i. e. a bunch length as long as the region of the beam that radiates coherently due to the FEL interaction. The regime is called the <b>Single</b> <b>Spike</b> regime. The pulses generated are fully coherent, moreover given that the laser pulse length is comparable to the electron beam length, its duration can reach femtosecond scale. This PhD thesis regards the theoretical and experimental analysis of the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> regime at SPARC(Sorgente Pulsata Autoampli cata di Radiazione Coer- ente) at Frascati, Italy. For SPARC FEL lasing in the visible range, the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> bunch length is in the order of hundreds of fs. The generation of high brightness ultra-short electron beam is achieved at SPARC with the so called Velocity Bunching (VB) technique. The compression mechanism introduces a linear chirp in the electron bunch energy and the compression ratio must be chosen accurately in order to have the maximum brilliance. The resulting bunch is longer than the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> length yet, but it has a peaked current shape combined with a strong linear chirp along the beam. The short energy chirped electron beams are injected into a tapered undu- lator to compensate the chirp. This scheme allows to select the brightest region of the bunch to operate in the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> regime. A theoretical investigation on the <b>Single</b> <b>Spike</b> regime at SPARC is presented in the the- sis, where, imposing the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> condition on beam length, a scaling law of the charge vs. the length of the beam is introduced in order to obtain the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> pulse. The superradiant properties of the pulse by means of three-dimensional simulation are also investigated. All the FEL simulations are done with GENESIS and PERSEO code. The theory and simulation results are then checked against the <b>Single</b> <b>Spike</b> SASE pulses obtained experimentally at SPARC. In addition SEED regimes with seed pulse length lower than the electron bunch length are investigated for the superradiance evolution of the seed spike injected at the tail of the electron beam and slipping towards the head. The harmonics in the FEL pulses are ultra-short pulses in the UV range with sub-muJ energy. The experimental results are the spectrum and the energy content of the pulses and they are in a good agreement with the simulations and theory...|$|R

40|$|Pyramidal cells perform {{computations}} {{on their}} inputs {{within the context}} of the local network. The present computational study investigates the consequences of feed-forward inhibition for the firing rate and reliability of a typical hippocampal pyramidal neuron that can respond with <b>single</b> <b>spikes</b> as well as bursts. A simple generic inhibitory interneuron is connected in a feed-forward mode to a pyramidal cell and this minimal circuit is activated with frozen noise. The properties (reversal potential, projection site, propagation delay, fast or slow kinetics) of the connecting synapse and the coupling strength between the interneuron and the pyramidal cell are varied. All forms of inhibition considered here decrease the burst rate, but the effects on the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> (spikes that are not part of a burst) rate are more ambiguous. Slow dendritic shunting inhibition increases the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> rate, but fast somatic inhibition does not. When a propagation delay is included in the slow dendritic synapse, the increase of the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> rate is smaller, an effect that could also be obtained by lowering the reversal potential of the synaptic current. Cross-correlations, reverse correlation analysis and decorrelating the interneuron and pyramidal cell activity are used to demonstrate that these effects depend critically on the exact timing of inhibition, emphasizing the relevance of spatiotemporal organization. The reliability of the firing of the pyramidal cell is quantified with the Victor-Purpura measure. When burst and spikes together or spikes alone are taken into account, feed-forward inhibition makes firing more reliable. This is not the case when the analysis is restricted to bursts. A hyperpolarization-activated, non-specific cation current (Ih) is inserted into the dendritic membrane of the pyramidal cell, where it slightly depolarizes the membrane and reduces its time constant. This dendritic h-current increases the output frequency, makes inhibition less effective and introduces spike-spike interactions at a 40 - 140 ms time scale. Feed-forward inhibition always decreases the burst firing rate, but the effects on the <b>single</b> <b>spike</b> rate depended on the spatiotemporal organization of inhibition. Therefore, using different connection strategies, the spike and burst rate of such a minimal circuit can be modulated independently...|$|R

In uiuo intracellular recording demonstrated the bursts to typically ride on a depolarizing wave (5 to 15 mV amplitude). Although the burst-firing frequency of DA cells showed little correlation with the base line firing rate, increases in firing rate were usually associated {{with an increase in}} burst firing. Increases in burst firing could also be elicited by intracellular calcium injection and could be prevented by intracellular injection of EGTA, suggesting a calcium involvement in bursting. Blockade of potassium conductances with extracellular iontophoresis of barium or intracellular injection of tetraethylammonium bromide could also trigger an increased degree of burst firing in DA cells.
