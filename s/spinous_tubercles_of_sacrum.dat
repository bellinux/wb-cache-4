40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) The most {{accepted}} {{method of}} identifying the second sacral spinous process is {{by using an}} accepted landmark known as the Posterior Superior Iliac Spines (PSIS). The PSIS lies about 4 cm lateral to the second <b>spinous</b> <b>tubercle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sacrum</b> (Williams and Warwick, 1980). However, in a search of published work, no evidence could be found of any study which established these generally accepted statements (Stonelake, 1983). This was an inter-examiner reliability study aimed to determine whether palpation of the PSIS was a reliable and accurate method of determining {{the location of the}} second sacral spinous process (S 2) in participants experiencing lumbosacral joint dysfunction. Thirty participants were marked by three examiners in the prone position using the PSIS to locate S 2. An x-ray was taken of each participant in the prone position, after being marked by all three examiners. Measurements were then made on the x-rays to assess the location of the markers on the sacral anatomy. The reliability. of palpation of anatomical landmarks needs to be validated further in future studies, as motion palpation and the palpatory assessment of effectiveness of treatment, applied to correct motion restrictions, are predicted- upon accurate localisation of anatomical landmarks (O'Haire and Gibbons, 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. In {{order to}} {{diagnose}} and treat {{a patient with}} a musculoskeletal complaint, a manual medical practitioner relies upon clinical palpatory skills (O'Haire and Gibbons, 2000). To compare palpatory findings between spinal levels and across treatment sessions, Chiropractors {{must be able to}} locate individual vertebral levels accurately and reliably (McKenzie and Taylor, 1997). There have been reports that the use of landmark palpation to locate spinal levels is of questionable reliability (Burton, Edwards and Sykes, 1990, Simmonds and Kumar, 1993). The most accepted method of identifying the second sacral spinous process is by using an accepted landmark known as the Posterior Superior Iliac Spines (PSIS). The PSIS lies about 4 cm lateral to the second <b>spinous</b> <b>tubercle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sacrum</b> (Williams and Warwick, 1980).

40|$|Purpose: The {{accurate}} {{diagnosis of}} submucosal ureteral stones {{in order to}} choose a proper and less complicative method of treatment is of significant importance. The use of KUB to detect submucosal ureteral stones has been studied in this research. Materials and Methods: This prospective study {{has been carried out}} on 33 patients (23 males and 10 females) with lower ureteral stone (17 cases in the right ureter and 16 in the left) located under iscial spine as was indicated in their KUB. The distance from the lower end of stone to the midline <b>of</b> <b>sacrum</b> was measured per millimeter using KUB. All patients underwent ureteroscopy, and accordingly those with submucosal ureteral stones were distinguished. The correlation between the distance of the lower end of stone from the middle line <b>of</b> <b>sacrum</b> and the existence of submucosal ureteral stone was analyzed. Results: Nineteen out of 33 studied patients had submucosal ureteral stones. The average distance between the peak of stone and the middle line <b>of</b> <b>sacrum</b> in patients with submucosal ureteral stone was 9. 7 mm with an accuracy of 1. 4 mm, a confidence interval 95 % and standard deviation of 3. 1 mm. Accordingly, if the distance of stone from the middle line <b>of</b> <b>sacrum</b> is lower than 13. 7 mm, in 90 % of cases the stone will be submucosal. Conclusion: In patients with lower ureteral stone, the KUB of whom indicates a stone under iscial spine, if the distance of the peak of stone from the midline <b>of</b> <b>sacrum</b> was lower than 15 mm, the stone could most likely be submucousal, a point, which should be considered during treatment. In such cases the intravesical approach should be considered intraoperatively and preparation for submucosal ureteral incision must be provided. This method would be useful in stone removal, if the classic ureteroscopy was not successful. </p...|$|R
