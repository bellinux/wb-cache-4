5|$|To obtain enough protein, aphids need to suck {{large volumes}} of sap. The excess sugary fluid, honeydew, is {{secreted}} by the aphids.

These aphids are also the vectors of about thirty plant viruses, mostly of the nonpersistent variety. The aphids may not be the original <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> but are instrumental in spreading the virus through the crop. Various chemical treatments are available to kill the aphids and organic growers can use a solution of soft soap.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the determination of the incidence of culture-proven postoperative endophthalmitis and probable <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Materials and Methods: It was a prospective study on the microbiology, incidence and probable <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in patients with postoperative infectious endophthalmitis carried out in a tertiary care eye hospital. Consecutive patients diagnosed with postoperative infectious endophthalmitis during the years 2000 - 2007 were investigated for the causative infective agent and possible <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> The surgical data and microbiological data including the investigations performed to trace the source were recorded in a specific formatted form and were gathered and compiled for analysis. Results: Data of analysis showed that 98 (0. 042 &#x 0025;) out of 2, 31, 259 patients who underwent intra-ocular surgery developed infectious endophthalmitis. Among these, 70 (0. 053 &#x 0025;) occurred after cataract, 10 (0. 5 &#x 0025;) after penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and 18 (0. 018 &#x 0025;) following other types of intra-ocular surgeries. The predominant infectious agents isolated were bacteria (89. 7 &#x 0025;), with equal proportions of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Polymicrobial infection was noted in four and fungi in seven patients. Occurrence of postoperative endophthalmitis was sporadic and not related to any specific part of period in a year. <b>Sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> were donor corneal rim in six post-PK patients and phaco probe in one who had postphacoemulsification endophthalmitis Conclusions: Overall incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis over an 8 -year period was quite low.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{persistence}} of bovine TB (bTB) in various countries {{throughout the world}} is enhanced by the existence of wildlife hosts for the infection. In Britain and Ireland, the principal wildlife host for bTB is the badger (Meles meles). The objective of our {{study was to examine}} the dynamics of bTB in badgers in relation to both badger-derived infection from within the population and externally-derived, trickle-type, infection, such as could occur from other species or environmental sources, using a spatial stochastic simulation model. Results The presence <b>of</b> external <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> can increase mean prevalence and reduce the threshold group size for disease persistence. Above the threshold equilibrium group size of 6 – 8 individuals predicted by the model for bTB persistence in badgers based on internal <b>infection</b> alone, external <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> have relatively little impact on the persistence or level of disease. However, within a critical range of group sizes just below this threshold level, external infection becomes much more important in determining disease dynamics. Within this critical range, external infection increases the ratio of intra- to inter-group infections due to the greater probability <b>of</b> external <b>infections</b> entering fully-susceptible groups. The effect is to enable bTB persistence and increase bTB prevalence in badger populations which would not be able to maintain bTB based on internal infection alone. Conclusions External <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> bTB <b>infection</b> can contribute to the {{persistence of}} bTB in badger populations. In high-density badger populations, internal badger-derived infections occur at a sufficient rate that the additional effect <b>of</b> external <b>sources</b> in exacerbating disease is minimal. However, in lower-density populations, external <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> are much more important in enhancing bTB prevalence and persistence. In such circumstances, it is particularly important that control strategies to reduce bTB in badgers include efforts to minimise such external <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> </p...|$|R

25|$|Wild nine-banded {{armadillos}} (Dayspus novemcinctus) {{in south}} central United States often carry Mycobacterium leprae. This {{is believed to be}} because armadillos have such a low body temperature. Leprosy lesions appear mainly in cooler body regions such as the skin and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. Because of armadillos' armor, skin lesions are hard to see. Abrasions around the eyes, nose and feet are the most common signs. Infected armadillos make up a large reservoir of M. leprae and may be a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> for some humans in the United States or other locations in the armadillos' home range. In armadillo leprosy, lesions did not persist at the site of entry in animals, M. leprae multiplied in macrophages at the site of inoculation and lymph nodes.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas where}} TB is highly endemic, {{it is not}} unusual to {{encounter}} patient with a fever, but in whom no <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> is found. The physician may then, after extensive investigation has excluded all other diseases, resort to a trial of TB treatment. The regimen used is HEZ for a minimum of three weeks; RMP and STM are omitted from the regimen because they are broad spectrum antibiotics, whereas the other three first-line drugs treat only mycobacterial infection. Resolution of the fever after three weeks of treatment is good evidence for occult TB and the patient should then be changed to conventional TB treatment (2HREZ/4HR). If the fever does not resolve after three weeks of treatment then it is reasonable to conclude that the patient has another cause for his fever.|$|E
25|$|Horses may acquire cellulitis, usually {{secondarily}} to a wound (which can {{be extremely}} small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath, or joint. Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of NSAIDs, such as phenylbutazone, cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a poultice, and mild exercise. Veterinarians may also prescribe antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It often occurs in close {{proximity}} to water bodies, but no specific activities that bring people into contact with water have been identified (i.e. fetching of water, fishing, rice farming, washing, bathing, etc.). The mode of transmission of Buruli ulcer is not entirely known. Recent evidence suggests insects may be involved in the transmission of the infection. These insects are aquatic bugs belonging to the genus Naucoris (family Naucoridae) and Diplonychus (family Belostomatidae). Trauma is probably the most frequent means by which M. ulcerans is introduced into the skin from surface contamination. The initial trauma can be a mild skin wound such as scratch or as severe. Other studies have suggested aerosol spread but these are not proven. In Australia, animals such as koalas and possums are naturally infected. Epidemiological evidence has not clearly supported person-to-person transmission. However, Muelder & Nourou found that 10 out of 28 patients had relatives who had also had the disease, and cautioned against the dismissal of person-to-person transmission. Given the number of patients who shed large numbers of bacilli from their wounds and live in very close contact with relatives, more cases should have been observed. The cases reported by Muelder & Nourou could perhaps have been exposed to a common <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> and there might also be genetic component to sensitivity to the disease.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{spring and}} summer, the fungus {{produces}} acervuli {{on the exterior}} of the necrotic areas at their mature stage. Under wet condition, these acervuli form conidia.

40|$|Zoonotic {{diseases}} {{are a major}} cause of morbidity, and productivity losses in both human and animal populations. Identifying the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> food-borne zoonoses (e. g. an animal reservoir or food product) is crucial for the identification and prioritisation of food safety interventions. For many zoonotic diseases it is difficult to attribute human cases to <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> because there is little epidemiological information on the cases. However, microbial strain typing allows zoonotic pathogens to be categorised, and the relative frequencies of the strain types among the sources and in human cases allows inference on the likely <b>source</b> <b>of</b> each <b>infection.</b> We introduce sourceR, an R package for quantitative source attribution, aimed at food-borne diseases. It implements a Bayesian model using strain-typed surveillance data from both human cases and <b>source</b> samples, capable <b>of</b> identifying important <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> The model measures the force <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> from each <b>source,</b> allowing for varying survivability, pathogenicity and virulence of pathogen strains, and varying abilities <b>of</b> the <b>sources</b> to act as vehicles <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> A Bayesian non-parametric (Dirichlet process) approach is used to cluster pathogen strain types by epidemiological behaviour, avoiding model overfitting and allowing detection of strain types associated with potentially high "virulence". sourceR is demonstrated using Campylobacter jejuni isolate data collected in New Zealand between 2005 and 2008. Chicken from a particular poultry supplier was identified as the major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> campylobacteriosis, which is qualitatively similar to results of previous studies using the same dataset. Additionally, the software identifies a cluster of 9 multilocus sequence types with abnormally high 'virulence' in humans. sourceR enables straightforward attribution of cases <b>of</b> zoonotic <b>infection</b> to putative <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> As sourceR develops, we intend it to become an important and flexible resource for food-borne disease attribution studies...|$|R
