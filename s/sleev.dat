5000|$|The cover art {{is taken}} from the inside sleeve of Internationalist. It was used also as the cover of [...] "Already Gone" [...] prior to the EP's release. Notably as it {{contains}} the same image as the cover of [...] "Already Gone," [...] that same song features as the first track from the EP, while the other two songs were not released as singles at all. The artwork has been tweaked to fit this EP, however. The <b>sleev</b> from Internationalist and the cover of [...] "Already Gone" [...] both display the artwork as predominantly autumn colours with {{the person in the}} foreground in blue overalls, while the Triple M version has been desaturated of colour except the ground in the image has been recoloured to red (from brown in the other image). The image itself is of a farmer raising his arms as aeroplanes fly overhead. The art style is art deco and very simplistic. The typesetting of the band's name and all other text is {{the same as that of}} the cover of Internationalist and all of its singles.|$|E

40|$|Forearm {{deformity}} {{secondary to}} giant solitary ulna exostosis is rare. We describe a rare presentation of symptomatic solitary giant exostosis involving the entire distal ulna resulting in ulnar bowing of the forearm in a five-year-old boy. The tumour was completely resected and the defect was reconstructed with an allograft wrapped {{with a free}} autogenous periosteal tubular sleeve to deliver fresh pluripotential cells for better incorporation and integration. The distal ulna physes was preserved. An osteotomy {{was performed on the}} radius to correct the deformity. One year after surgery, the deformity remains corrected with normal bone length and excellent hand function. There is no evidence of local recurrence and the allograft has fully incorporated.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Nonlinear simulations {{were used to}} predict and further understand the load transfer between trunnion shafts and yoke plates within a tainter gate trunnion assembly. Traditionally, yoke plates have been sized for an average stress based on the projected bearing area between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate; however, finite element analyses proved that the stress is not uniform across {{the thickness of the}} yoke plate. The non-uniform stress distribution is attributed to the transverse shaft rotations that exist at the supports, concentrating load on the inboard edges of the yoke plates. Further study showed that the installation of either a bronze or composite sleeve between the yoke plate and the trunnion shaft will reduce the magnitude of the stress concentrations. A series of finite element models was developed to investigate the effects that shaft diameter, yoke plate thickness, and sleeve material have on the trunnion shaft to yoke plate load path. The finite element models were developed utilizing solid elements in order to capture the stress distribution across the yoke plate thickness by including multiple solution points across the yoke plate thickness. The analyses showed that a trend can be identified between the magnitude of the edge stress and the L/D ratio (shaft clear span to shaft diameter). As the L/D ratio of the system is increased, the magnitude of the edge stress increases; however, when a sleeve with a lower modulus of elasticity is introduced into the system, it is observed that the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced. The results proved that the reduction in stress is sensitive to shaft diameter, sleeve material, yoke plate thickness and L/D ratio. Typically for a yoke-shaft detail, the L/D ratio is designed to be close to 1. 0 in order to minimize the inboard edge stress; however, trunnion assemblies with larger L/D ratios are desirable from a tainter gate design perspective. Larger clear spans (L) simplify the connection between the strut arms and the trunnion assembly, and small shaft diameters (D) reduce the trunnion pin friction moment demand on the tainter gate strut arms. By installing a low modulus sleeve between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate, the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced; therefore, the design can accommodate L/D ratios larger than 1. 0 while still keeping the stresses below an acceptable level. The simplified detailing and the reduction in strut arm demand will produce a more cost effective tainter gate design.

Then Tere showed Chanfle a pair of new shoes. So Chanfle said: [...] "That isn't saving, that is spending!". After that Tere said: [...] "Nope, it's saving, because I bought them in the supermarket and nobody charged me for them", making Chanfle realize that his wife took {{a pair of shoes}} without paying them, so he (as a recurring gag to show him as a straight up guy) rolled up two imaginary <b>sleevs</b> and returned to the store with Tere.|$|R
