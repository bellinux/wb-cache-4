5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E
5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a pitch is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E

Though they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> live on a stipend from the fief and the daimyō, in practice, the Saigōs lived more like Gōshi and were quite poor, and had debts Saigō Takamori needed 25 years to repay.|$|E

25|$|To the ancients, the {{parallel}} postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They {{were concerned with}} creating a system which was absolutely rigorous and to them {{it seemed as if}} {{the parallel}} line postulate <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be proven rather than simply accepted as a fact. It is now known that such a proof is impossible. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the Elements: the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.|$|E
25|$|Despite initial {{reports that}} {{technical}} issues {{had resulted in}} the accident, the cause {{was found to be}} spatial disorientation of the pilot following the loss of the attitude indicator. Flying in poor weather conditions, the flight crew would have had to rely only on their instruments; such a situation is known as instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The failure of the attitude indicator was caused by the failure of both generators and the crew using an outdated checklist and not adhering to a checklist; the battery was therefore drained of power in less than half the time that it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> supply power for.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{evidence}} {{is provided by}} the eyes of ichthyosaurs that among vertebrates are both relatively and absolutely the largest known. Modern Leopard seals can dive to up to one kilometre hunting on sight. Motani suggested that ichthyosaurs, with their relatively much larger eye sockets, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach even greater depths. Temnodontosaurus, with eyes that had a diameter of twenty-five centimetres, could probably still see at a depth of 1600 meters. At these depths, such eyes would have been especially useful to see large objects. Later species, such as Ophthalmosaurus, had relatively larger eyes, again an indication that diving capacity was better in late Jurassic and Cretaceous forms.|$|E

[...] These expressions accurately reflected the goodwill that existed between the officers and men of the two organizations. Admiral Rodman, for instance, later wrote that he came away from his service in the Grand Fleet as probably the most anglophile officer in the U.S. Navy, and many a relationship was forged among the junior officers that served both nations well in World War II.|$|R

25|$|Accurate {{calculations}} {{had already}} {{shown that the}} BMEWS system would give just ten to 25 minutes of warning {{in the case of}} an ICBM attack. The MIDAS system, as planned, would extend this warning time to about 30 minutes, giving the extra time needed for all of the Strategic Air Command's nuclear-armed heavy bombers to take off from their air bases, and hence proving to the Soviet government that it could not destroy these bombers in a sneak attack. Hence, the Soviets would be deterred from launching such an attack by a valid threat of nuclear retaliation. In addition, the MIDAS system <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> confirm radar detections from BMEWS of a thermonuclear attack, hence reducing the chances of an accidental nuclear false alarm from the radar system.|$|E
500|$|An {{editorial}} {{published in}} the Houston Chronicle criticized the lack of warnings prior to Hurricane Debra's arrival in Texas, alleging that with radar, aircraft, and communication systems, the Weather Bureau <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> give a warning {{well in advance of}} the storm. The article remarked that the Bureau [...] "seemed almost as uninformed as the ordinary citizen" [...] in regards to the forecasting. The chief of the Weather Bureau, Stephen Lichtblau, fired back, saying that [...] "we were fortunate to get a warning." [...] He continued [...] "had [...] not had... equipment they are complaining about, we could have [...] nothing," [...] and maintained that warnings were issued promptly. When repairs in Calhoun County, Texas were completed in 1961, Hurricane Carla struck shortly thereafter in September.|$|E

[...] However, there was some negative fan feedback concerning the pregnancy storyline. In reaction to this, Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our interpretation of it is that people desperately want to see Olivia and Peter together. And that Fauxlivia having a baby makes Olivia’s life that much harder and people are angry because of that. Anything that makes Olivia’s life harder, people seem to be angry at.

40|$|In {{introducing}} a two-tier {{foreign exchange market}} under the Bretton Woods system, the Belgian monetary authorities aimed to insulate the domestic currency from (speculative) capital flows.

The goal {{of this paper is to}} test this assumption empirically. Using a Taylor-rule approach, the paper shows that towards the collapse of the Bretton Woods system the volatility of the spread between the two segments of the foreign exchange market played a growing role in the determination of the monetary policy interest rate. © 2013 The Author...|$|R
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{claim that}} a {{metallic}} strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses (including the pilot of Jacques Chirac's aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay. British investigators and former French Concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the BEA report ignored, including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear. They {{came to the conclusion}} that the Concorde veered off course on the runway, which reduced takeoff speed below the crucial minimum. John Hutchinson, who had served as a Concorde captain for 15 years with British Airways, said that [...] "the fire on its own should have been 'eminently survivable; the pilot <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly his way out of trouble'", had it not been for a [...] "lethal combination of operational error and 'negligence' by the maintenance department of Air France" [...] that [...] "nobody wants to talk about".|$|E
500|$|Republicans {{claimed that}} Taylor's suit, {{by virtue of}} having been filed two hours before Beckham's, gave the case {{precedence}} in Louisville. By mutual consent, the parties consolidated the suits, which were heard before Judge Emmet Field in Jefferson County circuit court. Both sides knew that Field's decision, whatever it might be, would be appealed, but both agreed {{to abide by the}} outcome of the final court's decision. The case was heard on March 1 and 2, 1900. Taylor's attorney's contended that the General Assembly had acted in a quasi-judicial manner, violating the principle of separation of powers. Further, because the contest committee's report did not specify how many votes were invalid, Republicans argued that all 150,000 votes cast in the contested counties had been invalidated by the General Assembly's vote, and consequently, the voters of those counties had been illegally disenfranchised. The most the Assembly <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do, they claimed, was to invalidate the entire election. Finally, they contended that the alleged illegal activities of the General Assembly had deprived Taylor and Marshall of their property rights – the [...] "property" [...] in question being the offices they claimed – and their liberty to hold an elected office. Attorneys for Beckham contended that legislative actions historically had not been subject to judicial review, and indeed were not subject to such under any provision of the state constitution.|$|E
