5|$|Moving back to 1919, {{the elderly}} Raoul visits Christine's gravesite and places {{the music box}} near her tombstone.

2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
