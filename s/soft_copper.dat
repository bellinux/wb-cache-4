5000|$|In the {{standard}} {{process of making}} type, a hard metal punch (made by punchcutting, with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a <b>softer</b> <b>copper</b> bar, creating a matrix. This is then placed into a hand-held mould {{and a piece of}} type, or [...] "sort", is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould. The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or fonts. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type-cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times.

50|$|Copper is an {{excellent}} material for flashing because of its malleability, strength, solderability, workability, high resistance to the caustic effects of mortars and hostile environments, and long service life (see: copper flashing). This enables a roof to be built without weak points. Since flashing is expensive to replace if it fails, copper’s long life is a major cost advantage. Cold rolled (to 1/8-hard temper) copper is recommended for most flashing applications. This material offers more resistance than <b>soft</b> <b>copper</b> to the stresses of expansion and contraction. <b>Soft</b> <b>copper</b> can be specified where extreme forming is required, such as in complicated roof shapes.

50|$|Copper {{proved to}} be an {{excellent}} metal in this reaction due to its ability to complex with the oxygen when the hydrogen was added. Being a <b>soft</b> metal, <b>copper</b> greatly prefers 1,4 addition over 1,2 addition, with the alkene being a softer more polarizable electrophile. Again, BINAP became the ligand of choice due to its steric selectivity, lowering the transition state energy of starting material in the left column. In addition, PMHS was used as a relatively less reactive silane. This prevented loss of ee before deprotection with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF).|$|R
5000|$|Confusingly, the printmaking {{technique}} used in steel engravings is, after the earliest {{years in the}} 1820s, normally a combination of etching and true engraving, with etching becoming dominant in later examples, after the technique became popular in the 1830s. Engraving is done with a burin, which is a small bar of hardened steel with a sharp point. It is pushed along the plate to produce thin furrowed lines, leaving [...] "burr" [...] or strips of waste metal to the side. This {{is followed by the}} use of a scraper to remove any burs, since they would be an impediment during the subsequent inking process. Steel plates are very hard for this technique, which is normally used on <b>softer</b> <b>copper</b> plates. So steel engraving also used etching (q.v.), where acid creates the lines in the plates in the pattern made by selectively removing a thin coating of acid-resistant ground by tools. This is much less effort. As well as etching needles, the etched part of steel engravings made great use of roulettes, small wheels mounted in handles which have regular sharp projections which produce broken lines of dots and dashes when rolled across the plate. Roulettes of different types were used together with the burin and needle to create densely packed marks which appear as tonal to the eye, and allow a great variety of textures and effects. True burin engraving was generally used to finish the etched image.|$|R
50|$|In this method, {{the type}} {{was made by}} {{punching}} a letter-shaped cavity in a matrix made of some <b>soft</b> metal (typically <b>copper).</b> Then this matrix would {{be held in the}} lower part of the mould, the upper part would close on it, and molten type metal would be poured into the cavity.

40|$|AbstractThe Pauli {{exclusion}} principle (PEP) {{is one of}} the basic principles of modern physics and, even if there are no compelling reasons to doubt its validity, it is still debated today because an intuitive, elementary explanation is still missing, and because of its unique stand among the basic symmetries of physics. The present Letter reports a new limit on the probability that PEP is violated by electrons, in a search for an anomalous Kα line in copper: the presence of this line in the <b>soft</b> X-ray <b>copper</b> fluorescence would signal a transition to a ground state already occupied by 2 electrons.

40|$|International audienceAs a heterofunctional pro-ligand {{with both}} hard and soft {{coordination}} sites, trans- 3 -(3 -pyridyl) acrylic acid (LH) is of potential {{interest for the}} design of heterometallic complexes of f- and d-block cations, as previously shown in the case of lanthanides. Reaction with uranyl nitrate in water–acetonitrile at 180 °C gives the complex [(UO 2) 3 (L) (HL) O(OH) 3]· 2. 5 H 2 O·CH 3 CN (2), different from the previously reported [UO 2 (L) (OH) ] (1). Complex 2 crystallizes as a ribbon-like one-dimensional coordination polymer, with an oxo/hydroxo-bridged skeleton, in which the uranyl cation is bound to the bridging bidentate carboxylate groups, the pyridyl groups (one of them protonated) being directed sideways. In the additional presence of copper nitrate, the reaction gives the heterometallic complex [(UO 2) 2 Cu(L) 3 (O) (H 2 O) ](NO 3) (3), in which the harder uranium atom is bound to two m 3 -oxo anions to generate a tetranuclear secondary building unit, and to chelating and bridging carboxylate groups, while the <b>softer</b> <b>copper</b> cations are bound to three pyridyl groups and only one carboxylate donor. The copper atoms are further involved in cation–cation interactions with uranyl oxo groups, the Cu–O(oxo) bond lengths of 2. 162 (13) and 2. 248 (16) Å being among the shortest measured up to now. 3 crystallizes as a three-dimensional assembly displaying narrow channels, and it illustrates the ability of copper cations, in association with a ditopic ligand, to assemble discrete uranylcontaining units into a framework structure. The emission spectra of complexes 1 and 2 in the solid state display the usual vibronic progression of the uranyl ion in the 450 – 650 nm range, with the breadth of the bands indicating that they may be the superposition of slightly different series due to the inequivalent uranyl centres in the lattice...|$|R

50|$|Many of {{the first}} metal {{artifacts}} that archaeologists have identified have been tools or weapons, as well as objects used as ornaments such as jewellery.

50|$|The {{standards}} for armor-piercing rifle bullets aren't clear-cut, because the penetration of a bullet {{depends on the}} hardness of the target armor.

Most other core materials would have effects between lead and tungsten carbide.

During assembly, a flare nut is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight seal.

5000|$|Azurite is a <b>soft,</b> {{deep blue}} <b>copper</b> mineral {{produced}} by weathering of copper ore deposits.

The blue of azurite is exceptionally deep and clear, and for that reason the mineral has tended to be associated since antiquity with the deep blue color of low-humidity desert and winter skies. The modern English name of the mineral reflects this association, since both azurite and azure are derived via Arabic from the Persian lazhward (لاژورد), an area known for its deposits of another deep blue stone, lapis lazuli ("stone of azure").|$|R
