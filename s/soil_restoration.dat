40|$|Soil water/distribution {{coefficients}} (K-d) {{have been}} measured for the partitioning of naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene between aqueous surfactant solutions and a clean soil. The surfactants used are ABA block copolymers constructed from ethylene oxide (the monomer used to synthesise the hydrophilic A blocks) and propylene oxide (used for {{the manufacture of}} the hydrophobic B block). Three of these surfactants comprising the same size propylene oxide block but different ethylene oxide/propylene oxide ratios were investigated. Increasing amounts of surfactant in the system result in a progressive decrease in the K-d values signifying an increasing tendency for the hydrophobic solutes to be dispersed in aqueous solution due to {{the action of the}} surfactant. More significantly for equal surfactant doses the most hydrophobic surfactant possessing the lowest ethylene oxide/propylene oxide ratio reduces K-d by the greatest amount whereas the most hydrophilic surfactant reduces K-d the least. Finally micellar HPLC using the above surfactants and hydrophobic solutes was undertaken. Interpolated capacity factors evaluated for particular surfactant doses correlated well with K-d values calculated for the same surfactant doses. The relationship between K-d and capacity was found to be log-linear and the correlation line could be fitted to the data obtained for all three surfactants. It is therefore concluded that micellar HPLC may be used for preliminary evaluations of the effectiveness of particular surfactants proposed for contaminated <b>soils</b> <b>restoration</b> schemes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Revegetation and <b>soil</b> <b>restoration</b> efforts, often {{associated}} with erosion control measures on disturbed soils, are rarely monitored or otherwise evaluated in terms of improved hydrologic, much less, ecologic function and longer term sustainability. As in many watersheds, sediment is a key parameter of concern in the Tahoe Basin, particularly fine sediments less than about ten microns. Numerous erosion control measures deployed in the Basin {{during the past several}} decades have under-performed, or simply failed after a few years and new <b>soil</b> <b>restoration</b> methods of erosion control are under investigation. We outline a compre-hensive, integrated field-based evaluation and assess-ment of the hydrologic function associated with these <b>soil</b> <b>restoration</b> methods with the hypothesis that restoration of sustainable function will result in longer term erosion control benefits than that currently achieved with more commonly used surface treatment methods (e. g. straw/mulch covers and hydroseeding). The monitoring includes cover-point and ocular assessments of plant cover, species type and diversity; soil sampling for nutrient status; rainfall simulation measurement of infiltration and runoff rates; cone penetrometer measurements of soil compaction and thickness of mulch layer depths. Through multi-year hydrologic and vegetation monitoring at ten sites and 120 plots, we illustrate the results obtained from the integrated monitoring program and describe how it might guide future restoration efforts and monitoring assessments...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{indicators}} of <b>soil</b> <b>restoration</b> during secondary succession in a heterogeneous valley in the high tropical Andes. A combination of chronosequence and permanent plot methods was used to detect changes in this heterogeneous matrix. Thirty-six plots with different fallow times (1 – 9 years) and four noncultivated plots with natural vegetation (pa´ramo) were sampled twice in a 3 -year interval (1996 and 1999). The following soil properties were determined: total C and N, pH, exchangeable bases, cation exchange capacity, and microbial biomass N (MB-N). Using the chronosequence approach, successional increases in soil pH and Mg were detected, pointing to these variables as indicators of <b>soil</b> <b>restoration</b> during the fallow period. Comparing the noncultivated pa´ramo with the fallow plots, a significant decrease in MB-N was found, suggesting that this is a sensitive agricultural disturbance indicator. The permanent plot analysis failed to detect successional trends in any of the study variables, probably as a result of a lack of sensitivity of the indicators used within the 3 -year interval. Nevertheless, a strong acidification was detected by the permanent plot method when fallow plots were cultivated. We conclude that the size of important soil components such as total soil organic matter or microbial biomass is not a sensitive <b>soil</b> <b>restoration</b> indicator in these heterogeneous mountain systems but that other integrative variables such as pH could be more sensitive to successional changes in key soil processes (e. g., nitrification or nutrient losses). 619 - 628 lsarmien@ula. vellambi@ula. v...|$|E

Over the years, many review articles {{have concluded that the}} majority of research show that the practice poses less harm as compared to the benefits. This in turn made the United States Environmental Protection Agency to promote its use for <b>soil</b> enrichment and <b>restoration.</b> In an attempt to obtain an objective evaluation, based on reliable scientific evidence of the controversy, Google Scholar search was conducted using the phrase “environmental and health effects of land application of sewage sludge/biosolids”. The search result yielded 86 research articles directly related to the topic. The 86 articles were then comprehensively studied and grouped into three categories: those research findings that proved that land application of biosolids poses significant harm to the environment, human and animal health, those that proved that the practice does not pose significant harm to the environment, human and animal health and those that were inclusive and suggest precaution in using biosolids for <b>soil</b> enrichment and <b>restoration.</b> iv Out of the total of 86 research articles studied, 42 or about 49 % found that land application of biosolids posed significant harm to the environment, human and animal health as opposed to 33 or about 38 % concluding no significant harm. Furthermore, when research conducted in the U. S. were extracted from the 86 global research articles, about 51 % found that land application of biosolids posed significant harm to the environment, human and animal health as opposed to about 36 % concluding no significant harm. The U. S. articles numbered 47 or about 55 % of the total articles reviewed.
