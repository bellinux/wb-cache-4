500|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, around 60% of the dusky shark's diet {{consists}} of bony fishes, from over ten families with bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and <b>summer</b> <b>flounder</b> (Paralichthys dentatus) being especially important. Cartilaginous fishes, mainly skates and their egg cases, are the second-most important dietary component, while the lady crab (Ovalipes ocellatus) {{is also a}} relatively significant food source. In South African and Australian waters, bony fishes are again the most important prey type. Newborn and juvenile sharks subsist mainly on small pelagic prey such as sardines and squid; older sharks over [...] long broaden their diets to include larger bony and cartilaginous fishes. The run of the southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax), occurring off the eastern coast of South Africa every winter, is attended by medium and large-sized dusky sharks. Pregnant and post-partum females do not join, possibly because the energy cost of gestation leaves them unable to pursue such swift prey. One South African study reported that 0.2% of the sharks examined had preyed upon bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).|$|E

40|$|Biomass spectra were {{constructed}} for the biotic community of Narragansett Bay in size classes ranging from phytoplankton to fish {{to determine the}} usefulness of biomass spectra in determining spatial and temporal trends in community structure and pattern. ^ Yearly, regional and seasonal biomass spectra for fish and macro-invertebrates {{were constructed}} with data from two long-term trawl surveys from 1990 - 2005. Spectral slopes agreed with the predicted value of - 1 for all regions and years except 1991. This consistency indicated minimal impact of fishing, climate or anthropogenic effects on the community 2 ̆ 7 s size structure; spectral slope {{was not a good}} indicator of change in this community. Spectral intercept was strongly correlated with total biomass. Regionally, spectra indicated that the Lower bay was more productive for large benthic fish and the Mid bay was important habitat for pelagic fish and crabs. After 2002 the Upper bay fish community appeared to shift to a new regime, with increased large fish biomass. ^ Seasonal biomass spectra showed strong differences and also showed intra-annual trends indicating within-season shifts. Winter fish biomass steadily declined and was composed mainly of skates rather winter <b>flounder.</b> <b>Summer</b> fish size was five times smaller than winter fish size. Spring, summer and fall biomass increased after 2002. Migratory and warm-water fish appeared to be increasing their biomass and {{the amount of time spent}} in the bay. ^ Whole-system biomass spectra (phytoplanIcton, zooplankton, benthic infauna, ctenophores, crabs and fish) were constructed for one station in Mid Narragansett Bay for a warm winter year (2002) and a cold winter year (2004). Yearly spectral slopes were indistinguishable from - 1 despite twofold variation in individual trophic group biomass. Modeling of the variation in group biomass showed that large (up to 4 x) changes were required to produce slopes significantly different from - 1. Cooler winter temperatures in 2004 were linked to higher phytoplankton biomass, but lower biomass of ctenophores and benthic infauna. The warmer winter in 2002 produced opposite results; the increased temperatures may have allowed faster growth of ctenophores and benthic fauna. The biomass-size relationship produced a reasonable estimate of bacterial biomass but overestimated seabird biomass by two orders of magnitude. ...|$|R
40|$|Animals are {{influenced}} by both biotic and abiotic factors when selecting a habitat. The final decision of an organism to select a habitat generally depends on the fitness increase that can be expected. Within a selected habitat, interactions with conspecifics and other species also affect its quality. This thesis describes the habitat use of estuarine fishes in the Scheldt estuary. In the first part (Chapter 1 to Chapter 3) we studied the importance of intertidal migration for fishes and discussed the various factors that affect intertidal habitat quality. We also examined to what extent fishes affect their environment by predation on the intertidal infauna. The second part (Chapter 4 and 5) describes the effect of abiotic factors {{on the use of}} the Scheldt estuary by European flounder Platichthys flesus (L.). The fish assemblage on a mudflat in the brackish part of the Scheldt estuary is dominated by juveniles, confirming the nursery status of this part of the estuary. The composition of the intertidal fish community reflects well the cyclicity of seasonal recruitment of species into the estuary. Flatfishes migrate actively onto the mudflat whereas the distribution of (semi-) pelagic species in the fyke nets suggests that they are transported passively by the tidal currents. Most fish species do not show a clear zonation on the mudflat and, if observed, this is mainly the result of species-specific differences in mobility. Zonation of flatfishes tends to be affected by density-dependent processes. When fish abundance in the nets is higher, relatively more flounder are caught on the upper shore. By doing so, they probably avoid competition for food or space with sole, which stays on the middle and lower zones of the mudflat. Because of the low predator abundance and high turbidity in the brackish part of the estuary, predation is probably not an important trigger for intertidal migration. The most important (and perhaps only?) trigger for intertidal migration in turbid estuaries is the high intertidal food availability. The concentration of large numbers of juvenile fishes in these intertidal areas may give rise to competitive interactions. Diet analysis shows that all fish species on the mudflat, without exception, target the same prey species (Corophium volutator). The relative importance of prey species in the diet of fishes reflects the seasonal prey availability in the field, confirming the generalist and opportunistic feeding nature of estuarine fishes. For all species, the niche width is larger when resources are less available or when the population density is higher. It is suggested that a generalist and opportunistic feeding strategy reduces competition and results in a broader population diet with increasing population density. As most fishes are feeding on a limited number of prey species, niche overlap is generally high between species. A significant niche overlap was found in <b>summer</b> between <b>flounder</b> and sole. Direct competition for food, however, is probably avoided by spatial niche separation and by resource partitioning at the level of prey size. The intensive use of the intertidal benthic resources raises the question whether or not predators deplete the macrobenthic prey populations. The results of two exclosure experiments on an estuarine mudflat indicate that fishes and birds have only a negligible effect on the abundance of their infaunal prey species. The effects of short-term experiments in these highly productive areas may only be noticeable at high predator densities. Long-term exclosure experiments on the other hand, seem to reflect the indirect effects of predation, as in the absence of predation, infaunal regulation (competition and predation) becomes more important. The lack of clear direct effects of predation on the abundance of organisms on the lower trophic levels, suggests that the interaction strength in the benthic food web is rather weak. Weak links generally support food web stability and decrease the probability of tropic cascades. These weak interactions may be the result of (1) the three-dimensional structure of soft sediments, which reduces the risk of strong competitive and predatory interactions and (2) the prevalence of omnivory in the benthic food web. The fact that benthic prey is superabundant and that fishes are flexible to switch between different prey species (infaunal, epibenthic, hyperbenthic, pelagic), suggests that the carrying capacity of the estuary for benthic fishes is only rarely reached. If food and predation are not limiting, which is thought to be the rule in estuarine nurseries, then abiotic factors determine the habitat selection of fishes. We were able to accurately describe the growth of flounder in an estuarine environment, solely based on temperature, which demonstrates the predominance of temperature as a regulator of growth and hence habitat quality. A multivariable bioenergetics model, based on temperature, oxygen concentration and salinity, was constructed for European flounder (Platichthys flesus) to generate spatially-explicit estimates of growth in the Scheldt estuary. The model was run for two years (1998 and 2003) and predicts that in March, when 0 -group flounder is known to migrate upstream, growth is highest in the upper freshwater reaches of the estuary. This suggests that freshwater migration of flounder may be, at least partly, temperature driven. In July and October, the unfavourable oxygen concentration in the central part of the Zeeschelde reduces growth and probably prevents upstream migration. In summer and autumn, the growth rate in the brackish part of the estuary is higher compared to the marine part. Field data on the distribution of flounder in the estuary shows that the abundance of this species is highest in the brackish part, where it also finds plenty of suitable prey items. Our results indicate that abiotic variables may be useful to predict the habitat use of diadromous species in estuaries. Given the importance of food in determining habitat quality, the model should be further extended with a foraging compartment to account for spatial differences in prey availability...|$|R

50|$|The <b>summer</b> <b>flounder</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} to be, by far, {{the most important}} flounder along the Atlantic coast as {{it is important to}} both the commercial fishing industry and very popular for recreational fishing in the northeast United States. In addition to commercial fishing, businesses such as recreational charters, party boats, bait and tackle stores, and any number of businesses associated with boating and angling may depend on a viable <b>summer</b> <b>flounder</b> angling season.
