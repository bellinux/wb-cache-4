The first is {{about the fact that}} there is climate change and that it is human-induced. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
500|$|A {{period of}} hard work for Verdi—with the {{creation}} of twenty operas (excluding revisions and translations)—followed over the next sixteen years, culminating in Un ballo in maschera. This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised. In April 1845, in connection with I due Foscari, he wrote: [...] "I am happy, no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything. I cannot wait for these next three years to pass. I have to write six operas, then addio to everything." [...] In 1858 Verdi complained: [...] "Since Nabucco, you may <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never had one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2012 Golden Globe ceremony, when Dinklage won {{the award}} for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, he told the {{audience}} {{that he had been}} thinking about [...] "a gentleman, his name is Martin Henderson", and suggested that they Google his name. Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said what I wanted to <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a friend who says the world doesn't need another angry dwarf." ...|$|E

500|$|Described as [...] "one of {{the most}} talented footballers of his generation", Enda Muldoon has played in {{virtually}} all positions in the forward line, as well as midfield for both his club and county. He is regarded as the complete footballer in that he has impressive high-fielding skills, is hard to dispossess, is very accurate in front of the posts with both feet and covers a lot of ground often tracking back to help in defence. Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin-point passes, and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game. Ballinderry and Derry team-mate Kevin McGuckin described him as [...] "a magician on the ball and can do anything with it or put it anywhere with his passing". GAA journalist and former Derry player Joe Brolly said of him: [...] "I cannot <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever seen a more elegant footballer" [...] and compared him to Kerry football legend Maurice Fitzgerald.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, Waters {{commenced}} The Wall Live tour, {{an updated}} version of the original Pink Floyd shows, featuring a complete performance of The Wall. Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: [...] "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but I still have the fire in my belly, and I have something to <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a swan song in me and I think this will probably be it." [...] At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing [...] "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for [...] "Outside the Wall". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. As of 2013, The Wall Live is the highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist. Waters performed at [...] at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Waters was accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} this period of turmoil that Verdi was to {{describe}} the previous sixteen years of his composing life: in a letter to Countess Clara Maffei, he states: [...] "From Nabucco, you may <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never had one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys!" ...|$|E

The ceremony was held at the Waldorf-Astoria on Monday, March 14, 2011, at 8:30pm EST. Waits accepted the award with his customary humor, stating, [...] "They <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no hits and that I'm difficult to work with... like it's a bad thing." ...|$|E

Pirès was quoted saying: [...] "I have to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had some disappointments this season. For instance, I was on the bench very often". Pirès {{additionally}} suggested that Wenger's decision to withdraw him in the UEFA Champions League Final showed he had slipped in the eyes of his French boss. Pirès said that he felt hurt by how Wenger did not trust him anymore, which was a major factor that convinced him {{that it was time to}} move on from Arsenal.|$|E
2500|$|Uday Shankar, CEO of STAR India, {{suggested}} Aamir Khan {{to venture}} into television. Khan, however, was hesitant at first but agreed and worked upon {{the concept of the}} show for two years. In an interview with Zee News, he said, [...] "Initially I was scared to do the show as we were travelling on a different path. I was worried. It was in a way difficult, but we knew what we are doing is different, but it comes straight from our heart." [...] He also added, [...] "I cannot say I understand TV completely. I was earlier scared {{to go ahead with the}} project. I can only <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made this show with complete honesty and without compromising on anything." ...|$|E

Already under intense {{pressure}} {{as a high school}} prospect, the combination of high expectation and the many new temptations that were prohibited under his strict upbringing soon overwhelmed him. He was torn between embracing the freedom and following his father's teachings, noting that [...] "I'm finally away from my dad telling me everything to do. And I've got to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken advantage of it. Full advantage. He keeps telling me, 'Come on, you've got {{the rest of your life}} to fool around. Not now.' I know he's right.

2500|$|A {{story that}} haunted Burton {{up to his}} death (recounted {{in some of his}} obituaries) was that he came close to being {{discovered}} one night when he lifted his robe to urinate rather than squatting as an Arab would. It was said that he was seen by an Arab and, in order to avoid exposure, killed him. Burton denied this, pointing out that killing the boy would almost certainly have led to his being discovered as an impostor. Burton became so tired of denying this accusation that he took to baiting his accusers, although he was said to enjoy the notoriety and even once laughingly claimed to have done it. A doctor once asked him: [...] "How do you feel when you have killed a man?", Burton retorted: [...] "Quite jolly, what about you?". When asked by a priest about the same incident Burton is said to have replied: [...] "Sir, I'm proud to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> committed every sin in the Decalogue." [...] Stanley Lane-Poole, a Burton detractor, reported that Burton [...] "confessed rather shamefacedly that he had never killed anybody at any time." ...|$|E
