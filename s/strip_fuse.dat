50|$|Limiter fuses {{consist of}} a metal strip from a lock plate, for {{currents}} over 40 amperes. Frequently, these are used {{in close proximity to}} starter battery fuse boxes. They are used also in electric vehicles, e.g., in forklift trucks. Because <b>strip</b> <b>fuses</b> require the use of tools for replacement they are therefore legally considered non-serviceable components for end-users.|$|R
5000|$|Reinforcement Film (A <b>strip</b> {{of plastic}} <b>fused</b> to each {{half of the}} zipper tape to allow a {{manufacturer}} to electronically [...] "weld" [...] the zipper onto the garment or item that is being manufactured, without the need of sewing or stitching.) ...|$|R
60|$|They {{moved forward}} in a little phalanx, {{carrying}} staves and iron bars, though Austin knew that a word would bring out the twinkling steel; and, somewhat to his astonishment, the negroes fell back before them, and as they approached it the headman scuttled out of his house. Jefferson stopped outside it and taking a stick of yellow substance from his pocket, inserted it in a cranny he raked out in the wall. Then he lighted the <b>strip</b> of <b>fuse</b> and touched Austin's shoulder.|$|R
60|$|He {{worked the}} soft yellow {{substance}} over the detonator, {{after which he}} thrust it gently into the auger hole and pressed a handful of soil down on it. Frank was thankful when he had finished, for having heard of the tremendous powers of the giant powder {{he did not care}} to be shut up with it among that network of roots. Then Harry, straightening the <b>strip</b> of black <b>fuse</b> which projected from the hole, took a quick glance about him.|$|R
60|$|Austin, {{who decided}} {{that there was}} some reason in the query, strolled round the house, and came upon Jefferson sitting with his back to it and the box of {{dynamite}} on the deck in front of him. He looked gaunter and more haggard than ever in the daylight, but he was busy pinching down a copper cap upon a <b>strip</b> of snaky <b>fuse,</b> which he proceeded to carefully embed in a roll of semi-plastic material that looked very like a candle made of yellow wax.|$|R
40|$|By {{varying the}} mean {{granulometry}} and {{the packing density}} of the arc quenching material (silica sand), we show {{the influence of the}} silica sand morphometric properties on the pressure evolution during the HBC fuse working. Pressure measurements are made using piezoelectric transducers inserted at various lengths taken from the <b>fuse</b> <b>strip</b> plane. The measurements are compared with the results get from the simulation of the energy withdraw within a granular material. Both types of results show that the pressure evolution is strongly correlated with the electric power evolution and the morphometric properties...|$|R
60|$|He toiled assiduously {{with the}} axehead {{and a little}} drill, {{bruising}} his fingers as the light grew dim, and when his left hand was smeared with blood, drew out a plastic yellow roll {{from one of his}} bundles. This he gently rammed into the hole, squeezed down a copper cap upon a <b>strip</b> of <b>fuse,</b> and, lighting the latter, retired expeditiously towards the river. Standing behind a big cedar, he watched the train of blue vapour and thin red sparks creep on through the dusk until a blaze of yellow flame leapt up, and a stunning detonation rolled across the woods. The hillsides took up the sound, and flung it from one to another in great reverberations, while the pines, quivering in all their sprays, shook drops of water down. Alton stood still and listened, silent and intent, while the discord died, until there was once more stillness again, realizing dimly a little of its significance.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the year}} 1975, Moje began cutting the rods into thin wafers or <b>strips</b> and <b>fusing</b> them {{together}} in a kiln. The pieces would then be cut again and re-fused to create rhythmic patterns of vibrant color. In 1976, Moje returned to Hamburg after a short time living in Danzinger Strasse. Moje became {{a founding member of}} Galerie der Kunsthandwerker and in 1978 through 1982 {{he was a member of}} the Jury of Arbeitsgemeinschaft des Deutschen Kunsthandwerks. Meanwhile, Moje continued working with the glass rods. The process was fraught with failure caused by the material. Many of the glass colours were incompatible with each other, causing the work to break in the kiln or even after the firing process had finished. The work that did survive was often heavily devitrified. Moje's background as a glass cutter came to the fore as he had to carve away the contaminated surface to reveal the colour he desired.|$|R
25|$|A fuse {{consists}} of a metal <b>strip</b> or wire <b>fuse</b> element, of small cross-section compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between a pair of electrical terminals, and (usually) enclosed by a non-combustible housing. The fuse is arranged in series to carry all the current passing through the protected circuit. The resistance of the element generates heat due to the current flow. The size and construction of the element is (empirically) determined so that the heat produced for a normal current does not cause the element to attain a high temperature. If too high a current flows, the element rises to a higher temperature and either directly melts, or else melts a soldered joint within the fuse, opening the circuit.|$|R
60|$|The {{other man}} went out, {{and the two}} who were left {{proceeded}} to nip down the fulminating caps on the <b>strips</b> of snaky <b>fuse,</b> after which they carefully embedded them in sundry plastic rolls, which looked very like big candles made of yellow wax. These they packed in an iron case, and then, carrying an axe and a big auger, {{went out of the}} tent. The rest of the men left at the ridge were waiting them, for every one understood the perilous nature of the attempt, though, as two men were sufficient for the work, there was nothing that they could do, and they proceeded in a body through the dripping undergrowth towards the gully. Here a big fire of resinous wood was lighted, and when at last the smoky glare flickered upon the wet rocks in the hollow, Brooke, who stripped to shirt and trousers, flung himself over the edge.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of pre-arcing time {{in the case of}} High Breaking Capacity fuses submitted to high fault currents. The fuse elements studied consist of silver <b>fuse</b> <b>strips</b> with reduced sections in their centre. During the fuse working the fuse element is fused partly and hence vaporized. The time necessary to obtain an electric arc is called the pre-arcing time. This latter is defined by the duration from the appearance of the fault current to the splitting of the fuse element due to the vaporization of the reduced sections. The mathematic model is based on the solution of the heat transfer equation, using an enthalpy formulation {{to take into account the}} phase transitions, supplemented by an energy source due to the heat produced by ohmic losses. In order to determine the current density evolution in the fuse element, the Laplace equation governing the electric potential and the Ohm's law are used. Two typical fuse elements close to industrial ones are chosen for the simulations. The calculated pre-arcing times are given together with the main electrical properties, and compared with the experimental values. The resistive case with cos phi ~ 0. 9 is discussed for a 2. 5 mm and 7. 5 mm-width elements respectively with one and three reduced sections...|$|R
