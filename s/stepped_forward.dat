5|$|Culverhouse was {{diagnosed}} with cancer in 1992, and died in 1994. His apparent attempt to exclude his wife from his inheritance led to posthumous revelations of extramarital affairs. Ensuing lawsuits caused an ownership crisis that almost required the team to relocate to another city, before the Glazer family <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> with a purchase offer.|$|E
5|$|A second cruise saw {{the capture}} of an American privateer, and a notable {{incident}} for Nelson. Lowestoffe sent her boat and first lieutenant {{to take over the}} prize, but the seas were too rough to allow the American to be boarded, so the lieutenant returned. Nelson <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> and volunteered to make an attempt; he succeeded.|$|E
5|$|An {{argument}} {{then broke}} out between Tyler {{and some of}} the royal servants. The Mayor of London, William Walworth, <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to intervene, Tyler made some motion towards the King, and the royal soldiers leapt in. Either Walworth or Richard ordered Tyler to be arrested, Tyler attempted to attack the Mayor, and Walworth responded by stabbing Tyler. Ralph Standish, a royal squire, then repeatedly stabbed Tyler with his sword, mortally injuring him.|$|E

5000|$|In Pakistan, a {{variation}} that uses two dice allows backwards movement. The dice are rolled and the die values {{can be used}} independently or in combination to move two pieces or a single piece forwards or backwards or both. For example, if the roll gives 1 and 4, the player can move a single piece 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> and then 1 step backwards, or 1 <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> and 4 <b>steps</b> backwards, or 1 then 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards. Or the player can move a piece 1 <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards, and another piece 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards.|$|R
50|$|Equivalent to a chess pawn; it {{can move}} one <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> but cannot retreat. It captures one {{diagonal}} <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> as in Western chess.|$|R
5|$|That summer, the Canadiens' {{franchise}} was for sale, {{after posting}} losses of $60,000 {{over the previous}} two seasons. Over forty thousand families and 150,000 individuals were receiving social assistance in Montreal. Owners Leo Dandurand and Joseph Cattarinich held negotiations with A. C. Sutphin to sell the club and move it to Cleveland. Just before the season, a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen, led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard, <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to buy the club and prevent the transfer.|$|E
5|$|When the {{government}} withdrew Mitchell, the McCanns hired Justine McGuinness, who was reportedly headhunted for the job. When she left, Hanover Communications took over briefly, headed by Charles Lewington, formerly John Major's private secretary. In September 2007 Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> as a benefactor {{and offered to}} cover Clarence Mitchell's salary {{so that he could}} return. Mitchell resigned from his government position and started working for the McCanns full-time; he was later paid by Madeleine's Fund.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{all forms}} of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{rhythm of}} the figure is Sqqqqqq. The leader takes a slow <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> with right foot (heel), and then <b>steps</b> forward/replace/back/replace/forward/replace. <b>Steps</b> <b>forward</b> are taken with [...] "digging" [...] the heel. <b>Steps</b> <b>forward</b> and back may be taken {{slightly}} sideways, then the [...] "replace" [...] steps are with slight slide leftwards. The follower's steps are opposite.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding Georgia's mixed {{democratic}} progress, {{he often}} used to say: “Georgia made a <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in terms of democracy, but sometimes {{when you make a}} <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> you <b>step</b> in shit.” ...|$|R
50|$|The walk {{consists}} of <b>stepping</b> <b>forward,</b> pausing, rocking {{back on the}} back leg, then proceeding to the next <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b> In other variations, there is simply a pause between steps with the feet poised together.|$|R
5|$|The ancient chronicles mention {{two tests}} that Dutthagamani planned {{to find out}} these warriors' skill before the battle. For the first test, Dutthagamani asked the warriors to drink a large {{cauldron}} of toddy, intending to test their strength. When all others refused, Suranimala <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> and drank the entire cauldron without any effort. The second test was to test Nandimithra, {{the commander of the}} army. Dutthagamani had his royal elephant, Kandula, infuriated and set on Nandimithra. However, the warrior stood his ground and taking the elephant by its tusks, pushed it to the ground. Thus clearing all doubts as to the abilities and skill of his warriors, Dutthagamani sounded the war drums and raising his flags, started the assault to take Vijithapura.|$|E
5|$|The {{dormitory}} {{was known}} as North Hall upon its opening. However, by 1915, the college's , no donor had <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to help fund the dormitory's construction and Vassar president Henry Noble MacCracken renamed the building Milo Jewett House after Milo P. Jewett. Jewett served as Vassar's first president from his election to the office in February 1861 until his departure from the college in spring 1864 after a dispute with the school's founder and namesake, Matthew Vassar. Although Jewett was instrumental in providing {{a vision for the}} college, the school did not open until 1865 meaning he never had the chance to oversee its student body.|$|E
5|$|The western {{half of the}} {{building}} is <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> (southwards) by two bays from the original building. Originally the service wing, it is plainer than the eastern building and dates from the Georgian era. Though using Georgian proportions, {{it was built in}} an early Jacobean revival style which has been heightened by subsequent alterations, particularly the addition of a central gable. The main part of the south (front) face has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet running along the entire façade at eaves level. In the centre of the five east bays is a canted bay window beneath a shaped gable; the flanking bays have single-mullion, double-transomed windows. The two west bays are set backwards and have a central oriel window on the first floor with two single-mullion, double-transomed windows on the ground floor.|$|E
5000|$|A pawn moves one <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> as a rook; on {{its first}} move it may {{optionally}} move two <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> in the same direction. A pawn captures one step diagonally forward; en passant captures are permitted.|$|R
50|$|Both {{starting}} with the left foot, take four steps forward; on the fifth step, change position, the man crossing over behind the lady without releasing the hands or losing a step; three more <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> and then cross back again; then three more <b>steps</b> <b>forward.</b> In other words, this is merely twelve <b>steps</b> <b>forward,</b> changes of position being made on the fifth and ninth steps. Completion of these twelve steps leaves the dancers {{in the same position}} as at the start.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Step</b> <b>Forward</b> {{was founded}} in 1989 in Umeå, Sweden, by Dennis Lyxzén and his friends, Toft Stade, Jens Nordén and Henrik Jansson. <b>Step</b> <b>Forward</b> {{was one of the}} very first {{hardcore}} punk bands in Sweden that held on to the American straight edge lifestyle.|$|R
5|$|With {{losses of}} $60,000 over the {{previous}} two seasons, the Canadiens were put up for sale in 1935. Dandurand and Cattarinich entered negotiations to sell the club and move it to Cleveland, Ohio, but a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to buy the team and prevent the transfer. The Canadiens struggled on the ice, finishing with the worst record {{in the league in}} 1935–36. The new owners asked Cecil Hart to coach the team, in the hopes that he would bring the Habs back to respectability. Hart agreed with one stipulation: that the Canadiens bring back Morenz. The team agreed, and acquired an overjoyed Morenz in a trade with the New York Rangers.|$|E
5|$|After {{a strong}} {{performance}} by rookie quarterback Browning Nagle in the team's 5–0 1992 preseason, Coslet promoted {{him to the}} starting lineup. Despite throwing {{for a total of}} 366 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the opener, then the second-highest yardage total for a quarterback making his NFL debut, the team lost 20–17; the Jets lost their first four games. Wide receiver Al Toon retired on November 27, 1992, having suffered the ninth concussion of his career earlier in the season. Two days later, defensive end Dennis Byrd collided with teammate Scott Mersereau when Chiefs quarterback Dave Krieg <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> in the pocket as the two players were about to sandwich him. Mersereau managed to walk away and continue his career with New York, but Byrd suffered a fracture to his C-5 vertebra that left him partially paralyzed. Inspired by Byrd's persistent high spirits, New York traveled to Buffalo the following week and defeated the AFC champion Bills. The Jets finished the season 4–12.|$|E
5|$|Berryman's Duntroon {{class had}} not yet {{completed}} its military training. Major General William Throsby Bridges decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he assigned the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), rather than as staff officers. Cadets were given the choice of service in the infantry or light horse. One cadet, Lawrence Wackett, protested that he wished {{to serve in the}} technical services. When asked if they would prefer the technical services, twelve cadets, including Berryman, Beavis, Clowes, Vasey, and Wackett <b>stepped</b> <b>forward.</b> Berryman was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Permanent Military Forces (PMF) on 29 June 1915 and again in the First AIF on 1 July 1915. He was posted to Lieutenant Colonel Harold Grimwade's 4th Field Artillery Brigade of the 2nd Division Artillery, along with Vasey and Milford. Berryman embarked for Egypt with the 4th Field Artillery Brigade on the transport Wiltshire on 17 November 1915. In Egypt, Berryman briefly commanded the 4th Brigade Ammunition Column before it was absorbed into the 2nd Division Ammunition Column.|$|E
5000|$|A pawn {{on a point}} {{having no}} {{diagonal}} connections moves and captures one <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b> A pawn on a point having one or more diagonal connections moves one <b>step</b> straight <b>forward,</b> and captures one <b>step</b> diagonally <b>forward.</b> As in chess, pawns may optionally advance two <b>steps</b> straight <b>forward</b> on their first move, en passant captures are possible, and promotion occurs at the last [...]|$|R
25|$|Observant Jews {{have the}} custom to take three steps {{back and then}} three <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> {{both before and after}} reciting the Amidah. The steps {{backward}} at the beginning represent withdrawing one's attention from the material world, and then <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> to symbolically approach the King of Kings. The Mekhilta notes that the significance of the three steps is based on the three barriers that Moses had to pass through at Sinai before entering God's realm. The Mishnah Berurah wrote that only the <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> are necessary, while the backward steps beforehand are a prevalent custom.|$|R
50|$|Yon-no: <b>Step</b> <b>forward</b> with a {{downward}} vertical cut; repeat.|$|R
5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris picking it up signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that should he be proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing the challenges and accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. If the case could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, {{the second}} stage in the legal process began when both Carrouges and Le Gris, with their followers, {{presented}} themselves before the Parlement of Paris at the Palais de Justice to issue the formal challenge. This involved reciting their accusations and throwing down a gauntlet signifying their intention to fight. The declarations were pronounced {{in front of the}} King, his brother Louis of Valois and the entire Parlement, who decided to initially hear the case as an ordinary criminal one and defer their decision on whether to permit the judicial duel until both sides had given testimony. Attempts had been made to persuade Le Gris to insist on a church trial, but these proved unsuccessful as Le Gris wished to counter the accusation with a lawsuit against his opponent claiming 40,000 livres for defamation. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic {{doctrine of the}} Eucharist, the most sensitive area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} debates over the nature of the Eucharist.|$|E

5|$|Several investors <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> with {{offers to}} buy the Buccaneers after Culverhouse's death, {{including}} Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, New York Yankees owner (and Tampa resident) George Steinbrenner, and Massachusetts developer Socrates Babacas. In response to the ensuing publicity, the trust administering Culverhouse's estate then issued a statement that the team was not for sale. They reversed their position two months later, as a poor early-season record led to declining fan support and revenues. The decision to sell the franchise came {{on the same day}} that Joy filed a $25 million claim against Hugh's estate. Hugh had paid $16 million for the franchise, which was now valued at $142 million. With Barnett Bank filing claims for $20.8 million against the Culverhouse estate, the trustees came very close to accepting Angelos' $200 million offer, which would have involved relocating the team to Baltimore, Maryland. Fearful of losing the team, civic leaders presented a proposal guaranteeing ticket sales of at least 55,000 for all home games for the next two years. The team was eventually sold to Palm Beach, Florida businessman Malcolm Glazer for $192 million, at that moment the largest price ever paid for a professional sports franchise.|$|E
5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell said. When the registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{residents}} of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One {{of the oldest and}} most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.|$|E
