50|$|<b>Single</b> <b>bevel</b> knives are knives {{made in the}} Japanese {{tradition}} and have an omote (front or face on the right for right-handers), a shinogi (where the front bevel meets the flat of the blade face), and a urasuki (backside hollow to release food). These knives are usually a little thicker at the spine and body than Japanese double bevels but are thinner right behind the edge. They leave a better surface finish but the produce must bend a further distance due to the thickness. These are the knives of the established traditional Japanese cuisine and were originally developed from double bevel knives from China. They are sharpened along the <b>single</b> <b>bevel</b> by applying pressure to the shinogi to raise it and to the edge. Honbadzuke is the initial sharpening to form a flat surface along {{the perimeter of the}} urasuki to strengthen it, straighten the backside, and lay geometry for future sharpening. The omote is sharpened much more than the urasuki {{in order to maintain the}} function of the <b>single</b> <b>bevel.</b> Kansai style knives usually have pointed tip for use standing up (which helps in decorative tip work) and Edo style knives have a square tip for use sitting down (which makes a more robust working knife). The standard Japanese knife kit includes the yanagiba, deba, and usuba. They are essential to Washoku (Japanese cuisine).|$|E
5000|$|Flat grind — The blade tapers all the {{way from}} the spine to the edge from both sides. A lot of metal is removed from the blade and is thus more {{difficult}} to grind, one factor that limits its commercial use. It sacrifices edge durability in favor of more sharpness. A true, flat ground knife having only a <b>single</b> <b>bevel</b> is somewhat of a rarity.|$|E

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) as alternatives to conventional austenitic {{stainless steels}} {{for the construction of}} pipelines is becoming more wide-spread, particularly for sour service applications where corrosion resistance / stress corrosion cracking resistance is required in aggressive chloride / sulphide environments. While these steels show many superior characteristics, limitations are associated with the welding of these steels, particularly controlling the weld structure and properties and understanding how the weld metallurgy may influence the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). The focus {{of this paper is to}} report on the findings from a detailed study of the various weld sections within a DSS pipeline, as a function of heat input and type of weld, in terms of the metallurgical structure, composition and mechanical properties and to assess the susceptibility to IGC. Welding was performed using the manual Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) technique at both high and low heat input conditions. Two different join configurations (double <b>bevel</b> <b>single</b> V <b>bevel</b> and double <b>bevel</b> <b>single</b> U joint configuration) were adopted. Structural analysis consisted of (i) optical microscopy of welded specimens; (ii) ferrite content determination; (iii) Vickers hardness measurements; (iv) Charpy impact studies and (v) transverse tensile testing. Two test methods namely a modified ASTM A 262 and a modified Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation (DL-ERP) test was used to determine susceptibility to IGC. The electrolyte solution used was 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 + 0. 001 M TA (thioacetamide). The test was conducted at 60 ºC. The potential was scanned from - 500 mV (SCE) to + 200 mV (SCE) and back to - 500 mV (SCE) at a rate of 1. 67 mV/s. The ratio of the reactivation charge to the passivation charge was calculated. From the results obtained it can be shown that the fill region was most susceptible to IGC for all weld conditions...|$|R
40|$|Understanding screech is {{especially}} important for the design of advanced aircraft because screech can cause sonic fatigue failure of aircraft structures. Although the connection between shock-cell spacing and screech frequency is well understood, the relation between non-uniformities in the shock-cell structures and the resulting amplitude, mode, and steadiness of screech have remained unexplored. This paper addresses the above issues by intentionally producing spanwise (larger nozzle dimension) variations in the shock-cell structures and studying the resulting spanwise screech mode. The spanwise oblique shock-cell structures were produced using imperfectly expanded convergent-divergent rectangular nozzles (aspect ratio = 5) with nonuniform exit geometries. Three geometries were studied: (a) a nozzle with a spanwise uniform edge, (b) a nozzle with a spanwise oblique (<b>single</b> <b>bevelled)</b> edge, and (c) a nozzle that had two spanwise oblique (double bevelled) cuts to form an arrowhead-shaped nozzle. For all nozzles considered, the screech mode was antisymmetric in the transverse (smaller nozzle dimension) direction allowing focus on changes in the spanwise direction. Three types of spanwise modes were observed: symmetric (1), antisymmetric (2), and oblique (3). The following significant results emerged: (1) for all cases the screech mode corresponds with the spanwise shock-cell structure, (2) when multiple screech modes are present, the technique presented here makes it possible to distinguish between coexisting and mutually exclusive modes, (3) the strength of shocks 3 and 4 influences the screech source amplitude and determines whether screech is unsteady. The results presented here offer hope for a better understanding of screech and for tailoring shock-containing jets to minimize fatigue failure of aircraft components...|$|R

5000|$|Japanese kitchen knives are knives made {{to varying}} degrees of {{adherence}} to the traditional blacksmithing techniques of Japan. Most knives {{are referred to as}} [...] (hōchō), or sometimes -bōchō (due to rendaku), but often have other names, like [...] ("… cutter").

5000|$|Double bevel or {{compound}} bevel — A back bevel, {{similar to}} a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This back bevel keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a <b>single</b> <b>bevel,</b> sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a <b>single</b> <b>bevel</b> blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the bevel is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double bevels are common {{in a variety of}} edge angles and back bevel angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have a double bevel, with an edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|E

5000|$|On a {{vertical}} band knife machine usually a narrow width band knife blade is used, {{the most common}} width being 10mm. The length of the band knife blade depends on the supplier of the band knife machine. The dimensions are indicated on a small metal tag pasted or riveted on the machine. The vertical machine band knife blade is most commonly a [...] "double bevel, double edge DBDE" [...] execution to enable cutting while advancing the table and also while retracting the work table, while as the [...] "double <b>bevel,</b> <b>single</b> edge DBSE" [...] execution cuts only in one direction. Productivity is enhanced when the operator cuts both while advancing and also while retracting the work table after adjusting the foam block after each pass for cutting. The DBDE execution blade can have a parallel or twisted 180 degrees welding. The twisted welding execution saves a grinding unit, as both edges pass the same grinding unit after two turns. It has been observed that a narrow width on {{a vertical}} band knife machine gives better dimensional accuracies on the foam block. The wider the vertical machine band knife - more the deflection and size variation {{from one end to}} the other extreme end.|$|R

Os grupos 3 - 8 foram restaurados com resina composta Z 250, pela técnica incremental. Os corpos-de-prova foram submetidos ao teste de resistência à fratura em máquina {{universal}} de ensaios, a uma velocidade de 0, 5 mm/min. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente pelos testes ANOVA, Tukey e exato de Fisher (α= 0, 05).

50|$|Generally, cutting axes have {{a shallow}} wedge angle, whereas {{splitting}} axes have a deeper angle. Most axes are double bevelled, i.e. symmetrical {{about the axis}} of the blade, but some specialist broadaxes have a <b>single</b> <b>bevel</b> blade, and usually an offset handle {{that allows them to}} be used for finishing work without putting the user's knuckles at risk of injury. Less common today, they were once an integral part of a joiner and carpenter's tool kit, not just a tool for use in forestry. A tool of similar origin is the billhook.

50|$|A broadaxe is a large-(broad) headed axe. There are two {{categories}} of cutting edge on broadaxes, both are used for shaping logs by hewing. On one type, one side is flat {{and the other side}} beveled, a basilled edge, also called a side axe, <b>single</b> <b>bevel,</b> or chisle-edged axe. On the other type, both sides are beveled, sometimes called a double bevel axe, which produces a scalloped cut.On the basilled broadaxe the handle may curve away from the flat side to allow an optimal stance by the hewer in relation to the hewn surface. The flat blade is to make the flat surface but can only be worked from one direction and are right-handed or left-handed. The double bevel axe has a straight handle can be swung with either side against the wood. A double beveled broad axe can be used for chopping or notching and hewing. When used for hewing, a notch is chopped {{in the side of the}} log down to a marked line, called scoring. The pieces of wood between these notches are removed with an axe called joggling and then the remaining wood is chopped away to the line.|$|E

Both converging (C) and converging-diverging (C-D) nozzles were built with asymmetrical (<b>single</b> <b>bevel)</b> and symmetrical (double bevel) exit chambers and with conventional straight exits for comparison. About a four decibel reduction of peak mixing noise was observed for the double bevelled C-D nozzle operated at design pressure ratio.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a fatigue assessment for multi-pass welds {{based on the}} simulation of a welding process, a post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) and a cyclic fatigue loading. The commercial software Virtual Weld Shop {{is used for the}} modelling of a welding process and PWHT. Welding induced residual stresses and the information about the material state can then be used in the fatigue analysis of the entire engine structure by the submodeling technique in ANSYS. Based on this calculation procedure a more accurate prediction of the component lifetime is possible. In order to validate the proposed approach an experimental setup with multi-pass <b>single</b> <b>bevel</b> butt weld is investigated. Temperature evolution during welding and X-ray measured residual stresses were compared with the results of simulation as well as failure behavior after cyclic loading.

40|$|Resonators {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of electronic products. They provide a stable reference frequency to ensure the operation of these products. Recently, the electronic products have the trend of miniaturization, which rendered the size reduction of the resonators as well [1]. Better design of the resonators relies on a better understanding of the crystals ' nonlinear behavior [2]. The nonlinearities affect the quality factor and acoustic behavior of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System) and nano-structured resonators and filters [3]. Among these nonlinear effects, Drivel Level Dependence (DLD), which describes the instability of the resonator frequency due to voltage level and/or power density, is an urgent problem for miniaturized resonators [2]. Langasite and GaPO 4 are new promising piezoelectric material. Resonators made from these new materials have superior performance such as good frequency-temperature characteristics, and low acoustic loss [2]. In this thesis, experimental measurements of drive level dependence of langasite resonators with different configurations (plano-plano, <b>single</b> <b>bevel,</b> and double bevel) are reported. The drive level dependence of GaPO 4 resonators are reported as well for the purpose of comparison. The results show that the resonator configuration affects the DLD of the langasite resonator. Experiments for DLD at elevated temperature are also performed, and it was found that the temperature also affects the DLD of the langasite resonator. i...|$|E
40|$|In many aero-engines, {{the power}} to drive {{accessories}} is transmitted through high speed bevel gears in a chamber {{in the center of}} the engine. The windage power loss (WPL) associated with these gears makes a significant contribution to the overall heat generation within the chamber. Shrouding the gears provides an effective method of reducing this WPL and managing the flow of lubricating oil. Experimental and computational programs at the University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems are providing an improved understanding of shroud performance and design. This paper presents the results from a pair of shrouded meshing gears run at representative speeds and oil flow in a rig with speed and torque measurement. A previously published study of a <b>single</b> <b>bevel</b> gear operating in air (Johnson, 2007, “Experimental Investigation Into Windage Power Loss From a Shrouded Spiral Bevel Gear” ASME Paper No. GT 2007 - 27885) found a reduction in torque of up to 70 % from shrouding. In this work, the addition of oil and the pinion gear did not lead to high torque due to the buildup of oil under the shrouds, but the reduction in torque due to fitting the shrouds is significantly less than was found for the same gear in air alone. In order to isolate the various parameters, further testing with a single gear was carried out. A fully (360 deg) shrouded gear shows a big improvement over an unshrouded gear when running in air alone, but much of this benefit disappears as soon as a very small amount of oil is introduced under the shroud. This implies that the oil is recirculating under the shroud. Increasing the oil flow beyond this initial level increases the torque by the amount required to accelerate the oil mass flow up to the peripheral speed of the gear. Providing a full width slot in the shroud downstream of the oil jet allows the oil to escape without any recirculation and restores much of the benefit of the shroud. Further insight into the oil behavior is obtained from torque measurements and observations through a transparent shroud and with various slot configurations. Video observation shows evidence of a vortex flow under the shroud that carries some of the oil toward the inner diameter of the gear. The three main windage contributors, air alone, recirculation of oil under the shroud, and acceleration of the feed oil, are quantified and methods for achieving the optimum design are discussed...|$|E
