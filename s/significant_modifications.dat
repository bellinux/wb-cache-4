5|$|<b>Significant</b> <b>modifications</b> to the {{algorithms}} used meant that a chipset intended for a four-function calculator {{was able to}} process scientific functions, but {{at the cost of}} reduced speed and accuracy. Compared to contemporary scientific calculators, some functions were slow to execute, and others had limited accuracy or gave the wrong answer, but the cost of the Sinclair was {{a fraction of the cost}} of competing calculators.|$|E
5|$|The {{politics}} of New Zealand are {{strongly influenced by}} British political culture. Although <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> have been made, New Zealand is governed by a democratic parliamentary framework comparable to the Westminster system, and retains Elizabeth II {{as the head of}} the monarchy of New Zealand. English is the dominant official language used in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} {{down some of}} the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E

5|$|Ornais and Dooneys Gate both {{suffered}} fatal {{falls on}} the first circuit. Ornais incurred a cervical fracture at the fourth fence (a plain 4ft 10-inch obstacle) and Dooneys Gate fractured his thoracolumbar at fence six (the 5ft Becher's Brook). Aintree had made <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> to its National Course in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some fences, but another notable change was highlighted in this race – that the course has been widened to allow more fences to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving chequered flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered by a tarpaulin on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, this time around the famous Becher's Brook, where veterinary staff attended to Dooneys Gate. This {{was the first time}} since the modern course was finalised in the 1880s that only 28 fences were jumped.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Intelligence Reform Law 25.520 {{came into}} effect, {{subsequently}} making <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> to SIDE's traditional internal organization, {{as well as}} branching out some of its tasks to other newly created {{organizations such as the}} National Directorate of Criminal Intelligence.|$|E
25|$|France {{was later}} {{purchased}} by Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) in 1979, renamed SS Norway and underwent <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> that better suited her for cruising duties. She {{was sold to}} be scrapped in 2006, and scrapping was completed in late 2008.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cartridge}} has its lineage in the [...]50 Action Express, {{starting with}} the L.A.R. Grizzly and in modern times, the Magnum Research Desert Eagle pistol, with <b>significant</b> <b>modification</b> to improve functionality and safety in the AR-15 rifle.|$|R
50|$|Later this {{draft was}} adopted with some {{modifications}} when the Nuclear Command Authority was announced on January 4, 2003. A <b>significant</b> <b>modification</b> was the dilution of the NFU principle to include nuclear retaliation to attacks by {{biological and chemical}} weapons.|$|R
25|$|Iguanodontians are {{a diverse}} but morphologically tight knit array of genera known from fossils {{of the late}} Cretaceous. <b>Significant</b> <b>modifications</b> include the {{evolution}} of tooth batteries, a ligament-bound metacarpus and a digitigrade hand posture. Tenontosaurus is the most basal iguanodontian. Others include Iguanodon, Camptosaurus and Muttaburrasaurus.|$|E
25|$|No <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> {{were made}} to the design. The tank vent was found to {{restrict}} the driver's vision and was moved further forward from 80059. Initially built with fluted coupling rods, these caused problems on other classes and from 80079 plain section coupling rods were substituted.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{fluoxetine}} {{has been}} demonstrated to increase serotonergic activity in fish, subsequently reducing aggressive behavior. Perinatal exposure to fluoxetine at relevant environmental concentrations {{has been shown to}} lead to <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> of memory processing in 1-month-old cuttlefish. This impairment may disadvantage cuttlefish and decrease their survival. Somewhat less than 10% of orally administered fluoxetine is excreted from humans unchanged or as glucuronide.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of HDcctv {{is that it does}} not require <b>significant</b> <b>modification</b> for existing CCTV systems designed for analog cameras originally using composite NTSC or PAL video, for which extensive cabling and labor was invested for installation of the original analog system.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{after-market}} cooling {{systems for}} the 7800 GS, stock cooling in the GeForce 7800 GS AGP is adequate. The board layout is radically different from other GeForce 7 boards so no universal aftermarket coolers would fit without <b>significant</b> <b>modification</b> to their mounting mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the disk}} laser, {{the heat sink}} {{does not have to}} be transparent, so, it can be {{extremely}} efficient even with large transverse size [...] of the device (Fig.1).The increase in size allows the power scaling to many kilowatts without <b>significant</b> <b>modification</b> of the design.|$|R
25|$|In Moscow, he was {{responsible}} for the reconstruction of medieval Red Square in a fashionable neo-Palladian mode. Count Nicholas Sheremetev engaged him to devise a theatre hall in the Ostankino Palace and a semicircular collonnade for the Sheremetev Hospital. Most of Quarenghi's designs intended for Moscow were subsequently realized with <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> by other architects, {{as was the case with}} Gostiny Dvor (1789–1805), Catherine Palace (1782–87), and Sloboda Palace (1790–94).|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 film The Damned United, Saltergate {{stood in}} for Wembley Stadium, Carrow Road, Bloomfield Road and most prominently, Derby County's Baseball Ground (demolished in 2003). The ground {{was chosen because}} it had not had any <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> since the 1970s, though some {{repainting}} work {{was done by the}} production team to differentiate the various locations represented. Saltergate's film role earnt the club added income of £50,000 in 2007-08.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Einstein's position underwent <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> {{over the}} course of the years. In the first stage, Einstein refused to accept quantum indeterminism and sought to demonstrate that the principle of indeterminacy could be violated, suggesting ingenious thought experiments which should permit the accurate determination of incompatible variables, such as position and velocity, or to explicitly reveal simultaneously the wave and the particle aspects of the same process.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} they were listed on the Register the Knickerbocker was in use as a Hertz rental-car location.

30|$|Removing {{the gravity}} effect is very effective, since {{it led to}} <b>significant</b> <b>modification</b> {{with respect to the}} gravity {{signature}} on the Bouguer map. The strip off results at the pre-Miocene level exhibit two gravity minima which was interpreted to be the expression of two sedimentary piles.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1960, a <b>significant</b> <b>modification</b> was {{accomplished}} when Betelgeuse was modified to carry Polaris missiles and components {{in support of the}} Fleet Ballistic Missile program. This modification changed the mission of Betelgeuse from a fleet resupply ship to a link in the Polaris program.|$|R
25|$|Leland D. Bryan built {{a series}} of roadable {{aircraft}} using an Ercoupe fuselage, calling this line the Bryan Autoplane. <b>Significant</b> <b>modifications</b> included a double-articulated folding wing mechanism and a pusher engine. It still retained Ercoupe features, such as the twin tail and the center section. The first flight was in 1953, and the model II flew 65 hours. The Model III with a single wing-fold mechanism crashed in 1974, killing Bryan.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> to the {{property}} were undertaken. The owners added a service wing to {{the western side of}} the house, running from the original Georgian structure towards the walled garden. This wing contained the kitchens for the house (two in number), two dairies, pantries and store rooms, and servants' accommodation. This wing was damaged by fire in the 1950s, and demolished in the early 1970s. The westernmost portion of the wing remains, and is now in use as garages.|$|E
25|$|In Korea and Japan, phonetic {{systems were}} {{developed}} so that Chinese characters could {{be taught to}} the general public. Vietnam's educated class looked down on Nom as inferior to Han, so they {{were not interested in}} doing the work required to turn Nom into a form of writing suitable for mass communication. Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language and has nearly 5,000 distinct syllables. Neither the Korean nor the Japanese writing systems indicate tones, so they cannot be accurately applied to the Vietnamese language without <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> to their systems.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, she {{replaced}} the sailing ship Vasco da Gama as the Artillery School of the Portuguese Navy, conducting training missions up until 1878, when it completed her last training mission on sea in a voyage to the Azores islands. In this last voyage she rescued {{the crew of}} the American barque Lawrence Boston, which had caught fire off the Azores archipelago. After this, she remained permanently moored in Lisbon as the Naval Artillery School with <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> being made on her in 1889, with the replacement of her elegant masts, and the construction of two redoubts on both her sides for the placement of modern cannons, to better serve her role of artillery instruction unit.|$|E
25|$|The party's {{distinctive}} logo {{was designed}} in 1968 by painter and poet Roland Giguère. It {{consists of a}} stylised letter Q, represented by a blue circle broken by a red arrow. The creator meant it as an allegory of the Parti Québécois breaking the circle of colonialism which he claimed Canada was imposing on Quebec and opening Quebec upon {{the world and the}} future. The PQ has made very few <b>significant</b> <b>modifications</b> to its logo during its history. In 1985 it made the circle and arrow slightly thicker, and placed the tip of the latter at the centre of the circle. The original saw it span the whole diameter. When placed upon a blue background instead of a white one, the circle was commonly turned to white, the single main design variation currently observed.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} 1977 that the phrase [...] "A Canadian citizen is a British subject" [...] ceased {{to be used in}} Canadian passports.
