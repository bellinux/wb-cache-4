5|$|In late 1980 Matlock {{had been}} {{appointed}} Ambassador to Czechoslovakia by President Jimmy Carter. However, the appointment was not ratified by the Senate before Carter’s election loss, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> Ronald Reagan’s re-appointment in 1981 that he became Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. During his tenure, {{he was able to}} help resolve a major impediment to good relations: the return of 18.4 tons of gold that had been looted by the Nazis in World War II and kept, ever since its recovery by Allied forces, in American and British banks.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Army started World War II underprepared {{and short}} of modern weapons and equipment. It had not {{expected}} to be involved in any hostilities and had been advised after the outbreak of war in Europe, by the British government, that it was unlikely to be required at all. <b>So,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> some surprise when the 4th Infantry and 5th Infantry divisions were requested to serve in the North African and East African Campaigns and four mule companies to join the British Expeditionary Force in France.|$|E
25|$|It was discovered, {{that due}} to certain {{statutes}} of English law, Thomas Wake's heirs or successors {{would have been able}} to order the future demolition of the Priory. It was for this reason that the Pope granted further license that the Priory should be moved to another suitable location, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> permission from both the Pope and Edward II that Thomas Wake moved the monastery to Newton – a now deserted medieval village located two miles south of Cottingham.|$|E

25|$|The adidas Golden Ball {{could only}} {{go to one}} of the members of the victorious Ghanaian side, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>with</b> Lamptey taking home a very special {{souvenir}} from his Italian sojourn. Lamptey was the beating heart of a very good side. His fast feet, speed of thought, and clever interplay with captain Alex Opoku and fellow midfielders Mohammed Gargo and Emmanuel Duah were on display for all to see. His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top-goalscorer.|$|E
25|$|And <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> As the World Turns, {{with its}} slow-moving {{psychological}} character studies of families headed by legal and medical professionals. The {{personal and professional}} lives of doctors and lawyers remained central to As the World Turns throughout its run, and eventually became standard fare on many soap operas. Whereas the 15-minute radio soaps often focused on one central, heroic character (for example, Dr. Jim Brent in Phillips' Road of Life), the expanded 30-minute format of As the World Turns enabled Phillips to introduce a handful of professionals {{within the framework of}} a family saga.|$|E
25|$|Racism {{rests on}} two basic assumptions: that a {{correlation}} exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks. Racism, thus defined, {{is a modern}} conception, for prior to the XVIth century there was virtually nothing in the life and thought of the West that {{can be described as}} racist. To prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and ethnocentrism... The Ancient Hebrews, in referring to all who were not Hebrews as Gentiles, were indulging in ethnocentrism, not in racism.... <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> the Hellenes who denominated all non-Hellenes—whether the wild Scythians or the Egyptians whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts of civilization—Barbarians, the term denoting that which was strange or foreign.|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Joanna Johnston created 60 {{different versions}} of Ray's leather jacket, to illustrate the degrees to which he is weathered {{from the beginning of}} the journey to the end. [...] "He begins with the jacket, a hoodie, and two t-shirts," [...] explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning's costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: [...] "I wanted her to have something that made her feel safe, some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face," [...] Johnston notes. [...] "That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> her at all times."

500|$|Compounding the {{pressure}} during what Harrison himself would {{refer to as}} [...] "the naughty period, 1973–74", he was drinking heavily and had returned to his drug-taking ways of the 1960s. Some of Harrison's biographers suggest that this abandoning of the [...] "semi-ascetic" [...] path espoused on his 1973 album Living in the Material World was Harrison's reaction to the media's sniping, particularly in Britain, at the pious content of that album, {{as well as a}} reflection of Harrison's despondency over the failure of his first marriage. These two issues informed the lyrics to a new Harrison song, [...] "Dark Horse". Friend and confidant Klaus Voormann has described this time as an obvious [...] "step back" [...] on Harrison's spiritual journey, while Boyd would later write: [...] "That whole period was insane. Friar Park was a madhouse. Our lives were fuelled by alcohol and cocaine, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> everyone who came into our sphere... George used cocaine excessively and I think it changed him." [...] Harrison addressed this behaviour in [...] "Simply Shady" [...] and laid out his feelings on the couple's inevitable split in [...] "So Sad".|$|E

2500|$|Although the shogunate imposed punishments {{including}} {{death by}} burning {{to crack down}} on arson, its punishments for fire accidents were nowhere near as harsh. Those of the samurai class who caused a fire would be acquitted if they managed to extinguish it within their residences; <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> the chōnin if the fire remained small. Although the council of [...] considered proposals to impose harsh penalties including death and exile in the case of great fires, such proposals were never adopted. Anecdotal reasoning held that fire accidents at the time could befall anyone, and that the rōjū questioned their readiness to commit seppuku should they themselves accidentally start a great fire.|$|E
2500|$|Under Uzbeg and his {{successor}} Janibeg (1342–1357), Islam, which {{among some of the}} Turks in Eurasia had deep roots going back into pre-Mongol times, gained general acceptance, though its adherents remained tolerant of other beliefs. In order to successfully expand Islam, the Mongols built a mosque and other [...] "elaborate places" [...] requiring baths — an important element of Muslim culture. Sarai attracted merchants from other countries. The slave trade flourished due to strengthening ties with the Mamluk Sultanate. Growth of wealth and increasing demand for products typically produce population growth, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> Sarai. Housing in the region increased, which transformed the capital into the center of a large Muslim Sultanate.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} why the consecration of the Levites in [...] followed {{soon after the}} presentation of the twelve tribes' offerings in [...] The Midrash noted that while the twelve tribes presented offerings at the dedication of the altar, the tribe of Levi did not offer anything. The Levites thus complained that they had been held back from bringing an offering for the dedication of the altar. The Midrash compared this to the case of a king who held a feast and invited various craftsmen, but did not invite a friend of whom the king was quite fond. The friend was distressed, thinking that perhaps the king harbored some grievance against him. But when the feast was over, the king called the friend and told him that while the king had made a feast for all the citizens of the province, the king would make a special feast with the friend alone, because of his friendship. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> God, who accepted the offerings of the twelve tribes in [...] and then turned to the tribe of Levi, addressing Aaron in [...] and directing the consecration of the Levites in ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Tanhuma {{taught that}} Moses prostrated himself before the Israelites {{and said to}} them the words of [...] "You are to pass over the Jordan," [...] noting that he would not. Moses gave the Israelites the {{opportunity}} to pray for him, but they did not. The Midrash compared this to a king who had many children by a noble lady. The lady was undutiful {{to him and he}} decided to divorce her. He told her {{that he was going to}} marry another wife. She asked who, and he told her. She summoned her children and told them that their father intended to divorce her and marry the other woman, and asked the children if they could bear being subjected to her. She thought that perhaps they would understand what she meant and would intercede with their father on her behalf, but they did not understand. As they did not understand, she commanded them only for their own sake to be mindful of the honor of their father. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> Moses.

2500|$|This {{conclusion}} {{on human}} unity {{was supported by}} monogenism, including John Bachman's evidence that intercrossed human races were fully fertile. Proponents of polygenism opposed unity, but the gradual transition from one race to another confused them {{when they tried to}} decide how many human races should count as species: Louis Agassiz said eight, but Morton said twenty-two. Darwin commented that the [...] "question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of late years been much agitated by anthropologists, who are divided into two schools of monogenists and polygenists." [...] The latter had to [...] "look at species either as separate creations or as in some manner distinct entities". but those accepting evolution [...] "will feel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single primitive stock". Although races differed considerably, they also shared so many features [...] "that it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races." [...] He drew on his memories of Jemmy Button and John Edmonstone to emphasise [...] "the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man. The American aborigines, Negroes and Europeans differ as much from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the Beagle, with the many little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> a full-blooded negro with whom I happened once to be intimate." [...] Darwin concluded that [...] "...when the principles of evolution are generally accepted, as they surely will be before long, the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a silent and unobserved death." ...|$|E
