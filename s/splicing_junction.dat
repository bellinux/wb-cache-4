50|$|Protein {{splicing}} is an intramolecular {{reaction of}} a particular protein in which an internal protein segment (called an intein) is removed from a precursor protein with a ligation of C-terminal and N-terminal external proteins (called exteins) on both sides.

The protein splicing reactions which are known now do not require exogenous cofactors or energy sources such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP).

40|$|Protein {{splicing}} is {{a compelling}} chemical reaction in which two proteins are produced posttranslationally from a single precursor polypeptide by excision of the internal protein segment and ligation of the flanking regions. This unique autocatalytic reaction was first discovered in the yeast Vma 1 p protozyme where the 50 -kD site-specific endonuclease (VDE) is excised from the 120 -kD precursor containing the N-and C-terminal regions of the catalytic subunit of the vacuolar H(+) -ATPase. In this work, we randomized the conserved valine triplet residues three amino acids upstream of the C-terminal <b>splicing</b> <b>junction</b> in the Vma 1 protozyme and found that these site-specific random mutations interfere with normal protein splicing to different extents. Intragenic suppressor analysis has revealed that this particular hydrophobic triplet preceding the C-terminal <b>splicing</b> <b>junction</b> genetically interacts with three hydrophobic residues preceding the N-terminal <b>splicing</b> <b>junction.</b> This is the first evidence showing that the N-terminal portion of the V-ATPase subunit is involved in protein splicing.

In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of the entire rat GSTA 3 (rGST Yc 1) subunit gene. The rat GSTA 3 subunit gene is approximately 15 kb in length and consists of seven exons interrupted by introns of different lengths. Exon 1, with a length of 219 bp, contains only the 5 '-untranslated region of the gene. Each exon-intron <b>splicing</b> <b>junction</b> exhibited the consensus sequence for a mammalian splice site. The transcription start site and exon 1 of rat GSTA 3 were characterized by a combination of primer extension and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends. Position + 1 was identified 219 bp upstream of the first exon-intron <b>splicing</b> <b>junction.</b> The proximal promoter region of the rat GSTA 3 subunit gene does not contain typical TATA or CAAT boxes. A computer-based search for potential transcription-factor binding sites revealed the existence of a number of motifs such as anti-oxidant-responsive element, ras-response element, activator protein- 1, nuclear factor-kappaB, cAMP-response-element-binding protein, Barbie box and E box. The functional activity of the regulatory region of the rat GSTA 3 subunit gene was shown by its ability to drive the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in rat mammary carcinoma cells, and its activity was greater in melphalan-resistant cells known to have transcriptional activation of this gene by previous studies. The structure of the gene, with a large intron upstream of the translation-initiation site, may explain why the isolation of this promoter has been so elusive. This information will provide the opportunity to examine the involvement of the rat GSTA 3 subunit gene in drug resistance and carcinogenesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlternative {{splicing}} is {{an important}} mechanism mediating the function of genes in multicellular organisms. Recently, we discovered a new splicing-junction wobble mechanism that generates subtle alterations in mRNA by randomly selecting tandem 5 ′ and 3 ′ splicing-junction sites. Here we developed a sensitive approach to identify such splicing-junction wobble isoforms using polymerase chain reaction amplification with fluorescence-labeled primers encompassing the wobble-splicing boundary and capillary electrophoresis. Using the ING 4 wobble isoforms as an example, we demonstrated that capillary electrophoresis can precisely separate DNA fragments with a small difference in size (< 3 nt) {{and can be used}} to quantify the expression ratio, which thus measures the distribution of each splicing-junction wobble isoform in tissues. Based on our analyses of several genes, the relative ratio of each wobble-splicing isoform tends to be constant among various tissues. The occasional observed tissue heterogeneity of wobble-splicing transcripts can be generated only by genomic single-nucleotide polymorphisms around the <b>splicing</b> <b>junction...</b>|$|E

Thus, the gene detection problem is reduced to that of analyzing the paths in the graph G. A dynamic programming algorithm is used to find the optimal path in G. The proposed system is trained using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and its performance on vertebrate gene prediction is evaluated using the 10 -way cross-validation method.

40|$|Abstract—Gene, {{principal}} unit of inheritance, is an ordered {{sequence of}} nucleotides. The genes of eukaryotic organisms include alternating segments of exons and introns. The region of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) within a gene containing instructions for coding a protein is called exon.

This paper proposes to determine <b>splice</b> <b>junctions</b> that are exon-intron boundaries by analyzing DNA sequences. A <b>splice</b> <b>junction</b> can be either exon-intron (EI) or intron exon (IE).

The mutation activated several cryptic splice sites and generated the production of seven erroneous splicing isoforms, which we confirmed by sequencing of RT-PCR products and resequencing of cDNA clones.

Subsequently, the expression levels of SEDL among the affected patients, carriers and controls were estimated using real-time quantitative PCR. Expression analyses showed that the expression levels of SEDL in both patients and carriers were decreased. Taken together, these results illustrated how disruption of the AT donor site in a rare AT–AC intron, leading to a canonical GT donor site, resulted in a multitude of aberrant transcripts, thus impairing exon definition.

The majority of the inteins identified to date consist of two structurally and functionally independent domains: the homing endonuclease domain and the splicing domain (2). Although the basic steps of intein splicing has been well documented (for a review, see (3)), the atomic details of the splicing mechanism is still lacking. Advancing the understanding of the mechanism of intein splicing can have two major impacts. First, inteins have found extensive applications in protein engineering and biotechnology and therefore are an indispensable tool for biomedical research. Second, inteins are potential targets for antibiotic development because only unicellular organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis have inteins that are vital for their survival. Many structural studies of inteins have been carried out (4 – 7). All intein splicing domains have the Hint (hedgehog intein) fold, shared by the Hedgehog C-terminal autoprocessing domain (4 – 7).

In order to widen biotechnological applications of protein trans-splicing, it is highly desirable to have split inteins with shorter C-terminal fragments, which can be chemically synthesized. Principal Findings: We report the identification of new functional split sites in DnaE inteins from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and from Nostoc punctiforme. One of the newly engineered split intein bearing C-terminal 15 residues showed more robust protein trans-splicing activity than {{naturally occurring}} split DnaE inteins in a foreign context. During {{the course of our}} experiments, we found that protein ligation by protein trans-splicing depended not only on the <b>splicing</b> <b>junction</b> sequences, but also on the foreign extein sequences.
