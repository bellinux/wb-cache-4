25|$|The Livonian dialect of Latvian {{was more}} {{affected}} by the Livonian language substratum than Latvian {{in other parts of}} Latvia. It is divided into the Vidzeme variety and the Courland variety (also called tāmnieku or ventiņu). There are two intonations in the Livonian dialect. In Courland short vowels in the endings of words are discarded, while long vowels are shortened. In all genders and numbers only one form of the verb is used. Personal names in both genders are derived with endings– els, -ans. In prefixes ie is changed to e. Due to migration and the introduction of a standardised language this dialect has declined. It arose from assimilated Livonians, who <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in Latvian and assimilated Livonian grammar into Latvian.|$|E
500|$|Cousy was {{the only}} son of poor French {{immigrants}} living in New York City. He {{grew up in the}} Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan's East Side, {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression. His father Joseph was a cab driver, who earned extra income by moonlighting. The elder Cousy had served in the German Army during World War I. Shortly after the war, his first wife died of pneumonia, leaving behind a young daughter. He married Julie Corlet, a secretary and French teacher from Dijon. At the time of the 1930 census, the family was renting an apartment in Astoria, Queens, for $50 per month. [...] The younger Cousy spoke French for the first 5 years of his life, and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> English only after entering primary school. He spent his early days playing stickball in a multicultural environment, regularly playing with African Americans, Jews and other ethnic minority children. These experiences ingrained him with a strong anti-racist sentiment, an attitude he prominently promoted during his professional career. When he was 12, his family moved to a rented house in St. Albans, Queens. That summer, the elder Cousy put a $500 down payment for a $4,500 house four blocks away. [...] He rented out the bottom two floors of the three-story building to tenants to help make his mortgage payments on time.|$|E

50|$|The main {{concept of}} Europanto {{is that there}} are no fixed rules—merely a set of suggestions.

2500|$|Julius Caesar conquered Gaul in 57 BC. [...] The Low Countries {{became part}} of the larger Gallia Belgica {{province}} which originally stretched from southwestern Germany to Normandy and {{the southern part of the}} Netherlands.

He brought with him {{the law of the}} Grand Council, the OdG Grandi and the letter of Cianetti. The King awaited him {{at the foot of the}} patio stair of the villa. The Duce <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> trying to {{convince}} Victor Emmanuel that the OdG had no legal value, and that many of its supporters had changed their minds in the night. The King interrupted him, and told him softly that the country was broken and that the situation required him to quit his post: the new President of the Council of Ministers would be Marshal Badoglio. Mussolini, visibly shaken, answered: [...] "Then is it over? It is over, it is over. But what will happen to me, to my family?". The King assured him that he would personally take care of his security and that of his family. Victor Emmanuel accompanied him to the door, where he met Captain Vigneri. The Duce went to his car, but the captain told him to go to a nearby ambulance, for his security. Mussolini answered that there was no need for that, but followed the captain. When the rear door opened, he saw three Carabinieri and three policemen sitting on the side banks, and said: [...] "The policemen too? No!"

50|$|Total {{physical}} {{response is}} an example of the comprehension approach to language teaching. Methods in the comprehension approach emphasize the importance of listening to language development, and do not require spoken output in the early stages of learning. In total physical response, students are not forced <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Instead, teachers wait until students acquire enough language through listening that they <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> spontaneously. At the beginning stages of instruction students can respond to the instructor in their native language.|$|R

Nor did they suddenly <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Etruscan.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the interpreter’s speeches using an aligned simultaneous monologue in-terpreting corpus. The following points have been investigated: (1) the interpreter’s speaking speed, (2) the interpreting unit of simultaneous in-terpretation, and (3) the difference between the beginning time of the lecturer’s utterance and that of the interpreter’s utterance. This paper also describes characteristic features about the timing at which profes-sional simultaneous interpreters <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> The analysis will be avail-able {{for the development of a}} simul-taneous machine interpreting system. ...|$|R
50|$|Specific {{language}} impairment (SLI) {{is diagnosed}} {{when a child}} has delayed or disordered language development for no apparent reason.

Spoken language may be immature. In many children with SLI, understanding of language, or receptive language, is also impaired, though this may not be obvious unless the child is given a formal assessment.|$|R
