5|$|Three decades later, the East–West Telegraph {{line was}} installed. Constructed between 1875 and 1877, it {{followed}} the same route across the Nullarbor and along the Great Australian Bight, after John Forrest retraced Eyre's route in 1870 and confirmed its suitability. Repeater stations were installed at Port Lincoln, <b>Streaky</b> Bay, Smoky Bay, Fowlers Bay, Eucla, Israelite Bay, Esperance, and Bremer Bay. Stations were later added at Franklin Harbour (Cowell) in 1885, Yardea in 1896, and Balladonia in 1897.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} <b>streaky</b> features, {{some of them}} {{hundreds}} of kilometers in length, {{that appear to be}} caused by windblown particles. Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth; the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been filled in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150meters. Occasional elevation changes of 500meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height.|$|E
5|$|Play {{finally began}} after the tea, and the pitch played very slowly {{because of the}} excess moisture. As Australia had no {{intention}} of chasing the runs, England captain Norman Yardley often installed seven men in close catching positions. In the first half-hour, the tourists showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Johnson then fell for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Bradman came to the crease and played 11 balls without scoring while Morris scored two <b>streaky</b> fours from Bedser. Yardley used his spinners for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike by taking singles. The Australian skipper faced only eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled when his partner wanted a single that he sent him back. Thereafter, the tourists batted steadily and defensively to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 from 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens; this was the slowest innings run rate for the series to date. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century during the Test series. The match finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions.|$|E
25|$|Transport to {{and from}} <b>Streaky</b> Bay is usually done by car via the Flinders Highway, but bus {{services}} {{to and from}} Adelaide do operate, as does the <b>Streaky</b> Bay Airport.

25|$|In the US and Europe, bacon is {{commonly}} used as a condiment or topping on other foods, often {{in the form of}} bacon bits. <b>Streaky</b> bacon is more commonly used as a topping in the US on such items as pizza, salads, sandwiches, hamburgers, baked potatoes, hot dogs, and soups. In the US, sliced smoked back bacon is used less frequently than the <b>streaky</b> variety, but can sometimes be found on pizza, salads, and omelettes.|$|E

25|$|If <b>streaky</b> {{pork belly}} bacon sliced in cubes {{is being used}} for lard preparation, as {{traditionally}} in Germany, the parts with higher melting temperatures are roasted {{and stay in the}} lard. The result is Griebenschmalz, a famous spread.|$|E
25|$|Wheat growing {{began in}} the 1880s and by 1906, 31,000 bags of wheat and 470 bales of wool had been {{exported}} from <b>Streaky</b> Bay by ship. By this time a telegraph office had been established and regular mail deliveries were made from Port Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|The town of Smoky Bay {{lies on the}} bay of {{the same}} name, north of <b>Streaky</b> Bay. The bay is {{shielded}} from ocean swells by a small promenade of land that leads to Point Brown. Around 10km offshore lies 'Eyre Island', a small, sandy island that also protects the bay.|$|E
25|$|N.C. State quarterback Daniel Evans {{threw for}} 347yards and 3 touchdowns while wide {{receiver}} Donal Bowens {{was on the}} receiving end of 202 of those yards.

25|$|The {{inland areas}} of the {{district}} are largely dominated by pastoral country; however {{areas such as the}} Calpatanna Waterhole Conservation Park located 30km SE of <b>Streaky</b> Bay represents an example of the original coastal and salt lake environments, where wildlife still abounds. Possibly the areas most interesting geological features are Murphy's Haystacks. These pink granite formations have been dated at 1590 million years old.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form sold is 'middle bacon', which {{includes}} the more of the <b>streaky,</b> fatty section of side bacon along with {{a portion of the}} loin of back bacon. In response to increasing consumer diet-consciousness, some supermarkets also offer the loin section only. This is sold as 'short cut bacon' and is usually priced slightly higher than middle bacon. Both varieties are usually available with the rind removed.|$|E
25|$|A {{fortnight}} later, on 25 August 1839, Edward John Eyre, who had explored overland from Port Lincoln, {{arrived at}} this locality {{and established a}} small base about 3 kilometres from {{what is now the}} <b>Streaky</b> Bay Township which he used as a store for his overland expeditions to Point Bell. This site, known as Eyre's Waterhole, is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register, and can still be seen today just off the Flinders Highway.|$|E
25|$|An extra {{half-hour of}} play was allowed, {{as a result}} was nearing, but Warne and Clarke defied the English. Warne was lucky {{on more than one}} occasion, playing <b>streaky</b> shots that could easily have got him out, but he did smash Giles for 12 in one over. He was not out {{overnight}} – however, Steve Harmison, bowling his third spell of the day, brought the third day's proceedings to an end with a slow delivery that was not read correctly by Clarke, who missed the ball completely to be bowled. England now only needed two wickets on the fourth day – Australia, however, needed 107 runs for the victory.|$|E
25|$|Rob Barnes in turn helped recruit {{several young}} stars. Canadian import Ray Sheffield, {{sponsored}} by HISS as a rink manager, {{was promoted to}} team captain, a title that he retains to this day. Although the North Stars had a somewhat <b>streaky</b> season, they finished in 2nd place and defeated the Sydney Bears 7–4 in the semi-final. Minor Premiers the Adelaide Avalanche were eliminated by the Western Sydney Ice Dogs. In the final, the North Stars defeated the Ice Dogs 4 goals to 1 and won their first ever Goodall Cup. It {{was also the first}} time the AIHL had awarded the Goodall Cup through a tournament-style playoff series. Top-scorer and Most Valuable Player for the North Stars in 2003 was Daryl Bat (York Lions).|$|E
25|$|England's {{difficulties}} {{continued in}} the morning. Despite McGrath not getting nearly as much swing, Hoggard departed for an eight-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Shane Warne to Hayden in the slips. Throwing caution to the wind, Pietersen launched himself into his natural game, taking 21 runs off seven deliveries before finally being out caught by Damien Martyn, a splendid catch just metres off the ropes, as England looked to subside for 130. However, in yet another twist, Simon Jones and Harmison fought back with some <b>streaky</b> accumulation, pairing up for 33 to reduce Australia's lead to 35 runs. England also got a good start fielding, Pietersen having a flat throw at the stumps to run out Langer for 6, but Hayden and Ricky Ponting rebuilt well.|$|E
25|$|That they did. Jones {{kept his}} head, {{managing}} 12 runs in his 42-minute {{stay at the}} crease with some <b>streaky</b> fours, while Flintoff smacked Lee everywhere. Flintoff also took runs off Kasprowicz, with one over yielding 20 runs for England, including a couple of no balls. At one point during Flintoff's innings, Ponting had nine men on the boundary, something rarely seen in cricket. One six hit by Flintoff landed {{on top of the}} stands. Flintoff ended with 73 – the only man to pass 25 for England – before being bowled by Warne. Warne finished with stunning figures of six for 46 from 23.1 overs, having bowled unchanged from the seventh over till the end – but, as luck and Australia's batsmen would have it, his failure to get Flintoff out earlier would be crucial.|$|E
25|$|England's {{difficulties}} {{continued in}} the morning. Despite McGrath not getting nearly as much swing, Hoggard departed for an eight-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Shane Warne to Hayden in the slips. Throwing caution to the wind, Pietersen launched himself into his natural game, taking twenty-one runs off seven deliveries before finally being out caught by Damien Martyn, a splendid catch just metres off the ropes, as England looked to subside for 130. However, in yet another twist, Simon Jones and Harmison fought back with some <b>streaky</b> accumulation, pairing up for 33 – the fifth-highest partnership of the game thus far – to reduce Australia's lead to 35 runs. England also got a good start fielding, Pietersen having a flat throw at the stumps to run out Langer for 6, but Hayden and Ricky Ponting rebuilt well.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the Wild set a {{franchise}} record {{with the best}} win record in the first 41 games of the season. Immediately afterward, they went into a skid, losing the next 13 of 14 games, culminating in the firing of head coach Mike Yeo. Under new interim head coach John Torchetti, the team snapped the losing streak but remained <b>streaky</b> {{throughout the rest of}} the season, managing to barely make the playoffs with a total of 87 points, the worst record of any playoff team in the shootout era (since 2005-06). In the first round, the Wild fell to the Central Division champion Dallas Stars in 6 games. During the 2016 offseason, the Wild acquired Eric Staal through free agency, and signed him to a three-year deal. The Wild also hired Bruce Boudreau as their new head coach, replacing interim head coach John Torchetti.|$|E
25|$|Then, Bangladesh {{lost their}} heads. Ashraful {{attempted}} a big heave off Herath, but {{was caught by}} Dilhara Fernando in the deep. Two overs later, Tushar Imran was bowled by Herath, but the killing blow came with the next delivery. A throw from close in ran out Habibul Bashar - {{he had managed to}} get his bat over the line, but it bounced up and did not touch the ground when the ball hit the stumps. Bangladesh had lost three wickets for one run, and more was to come, as Muttiah Muralitharan and Herath took one wicket each within the space of six deliveries. At 158 for 7, Bangladesh batted for face, and debutant Syed Rasel tried with a <b>streaky</b> 19. He was last out, stumped off Herath, who ended with four for 38. In return, Sri Lanka played a bit more sedately, and none of their batsmen passed fifty in the 44 overs in their innings on day one, yet they only trailed 28 runs with seven wickets in hand.|$|E
25|$|Gáborík's {{second season}} with the Rangers, in 2010–11, was {{hampered}} by injury. Just three games into the season, he suffered a shoulder injury after receiving an illegal boarding hit {{in a game against}} the Toronto Maple Leafs. The injury caused him to miss nearly a month, and, upon his return, limited his playing style, which relies on his tremendous wrist shot. Perhaps due to lingering effects from his various ailments, Gáborík proved a <b>streaky</b> scorer throughout the season and finished with 22 goals and 26 assists in 62 games, though 12 of those goals came in four games. His best game of the season was on 19 January 2011, when Gáborík scored four goals and an assist in a 7–0 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs. For the first time since Gáborík had joined the team, the Rangers qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with a 5–2 win over the rival New Jersey Devils in the final game of the season. Gáborík contributed an assist on the game-winning goal, and a plus-minus rating of +2 during the game.|$|E
