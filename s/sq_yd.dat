50|$|While {{a number}} of large cities {{tentatively}} erected their first high-rise developments (e.g., Aston Cross in Birmingham, Churchill Gardens in Westminster), in England and Wales homes were typically semi-detached or in small terraces. A three-bedroom semi-detached council house was typically built on a square grid seven yards (21 ft) on the side, with a maximum density {{of no more than}} 12 houses per acre (30 houses per hectare; around 337 m² or 403 <b>sq.</b> <b>yd.</b> per house), meaning that most houses had generous space around them. The new towns and many existing towns had countless estates built to this basic model. In Scotland, the tradition of tenement living meant that most homes of this period were built in low-rise (3-4) storey blocks of flats.|$|E

A group of Cubans attempted to enter the Peruvian embassy {{in the last week}} of March and on 1 April a group of six driving a city bus was successful in doing so and a Cuban guard was killed by a ricocheting bullet. The Peruvians announced they would not hand those seeking asylum over to Cuban police. The embassy grounds contained two two-story buildings and gardens covering {{an area the size of}} a U.S. football field or 6400 <b>sq.</b> <b>yds.</b> The Cuban government announced on 4 April that it was withdrawing its security forces, normally officers from the Interior Ministry armed with automatic weapons, from that embassy: [...] "We cannot protect embassies that do not cooperate in their own protection." [...] Following that announcement, about fifty Cubans entered the embassy grounds. By nightfall on 5 April, that number had grown to 2,000, including many children and a few former political prisoners. Cuban officials announced through loudspeakers that anyone who had not entered the embassy grounds by force was free to emigrate provided another country would grant them entry. President Francisco Morales of Peru had announced a willingness to accept asylum-seekers. Diplomats from several countries met with the Peruvians to discuss the situation, including the crowd's food and shelter requirements. An official of the U.S. State Department stated on 5 April that the U.S. would grant asylum to bona fide political prisoners and handle other requests to immigrate following standard procedures, which provided for the issuance of 400 immigrant visa per month to Cubans, with preference given to those with family members already in the U.S.|$|R
