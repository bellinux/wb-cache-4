40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{experimental}} results for monitoring long distance WDM communication links using a line monitoring system suitable for legacy optically amplified long-haul undersea systems. This monitoring system {{is based on}} setting up a simple, passive, low cost high-loss optical loopback circuit at each repeater that provides {{a connection between the}} existing anti-directional undersea fibres, and can be used to define fault location. Fault location is achieved by transmitting a short pulse <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> along with the WDM data signals where a portion of the overall signal is attenuated and returned to the transmit terminal by the loopback circuit. A special receiver is used at the terminal to extract the weakly returned <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> where each <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> is received at different times corresponding to different optical repeaters. Therefore, the degradation in any repeater appears on its corresponding <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> level. We use a recirculating loop to simulate a 4600 km fibre link, on which a high-loss loopback supervisory system is implemented. Successful monitoring is accomplished through the production of an appropriate <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> at the terminal that is detected and identified in a satisfactory time period after passing through up to 45 dB attenuation in the loopback circuit.

50|$|Line {{signaling}} {{is concerned}} with conveying information {{on the state of}} the line or channel, such as on-hook, off-hook (answer supervision and disconnect supervision, together referred to as supervision), ringing current (alerting), and recall. In the middle 20th century, supervision signals on long-distance trunks in North America were usually inband, for example at 2600 Hz, necessitating a notch filter to prevent interference. Late in the century, all <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> were out of band. With the advent of digital trunks, supervision signals are carried by robbed bits or other bits in the E1-carrier dedicated to signaling.|$|E
50|$|This {{was also}} an in-band system but, instead of using multifrequency signals for digits, it used four 35 ms pulses of tone, {{separated}} by 35 ms of silence, to represent digits in four-bit binary code, with 2400 Hz as a '0' and 2040 Hz as a '1'. The <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> used the same two frequencies, but each supervisory signal started with both tones together (for 150 ms) followed, without a gap, by a long (350 ms) or short (100 ms) period of a single tone of 2400 Hz or 2040 Hz. Phreaks in Europe built System 4 blue boxes that generated these signals. Because System 4 was used only on international circuits, {{the use of these}} blue boxes was more specialized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Engineering {{approaches}} to stereo typically use explicit {{search for the}} best matching between left and right sub-windows, which involves a high cost of search and unstable performance {{in the presence of}} binocular inconsistency and weak texture. The brain does not seem to conduct explicit search in the V 1 and V 2 cortex. But the mechanisms that the brain employs to integrate binocular disparity into 3 -D perception is still largely a mystery. The work presented in this paper focuses on an important issue of integrated stereo: How the same cortex can perform recognition and perception by generating a topographic disparity-tuning map using top-down connections. As top-down connections with objectclass <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> result in topographic class maps, the model presented here clarifies that stereo can be processed by a unified in-place internal representation. ...|$|E

Empirical evaluation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach: 1) monocular depth performing comparably with supervised methods that use either ground-truth pose or depth for training, and 2) pose estimation performing favorably with established SLAM systems under comparable input settings.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this {{dissertation}} studies a principal-supervisor-agent model in which a privately informed supervisor is susceptible to collusion. We explore how the supervisory information helps the principal to extract information rent from the agent when the informational asymmetry between the supervisor and agent results in inefficient collusion on their part. The optimal collusion-proof mechanism is such that the principal receives expected payoff that {{is as high as}} in the direct supervision benchmark in which the principal publicly observes the <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal.</b> Under some parameters, the principal can extract more rent from the agent, and the equilibrium is more efficient. The second chapter analyzes an informed principal problem in which the principal privately observes the <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal.</b> The principal 2 Ì 7 s expected payoff is strictly higher than the case in which the signal is publicly observed. This is a common feature of the independent type cases, except that this result holds even if preferences are quasi-linear. Unlike in the independent case, efficiency is constrained by the principal 2 Ì 7 s incentive problem. The third chapter considers a collusion formation process in which the supervisor proposes the side mechanism. We show that the informed principal problem within the coalition does not affect the optimal design of the grand mechanism. We then consider the supervisor 2 Ì 7 s incentive to exit once she obtains new information. The principal {{can take advantage of the}} implicit information revealed by the supervisor 2 Ì 7 s exit decision. The direct supervision benchmark outcome can be attained by a simple mechanism if the coalition cannot write a contract based on the exit decision, or the principal can publicly observe the timing of the supervisor 2 Ì 7 s exit decision. ...|$|R

40|$|Occluded face {{detection}} is {{a challenging}} detection task {{due to the}} large appearance variations incurred by various real-world occlusions. This paper introduces an Adversarial Occlusion-aware Face Detector (AOFD) by simultaneously detecting occluded faces and segmenting occluded areas. Specifically, we employ an adversarial training strategy to generate occlusion-like face features that are difficult for a face detector to recognize. Occlusion mask is predicted simultaneously while detecting occluded faces and the occluded area is utilized as an auxiliary instead of being regarded as a hindrance. Moreover, the <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> from the segmentation branch will reversely affect the features, aiding in detecting heavily-occluded faces accordingly. Consequently, AOFD is {{able to find the}} faces with few exposed facial landmarks with very high confidences and keeps high detection accuracy even for masked faces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOFD not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MAFA occluded face detection dataset, but also achieves competitive detection accuracy on benchmark dataset for general face detection such as FDDB...|$|E

We consequently learn to predict shape in an emergent canonical (view-agnostic) frame along with a corresponding pose predictor.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new problem of generating an image based on {{a small number of}} key local patches without any geometric prior. In this work, key local patches are defined as informative regions of the target object or scene. This is a challenging problem since it requires generating realistic images and predicting locations of parts at the same time. We construct adversarial networks to tackle this problem. A generator network generates a fake image as well as a mask based on the encoder-decoder framework. On the other hand, a discriminator network aims to detect fake images. The network is trained with three losses to consider spatial, appearance, and adversarial information. The spatial loss determines whether the locations of predicted parts are correct. Input patches are restored in the output image without much modification due to the appearance loss. The adversarial loss ensures output images are realistic. The proposed network is trained without <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> since no labels of key parts are required.

As sorting shuffled image sequence requires {{an understanding of the}} statistical temporal structure of images, training with such a proxy task allows us to learn rich and generalizable visual representation. We validate the effectiveness of the learned representation using our method as pre-training on high-level recognition problems.
