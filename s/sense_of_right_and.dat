This article looks at China 2 ̆ 7 s recent legal reform through the eyes of male and female divorce litigants, and examines the kinds <b>of</b> citizenship <b>rights</b> that are being promoted through the Chinese court system.

He joins the Doctor and Vicki as a companion in the following serial, The Time Meddler, when they discover that he stowed-away in the TARDIS after having escaped the burning Mechanoid City.

40|$|A {{significant}} body {{of research}} has highlighted problematic behaviour as {{a major source of}} discontent among teachers creating difficulties for teaching and learning in some schools. Improving behaviour in school depends on addressing a range of inter-related issues a the whole-school level, in the classroom, and in relation to individual pupils. Evidence suggests that schools with high levels of communal organisation, adopting a whole-school approach, show more orderly behaviour. It is also important for schools to nurture a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities in school cultures. In the longer term, students need to internalise the need for responsible behaviour and value it for the benefits which accrue to themselves as well as others...|$|R

Successes include the establishment of a new appointment system for mental health patients attending emergency departments across Northern Ireland, re-housing families from run-down tower blocks, and renegotiation of regeneration plans from which residents have been excluded. Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has described the work of the organisation as [...] "groundbreaking," [...] saying, [...] "They are not just challenging what is wrong, they are creating an inclusive <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> dignity, they are engaged in pioneering work which will command much interest and application elsewhere".|$|R
25|$|The term is used {{in various}} {{different}} ways in contemporary usage. Robert Hare stated in the popular science book entitled Snakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, {{but in some cases}} the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user's views on the origins and determinants of the disorder. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors. Hare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but sociopathy as only differing in <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong from the average person.|$|E
25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.|$|E
25|$|By 1998, Lawler rarely {{wrestled}} in the WWF {{and focused}} on commentary. Despite their feud in the USWA in 1993, by 1998, Vince McMahon had turned heel in the WWF {{for the first time}} and left the announce position, to which Lawler began praising McMahon's name on commentary as part of his own heel persona, much to the chagrin of Jim Ross. It was McMahon's departure from the commentary team which led to the strong on-screen chemistry between Lawler and Ross in subsequent years. This played a key role in a change of Lawler's character; although he still supported the heels, he showed a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong, and would condemn actions of heels when they went too far. He would become a full-time face by 2007. This began when Lawler surprisingly attacked Tazz when he started bullying Ross. At SummerSlam, The King wrestled Tazz in defense of Ross. With the creation of the XFL in 2001, Lawler was given the job as an announcer for the new football league. Lawler claims that he never wanted to announce for the XFL (he would admit on-air that he knew and cared almost nothing about the sport), but that he agreed to it after McMahon and Kevin Dunn asked him.|$|E

Christopher Hitchens in God is Not Great has argued that [...] "Modern vernacular {{describes}} conscience—not too badly—as whatever it is that makes us behave well when nobody is looking...

Cox has also suggested that his selection was due to his nationality, claiming that characters who are [...] "a little bit nasty" [...] are best played by Europeans. Mann kept the role of Lecktor very short, believing that it was [...] "such a charismatic character that [...] wanted the audience almost not to get enough of him". For the role of Will Graham, De Laurentiis had expressed interest in Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman, but Mann, having seen footage of William Petersen's role in To Live and Die in L.A., championed Petersen for the part.|$|E
