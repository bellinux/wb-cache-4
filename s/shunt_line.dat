40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power system amongst other things, to suppress overvoltages in the network during network switching, auto reclosing of transmission lines and under low loading condition of the network. Traditionally, shunt reactors of fixed type have been used and these have been permanently connected to the system. This research work investigated the feasibility of replacing the fixed <b>shunt</b> <b>line</b> reactors with a reactor, whose parameters are automatically varied depending on the system reactive power requirements, in a mature power system overlaid with high voltage lines to improve amongst, other things voltage stability. However, in a mature system overlaid with parallel higher voltage lines, power tend to flow on the matured system rather than higher voltage system as predetermined by various impedances of the power system. It is therefore desirable that loading of higher voltage lines be increased because of their higher power transfer capability and fact that higher voltage networks generate capacitive power which is substantially more than for each line at the original voltage. However, replacing {{a large number of}} fixed line reactors, at low loadings of higher voltage lines, even when system collapse is averted by increasing the number of reactors inserted into the system, overvoltage problems may still be an issue, until a certain number of must-run reactors, operating at full reactance, are put into service. If too much inductive reactance is removed from the system when the loading levels are extremely low, the power system will collapse. Therefore, there was no economic benefit in replacing all the fixed <b>shunt</b> <b>line</b> reactors with controllable type when the loading was still relatively low. Thus, the majority of the converted reactors were operating in their full rating as there was still more reactive power to be absorbed. However, when the power was diverted to flow on the higher voltage system through the use of series compensation of the higher voltage system, there was a possibility of making some fixed <b>shunt</b> <b>line</b> reactors on the higher voltage network controllable. This also allowed more power to be transferred in the higher voltage system thus improving its utilisation. Also, a positive impact on active system losses was realised...|$|E
40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} is {{a promising}} approach towards the solution processing of electronic devices on an industrial scale. Of particular {{interest is the}} production of high-end applications such as large area OLEDs on flexible substrates. Roll-to-roll (R 2 R) processing technologies involving inkjet printing have especially high potential, since they allow a continuous production of large volumes with high throughput. Here we report on our research activities to scale up printed OLED production on foils to an industrial scale. When building up the device, necessarily deposition {{will have to be}} done on very different types of surfaces, some of which are highly prone to damage upon mechanical load. Inkjet printing as a non-impact technology is therefore expected to have decisive advantages compared to e. g. screen printing. We have evaluated both methods for silver <b>shunt</b> <b>line</b> deposition on a barrier layer which protects the OLED against humidity. Screen printing on the barrier layer resulted in a significantly higher number of defects than did inkjet printing. For post-deposition treatment we have used photonic flash sintering as a highly efficient and R 2 R compatible method. We were thus able to demonstrate that a core step of OLED production can be carried out by R 2 R processing. Finally, our efforts resulted in the production of fully functional large area OLED devices, with inkjet printed silver shunt lines. Our future plans include moving towards fully integrated R 2 R production of OLEDs to demonstrate this concept's feasibility for industrial scale manufacturing. cop. 2014 Society for Imaging Science and Technology...|$|E

High conductive metal grid, {{can be obtained by}} screen prinitng of the metal <b>shunt</b> <b>lines</b> which are several microns thick. In order to avoid the risk of electrical shorts, the height of the metal <b>shunt</b> <b>lines</b> should be minimized as much as possible, so that other active layers can be coated above it. But, the surface topology of the metal <b>shunt</b> <b>lines</b> greatly influences the active layers coated above it. New concept has been developed {{to address the problem of}} surface topology at Holst Centre. New concept developed constitutes of embedding of the screen printed silver conductive sintered grids in the ultra violet (UV) sensitive transparent resist, which is cured on the polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) foil using the roll-to-roll (R 2 R) process. By doing so, we obtain the metal <b>shunt</b> <b>lines</b> in combination with the resist having more or less a flat surface profile. Characterization methods namely scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dektak profilometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical interferometry and confocal microscopy measurements were performed on the samples.
