40|$|Aging-related {{bone loss}} and {{osteoporosis}} affect {{millions of people}} worldwide. Chronic inflammation associated with aging promotes bone resorption and impairs bone formation. Here we show that Wnt 4 attenuates bone loss in osteoporosis and <b>skeletal</b> <b>aging</b> mouse models by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) via noncanonical Wnt signaling. Transgenic mice expressing Wnt 4 from osteoblasts were significantly protected from bone loss and chronic inflammation induced by ovariectomy, tumor necrosis factor or natural aging. In addition to promoting bone formation, Wnt 4 inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Mechanistically, Wnt 4 inhibited NF-κB activation mediated by transforming growth factor-β–activated kinase- 1 (Tak 1) in macrophages and osteoclast precursors independently of β-catenin. Moreover, recombinant Wnt 4 alleviated bone loss and inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB in vivo in mouse models of bone disease.

A number of studies suggest that the multiplier method, which is based on the patient’s chronological age, has a limited scope and should be applied judiciously when compared to using the radiographic <b>skeletal</b> <b>age.</b> For example, Sanders et al. demonstrated that using the multiplier method with chronologic age is superior to using it with <b>skeletal</b> <b>age</b> for children who have not yet reached their adolescent growth spurt, but that the reverse is true once the child reaches their adolescent growth spurt [6]. For a given population, the chronological age is equal to <b>skeletal</b> <b>age,</b> thus the use of the chronological age is most accurate for children who reach the adolescent growth spurt closest to the average age of onset.

40|$|<b>Skeletal</b> <b>age</b> {{assessment}} {{is one of}} the important applications of hand radiography in the area of pediatric radiology. Features analysis of the carpal bones can reveal the important information for <b>skeletal</b> <b>age</b> assessment. The present work in this paper faces the problem of the detection of carpal-bone features from its radio-image. A novel and effective segmentation technique is presented in this work with carpal bone image for <b>skeletal</b> <b>age</b> estimation. Carpal bone segmentation is a critical operation of the automatic <b>skeletal</b> <b>age</b> assessment system. This method consists of three procedures. First, the original carpal bone image is preprocessed via anisotropic diffusion. Then, the carpal bone image is segmented by GVF-Snake model. Third, experiments are carried out on images of carpal bone. The results are very promising. In particular the method is able to extract overlapping carpal bones. Facultad de Informátic...|$|E
40|$|Ageing {{is defined}} as an age-related {{increase}} in susceptibility to diseases and death and is a complex process that affects every major system at the molecular, cellular and organ level. Although the exact cause of ageing is unknown, there is significant evidence that oxidative stress {{plays a major role}} in the <b>ageing</b> process. <b>Skeletal</b> muscle produces oxidants from a variety of different sources with nitric oxide and superoxide being the primary radical species. Nitric oxide is regulated by the activity of nitric oxide synthases, however the sites that modulate changes in superoxide remain unclear. <b>Skeletal</b> muscle <b>ageing</b> is associated with a reduction in muscle mass and strength and leads to a significant vulnerability that opposes healthy ageing. Reports have indicated a positive correlation between tissue concentrations of oxidised macromolecules in skeletal muscle of old individuals, which implies the possible involvement of reactive species in the processes of <b>skeletal</b> muscle <b>ageing.</b> The role of oxidants in <b>skeletal</b> muscle <b>ageing</b> has also been extensively examined in different model organisms, which have undergone genetic manipulations and reports have shown that absence of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) in homozygotic SOD 1 knockou...|$|R

Between early adulthood and old age, women lose about 50 % of their cancellous bone and 30 % of their cortical bone, and men lose about 30 % and 20 % respectively. At the same time, there is a progressive decline in the circulating and skeletal concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Expectations are high that the continuous decline in IGF-I activity with age may be a major, and potentially preventable, cause of <b>skeletal</b> <b>aging.</b> Indeed, there is convincing evidence for a role for IGF-I as an osteotropic agent: it is present in large amounts in human skeletal tissue.
