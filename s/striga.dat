Mucuna pruriens is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area. Desmodium uncinatum can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (<b>Striga).</b>|$|E

25|$|Species within Orobanchaceae (broomrapes) {{are some}} of the most {{economically}} destructive species on Earth. Species of <b>Striga</b> (witchweeds) are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop yield loss annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within Sub-Saharan Africa alone. <b>Striga</b> infects both grasses and grains, including corn, rice and Sorghum, undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. Orobanche also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots, and varieties of the genus Brassica (cabbages). Yield loss from Orobanche can reach 100%; despite extensive research, no method of control has been entirely successful.|$|E

25|$|Some learned {{men have}} thought they {{discovered}} some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; {{but all that}} they say of it does not come near what is related of the vampires.

25|$|In 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold {{traveled}} around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata {{made from a}} special clay dug from the hills outside the town of <b>Striga,</b> now Strzegom, Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a panacea effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.|$|E

2500|$|Romanian words {{entered the}} Slovak {{language}} {{in the course of}} the so-called [...] "Wallachian colonization" [...] in the 14th–16th century when sheep breeding became common in Slovak mountains. Many of today's Slovak rustic-pastoral words like bača ("shepherd"; Romanian baci), valach ("young shepherd"; cf. the dated exonym for Romanians, [...] "Valach"), magura ("hill"; Romanian măgura), koliba ("chalet"; Romanian coliba), bryndza (a variety of sheep cheese; Romanian brânză), <b>striga</b> ("witch", [...] "demon"; Romanian [...] "strigă/strigoi"), etc. were introduced into the Slovak language by Romanian shepherds during the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Times.

5000|$|I {{own that}} these terms & <b>strigæ</b> {{are found in}} the {{versions}} of Holy Scripture. For instance, Isaiah, describing the condition to which Babylon was to be reduced after her ruin, says that she shall become the abode of satyrs, lamiæ, and <b>strigæ</b> (in Hebrew, lilith). This last term, according to the Hebrews, signifies the same thing, as the Greeks express by strix and lamiæ, which are sorceresses or magicians, who seek to put to death new-born children. Whence it comes that the Jews are accustomed to write in the four corners of the chamber of a woman just delivered, [...] "Adam, Eve, be gone from hence lilith."...The ancient Greeks knew these dangerous sorceresses by the name of lamiæ, and they believed that they devoured children, or sucked away all their blood till they died.|$|R

50|$|Desmodium also {{controls}} <b>striga,</b> {{resulting in}} significant yield increases of about 2 tonnes/hectare (0.9 short tons per acre) per cropping season. In the elucidation of {{the mechanisms of}} <b>striga</b> suppression by D. uncinatum, it was found that, in addition to benefits derived from increased availability of nitrogen and soil shading, an allelopathic effect of the root exudates of the legume, produced independently {{of the presence of}} <b>striga,</b> is responsible for this dramatic reduction in an intercrop with maize. Presence of blends of secondary metabolites with <b>striga</b> seed germination stimulatory, 4′′,5′′,-dihydro-5,2′,4′-trihydroxy-5′′,-isopropenylfurano-(2′′,3′′;7,6)-isoflavanone, and postgermination inhibitory, 4′′,5′′-dihydro-2′-methoxy-5,4′-dihydroxy-5′′-isopropenylfurano- (2′′,3′′;7,6)-isoflavanone, activities in the root exudates of D. uncinatum which directly interferes with parasitism was observed. This combination thus provides a novel means of in situ reduction of the <b>striga</b> seed bank in the soil through efficient suicidal germination even in the presence of grassy host plants in the proximity. Other Desmodium species have also been evaluated and have similar effects on stemborers and <b>striga</b> weed and are currently being used as intercrops in maize, sorghum and millets.|$|E
