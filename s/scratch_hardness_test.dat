Adequacy of the model to interpret the local phenomenon induced by addition of fillers was questioned. It was demonstrated that incorporation of hard fillers can enhance the <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> of polymers as well as their basic mechanical properties but leads to an increase in scratch visibility due to a change in scratch deformation mode from ductile ploughing to a brittle failure with crack formation.

The maximum depth of groove was {approx} 0. 07 mm, and the scratch velocity was {approx} 1. 0 m/s. Normal and tangential forces were monitored. The material removal mechanisms were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the scratches were measured by using a laser profilometer. The mechanical properties of the tested TiAls were characterized by the instantaneous specific energy, scratch resistance and <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> as related to the groove depth. Extensive thermal softening was observed in the dynamic scratch test of the TiAls, which facilitated both the detachment of developing chips and pile-up of material on side ridges. Sizable fractures were observed in the transverse direction in the tested TiAls; these fractures tended {{to participate in the}} chip formation, depending on the microstructure of the TiAl {{and the size of the}} scratch groove. Specific energy and <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> are depth-dependent to various degrees for the TiAls tested.
