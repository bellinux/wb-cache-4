5|$|In February 2011, Marvel Comics {{launched}} the eight-issue digital comic Captain America: First Vengeance, {{on the same}} day as the first trailer aired. Written by Fred Van Lente and featuring a rotation of artists, the story is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Each of the eight issues focuses on a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> from the movie, heroes and villains alike, and what brought them {{to the point where the}} movie begins.|$|E
5|$|D {{departs from}} {{traditional}} wargaming and assigns each player a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> to play {{instead of a}} military formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master serves as the game's referee and storyteller while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and {{playing the role of}} the inhabitants. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting's inhabitants, and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process the characters earn experience points in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.|$|E
5|$|Georgian English {{landscape}} gardens, such as West Wycombe and Stowe, {{are arranged}} as a walk or series of walks {{that take the}} visitor through a range of locations, {{each with its own}} <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> and separate from the last. Planting and the shape of the landscape is used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they do today.|$|E

5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|Hit & Run {{has seven}} levels, each with {{missions}} and sub-plot. The player can control one <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> in each level. The game's playable characters are Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, and Apu. Homer and Bart are played twice. When travelling on foot, the player character can walk, run, and perform {{three types of}} melee attacks: a normal kick, a jumping kick, and a smashing move. To drive, the player can either commandeer {{one of the many}} civilian vehicles that drive endlessly around town, or use a phone booth to select a car. The game's driving missions are also similar to those of Grand Theft Auto III. In both games, the player races against other characters, collects items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.|$|E

25|$|The TSG quality scheme aims {{to provide}} a {{protection}} regime for traditional food products of <b>specific</b> <b>character.</b> Differing from PDO and PGI, this quality scheme does not certify that the protected food product has a link to specific geographical area.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} text applications, the GB {{encoding scheme}} most often renders simplified Chinese characters, while Big5 most often renders traditional characters. Although neither encoding has an explicit {{connection with a}} <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> set, {{the lack of a}} one-to-one mapping between the simplified and traditional sets established a de facto linkage.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} the Ronde's <b>specific</b> <b>character,</b> organisers {{increased the number of}} hills and searched for more backroads in the Flemish Ardennes. In 1973 the finish was moved to Meerbeke, not far after the Muur of Geraardsbergen, which became an iconic climb of the race and of Belgian cycling. Three years later the controversial Koppenberg was included.|$|E
25|$|The {{first season}} of Mortal Kombat: Legacy is a prequel to the {{original}} game, explaining the background stories of several characters from the series and demonstrating their reasons for participating in the upcoming tenth Mortal Kombat tournament, on which the first game was based. The episodes are non-linear with minimal continuity and each devoted {{to the story of}} a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> or characters. The second season covers the tournament itself.|$|E
25|$|Ellen Churchill Semple, a {{prominent}} environmental determinism scholar, applied her theories {{in a case}} study which focused on the Philippines, where she mapped civilization and wildness onto the topography of the islands. Other scholars argued that climate and topography caused <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> traits to appear in a given populations. Scholars thereby imposed racial stereotypes on whole societies. Imperial powers rationalized labor exploitation by claiming that tropical peoples were morally inferior.|$|E
25|$|In Manhunt {{there are}} two teams of four. One team is the hunters, {{the other is the}} hunted. Each team looks like a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and {{remaining}} hidden. The team with the highest score wins. In Chest Capture {{there are two}} teams of four. One team is the hunters, and the other is the hunted who need to steal chests by standing close to them. Each team looks like a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and stealing chests. The team with the highest score wins. The Escort mode sees one team of four players protecting a wandering NPC while the other team of four tries to assassinate him. There are two NPCs to protect at a time and they walk through a series of checkpoints, which are visible to both teams. When an escorted NPC is killed, another is synchronized. This mode has two rounds with each team playing once as an escort and once as assassins.|$|E
25|$|In Marx's {{critique}} of political economy, any labor-product has a value and a use value, {{and if it}} is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, most often expressed as a money-price. Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a general utility, implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> of the economy in which they are produced and sold.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, MDK2 is a run-and-gun third-person shooter. However, unlike the {{original}} game, MDK2 features three player characters, each {{with their own}} unique set of abilities, skills, weaknesses, and style of gameplay. As such, the general game mechanics are more varied than in the first game, with the inclusion of more platform and puzzle based elements than before. Except for the last level of the game, which can be played {{with any of the}} three playable characters, the player cannot choose which character to use in any given level; each level can only be played with a <b>specific</b> <b>character,</b> and as such, the level design of each level is specifically geared towards that characters' abilities.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} on Famitsu.com by Taiga Asaba, Angel Beats! 1st Beat is {{described}} as not merely complementing the anime it is based on, but instead using the characters and setting to produce a wholly new story, which creates a separate charm surrounding the separate versions of the story. Asaba notes that the theme revolving around family already present in the anime is expanded upon in the game {{for each of the}} characters. Regarding the game's mechanics, Asaba found it fairly difficult to go down <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> routes, noting that a small change in how to diverge the plot line results in large changes to the characters. Asaba writes that its game structure makes it feel more like a game compared to other adventure games released around the same time, which have less choices available to the player and less-divergent plot lines.|$|E
25|$|Totem poles can {{symbolize the}} {{characters}} and events in mythology, or convey the experiences of recent ancestors and living people. Some of these characters may appear as stylistic representations of objects in nature, while others are more realistically carved. Pole carvings may include animals, fish, plants, insects, and humans, or they may represent supernatural beings such as the Thunderbird. Some symbolize beings that can transform themselves into another form, appearing as combinations of animals or part-animal/part-human forms. Consistent use of a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> over time, with some slight variations in carving style, helped develop similarities among these shared symbols that allowed people to recognize one from another. For example, the raven is symbolized by a long, straight beak, while the eagle's beak is curved, and a beaver is depicted with two large front teeth, {{a piece of wood}} held in his front paws, and a paddle-shaped tail.|$|E
25|$|The A natural minor {{scale has}} some {{historical}} connections. Before {{major and minor}} scales became prevalent in Western art music, music, especially the early liturgical music that has been so influential on Pärt, used a system of modes. The idea of musical modes was known to the ancient Greeks, and each {{was said to have}} a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> which could strongly affect the mind. The church modes are formed by using the notes of the C major scale (i.e., the white keys on a piano) but starting at different notes in each mode. A scale of A with no black keys is in the Aeolian mode. Since all natural minor scales derive from the white keys on the piano played from A to A, in choosing the A minor scale Pärt is acknowledging his debt to early church music, or at least affirming his affinity with it.|$|E
25|$|Bound in Blood is a first-person shooter {{in which}} the player can control one of two characters; Ray McCall, or his brother Thomas. Whereas in the {{original}} Call of Juarez, the player controlled alternating characters from level to level, in Bound in Blood, most levels offer the player the choice of which character they wish to play as, with each character having a slightly different style of gameplay. The character which the player does not choose {{is controlled by the}} AI {{for the duration of the}} level. There are also occasional levels through which the player must play with a <b>specific</b> <b>character.</b> In many levels, there will be times where the brothers will have to directly help one another, such as Thomas helping Ray to reach a high platform, or Ray kicking down a door for Thomas. Most levels are played through in the same manner, irrespective of which character is chosen, with the only difference being that of style. Occasionally, however, the brothers will separate within a level, and, as such, the level design will be different depending on which character the player is using.|$|E
25|$|In a large open-air theatre, {{like the}} Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, the {{classical}} masks {{were able to}} create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions. They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one <b>specific</b> <b>character.</b> Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself. Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as The Furies in Aeschylus' Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides' The Bacchae. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.|$|E
500|$|Beauty and the Beast {{became the}} first {{animated}} film to fully credit each animator responsible for animating a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> during the film's closing credits.|$|E
500|$|... "Pokémon - I Choose You!" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the Pokémon anime to be made and aired in Japan. The episode was written by Shoji Yonemura, and {{directed}} by Masamitsu Hidaka. When the production staff started on the anime, they wanted a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> to focus on. They chose Pikachu because it was relatively popular compared with the other Pokémon and the staff thought that [...] "potentially {{both boys and girls}} would like it". The episode was animated by Shogakukan in Japan, and it was aimed at elementary school students.|$|E
500|$|Carnival of Carnage is {{the first}} Joker's Card in Insane Clown Posse's Dark Carnival concept album series. The Dark Carnival is a concept of the afterlife in which souls are sent {{to a form of}} limbo while waiting to be sent to heaven or hell based on their {{individual}} actions. These concepts are related by Insane Clown Posse in a series of albums called the six Joker's Cards. Each of the six Joker's Cards relate to a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> — an entity of the Dark Carnival — that tries to [...] "save the human soul" [...] by showing the wicked inside of one's self.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy Dimensions is a {{role-playing}} video game, {{developed in}} the style of previous 16-bit [...] Final Fantasy games. The game uses the Active Time Battle system in which a character's turn are determined by a gauge that fills over time during battle. Once the gauge fills completely from one character, players can choose a command from that <b>specific</b> <b>character.</b> After choosing a command, the gauge fills over again to execute the command. Once the gauge fills again and the command is executed, the gauge empties and repeats the cycle. Similar to , the game was released in an episodic format, but players must play through each episode in sequence. Players command a party of five with the party members changing in each episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} of Type-0 {{have so far}} received positive reception from video game critics in both local and import reviews. One of the reviewers for Famitsu magazine said that {{the large number of}} characters made the game [...] "a very different [...]" [...] RPG Site's Erren Van Duine was very impressed, saying that certain character interactions were [...] "handled excellently and you really get a sense of <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> motivations because of it." [...] He also praised the sympathetic portrayal of Cid Aulstyne, and stated that the game had [...] "so many great moments, [...] have to experience each little detail for [...] Heath Hindman, writing for PlayStation Lifestyle, called the characters [...] "pretty strong overall", although she cited some scenes where various characters' inclusion felt like a necessity rather than a useful element to be a fault.|$|E
500|$|The game {{features}} {{environmental effects}} throughout some levels, which includes fog, rain and thunder storms. Some levels feature different mechanics and settings, such as underwater sections, riding a mine cart, grappling onto vines, and [...] "honey" [...] levels which feature sticky surfaces. As with its predecessor, the game features barrels which will propel the player {{in any direction}} they are facing. Aside from checkpoint barrels, some give the player temporary invincibility or an [...] "Animal Buddy". Bonus barrels hidden throughout the game transport the player to a bonus game, which features a challenge such as eliminating all enemies in order to earn a [...] "Kremcoin". In addition, there are some barrels {{that can only be}} activated by a <b>specific</b> <b>character.</b> Players may earn extra lives by collecting balloons, earning 100 bananas or collecting four letters which spell [...] "KONG".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} amount of freedom given to players, Meryl Evans of Blogcritics stated [...] "There was no right or wrong, or a set path you must take", but added that the game lost pace when she had {{gathered}} {{a large amount of}} money and had to find a <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> to speak with before completing her current quest. After finding the non-player character, the game [...] "picked up again and kept me hopping for the rest of it." [...] Didi Cardoso of website Grrl Gamer also enjoyed the freedom, but noted that sometimes she felt lost and was unsure of how to find the location of the next recipe. The chocolate manufacturing mini-game was also praised as [...] "fun". Peter Cohen of Macworld noted that some fans of business simulators might find the mini-game [...] "off-putting", but also suggested that it helped break up gameplay. Marc Saltzman expressed the same opinion, while Anise Hollingshead found the mini-game to be too easy to play.|$|E
500|$|Ste Pickford {{developed}} the gameplay map for Ironsword. According to him, he basically copied the map {{that was used}} in a conversion port of Ghosts 'n Goblins that he developed a couple of years earlier. Moreover, the Pickford brothers were trying to resemble Ghosts 'n Goblins and similar games by Capcom as part of their attempt to earn the rights to develop the game from Rare. For the map screen, Ste Pickford used <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> data in the ROM itself, used the font from elsewhere in the data that was inserted separately, and overlaid the Elementals' floating heads {{over the top of the}} graphic. According to Pickford: [...] "The job of graphic was always about 30% drawing, and about 70% fiddly technical stuff (which was why so many terrible artists – people who couldn't draw at all – made decent video game artists back then, if they could manage the technical side of things well enough)." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] (...) is {{a painted}} face male role. Depending on the {{repertoire}} {{of the particular}} troupe, he will play either primary or secondary roles. This type of role will entail a forceful character, so a [...] must have a strong voice {{and be able to}} exaggerate gestures. Peking opera boasts 15 basic facial patterns, but there are over 1000 specific variations. Each design is unique to a <b>specific</b> <b>character.</b> The patterns and coloring are thought to be derived from traditional Chinese color symbolism and divination on the lines of a person's face, which is said to reveal personality. Easily recognizable examples of coloring include red, which denotes uprightness and loyalty, white, which represents evil or crafty characters, and black, which is given to characters of soundness and integrity. Three main types of [...] roles are often seen. These include , roles that heavily involve singing, , roles with less emphasis on singing and more on physical performance, and , martial and acrobatic roles.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Licht {{composed}} the game's score—an ambient, violin-heavy presentation designed to represent 19th-century London. Licht's score {{is designed to}} make the player feel unsettled, and not provide comfort. He described the music as an [...] "evil fog" [...] that fades {{in and out of}} the game without being initiated by any scripted moments or to warn of impending danger, instead creating the impression of ever-present danger. As Dishonored features few cinematic scenes that allowed for long interactions with any particular character, Licht found himself limited in developing <b>specific</b> <b>character</b> themes, and instead focused largely on composing ambient music. Samples of Licht's ambient themes were used in the game's few cinematic scenes, although Licht was not involved in scoring them. Licht conceived the score as a mixture of older music befitting the period setting, and 20th-century techniques such as reversed sounds. Dishonoreds credit song, [...] "Honor for All", was written by Licht and his nephew Jon, who also provided the track's vocals. It was written as a reward for players who had finished the game.|$|E
