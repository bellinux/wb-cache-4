She maintained contact with her mother, but broke off ties {{to the rest of}} her family until the end of 1936. In 1937, her daughter Cecilie, son-in-law and two of her grandchildren were killed in an air accident at Ostend; she and Prince Andrew {{met for the first time}} in six years at the funeral (Prince Philip, Lord Louis Mountbatten and Hermann Göring also attended). She resumed contact with her family, and in 1938 returned to Athens alone to work with the poor, living in a two-bedroomed flat near the Benaki Museum.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong-route {{was officially}} opened on 5 August 1949. Braathens SAFE had then moved its {{operative}} base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company stationed technical employees in Rome, Karachi, Bangkok and Hong Kong, {{as well as}} having an agreement with KLM. The planes would stop each night and crew and passengers would <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> hotel. Cabin crew had no training, and learned the job as they worked. Chicken {{was the most common}} lunch meal, and the cabin crew had to purchase this fresh each day, usually observing the slaughter to ensure its freshness. In 1949, sixty-seven flights were made to Hong Kong, as well as two to Tokyo, to Venezuela and one to Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} {{run out of}} gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E

5|$|On 25 April, {{the marchers}} reached Tiruthuraipoondi and {{had planned to}} <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> choultry which was managed by Ramachandra Naidu, a close {{associate}} of Pillai. Despite the collector's warning, Naidu provided accommodation to the marchers at his choultry. His actions led to him being arrested by the police the following day. The arrest of Iyer and Naidu created fear among the people. Pillai, however, convinced {{the people that they}} could provide food without getting caught by the police. As a result, food packets were found tied to the branches of roadside trees, and when the group rested on the banks of Kaveri there were indicators where huge food containers were buried. The British policemen, who were deployed to suppress the marchers, suffered from starvation when local residents refused them food and water. The Indian staff who were employed by the British stopped performing their daily activities, while barbers and washermen refused to serve the government employees.|$|E
5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E

25|$|Joseph Rogers (August 21, 1764 – November 6, 1833) {{was born}} near Cook's Town, Ireland, {{the son of}} James Rogers and his wife, Elizabeth Brown.

In the spring of 1937, {{at the age of}} 80, his face was lightly burned when a candle on his desk set fire to his beard. During a couple of months <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> charity hospital, the young film journalist René Jeanne helped organize a benefit screening of his work, which played at the Champs-Elysées Cinema on January 19, 1938, the day before Cohl's death, two weeks after his 81st birthday.

She soon became romantically involved with a customer at the restaurant, Goro Omiya, a professor and banker who aspired {{to become a member}} of the Diet of Japan (Japanese parliament). Knowing that the restaurant would not tolerate a maid having sexual relations with clients, and having become bored with Nagoya, she returned to Tokyo in June. Omiya met Abe in Tokyo, and, finding that she had in the past contracted syphilis, paid for her <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> hot springs resort in Kusatsu from November until January 1936. In January, Omiya suggested that Abe could become financially independent by opening a small restaurant, and recommended that she should start working as an apprentice in the restaurant business.|$|E
25|$|The Browns {{played a}} final {{game in the}} 1949 season, {{matching}} up against a team of AAFC all-stars {{a week after the}} championship game in Houston, Texas. The Shamrock Bowl was organized by Glen McCarthy, a Texas oil executive who wanted to bring a football team to Houston. While a Houston-based AAFC team was no longer possible with the league's demise, McCarthy hoped that a well-attended game would convince NFL owners of the viability of a franchise for the city. The game, however, was poorly attended – only about 10,000 people came. It was also marred by racism: it was initially unclear whether the Browns' black players, Motley, Willis and Gillom, would be allowed to play. McCarthy ultimately relented on the issue, but black players were forced to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> different hotel from the white players. Cleveland lost the game to the all-stars by a score of 12–7.|$|E
