60|$|In Conchoderma aurita the {{ophthalmic}} ganglia {{are much}} smaller, and nearer to the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> than in L. fascicularis. In Alepas cornuta the ophthalmic chords run towards {{each other from}} the two distant and separate supra-oesophageal ganglia; and the ophthalmic ganglia, (instead of being quite separate, as in L. fascicularis,) are united by their front ends, and the two eyes instead of standing some way in front, with nerves running to them, are embedded on the double ophthalmic ganglion; the pigment-capsules here, also, have the shape of mere saucers, and are joined back to back, with the two lenses projecting far out of them. In neither sex of Ibla could I perceive that the eye was double. In Pollicipes spinosus the ophthalmic ganglion {{stands in front of}} the single <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> and shows no signs of being formed of a lateral pair; the eyes themselves, however, differently from, in all the foregoing cases, are, though approximate, quite distinct. In Pollicipes mitella I did not see the eyes; but the ophthalmic ganglion consists, as I believe, of a single globular one, placed exactly between the two globular, supra-oesophageal ganglia, all three being of nearly equal size. Professor Leidy does not mention the ophthalmic ganglia; hence I infer that in Balanus, which is a more highly organised Cirripede, they are fused into the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion.</b>|$|E

60|$|The latter (D) alone {{remain to}} be described; they present far more {{diversity}} in shape than do the thoracic ganglia; they are almost always seen in outline to be laterally distinct, and usually resemble two pears with their tapering ends cut off and united; in a transverse line they are {{as long as the}} infra-oesophageal ganglion, but are much less massive. In Lepas fascicularis (D), they are pear-shaped; in Pollicipes mitella they are globular, and separated by a third globular ganglion, which I believe is the ophthalmic ganglion, presently to be described; in Pollicipes spinosus, however, the ophthalmic ganglion is, as usual, placed in advance of the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> which latter, in this one species, shows no sign of being formed of a lateral pair fused together. In Alepas cornuta the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> consists of two quite distinct ganglia, elongated in the longitudinal axis of the body, and separated from each other by the whole width of the mouth; the chord which unites them is of the same thickness {{as the rest of the}} collar. In all the genera, from the front of each of the two supra-oesophageal ganglia, a pair of nerves, (f, f,) united and together as large as the collar nerve, rises, and can be traced running unbranched, in a nearly straight line, for a length equalling the whole rest of the nervous chord, so as to supply the peduncle and the inside of the capitulum or sack. At the inner ends of these two same ganglia, from a central point where they are united, a little central branch runs in front to the adductor scutorum and other adjoining muscles; and still smaller fibrils run behind to the oesophageal muscles.|$|E
60|$|As the infra-oesophageal {{ganglion}} sends nerves to the trophi and to {{the first}} pair of cirri, it must correspond to the segments, from the fourth to the ninth inclusive, of the archetype crustacean. The state of the supra-oesophageal and ophthalmic ganglia appears to me very interesting: I {{do not believe that}} in any mature ordinary crustacean, the first or ophthalmic ganglion can be shown to be distinct from the two succeeding ganglia, or to be itself composed of a pair laterally distinct. The ganglia, corresponding with the second and third segments of the body, which should normally support two pair of antennæ, are in the Lepadidæ united together; but laterally they are generally distinct in outline, and are actually separate in Alepas: the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> shows also its double nature, by giving rise to a pair of large double nerves, evidently corresponding with the two pair of antennular nerves in ordinary crustaceans. The embryonic condition of the whole supra-oesophageal portion of the nervous system in the Lepadidæ, corresponds with the rudimentary state of the only organ of sense supplied by it, namely, the eye, which in size and general appearance has retrograded to the state in which it was in, during the first stage of development of the larva;--I have used the term embryonic, because, in the embryos of ordinary crustacea, all the ganglia are at first longitudinally distinct, and laterally quite separate. The conclusion at which we before arrived from studying the metamorphoses, namely, that the whole peduncle and capitulum consisted of the first three segments of the head, is beautifully supported by the structure of the nervous system, in which these parts are seen to be supplied with nerves exclusively from the supra-oesophageal ganglion: now in ordinary crustacea the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> sends nerves to the eyes and the two pair of antennæ corresponding, as is known by embryological dissections, to the first three segments of the body. Moreover, it is asserted that the carapace which covers the thorax in crustacea, is not formed by the development of the first segment; and this, likewise, may be inferred to be the case with the peduncle and capitulum in the Lepadidæ, as the nerves of the ophthalmic ganglia go exclusively to the eyes. Finally, I may remark that in Pollicipes, looking to the whole nervous system, the state of concentration nearly equals that in certain macrourous decapod crustaceans, for instance the Astacus marinus, of which a figure is given by Milne Edwards.|$|E
40|$|The {{disposition}} of the prostomial mucus-glands in Nephtys picta, N. incisa, and N. bucera provides additional evidence that the posterior lobes, which {{are attached to the}} <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> of species such as N. californiensis and N. caeca, have been formed by the posterior migration of prostomial epidermal mucus-cells. In N. picta there are few mucus-cells in the prostomium. In N. incisa there are many, and some at the sides of the prostomium occur in clumps and project into the prostomial cavity. In N. bucera there are numerous mucus-cells, but they are massed at the sides of the prostomium and open to the exterior over a narrow zone. The cell-bodies are in intimate contact with the sides of the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> and lie within the membranes investing the brain. Subsequent evolution of the prostomial mucus-glands has led to the accumulation of their cell-bodies in the posterior part of the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> in the form of posterior lobes. SOME species of Nephtys, particularly those from the north-east Pacific, butincluding the common circumpolar species JV. caeca, have a pair of long lobes attached to the posterior margin of the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion.</b> These lobes are filled with mucus-cells, the long necks of which run in a trac...|$|E

40|$|Age {{determination}} using quantification of in situ neurolipofuscin {{has been}} an useful and reliable tool to understand population dynamics of crustaceans. In the present investigation, in situ neurolipofuscin was quantified in the medulla terminalis of eyestalks (cluster A cell mass, MT-A), and in the olfactory lobe cell mass 10 (OLCM- 10) of the <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> of unknown age blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) caught in the wild. No significant difference in neurolipofuscin quantity was found between right and left MT-A and between right and left OLCM- 10. Comparison between MT-A and OLCM- 10 resulted in a weaker correlation. Average neurolipofuscin was 0. 353 + 0. 038 % vol. and 0. 896 + 0. 105 % vol. in MT-A and OLCM- 10, respectively. Size explained 23 % of the variation of neurolipofuscin loading in OLCM- 10. No significant relationship was found between size and MT-A neurolipofuscin content. It can be concluded that both structures are suitable for the quantification of neurolipofuscin, {{and they have the}} potential for age determination for C. sapidus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The general {{morphology}} of {{the central}} nervous system is analysed in intact females of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis (Acari: Phytoseiidae), using a nucleic acid label (YOYO- 1) and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The somata of all cells that comprise the synganglion reside in the cortex. The cortex harbours an estimated total of 10, 000 cells. The somata are densely packed in the cortex and cells residing in the inner cortex may only occupy about 1. 8 lm. As in all Arachnida, the synganglion is divided in a sub- and a supra-oesophageal nervous mass. Both the cortex and the neuropil appear continuous between these two nervous masses. The sub-oesophageal nervous mass mainly consists of the four paired pedal ganglia that are each associated with a leg. The prominent olfactory lobes are ventrally associated with the first pedal ganglia. A small opisthosomal ganglion occupies the most caudal part of the sub-oesophageal ganglion. The rostral part of the supra-oesophageal nervous mass consists of the paired cheliceral and palpal ganglia. The <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> is the largest ganglion in the supra-oesophageal nervous mass and unlike all other ganglia it is not associated with any of the major nerves. It is therefore more likely involved in secondary information processing...|$|E
40|$|The <b>supra-oesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> of Nephtys varies {{considerably}} in {{its size and}} gross morphology from one species to another. The ganglion is relatively larger in small species and then extends into the anterior body segments. It is epidermal and in con-tact with the cuticle in the prostomium, sub-epidermal in the anterior segments. In a number of species a pair of conspicuous posterior lobes to the ganglion has been developed. There is a tendency, particularly in the smaller worms, for the ganglion to be bifurcated at its posterior, and sometimes also at its anterior margin. The sensory nerves are as follows: tegumentary nerves, extremely variable in number and disposi-tion, arising {{from the front of}} the ganglion; two pairs of antennary nerves arising immediately above the roots of the circum-oesophageal connectives, but generally distinct from them; and a pair of anterior optic 'nerves ' supplying the paired, single-Celled photoreceptors. The only other nerves arising from the ganglion are the nuchal nerves which arise from it opposite the nuchal organs, whatever the position of the brain. Since the latter may barely protrude into the prostomium, these nerves emerge from the anterior part of the brain in some species, instead of near the posterior end of the ganglion. The circum-oesophageal connectives are extremely long because the sub-oesophageal ganglion lies in the fifth segment. In their passage through the lateral lips of the mouth and along the sides of the gular membrane, they give off three pairs of stomatogastric nerves and the segmental nerves of the first two segments. The third and fourth segmental nerves arise {{from the front of the}} sub-oesophageal ganglion, those of the fifth segment from the back of the ganglion. The stomatogastric nervous system is also described. The entire nervous system shows little specialization com-pared with that of most other errant polychaetes...|$|E
