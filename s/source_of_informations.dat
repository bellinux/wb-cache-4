Insensitivity of infrared physics {{to the details}} of short-range strong interaction allows for consistent, free of ultraviolet divergences, formulation of local theory at the level of local energy density functional (LEDF) including, on the same footing, both particle-hole as well as particle-particle channels.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{summarize}} all what is known about the karyotype and about sex chromosomes in the lizard clade Laterata and to analyze this two gained datasets by means of a phylogeny. Karyotype represents a whole number of chromosomes in a cell and it is an important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>informations</b> on how the genetic information in nucleus is organized and how it works along with the evolution. The Laterata clade consists of four big groups of squamate reptiles: Teiidae, Gymnophthalmidae, Amphisbaenia and Lacertidae. All the groups have a genotypic sex determination system (GSD) and some species within these clades pones sex chromosomes. If they are present, in Teiidae and Gymnophthalmidae it is the XY sex chromosome system which determines the sex of a specimen. On the other hand, in Amphisbaenia and Lacertidae it is the ZW system of sex determination. Sometimes the X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 :X 1 X 2 Y or Z 1 Z 1 Z 2 Z 2 :Z 1 Z 2 W sex chromosome system occurs in Teiidae / Gymnophthalmidae or in Lacertidae, respectively.
