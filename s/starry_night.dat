5|$|In mid-1889, and at {{his sister}} Wil's request, Van Gogh painted several smaller {{versions}} of Wheat Field with Cypresses. The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and include The <b>Starry</b> <b>Night,</b> in which cypresses dominate the foreground.|$|E

The columns and truss system in the station imitate trees; as they extend toward {{the outside of the}} building, the artificial elements are integrated into nature. When night falls, the ceiling is lit with thousands of lights over the truss system, resembling a <b>starry</b> <b>night</b> over the branches of a forest.|$|E

5|$|The Roseland Theater, {{sometimes}} called the Roseland Theater and Grill, is a music venue located at 8 Northwest Sixth Avenue in the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The building was originally a church, constructed by the Apostolic Faith Church in 1922. In 1982, Larry Hurwitz converted the building to a music venue called <b>Starry</b> <b>Night.</b> In 1990, the club's 21-year-old publicity agent was murdered {{in one of the}} theater's hallways; Hurwitz was convicted for this murder ten years later. Hurwitz sold the club in 1991, claiming he had lost support from the local music industry. The venue was given its current name during the 1991 ownership transfer. During the 1990s, Double Tee acquired control of the hall's operations, then purchased and renovated the building.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and was {{directed}} by Parker; it was made on a budget of $300,000. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. This laborious process involved creating hundreds of construction paper cutouts – including individual mouth shapes, {{and many of the}} characters in several different sizes –, and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera, to the dialog that had been recorded earlier. Assistants helped with the cutting and pasting of the cutouts, while the animation was primarily done by Parker, Stone, and South Park animation director Eric Stough. The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Additional animation techniques involved creating the <b>starry</b> <b>night</b> sky by putting holes into a black posterboard and illuminating it from behind, and having the pooling of Kenny's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen, and drawing more to it with every frame. The characters who are not speaking rarely move, saving time in the animation process.|$|E

25|$|The nocturne {{series was}} {{limited by the}} {{difficulties}} posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.e., at night. The first painting in the series was Café Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by <b>Starry</b> <b>Night</b> Over the Rhone later that same month. Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The <b>Starry</b> <b>Night</b> in particular.|$|E

25|$|Whitney also theorizes {{that the}} swirls {{in the sky}} could {{represent}} wind, evoking the mistral that had such {{a profound effect on}} Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence. (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, {{less than a month after}} painting The <b>Starry</b> <b>Night.)</b> Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.|$|E
25|$|The neoclassical view ignores much of {{what the}} natural {{sciences}} have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and ecosystem services directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a <b>starry</b> <b>night</b> sky, etc.|$|E

25|$|During {{the year}} Van Gogh {{stayed at the}} asylum, the {{prolific}} output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued. During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September, 1889, in the Musée d'Orsay. The <b>Starry</b> <b>Night</b> was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date {{he wrote to his}} brother Theo to say he had a new study of a starry sky.|$|E
25|$|But {{although}} Van Gogh periodically {{defended the}} practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature. Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series. He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Rémy. The <b>Starry</b> <b>Night</b> belongs to this latter series, {{as well as to}} a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.|$|E
25|$|Harvard {{astronomer}} Charles A. Whitney conducted his own astronomical {{study of}} The <b>Starry</b> <b>Night</b> contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost {{his entire career}} at U.C.L.A.). While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty {{with regard to the}} constellation Aries, he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed. He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, Lord Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.|$|E
