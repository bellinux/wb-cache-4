5|$|Shell <b>stowage</b> for {{the main}} guns was {{increased}} from 80 rounds per gun to 100.|$|E
5|$|The Storm 3 {{reconnaissance}} and patrol model {{allows for}} extra <b>stowage</b> of fuel, water and equipment. This version is especially suited to be fitted with various machine gun or special equipment mountings.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Government air {{transport}} regulations permit {{the transport of}} plutonium by air, subject to restrictions on other dangerous materials carried on the same flight, packaging requirements, and <b>stowage</b> in the rearmost part of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A bulk carrier's {{design is}} largely {{defined by the}} cargo it will carry. The cargo's density, also known as its <b>stowage</b> factor, is the key factor. Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0.6tons per cubic meter for light grains to 3tons per cubic meter for iron ore.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 mod. 1931 did {{not have}} a radio set. The tank {{commander}} communicated with the driver by speaking tube, which was replaced with a signalling lamp in 1932. The T-26 was equipped with one fire extinguisher, a kit of spare parts tools and accessories (including a tank jack), a canvas <b>stowage,</b> and a tow chain fixed on the rear of the hull.|$|E
5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition <b>stowage</b> was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional radio sets, mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition <b>stowage</b> was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 turret was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard to}} rotate the turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition <b>stowage</b> for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E
5|$|M34 Prime Mover – M34 Prime Movers {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple <b>stowage</b> ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The M9 Half-track was a {{half-track}} {{produced by}} International Harvester in the United States in World War II for lend-lease supply to Allies. It {{was designed to}} provide a similar vehicle to the M2 Half Track Car. It had the same body and chassis as the M5 Half-track (also built by International Harvester for lend-lease) but had the same <b>stowage</b> and radio fit as the M2 Half Track.|$|E
5|$|The M9 {{used the}} same chassis and {{mechanical}} components as the M5. It was laid out to provide similar <b>stowage,</b> access to the radios from the inside, rear doors, and a pedestal machine gun mount as with the M2. The M9A1 variant of the M9 matched the improvements made to the M2, M3, and M5, changing to ring mount machine gun mount and three pintle machine gun mounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} {{during the war}} are not entirely clear. Photographic evidence shows that four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her searchlight platform and the other pair on the bridge wings, although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge <b>stowage</b> to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Their roles imposed several design {{limitations}} on the vessels. The vessels were designed to operate in coastal areas, which required a shallow draft {{in order for them}} to be able to enter any port on the Baltic seaboard. They also required a heavy armament, {{in order for them to}} be able to engage any hostile ironclad on equal terms. Because Stosch envisioned only local deployments for the vessels, they had limited coal <b>stowage,</b> as they could easily replenish their supply.|$|E
5|$|This {{involved}} {{the replacement of}} 'A' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, the removal of her director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge {{in exchange for a}} Type 271 target indication radar, exchanging her two 2-pounder AA guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform, and the removal of her 12-pounder AA gun. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge <b>stowage</b> to be increased to 98 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{converted}} into an escort destroyer in late 1943, 'B' gun {{was replaced by}} a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar and <b>stowage</b> was increased for a total of 70 depth charges which meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder AA gun had to be removed to compensate for the weight. A Type 271 target-indication radar replaced the director. It is likely that the Vickers guns were replaced by the Oerlikons from the quarterdeck at this time.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun {{in the rear of the}} turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition <b>stowage</b> for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions <b>stowage,</b> the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret {{and replacing it with}} a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a monoblock steel tube, using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round <b>stowage</b> area near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E
5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment <b>Stowage</b> Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E
5|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There are also a program using the Simmering- Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Zeiss stereoscopic range finder, heated crew compartment, <b>stowage</b> for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure & air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|E
25|$|The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Raffaello {{made up the}} {{majority}} of the payload. This was Raffaellos fourth trip to the International Space Station since 2001 and the 12th use of an MPLM. Unlike previous MPLM missions that delivered large compartments and devices to outfit the space station laboratories, STS-135 delivered only bags and supply containers. The MPLM was filled with 16 resupply racks, which is the maximum that it could handle. Eight Resupply <b>Stowage</b> Platforms (RSPs), two Integrated <b>Stowage</b> Platforms (ISPs), six Resupply <b>Stowage</b> Racks (RSRs) and one Zero-G <b>Stowage</b> Rack (ZSR), which sits above another rack during transport.|$|E
25|$|Bricks {{were the}} usual {{material}} for building the <b>stowage,</b> wood only {{being used in}} floors. Stone was sometimes used too (Madley). Some oasts had a cider mill {{on the ground floor}} of the <b>stowage</b> (Little Cowarne Court, Little Cowarne).|$|E
25|$|Polish-produced tanks {{often have}} {{different}} <b>stowage</b> arrangements. The arrangement includes a rectangular box {{mounted on the}} left side of the turret, a smaller square <b>stowage</b> box {{on the left side}} of the turret-rear, and a slightly different rear decking.|$|E
25|$|Racks {{under the}} seats {{were used for}} {{ammunition}} and rations; additional racks behind the seat backs held the squad's rifles and other <b>stowage.</b> A small rack for mines was added {{on the outside of}} the hull just above the tracks. In combat, most units found it necessary to stow additional food, rucksacks and other crew <b>stowage</b> {{on the outside of the}} vehicle. Luggage racks were often added in the field, and very late vehicles had rear-mounted racks for this crew <b>stowage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aviation fuel {{delivery}} and <b>stowage</b> systems were extremely vulnerable. The Royal Navy stowed aviation fuel in cylindrical tanks, {{that in turn}} were surrounded by seawater. RN aviation fuel lines were purged with carbon dioxide when not in use. The USN used a similar system, which was further improved after the two navies began exchanging information in 1940. Pre-war USN and IJN carrier designs used a fuel <b>stowage</b> system which was not as secure as that used by the RN, but allowed for much greater <b>stowage</b> capacity. Several USN and IJN carriers were lost due to aviation gas fume explosions.|$|E
25|$|Without {{additional}} hull ammunition <b>stowage,</b> the SIBMAS could {{accommodate a}} maximum of sixteen passengers.|$|E
25|$|The bulges {{were removed}} and the anchor chain <b>stowage</b> was lowered by one deck.|$|E
25|$|Lifejacket <b>stowage</b> in HS 748 and {{aircraft}} with similar arrangements be repositioned to improve accessibility.|$|E
25|$|The primary payload of STS-131 was the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo. The MPLM {{was filled}} with food and science {{supplies}} for the International Space Station (ISS). The MPLM also carried {{the third and final}} Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), Window Orbital Research Facility (WORF), one Crew Quarters Rack, the Muscle Atrophy Resistive Exercise (MARES) rack, Resupply <b>Stowage</b> Racks (RSRs), as well as Resupply <b>Stowage</b> Platforms (RSPs).|$|E
25|$|BTS-2 - Rebuilt late {{production}} BTS-2 {{fitted with}} antiaircraft {{heavy machine gun}} pintle mount and additional <b>stowage</b> boxes.|$|E
25|$|BTS-1 (Bronetankoviy Tyagach Sredniy - Medium Armoured Tractor) - T-54A {{converted}} into an ARV {{equipped with a}} <b>stowage</b> basket.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{spent time}} stowing {{items in the}} shuttle's cabin in {{preparation}} for the return to Earth. Cabin <b>stowage</b> started at 08:48 UTC.|$|E
25|$|T-72BK (Ob'yekt 184K): Command {{version of}} T-72B, {{recognizable}} by having multiple radio antennas and a radio mast <b>stowage</b> under rear turret bin.|$|E
25|$|Astute has <b>stowage</b> for 38 {{weapons and}} was {{expected}} to typically carry both Spearfish heavy torpedoes and Tomahawk Block IV cruise missiles, the latter costing £870,000 each.|$|E
25|$|Single-seat fighter biplane for the Royal Navy, 60 built. Fitted with {{arrestor}} {{hooks and}} provision for dinghy <b>stowage.</b> Serial numbers: N5500 – N5549 and N5565 – N5574.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 13 {{was a rare}} off-duty day. The {{only major}} {{projects}} were <b>stowage</b> of the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) and an orbit adjustment burn.|$|E
