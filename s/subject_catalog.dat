40|$|Purpose - An {{empirical}} {{study has}} shown that the real process of <b>subject</b> <b>cataloging</b> does not correspond entirely to theoretical descriptions in textbooks and international standards. The purpose of this is paper is {{to address the issue of}} whether it is possible for catalogers who have not received formal training to perform <b>subject</b> <b>cataloging</b> in a different way to their trained colleagues. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study was conducted in 2001 among five Slovenian public library catalogers. The resulting model is compared to previous findings. Findings - First, all catalogers attempted to determine what the book was about. While the American catalogers tried to understand the topic and the author 2 ̆ 7 s intent, the Slovenian catalogers appeared to focus on the topic only. Slovenian and American academic library catalogers did not demonstrate any anticipation of possible uses that users might have of the book, while this was important for American public library catalogers. All catalogers used existing records to build new ones and/or to search for subject headings. The verification of subject representation with the indexing language was the last step in the <b>subject</b> <b>cataloging</b> process of American catalogers, often skipped by Slovenian catalogers. Research limitations/implications - The small and convenient sample limits the findings. Practical implications - Comparison of <b>subject</b> <b>cataloging</b> processes of Slovenian and American catalogers, two different groups, is important because they both contribute to OCLC 2 ̆ 7 s WorldCat database. If the cataloging community is building a universal catalog and approaches to subject description are different, then the resulting subject representations might also be different. Originality/value - This is one of the very few empirical studies of <b>subject</b> <b>cataloging</b> and indexing.

The proliferation of subheadings is shown to present particularly vexing problems in catalog revision.

40|$|A model {{based on}} strikingly {{different}} philosophical as. sumptions from those currently popular is {{proposed for the}} design of online <b>subject</b> <b>catalog</b> access. Three de-sign principles are presented and discussed: uncer-tainty (subject indexing is indeterminate and probabilis-tic beyond a certain point), variety (by Ashby’s law of requisite variety, variety of searcher query must equal variety of document indexing), and complexity (the search process, particularly during the entry and orien-tation phases, is subtler and more complex, on several grounds, than current models assume). Design features presented are an access phase, including entry and ori-entation, a hunting phase, and a selection phase. An end-user thesaurus and a front-end system mind are presented as examples of online catalog system com-ponents to improve searcher success during entry and orientation. The proposed model is “wrapped around ” existing Library of Congress subject-heading indexing {{in such a way as}} to enhance access greatly without requiring reindexing.
