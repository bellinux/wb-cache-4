25|$|On {{the night}} of 23–24 July there was {{violence}} in the protesting. By the end of July 2013, anti-government protesters were still out in force protesting peacefully in Sofia with Reuters recording 24 July 2013 as the 41st <b>straight</b> <b>day</b> of peaceful protests. The protesters were demanding {{the resignation of the}} Socialist-led government of Oresharski. More than 100 lawmakers, ministers, and journalists spent the night barricaded inside Parliament before police removed them. MPs attempted to leave Parliament by boarding a white coach bus and making their way through the crowd. There was violence as the police tried to unsuccessfully clear the way for the bus, and after slowly making its way around the Aleksandar Nevski cathedral, the bus returned to the back exit of Parliament after about an hour around midnight. Another police action at around 4 am forcefully cleared the remaining protesters, and the coach left, which led to further accusations of police violence in the ensuing days. A survey covering the attitudes of Bulgarians showed that 65% felt that the actions of the protesters on that day were out of line, while 53% also disapproved of the police response. 79% agreed that the provocateurs involved in the violence need to have charges levelled against them. Sociologists expressed mixed views in relation to the events. One policeman has been charged for unlawful conduct with regard to his actions during the siege of Parliament and is currently on trial for disproportionate use of force against protesters.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} second half of the season with the return of injured stars Matt Kemp (out since mid-may with a {{hamstring}} injury) and Andre Ethier (out for two weeks with a strained oblique). A solid performance by Kershaw and Mark Ellis two-run homer propelled them to a 2–1 win over the San Diego Padres at Dodger Stadium. The next night, the Dodgers led going into the ninth but Everth Cabrera stole hole against closer Kenley Jansen to tie the game and Will Venable scored the winning run when Jansen's throw to the plate went wide of catcher A. J. Ellis. The final score was 7-6. A season high five errors, include two in the decisive seventh inning by Jerry Hairston, Jr. led to six unearned runs in the Padres 7–2 victory over the Dodgers on July 15. Homeruns by Jimmy Rollins and Ryan Howard sent the Dodgers to a 3–2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. A sore arm prevented Chad Billingsley from making his next start, on July 17, so the Dodgers called up Stephen Fife from the minors to make his Major League debut.
