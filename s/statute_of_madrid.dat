50|$|The Andalusian {{election}} debacle {{paved the}} way for the party's final decomposition in the run up to the next general election. Calvo-Sotelo announced in July 1982 his intention not to run as his party's main candidate for the premiership and resigned from the UCD presidency, but remained as Prime Minister. Replacing him as party candidate and leader was Landelino Lavilla, elected with a strong internal opposition (with the support of only 67% despite being the only party candidate). Concurrently, the UCD's continuous splits in the Congress (with its parliamentary group reduced to 150 out of 350) had, by the summer of 1982, deprived the party of a workable majority to govern until the end of the legislature in 1983, causing Calvo-Sotelo to announce the Cortes' dissolution and the call of a snap election for October 28 before the Parliament's reopening in September. Bill proposals such as the <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Madrid,</b> the Balearic Islands, Castile and León and Extremadura or the 1983 budget, scheduled to be approved throughout the autumn, had to be delayed until after the election as a result.|$|R

50|$|At {{the present}} time there are two {{nominally}} Castilian autonomous communities in Spain, as they hold the toponym in their own official name: Castile and Leon and Castile-La Mancha. A third, the Community <b>of</b> <b>Madrid</b> is considered also Castilian, by its geographic enclosure and, above all, by the statements <b>of</b> its <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy, since its autonomic process originated by national interest and not by popular disaffection with Castile.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the process}} whereby {{democracy}} was restored in Spain between 1975 and 1978, the nationalist and regionalist parties pressed to grant home rule to certain territories in Spain. The constitution of 1978 opened a legal way for autonomous communities to be formed from provinces with common {{historical and cultural}} links. Even though the province <b>of</b> <b>Madrid</b> belonged to the cultural and historical region of Castile, the other provinces refused to include Madrid in their autonomic developments and, finally, it was granted autonomy as a single-province community {{by means of the}} 144th article of the constitution which declared an exception to the aforementioned rule in the creation of autonomous communities if it was the [...] "nation's interest." [...] The Community <b>of</b> <b>Madrid</b> was created in 1982 after the elaboration <b>of</b> a <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy, later approved by the General Courts of Spain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{creation}} of the contemporary Community <b>of</b> <b>Madrid</b> was preceded by an intense political debate. Since the 1833 territorial division of Spain, the main administrative division had consisted of provinces. Autonomous communities were to be created {{by one or more}} provinces with a distinct regional identity. Since the 1833 provincial organization, <b>Madrid</b> was part <b>of</b> the historical region of New Castile along with the provinces of Guadalajara, Toledo, Cuenca and Ciudad Real. Thus, it was first planned that the province <b>of</b> <b>Madrid</b> would be part of the future community of Castile-La Mancha (which was roughly similar to New Castile, with the addition of the Albacete) but with some special considerations as the home of the national capital. The other provinces of the community of Castile-La Mancha expressed fears <b>of</b> inequality if <b>Madrid</b> were associated with them. The integrating provinces of Castile-La Mancha opposed such a special status, and after considering other options—like its inclusion in the community of Castile and León or its constitution as an entity similar to a federal district.—it was decided that the province <b>of</b> <b>Madrid</b> would become a single-province autonomous community by virtue of Article 144 of the Constitution, which empowers the Cortes to create an autonomous community in the [...] "nation's interest" [...] even if it did not satisfy the requirement of having a distinct historical identity. Thus, in 1983, the Community <b>of</b> <b>Madrid</b> was constituted and a <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy was approved taking over all the competences of the old Diputación Provincial and the new ones the Statute considered. The Community <b>of</b> <b>Madrid</b> <b>statute</b> recognizes the Castilian association of the community, and its membership in the Castilian region. Several failed proposals have been made to alleviate the concentration <b>of</b> institutions in <b>Madrid</b> city by transferring the Community's capital to other towns, such as Alcalá de Henares, in the 1980s, and more recently, Getafe ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose are {{distinct}} from <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> limitation, though their effects are very similar. Deadlines imposed by <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose are enforced much more strictly than those <b>of</b> <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> limitation. In {{contrast to a}} <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations, a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose [...] "is designed to bar actions after a specified period of time has run from the occurrence of some event other than the injury which {{gave rise to the}} claim." ...|$|R
50|$|In many cases, both a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> {{limitations}} and a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose will {{apply to the}} same case, and a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations may cut off liability even if the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations has not run. For example, a defect in an airplane might cause a crash twelve years after the date of initial sale, with the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations for a personal injury claim commencing on {{the date of the}} crash, but where a ten year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose on product liability claims will have already expired. The earlier expiration <b>of</b> the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose will prevent the personal injury claim even before the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations starts to run.|$|R
