5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
5|$|When I got {{the call}} , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
500|$|After {{revealing}} that {{the song was}} finished, Mr. Bangladesh stated {{that he wanted to}} wait until the right artist came along to record the song. He later decided that it would be Rihanna, saying, [...] "I was like, 'That's dope. That's Rihanna all day'. They sent the song back, and I finished producing it. I put the 'I love it' on it that they had already had... <b>She</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> and that's what it was." ...|$|E

500|$|... "We had {{the song}} pitched {{to us and}} {{originally}} it wasn’t a duet. The more I {{was listening to the}} thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of Train's [...] "Hey, Soul Sister" [...] by the Dalton Academy Warblers received even more praise than [...] "Don't Cry For Me Argentina". Benigno called it flawless, {{and gave it}} an [...] "A++", and Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it gave it her [...] "top prize" [...] of the night. Berk gave it four stars out of five, Burns said [...] "the Warblers sounded fantastic and fun", and Harper said <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> and that, like the audience on the show, she [...] "would have given it" [...] a [...] "standing ovation". Stack said he [...] "sorta" [...] hated the song [...] "from sheer overexposure", but [...] "Darren Criss sold it for me with his choreography and acting", {{and gave it a}} [...] "B+". Pat Monahan, the lead singer of Train, said: [...] "Loved it! I thought they did an amazing job." ...|$|E

500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not Your Kind of People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title and <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about the world", saying that [...] "it can be great to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only really interested in people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying and how you say it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said [...] "Fifteen" [...] {{was one of}} Swift's best-written songs. James Reed of The Boston Globe {{believed}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] was one of Fearlesss {{most interesting}} songs and stated he could visualize the lyrics of the song scribbled in a diary that chronicled Swift's freshman year in high school. Sean Dooley of About.com named it the best track on Fearless and said it showcased Swift's growth as a songwriter. Josh Love of The Village Voice called the song a [...] "standout" [...] on the album and found it a refreshing contradiction to typical, idealistic country songs. Prior to its single release, Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine suggested for the song be released as a single from Fearless, adding that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called the track a fantastically good song that broadened [...] "her potential market from teenage girls to anyone {{who used to be}} a teenage girl". Petridis continued, [...] "You applaud her skill, while feeling slightly unsettled by the thought of a teenager pontificating away like Yoda." [...] Aidan Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle ranked it twelfth on his top 12 singles of 2009 list, commenting, [...] "Damn it if this song isn't too sweet, too vulnerable and just too real to ignore." ...|$|E
500|$|A Bollywood {{version of}} the song was done by Indian music {{producer}} duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant. The remix was released on DesiHits.com, a website for South Asian music and entertainment news. The Merchants were discussing music projects with Anjula Acharia-Bath of DesiHits.com, {{when they came to}} learn that Gaga, who did not have much reach within the Indian diaspora, was interested in a Bollywood remix for [...] "Born This Way". The Merchants were contacted by Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, and the remix was finalized. Sulaiman explained that they received Gaga's raw vocals from [...] "Born This Way", and using it as a base, they designed the remix. [...] "We sent her a rough cut of our composition for initial feedback on whether we were giving it the right groove. <b>She</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> and that's how we went about it," [...] he added. The Merchants used a number of Indian musical instruments like the dugi, sitar by Sunil Das, and the dhol and dholak in the chorus. Salim said that he sang a little bit of alaap to give the remix a Sufi touch, [...] "as that's the kind of music we do and it was also about adding our signature." [...] Gaga's management team were satisfied with their remix and wanted them to do another remix of her next song, [...] "Judas". The Bollywood remixes were a part of the Indian track list of Born This Way.|$|E

500|$|... "Creep" [...] has {{not only}} been covered, {{it has also been}} sampled and recreated by many hip-hop and R artists. Two of the notable ones were {{released}} on SoundCloud in 2013 and gained many attention from the public are Haitian-Canadian record producer Kaytranada's remix of the song called [...] "Kaytranada's Creepier Edition" [...] in January and GoldLink's own rap rendition in December. Later in July 2015, American singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger re-wrote and recorded {{a new version of the}} track for his album Cuffing Season. He simply called his version [...] "Creep" [...] and invited Watkins to contribute vocals for a new verse. [...] "When I heard [...] flip I immediately knew I had to at least try to get T-Boz on it since that was her solo song with ! Luckily when she heard the record <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it!</b> Hopefully the fans will too!," [...] Bellinger said in a statement sent to MTV News. In the track, its new content finds Bellinger making promises to never cheat on his lover. The original [...] "Creep" [...] also made its appearance on The Game's [...] "Sex Skit" [...] from his album The Documentary 2.5, released in October 2015. In February 2016, singer Zendaya sampled the song for her single [...] "Something New" [...] with Chris Brown. [...] "Well the song, when I first heard it, already had that TLC sample in it. And that's kind of what I think made me want to record it. That was literally the first thing I heard was 'Do do, do,' , and I was like, 'Oh, yes. Yes, please.'," [...] she shared. Watkins had also confirmed to have a cameo on its music video that hasn't yet been released.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, he {{returned}} to Los Angeles to record Loup Garou, again with producer John Philip Shenale. Musician said about the album: [...] "Loup Garou is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope, it connects the dots between all of the artist's sacrosanct influences, often {{within the framework of}} a single song... All of it is on the money, performed from the heart..." [...] Loup Garou featured a duet with Brenda Lee; DeVille said: [...] "She didn't know who the hell I was. I just called her up, played the song for her, and <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> She had her business people check me out, and they reported that I was big in Europe and had been recording for twenty years.

50|$|As {{a visual}} artist, Tamblyn worked in {{performance}} and new media {{and was in}} the forefront of those experimenting with video and computer technologies for the creation of conceptual art. Indeed, along with artists such as Timothy Binkley, Tamblyn argued that the emergence of computer art represented the apogee of the 20th century's conceptual art movement. Many of Tamblyn's works were autobiographically inflected, including the CD-ROM projects <b>She</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>It,</b> <b>She</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>It</b> Not: Women and Technology (1993), Mistaken Identities (1995)—both of which have been shown widely—and the posthumous Archival Quality (1998). By including personal materials such as childhood journals, Tamblyn underlined the fact that interactive media do not provide a space of absolute freedom for the viewer but instead offer a structure that complexly links viewer to artist. Tamblyn's work was exhibited during her lifetime at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (London), Pacific Film Archives (California), San Francisco Exploratorium, Wexner Center for Contemporary Art (Ohio); Walter Phillips Gallery in the Banff Centre (Canada), and numerous other international venues.|$|R
