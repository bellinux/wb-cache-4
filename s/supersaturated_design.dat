This paper mainly concerns the existing criteria for mixed-level designs, i. e. the [chi] 2 (D) criterion (for design D) proposed by Yamada and Matsui (J. Statist. Plann. Inference 104 (2002) 459), the E(fNOD) criterion proposed by Fang et al. (Metrika 58 (2003 b) 279) and the minimum moment aberration (MMA) proposed by Xu (Statist. Sinica 13 (2003) 691). A lower bound of [chi] 2 (D) is obtained along with the sufficient and necessary condition for achieving it. The connections between [chi] 2 (D) and other criteria are discussed. Especially, it is shown that [chi] 2 (D) and the second power moment K 2 (D) are in fact equivalent to each other and hence the two criteria, [chi] 2 (D) and MMA, share the same optimal supersaturated designs, which can be constructed from saturated orthogonal arrays and other supersaturated designs.

40|$|Complex {{systems such}} as {{large-scale}} computer simulation models typically involve {{a large number of}} factors. When investigating such a system, screening experiments are often used to sift through these factors to identify a subgroup of factors that most significantly influence the interested response. Our work focuses on analysis-method-directed optimal <b>supersaturated</b> <b>designs</b> for high-dimensional screening experiments. ^ A typical screening procedure consists of two steps: the experiment step and the analysis step. With a large number of factors, both of these two steps can be extremely challenging in practice.
