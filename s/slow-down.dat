25|$|Age-dependent {{changes in}} the rate of spine {{turnover}} suggest that spine stability impacts developmental learning. In youth, dendritic spine turnover is relatively high and produces a net loss of spines. This high rate of spine turnover may characterize critical periods of development and reflect learning capacity in adolescence—different cortical areas exhibit differing levels of synaptic turnover during development, possibly reflecting varying critical periods for specific brain regions. In adulthood, however, most spines remain persistent, and the half-life of spines increases. This stabilization occurs due to a developmentally regulated <b>slow-down</b> of spine elimination, a process which may underlie the stabilization of memories in maturity.|$|E

25|$|After {{improved}} German Panzer IVs {{with the}} high-velocity 75mm (2.95in) gun were encountered in combat in 1942, {{a project to}} design an entirely new Soviet tank was begun, {{with the goals of}} increasing armour protection while adding modern features like a torsion-bar suspension and a three-man turret. This new tank, the T-43, was intended to be a universal tank to replace both the T-34 and the KV-1 heavy tank. However, the T-43 prototype's armour, though heavier, was still not proof against German 88mm guns, while its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34. Finally, although the T-43 shared over 70% of its components with the T-34, manufacturing it would still have required a significant <b>slow-down</b> in production. Consequently, the T-43 was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|A {{spate of}} suicide bombings {{reinforced}} the Likud position for security. Hamas {{claimed responsibility for}} most of the bombings. As Prime Minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the Oslo Accords. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages. Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. He called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions. Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his Premiership saw a marked <b>slow-down</b> in the peace process.|$|E
25|$|On 5 June 1944, B-29s raided Bangkok, {{in what is}} {{reported}} as a test before being deployed against the Japanese home islands. Sources do not report from where they launched, and vary as to the numbers involved—77, 98, and 114 being claimed. Targets were Bangkok's Memorial Bridge and a major power plant. Bombs fell over two kilometres away, damaged no civilian structures, but destroyed some tram lines and destroyed both a Japanese military hospital and the Japanese secret police headquarters. On 15 June 1944, 68 B-29s took off from bases around Chengdu, 47 B-29s bombed the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. This was the first attack on Japanese islands since the Doolittle raid in April 1942. The first B-29 combat losses occurred during this raid, with one B-29 destroyed on the ground by Japanese fighters after an emergency landing in China, one lost to anti-aircraft fire over Yawata, and another, the Stockett's Rocket (after Capt. Marvin M. Stockett, Aircraft Commander) B-29-1-BW 42-6261, disappeared after takeoff from Chakulia, India, over the Himalayas (12 KIA, 11 crew and one passenger) This raid, which did little damage to the target, with only one bomb striking the target factory complex, nearly exhausted fuel stocks at the Chengdu B-29 bases, resulting in a <b>slow-down</b> of operations until the fuel stockpiles could be replenished. Starting in July, the raids against Japan from Chinese airfields continued at relatively low intensity. Japan was bombed on: 7 July 1944 (14 B-29s), 29 July (70+), 10 August (24), 20 August (61), 8 September (90), 26 September (83), 25 October (59), 12 November (29), 21 November (61), 19 December (36) {{and for the last}} time on 6 January 1945 (49).|$|E

Play Magazine awarded it a perfect score, stating that [...] "In the case of Odin Sphere, [...] confident that this is a perfect game, and that anyone who comes to it will derive the same," [...] praising its 2D graphics, detailed storyline, and unique combat system as high points. Western reviewers generally praised the game highly: the story was cited as both compelling and well-told, with it being compared to the works of Shakespeare and the A Song of Ice and Fire book series. The gameplay systems and controls were generally praised, but while crisisms was laid upon elements of repetition in its combat and progression, and its inventory system.

2500|$|At the , an inter-team feud {{broke out}} after Red Bull brought two updated front wings to the race. After one was broken {{when it became}} {{detached}} from Vettel's car in the third free practice session, Vettel was given the second wing for qualifying based upon championship positions and practice pace, which left team-mate Webber frustrated. With the new wing, Vettel qualified on pole with Webber recording the second-fastest time in the session. Webber made a better start than his team-mate and overhauled Vettel into the first corner, while Vettel suffered a puncture due to contact with the front wing endplate of Lewis Hamilton's McLaren, which dropped him to {{the tail of the}} field. He would recover to seventh place, while Webber went on to take his third victory of the season. On the <b>slow-down</b> lap, Webber, still angry at the situation, told his team over the radio that his victory was [...] "not bad for a number two driver", and in the post-race press conference, he stated that he would not have signed a contract extension with the team - having signed a contract extension for 2011 in the preceding month - had he believed {{he was going to be}} treated unfavourably to Vettel.|$|E
