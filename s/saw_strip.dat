5000|$|In {{the second}} incident, Alaungsithu awarded a royal {{attendant}} named Ananda Thuriya a robe of princely attire, worn only by princes. When the attendant {{showed up with}} the robe at the royal council, Min Shin <b>Saw</b> <b>stripped</b> the robe off Ananda Thuriya, saying [...] "This garment is not for a king's usher or nurse to wear. Only the king's brothers and sons are worthy to wear it." [...] The old king was greatly disturbed that Min Shin Saw was acting like a king even when the king was still alive.|$|R

5000|$|... ‘Here I <b>saw</b> art <b>stripped</b> of all esoteric and {{conceptual}} pretensions. I gladly adopted this approach, {{which seemed to}} be more vital than any current “-ism”. I found myself on an interior journey in which landscape and subject were subsumed to inner vision. This led to the large bondaged heads which, I hope, stand as an image of schizophrenia.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Gradually {{the wood}} lightened. They were nearing {{the edge of}} the park. Helen now <b>saw</b> a <b>strip</b> of open with a high, black wall of spruce beyond.

60|$|Two {{or three}} of the Marats lurched up to Leroy, and ran their hands over him, turning out his pockets, and cursing him foully for their emptiness. He saw the same office {{performed}} upon others, and <b>saw</b> them <b>stripped</b> of money, pocket-books, watches, rings, buckles, and whatever else of value they happened to possess. One man, a priest, was even deprived of his shoes by a ruffian who was in want of foot-gear.|$|R
6000|$|... “But I know. Often when we {{were alone}} Henry Allègre used to pour it into my ears.

Certainly not old enough to understand—or even to believe. But then his arm was about me. I used to laugh, sometimes. Laugh! At this destruction—at these ruins!” ...|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from their}} {{military}} service, S.61s {{were used in}} France for racing and record-setting attempts. On 25 June 1925, Pelletier d'Oisy won the cross-country Coupe Michelin in an S.61, and another of the type won the 1927 competition and was placed second in 1929. An S.61 was also used by Jean Callizo in his fraudulent attempt on the world altitude record that <b>saw</b> him <b>stripped</b> of his Légion d'Honneur. A Polish S.61 placed second in the Capitaine Echard race at the Zürich aerial meeting in 1927.|$|R
50|$|The 2010 Melbourne Storm {{season was}} the 13th in the club's history and {{competed in the}} NRL's 2010 Telstra Premiership. After winning the first four games of the season, Storm’s season would hit a {{significant}} challenge after Round 6 when the NRL penalised the Club for salary cap breaches with the team unable to play for points {{for the remainder of}} the season. These revelations also <b>saw</b> them <b>stripped</b> of the 2007 and 2009 Premierships and the 2006, 2007 and 2008 minor premiership titles.|$|R
50|$|Chad became {{independent}} in 1960, and in 1965 the Chadian administration settled itself in Tibesti. The derde, Oueddei Kichidemi, <b>saw</b> himself <b>stripped</b> of his powers {{by the new}} government, provoking him in going in exile in 1966, an event considered the signal of {{the start of the}} Chadian Civil War in the north. The derde became {{now for the first time}} a national symbol through his opposition to the government, a role that after 1975, when the derde returned in Chad, was never to be recovered again.|$|R
5000|$|Work on the {{extension}} of the runway started on 31 January 2007, involving the moving of [...] of earthwork.

40|$|The {{influence}} of applied clad procedure {{as well as}} heat treatment by annealing (650 °C/ 2 h) on level and nature of residual stresses was researched. Three clad procedures are used i. e. hot rolling, submerged arc welding (<b>SAW)</b> with <b>strip</b> electrode and explosion welding. The relaxed deformation measurement on clad plate surfaces was performed by applying centre-hole drilling method using special measuring electrical resistance strain gauges (rosettes). After performed measuring, size and nature of residual stresses were determined using analytical method. Depending of residual stresses on depth of drilled blind-hole is studied...|$|R

50|$|ERP Saints {{followed}} in 2004 {{as a tribute}} to the East Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago. This session <b>saw</b> the band <b>stripped</b> down to a quartet. Critics such as Larry Dolman and Matt Weir praised the effort for its clarity and noted a definitive shift in aesthetics: a turning to the light.|$|R
50|$|The Caprivi Strip is of politico-strategic {{military}} importance. During the Rhodesian Bush War (1970-1979), African National Congress {{operations against}} the South African government (1965-1994) and the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002), the <b>Strip</b> <b>saw</b> continual military action and multiple incursions by various armed forces using the Strip as a corridor to access other territories.|$|R
60|$|Hetty looked again, and <b>saw</b> that a <b>strip</b> of deer-hide {{with holes}} cut {{in it was}} tied across the face.

50|$|In 1400 Sadayo {{was once}} again {{questioned}} by the Bakufu, this time {{in relation to the}} Imagawa's province of Tōtōmi's failure to respond to a levy issued by the Bakufu- a negligence interpretable as treason and rebellion. This charge <b>saw</b> Sadayo <b>stripped</b> of his post as constable of Suruga and Tōtōmi provinces, and gave him reason to believe he might be assassinated. With this in mind he fled the capital for a time, though was later pardoned and returned to the capital, spending the rest of his days pursuing religious devotions and poetry until his death in 1420.|$|R

I sat there for some time, back amongst the trees, and I think that I must have fallen to sleep. There was a whisper in my ears and I <b>saw</b> myself <b>stripped</b> of everything. How was it? I forget now! A concession repudiated, a bank failure, a big slump--what does it matter? The money was gone, and I was simply myself again, Scarlett Trent, a labourer, penniless and of no account." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{on-screen}} feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began {{weeks before}} SummerSlam. As {{part of his}} gimmick, Rude would—after winning a match—invite a pre-selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring. On one occasion, {{one of the women}} refused to comply, later identifying herself as Robert's wife, Cheryl. As the feud intensified, Rude began wearing a pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them, prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked, although the live audience <b>saw</b> him <b>stripped</b> to a G-string instead.|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{existence}} of the infinite length self-avoiding walk in the half plane and its relationship to bridges. We prove that this probability measure is also given by the limit as β→β_c- of the probability measure on all finite length walks ω with the probability of ω proportional to β_c^|ω| where |ω| is the number of steps in ω. The self-avoiding walk in a strip {z : 0 <(z) <y} is defined by considering all self-avoiding walks ω in the strip which start at the origin and end somewhere on the top boundary with probability proportional to β_c^|ω| We prove that this probability measure may be obtained by conditioning the SAW in the half plane to have a bridge at height y. This observation is the basis for simulations to test conjectures on the distribution of the endpoint of the <b>SAW</b> in a <b>strip</b> and the relationship between the distribution of this <b>strip</b> <b>SAW</b> and SLE_ 8 / 3.
