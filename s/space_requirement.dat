25|$|It is {{frequently}} {{important to know}} how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(n), using the big O notation with n as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a <b>space</b> <b>requirement</b> of O(1), if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(n) if it is counted.|$|E

Introduction Time and <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> of problems, and algorithms to solve them, have been studied under the name "computational complexity". Problems and algorithms are classified according to their time and <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> expressed to within multiplicative and additive constants. See, for example, [Pap 94]. Those studies do not look at individual programs, since their intent is to classify the complexity of an algorithm independent of any program to compute it, or to classify the complexity of a problem independent of any algorithm to solve it. In this paper we are concerned with the time and <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> of programs, and with the multiplicative and additive consta [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} scheduling by periodization as a {{new approach}} to the design and analysis of efficient algorithms finding compactly specified schedules. The approach is demonstrated in application to the two-machine maximum-lateness unit-time job-shop scheduling problem. Earlier, Brucker proposed the largest-lag-first algorithm which is of pseudopolynomial time proportional to the total number of operations in jobs. We show that by using periodization Brucker's algorithm can be elaborated to solve the problem in polynomial time. The result represents a rare example of when a pseudopolynomial algorithm can be brought to a polynomial algorithm which, in addition, proves to have the best presently known time and <b>space</b> <b>requirements.</b> In comparison with an earlier algorithm of Timkovsky with time and <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> both O(n&sup 2;), where n is the number of jobs, the algorithm in this paper has time and <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> O(n&sup 2;) and O(n), respectively...|$|R
