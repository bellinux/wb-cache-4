40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address a classic problem – pattern {{formation}} identified by researchers in the area of <b>swarm</b> robotic <b>systems</b> – and is also motivated by the need for mathematical foundations in <b>swarm</b> <b>systems.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The work is separated out as inspirations, applications, definitions, challenges and classifications of pattern formation in <b>swarm</b> <b>systems</b> based on recent literature. Further, the work proposes a mathematical model for swarm pattern formation and transformation. Findings: A swarm pattern formation model based on mathematical foundations and macroscopic primitives is proposed. A formal definition for swarm pattern transformation and four special cases of transformation are introduced. Two general methods for transforming patterns are investigated and a comparison of the two methods is presented. The validity of the proposed models, and the feasibility of the methods investigated are confirmed on the Traer Physics and Processing environment.

This pa-per proposes a <b>swarm</b> <b>system</b> capable of extracting and exploiting the geometric properties of objects in images for fast and accurate recognition. In this approach, computational agents move over an image and affix themselves to relevant features, such as edges and corners. The resulting feature profile is then processed by a clas-sification subsystem to categorize the object. The system has been tested with images containing several simple geometric shapes at a variety of noise levels, and evaluated based upon the accuracy of the system's predictions.
