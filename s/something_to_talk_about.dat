25|$|Hawn {{was absent}} from the screen for four years while caring for her mother who {{died of cancer in}} 1994.

500|$|By this time, the war {{was closing}} in on the embattled Emperor. A Union of Czech Deputies had already sworn an oath to a new Czechoslovak state {{independent}} of the Habsburg Empire on 13 April 1918, the prestige of the German Army had taken a severe blow at the Battle of Amiens, and, on 25 September 1918, her brother in law King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria broke away from his allies in the Central Powers and sued for peace independently. Zita was with Charles when he received the telegram of Bulgaria's collapse. She remembered it [...] "made it even more urgent to start peace talks with the Western Powers while there was still <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> On 16 October, the emperor issued a [...] "People's Manifesto" [...] proposing the empire be restructured on federal lines with each nationality gaining its own state. Instead, each nation broke away and the empire effectively dissolved.|$|E
60|$|Lady English and Mrs. Levitte found <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> between themselves. Lady Somerham, however, had no {{intention}} of letting Tallente escape.|$|R

50|$|Nina {{arrived in}} Pine Valley for the Martin family housewarming. She had <b>something</b> {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> with her father, {{but decided to}} hold off after catching him in a heated argument with her mother.|$|R
500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E

2500|$|Ed Brophy, {{director}} of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, noted Camacho's talents in attracting an audience. He said, [...] "Camacho {{brought a lot of}} excitement to boxing. He was bright, colorful, and always gave <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> with his walks to the ring, with his unique style of entering, and the costumes he wore." [...] Brophy also praised Camacho's boxing skills, describing him as [...] "an exciting fighter, and one of the greats. He faced the best, going up and down several divisions." [...] Alfredo R.

6000|$|... "You can't see him now," [...] said Muriel, {{moving toward}} the sleigh. [...] "He's engaged with Gertrude and his father, and I think they have <b>something</b> {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> Cyril looked very serious, and one would imagine that's not {{often the case with}} him." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} quiet, {{as if it}} were <b>something</b> not <b>to</b> be <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> by him. He seemed sad.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And was the fellow-prisoner his {{accomplice}} and a murderer, too? But, of course, {{he gives}} a better account of himself than of his friend; it is needless to ask.

60|$|Stevens's eyes sparkled. He {{was young}} and enthusiastic, and to climb with a mountaineer like Stannard was <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
60|$|A common {{exclamation from}} the young men proclaimed their disapprobation; and that night three of them {{actually}} repeated the thing, as a well established truth, {{and two of the}} three, failing of <b>something</b> better <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> also announced that Eve was actually engaged to be married.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there's <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> It won't be {{long before}} Dick is his own master, and we must leave Appleyard.

6000|$|... "'Take it easy, Barney,' says I. 'I think there's been {{a change}} of plans. There's <b>something</b> more {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> Have you any money?' ...|$|R
60|$|When {{she married}} she dropped out. The romance of her wedding gave people <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{for a few}} days, {{and then she was}} forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expect you}} had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> just now. You and Janet Halliday {{understand}} each other well. I don't know if you are confidants or accomplices." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no. I {{am going}} to see it to the end," [...] {{declared}} the old lady. [...] "It will be <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> as long as I live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did she want?" [...] It was an axiom {{with the}} Forsytes {{that people did}} not go {{anywhere}} unless they wanted <b>something.</b> [...] "Came <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> her lover, I suppose?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Television {{broadcasts}} featuring Nelson were {{notable for}} his multi-colored [...] sports jackets. He reportedly owned 335 {{of them at}} one time. During a broadcast, his jackets often clashed with the set and produced a scintillation effect in the broadcast image. But he figured that if fans could see rather than just hear broadcasts, {{he might as well}} give them <b>something</b> interesting <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
60|$|However {{that may}} be, when the lovely {{moonlight}} tempted {{us into the}} garden, there was an end to our jokes. We had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> which still dwells disagreeably on my mind.|$|E

6000|$|... "If it {{please you}} {{to wait a}} moment, I will go and ask him," [...] said the servant, {{and then he went}} into the hall where the Tin Woodman sat with his friend the Scarecrow.

6000|$|... "No; it's not lost. You {{will hear}} more of it directly. Dry your eyes, and expect <b>something</b> interesting--I'm going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> love.

6000|$|Finally Throgmorton, as we saw, had the boldness to {{send his}} secretary, Jones, direct to Elizabeth.

Throgmorton, however, persevered till, in January 1561, Cecil plainly told him to cease to meddle. Throgmorton endorsed the letter 'A warning {{not to be too}} busy about the matters between the Queen and Lord Robert.'* ...|$|R
60|$|The {{beginning}} of a big row, one of those rows which turn a school upside down like a volcanic eruption and provide old boys with <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> when they meet, for years, is not unlike the {{beginning of}} a thunderstorm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Jack, {{you are a}} lucky fellow!" [...] Harry said, when he had finished. [...] "To {{think of}} your having gone through all those adventures and living to tell of them. Why, it will be <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> all your life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I says, [...] "surely a gent {{can bring}} his cook {{along with him}} to cook for him. And as for people talking, what I always say is, one may just as well give them <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> and save them the trouble of making it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] cried Corny, {{as soon as}} she saw me. [...] "We have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about!</b> Let's go and sit down. I {{wish there}} was some kind of an {{umbrella}} or straw hat that people could wear under their chins to keep the glare of these white roads out of their eyes. Let's go up into the silk-cotton tree." ...|$|R
50|$|The poustinik {{was also}} {{available}} to the people. When there were special needs, such as a fire to fight or hay to bring in, the poustinik would help.

5000|$|On August 21, 2012, Amorphis {{announced}} on their website {{that a new}} album was in the works. On January 17, 2013, the band announced the title and release date for their next record.

Back in the days, when there was <b>something</b> special <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> wise men used to sit in circle. Not everyone was invited to join them. But in this story, the protagonist was invited among the wise men's circle.” ...|$|R
