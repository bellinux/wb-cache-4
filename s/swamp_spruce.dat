40|$|The {{research}} {{carried out}} on <b>swamp</b> <b>spruce</b> forests on peatland in Latvia gives a detailed notion of the phytosociological structure of Ass. Sphagno girgensohnii - Piceetum (Br. - BI. 39) Polak. 62 {{in the western part}} of the East-European Plain at the Baltic Sea. The paper reflects one of the aspects of swamp forest investigation results in Latvia on forest communities, its biodiversity and presevation. Ninety-one sample plots with Picea abies as the dominant in the tree layer or co-dominant with Betula pendula, Betula pubescens or Pinus sylvestris are described according to phytosociological Braun-Blanquet methodology. Floristic features of spruce communities belonging to Caricoso-phragmitosa and Dryopterioso-cnricosa forest site types are analysed. The results are compared with similar investigations carried out in the Baltic Sea region states and neighbouring countries...|$|E

40|$|Damage by the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens), on balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., {{in local}} {{ecosystems}} (site units) of the Ottawa National Forest (western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, U. S. A.) was studied {{in relation to}} site factors. A multi-factor ecological approach was used to distinguish 25 spruce-fir-dominated ecosystems {{on a variety of}} different sites, ranging from dry-mesic outwash plains to river floodplains and <b>swamps.</b> <b>Spruce</b> budworm damage on balsam fir appears to be more directly related to site factors (specifically soil type and drainage class) than to stand parameters such as relative dominance or living-plus-dead basal area. Damage on balsam fir was greatest on wetland ecosystems with organic soils and on dryland ecosystems with impeded drainage. The heavy damage on these soils is probably a consequence of shallow rooting habit which predisposes the physiologically mature balsam fir to drought injury, lessened vigor, and a lessened ability to withstand defoliation. Black spruce, Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P., also exhibited heavy damage on sites where it is not well adapted, i. e. somewhat excessively drained dryland ecosystems. An understanding of the site factors and the ecosystem classification provide the basis for predicting where the greatest damage can be expected...|$|R

50|$|A swamp {{known as}} the Bellas Brook Swamp is located near the {{headwaters}} of Bellas Brook and is listed on the Wyoming County Natural Areas Inventory. This swamp is a spruce-hemlock swamp.

40|$|Forested {{wetlands}} {{throughout the}} world are valuable habitats; especially in relatively species-poor northern regions, they can be considered biological hotspots. Unfortunately, these areas have been degraded and destroyed. In recent years, however, the biological importance of wetlands has been increasingly recognized, resulting in the desire to restore disturbed habitats or create in place of destroyed ones. Restoration work is taking place across the globe in a diversity of wetland types, and research must be conducted to determine successful techniques. As a result, two studies {{of the effects of}} wetland restoration and creation were conducted in forested wetlands in northern Michigan and southern Finland. In North America, northern white-cedar wetlands have been declining in area, despite attempts to regenerate them. Improved methods for successfully establishing northern white-cedar are needed; as a result, the target of the first study was to determine if creating microtopography could be beneficial for white-cedar recruitment and growth. In northern Europe, <b>spruce</b> <b>swamp</b> forests have become a threatened ecosystem due to extensive drainage for forestry. As part of the restoration of these habitats, i. e. rewetting through ditch blocking, Sphagnum mosses are considered to be a critical element to re-establish, and an in-depth analysis of how Sphagnum is responding to restoration in <b>spruce</b> <b>swamp</b> forests has not been previously done. As a result, the aim of the second study was to investigate the ecophysiological functioning of Sphagnum and feather mosses across a gradient of pristine, drained, and restored boreal <b>spruce</b> <b>swamp</b> forests...|$|R

5000|$|Since the North Branch Land Trust {{has been}} conserving lands {{there has been}} a total of 53 {{properties}} and 10,831 acres, across eight counties in the Northeastern region of Pennsylvania conserved. [...] That does not include the 1,250 acres that the North Branch owns completely. In these counties, countless properties have environmental treasures that are nearly extinct. Such as spring seeps, vernal pools, acidic shrub <b>swamps,</b> rare red <b>spruce</b> <b>swamps,</b> and an extremely rare glacial kettle bog. [...] This all consumes one property, Bear Creek Camp in Luzerne County. There are other lands conserved with special and biologically significant features such as the Macialek property, and Kuryloski Woods. In 2010 NBLT conserved 3,000 acres in Luzerne County. This property, named after {{the fact that it was}} sold for only half it’s worth, Mocanaqua Tract was preserved to save the rare cranberry bog and orchids that grow on this property.

50|$|A site {{known as}} the Becker Brook Swamp is listed on the Wyoming County Natural Areas Inventory and at the {{headwaters}} of Becker Brook. Major environmental threats to this site include beaver activity, logging, and ATV usage. The Wyoming County Natural Areas Inventory recommended protecting the swamp and surrounding areas from ATV usage. Dominant plant species in the <b>swamp</b> include red <b>spruce,</b> red maple, dense thickets of highbush blueberry, cinnamon fern, and sphagnum moss.|$|R
50|$|Conifer swamps {{occur in}} areas that {{seasonally}} flooded. Trees can be very dense or sparse; mats of sphagnum moss cover the ground.

Artifacts such as projectile points found there indicate that the earliest residents of this site were primarily hunters. Later dwellers eventually added shellfish to their diet. After Long Island Sound moved inland, <b>Spruce</b> <b>Swamp</b> became infused with salt-water, and apparently, the site was abandoned at some time between 1000 B.C. and 1500 A.D. In the layers of the midden, two unique objects - a decorated paintstone?,which may have depicted an astronomical phenomenon or have been a plan of the original village, and the skull of an adult male, bearing healed scars that seem to indicate a hole drilled, incised or scraped into the skull using simple surgical tools while the recipient remains alive... may provide important clues to the origins of these people."

5|$|On 10 August 1959, a B-52 {{crashed in}} the <b>Spruce</b> <b>Swamp</b> at Fremont, New Hampshire. The bomber {{was on a}} routine {{training}} mission from Chicopee, Massachusetts, when its air speed indicator and altimeter failed, which led to more serious malfunctions. The B-52 was attempting to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, the only landing option not affected by foggy weather conditions. However, it crashed before making the landing. The U.S. Air Force reported {{that it was the}} first B-52 crash where the entire crew survived; the crew parachuted to safety. Debris from the crash covered a quarter-mile of densely wooded swampland.|$|R
40|$|Peer-reviewed Research Note. Highlights • In the boreal region, {{knowledge}} of plant species diversity (richness and rarity) is low {{compared with other}} taxa such as birds and mammals. This is particularly true of peatlands, which have {{a higher proportion of}} characteristic species compared to upland ecosystems in the same region. • Peatlands influence biodiversity far beyond their borders by maintaining hydrological and microclimate features of adjacent areas and providing temporary habitats or refuges for upland species. • Although not yet commonly logged in western Canada, wooded moderate-rich fens and black <b>spruce</b> <b>swamps</b> may have stands of marketable timber. Research has shown that, compared to other peatland types, these types have significantly higher plant diversity. • Knowledge of plant diversity in peatlands can improve the development of effective forest management plans. What is currently known about plant diversity in peatlands could be integrated into forest management plans at the ecosite and ecoelement scales...|$|R
40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{thinning}} at various intensities {{on the growth}} and mortality of mixed spruce-birch stands were investigated in thinning experiments on <b>spruce</b> <b>swamps</b> in northern and south-eastern Finland. At the time of establishment, three of the stands had recently reached the first commercial thinning stage and four were more advanced. The monitoring period was mainly 15 years, and the thinning intensity varied from heavy thinning (ca. 46 per cent of the basal area removed) to no thinning. Basal area removals of light and moderate thinning were ca. 22 % and 39 %, respectively. Unthinned plots had the highest volume increment. Light and moderate thinning slightly decreased the 15 -year volume increment by, on an average, 1 % and 8 %, respectively. Heavy thinning led to a greater reduction (22 %) in volume increment. The growth response to thinning intensity was evident as a higher relative volume and mean diameter increment of the living trees with decreasing stand density. Part of the volume increment on the unthinned plots was lost through natural mortality. Even light thinning significantly decreased natural mortality...|$|R
40|$|Forestry-drained peatlands in the boreal {{region are}} {{currently}} undergoing restoration {{in order to}} bring these ecosystems closer to their natural (undrained) state. Drainage affects the methane (CH 4) dynamics of a peatland, often changing sites from CH 4 sources to sinks. Successful restoration of a peatland would include restoration of not only the surface vegetation and hydrology, but also the microbial populations and thus CH 4 dynamics. As a pilot study, CH 4 emissions were measured on two pristine, two drained and three restored boreal <b>spruce</b> <b>swamps</b> in southern Finland for one growing season. Restoration was successful {{in the sense that the}} water table level in the restored sites was significantly higher than in the drained sites, but it was also slightly higher than in the pristine sites. The restored sites were surprisingly large sources of CH 4 (mean emissions of 52. 84 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1), contrasting with both the pristine (1. 51 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1) and the drained sites (2. 09 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1). More research is needed to assess whether the high CH 4 emissions observed in this study are representative of restored spruce mires in general...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on {{the area of the}} Ryzhukha Swamp Natural Monument (the Bryansk region). Unique {{communities}} – tall-herb spruce forests – are preserved in this <b>swamp.</b> A tall-herb <b>spruce</b> forest is the final stage (climax) of the succession of black alder swamp forest for the area of Picea abies and Alnus glutinosa. However, tall-herb spruce forests have almost completely disappeared due to felling, melioration and peat extraction. Geobotanical descriptions indicate that vascular plant species richness in tall-herb spruce forests is two or three times higher than in black alder forests. Mapping of the soil cover showed that {{this is due to the}} developed system of microsites in the tall-herb spruce forest. A significant proportion of the organic soil area (80 % or more) is covered by microsites of biogenic origin: treefall mounds, sedge tussocks, fallen logs, black alder hummocks, substrate composed of the surface tree roots and elevated base of trees. These biogenic microsites are characterised by a lower moisture excess, better aerated substrate, and also, less frequent flooding during high water in comparison with wet organic soil. Ecologically contrasting microsites are formed as a result of plant life and death. This ensures the joint existence of different ecological-coenotic species group in the community. Wet peat soils, treefall pits, sedge tussocks and fallen logs are favourable to species of nitrophilous, moist-meadow and water-marsh ecological-coenotic groups. Black alder hummocks, substrate composed of the surface roots and elevated base of trees are suitable for species of nemoral and boreal groups. Studies have shown that the system of microsites is necessary for the existence of rare species in the community. Thus, Cypripedium calceolus grows mainly on substrate composed of the surface roots and on elevated base of trees; Neottia nidus-avis, on elevated base of trees; Corallorrhiza trifida, Dactylorhiza fuchsii, Ligularia sibirica, Listera ovata and Malaxis monophyllos, on substrate composed of the surface roots; Daphne mezereum, on black alder hummocks and on substrate composed of the surface roots; Melandrium dioicum, on sedge tussocks and fallen logs. Due to favourable ecological conditions, the species richness in biogenic microsites is about two times higher than in wet organic soil. Microsites of biogenic origin are related. Thus, fallen logs are the basis for the formation of alder hummocks and sedge tussocks, as well as for substrate composed of the surface tree roots. In turn, sedge tussocks create conditions for the development of alder hummocks. Elevated base of trees (multi-trunk formations) of other species are formed later on the alder hummocks. Aging trees and treefalls of spruce, alder and other tree species are the next generation of fallen logs. Thus, the normal turnover of generations in tree populations is a condition for maintaining the structural and species diversity of tall-herb spruce forests...|$|R
