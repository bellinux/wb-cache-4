5|$|Laridae is {{a family}} of medium to large seabirds, the gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are {{typically}} grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and <b>skimming</b> the water for small fish.|$|E

5|$|Zappa's {{relationship}} with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for <b>skimming</b> {{more than he}} was allocated from DiscReet Records, {{as well as for}} signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that readers {{spend a great deal of}} time <b>skim</b> reading on the Web and that if readers <b>skim</b> read they reduce their comprehension of what they have read. There have been a number of studies exploring <b>skim</b> reading, but relatively little exists on the <b>skim</b> reading of hypertext and Webpages. In the experiment documented here, we utilised eye tracking methodology to explore how readers <b>skim</b> read hypertext and how hyperlinks affect reading behaviour. The results show that the readers read faster when they were <b>skim</b> reading and comprehension was reduced. However, the presence of hyperlinks seemed to assist the readers in picking out important information when <b>skim</b> reading. We suggest that readers engage in an adaptive information foraging strategy where they attempt to minimise comprehension loss while maintaining a high reading speed. Readers use hyperlinks as markers to suggest important information and use them to read through the text in an efficient and effective way. This suggests that <b>skim</b> reading may not be as damaging to comprehension when reading hypertext, but it does mean that the words we choose to hyperlink become very important to comprehension for those <b>skim</b> reading text on the Web...|$|R

5|$|Pallid {{sturgeon}} {{are generally}} bottom feeders, <b>skimming</b> the sandy {{reaches of the}} various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though {{little is known about}} the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.|$|E

40|$|Physical and {{rheological}} {{parameters of}} <b>skim</b> milk gels fermented with slime producing (ropy) cultures and non-ropy cultures were compared. The <b>skim</b> milk gels {{were made from}} steamed reconstituted nonfat dry milk inoculated with 2 % of a single strain starter culture and incubated at 32, 37, and 45 °C until pH 4. 5 + 0. 05 was attained. <b>Skim</b> milk gels fermented by slime-producing strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus cremoris, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus exhibited similar rheological and physical characteristics. Electron micrographs of the ropy <b>skim</b> milk cultures showed that slime produced by the organisms {{was associated with the}} cell surface as well as the protein matrix of the systern. <b>Skim</b> milk gels fermented by the slimeproducing strains exhibited decreased susceptibility to syneresis as compared to <b>skim</b> milk which had been fermented with non-ropy strains at the same temperatures. Excessive slime production (when cultures were incubated for a longer time at a lower temperature) resulted in a coagulum with decreased relative firmness and apparent viscosity. However the <b>skim</b> milk gels fermented by the ropy strains at the higher incubation temperatures exhibited greater viscosity than <b>skim</b> milk fermented by non-ropy strains at the same temperatures...|$|R

5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera <b>skimming</b> along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E

40|$|Among {{commensal}} bacteria, Bifidobacteria {{are one of}} {{the most}} numerous probiotics in the mammalian gut. Two strains of Bifidobacterium (B) were isolated from stool of breastfed infants and identified by their 16 S rRNA genes. The strains were identical to B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 and B. breve M 4 A. These isolates were conserved by lyophilisation, and the survival rates measured six months after lyophilisation, were 74. 74 % and 99. 6 % for B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 and B. breve M 4 A, respectively. To improve the survival rate in <b>skimmed</b> milk media used for lyophilisation, the <b>skimmed</b> milk was supplemented with yeast extract, glucose and oligofructose. Supplementation decreased the doubling time and increased the viable cell count. Statistical analyses showed a nonlinear relationship between <b>skimmed</b> milk media and bacterial count number and acid production, which indicates an opposite impact of yeast extract with glucose or oligofructose supplementation in <b>skimmed</b> milk media. Response surface plots were applied to optimize the supplemented <b>skimmed</b> milk media. Both strains grew more rapidly in supplemented media than in <b>skimmed</b> milk-based medium alone. Acid production was higher in B. breve M 4 A than B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 when inoculated into <b>skimmed</b> milk supplemented with yeast extract, glucose, and oligofructose. The fermentation ability in <b>skimmed</b> milk was dependent on nutrient availability and the carbon source, which decreased the doubling time and increased the viable cell count. The addition of yeast extract, glucose, and oligofructose to <b>skimmed</b> milk increased the growth rate and acid production, compared with <b>skimmed</b> milk alone, when incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 48 h. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential synergy between Bifidobacterium isolates with yeast extract, glucose, and oligofructose in <b>skimmed</b> milk after 6 months of conservation...|$|R

The modified MRS medium was not only economical, but it gave a relatively higher yield of L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 than the commercial MRS. Monosodium glutamate, <b>skim</b> milk and <b>skim</b> milk with malt extract provided significantly higher viable counts, with optimum concentration at 0. 3 %. Nevertheless, at concentration above 0. 5 %, there was a reduction in cell viability, which {{could be attributed to}} cell shrinkage associated with osmotic pressure changes inside the cells.
