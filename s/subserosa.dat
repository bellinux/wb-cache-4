50|$|A {{cross section}} of Fallopian tube shows four {{distinct}} layers: serosa, <b>subserosa,</b> lamina propria and innermost mucosal layer. The serosa is derived from visceral peritoneum. <b>Subserosa</b> is composed of loose adventitious tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics, an outer longitudinal and inner circular smooth muscle coats. This layer {{is responsible for the}} peristaltic action of the Fallopian tubes. Lamina propria is a vascular connective tissue. There are two types of cells within the simple columnar epithelium of the Fallopian tube (oviduct). Ciliated cells predominate throughout the tube, but are most numerous in the infundibulum and ampulla. Estrogen increases the production of cilia on these cells. Interspersed between the ciliated cells are peg cells, which contain apical granules and produce the tubular fluid. This fluid contains nutrients for spermatozoa, oocytes, and zygotes. The secretions also promote capacitation of the sperm by removing glycoproteins and other molecules from the plasma membrane of the sperm. Progesterone increases the number of peg cells, while estrogen increases their height and secretory activity. Tubal fluid flows against the action of the ciliae, that is toward the fimbrial end.|$|E
50|$|Loose {{connective}} tissue is {{a category of}} {{connective tissue}} which includes areolar tissue, reticular tissue, and adipose tissue.Loose connective tissue {{is the most common}} type of connective tissue in vertebrates. It holds organs in place and attaches epithelial tissue to other underlying tissues. For example, it forms , such as the tela submucosa and tela <b>subserosa,</b> which connect mucous and serous membranes to the muscular layer. It also surrounds the blood vessels and nerves. Cells called fibroblasts are widely dispersed in this tissue; they are irregular branching cells that secrete strong fibrous proteins and proteoglycans as an extracellular matrix. The cells of this type of tissue are generally separated by quite some distance by a gelatinous substance primarily made up of collagenous and elastic fibers.|$|E

A 62 -year-old woman presented with abdominal pain. US and CT showed a tumor measuring 5 [*]×[*] 4 [*]×[*] 4 [*]cm in vermiform appendix. Colon endoscopy showed mucosal elevation and irregularity in the orifice of vermiform appendix. A biopsy of the appendiceal mucosa showed no significant changes. Clinical diagnosis was appendiceal carcinoma and wide excision of terminal ileum, appendix, cecum, and ascending colon was performed. Grossly, the appendix showed a tumor measuring 5 [*]×[*] 3 [*]×[*] 4 [*]cm. The appendiceal lumen was opened, and the appendiceal mucosa was elevated and irregular. The periappendiceal tissue showed thickening. Microscopically, the lesion was multiple appendiceal diverticula. The diverticula were penetrating the muscle layer. The mucosa showed erosions in places. Much fibrosis, abscess formations, and lymphocytic infiltration were seen in the <b>subserosa.</b> Abscesses were also seen in the diverticular lumens. Some diverticula penetrated into the <b>subserosa.</b> The pathologic diagnosis was appendiceal diverticulitis.

30|$|Generally speaking, {{there are}} five metastatic {{pathways}} to the stomach: (1) direct invasion, (2) intraoperative seeding, (3) hematogenous metastasis, (4) lymphatic metastasis, and (5) intraluminal or intramural dissemination [10]. In our case, the primary pancreatic tumor was not anatomically near the stomach, and resection with tumor-free margins was performed. In addition, the two metastatic lesions in the <b>subserosa</b> and muscularis propria of the stomach did not expose to the mucosa or serosa. Considering these facts, we thought that gastric metastasis occurred through the hematogenous pathway.|$|E

He then received gemcitabine and S- 1 combination chemotherapy for 6 [*]months. Because tumor size remained approximately the same and tumor marker levels decreased, total gastrectomy and cholecystectomy were performed.

40|$|Myeloid sarcoma {{is a rare}} tumor {{composed}} of myeloid cells, localized in an extramedullary site, which {{may be associated with}} a concurrent myeloid neoplasm involving the bone marrow, although such an association is not required. Most patients present with acute myeloid leukemia and their prognosis is poor. We describe the case of a 76 -year old woman with an adenocarcinoma of the right colon infiltrating the <b>subserosa</b> synchronous with a myeloid sarcoma at the same site; one pericolic lymph node was infiltrated by both tumors. The peculiarities of this case are the clinical presentation (as an acute abdomen due to <b>subserosa</b> infiltration by the myeloid sarcoma), the coexistence of a myeloid sarcoma with an adenocarcinoma of the right colon, and the absence of progression to acute leukemia. Coexistence of myeloid sarcoma and adenocarcinoma in the colon is probably incidental, and so it appears likely that the two different tumours arose from different mechanisms. However, a possible common background is conceivable. Some authors have found that p 53 has a pivotal role in driving the maturation of myeloid stem cells and p 53 is, also, involved in colon carcinogenesis. In our case, it may be hypothesized that synchronous heterogeneous mutations occurred in different types of committed cells or in stem cells secondary to p 53 loss. Since only one case report has evaluated the correlation between myeloid sarcoma and adenocarcinoma of the large bowel, further immunohistochemical and molecular studies are needed to clarify the pathogenetic relationship between the...|$|E
30|$|A common {{limitation}} of the QDs’ use in tissue imaging in vivo was their potential toxicity. Some researchers claimed that the oxidation of Cd 2 + on the QD surface and subsequent Cd 2 + release may induce potential cytotoxicity [11]. However, many authoritative studies showed {{that there was no}} significant influence on cell viability, morphology, function, or development in the use of QDs [12, 13]. Besides, no obvious toxicity evidence was obtained during in vivo imaging [7, 14 – 16].

40|$|A {{peculiar}} structure, observed as a dome-like protrusion at {{the apex}} of the caecum, was investigated macroscopically and histologically in healthy White Leghorn chickens. It was hemispheric or spherical in shape and as it consisted of a lumen with a wall occupied by lymphoid tissue, this structure was designated the apical caecal diverticulum (ACD). ACD were detected in 25. 2 % of examined chickens and had a mean diameter and height of 1. 9 mm and 1. 2 mm respectively. Histologically, both the lamina propria mucosae and the submucosa of ACD consisted of well developed aggregated lymphoid nodules. Each nodule was covered by follicle-associated epithelium which contained cells resembling M cells. Some secondary nodules extended into the <b>subserosa.</b> The muscularis mucosae and the stratum circulae of the tunica muscularis disappeared near the entrance to ACD. The stratum longitudinale also gradually decreased in thickness around the entrance, becoming an extremely thin layer in the diverticulum wall. At the caecal apex, each stratum of the tunica muscularis was thinner than in the caecal body and separated into several muscle bundles. These bundles were occasionally displaced by developed lymphoid nodules, causing them to protrude into the <b>subserosa.</b> The high frequency of ACD suggests that caecal apex may be sites for immunological surveillance in the chicken caecum. In addition to the intense and frequent antiperistalsis {{at the apex}} suggested by Yasukawa (1959), possible causes for the formation of ACD included (1) the fragility of the tunica muscularis at the ACD, and (2) the local removal of the physical supporting structures by the development of lymphoid nodules...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFP) are rare, benign lesions of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract. Recent molecular {{studies of}} IFPs identified platelet‑derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) ‑activating mutations, suggesting possible neoplastic qualities to IFPs. IFPs originate from the submu-cosa and often extend into the overlying mucosa. Although certain IFPs infiltrate the muscularis propria focally, {{disruption of the}} muscularis propria and penetration into the <b>subserosa</b> is extremely rare. The current study presents an unusual case of an ileal IFP. A 48 ‑year‑old female visited the Department of Surgery, Chonbuk National University Hospital (Jeonju, Republic of Korea) due to abdominal pain. Radiological study demonstrated an ileocecal‑type intus-susception due to a luminal polypoid mass of the ileum. The excised tumor consisted of haphazardly arranged epithelioid and spindled cells in a fibromyxoid stroma, with an abundant vascular network, accompanied by an inflammatory reaction predominantly composed of eosinophilic infiltrates. The infil-trating tumor cells disrupted the muscularis mucosa above the tumor cells and the muscularis propria below the tumor cells, and extended into the <b>subserosa.</b> Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for vimentin and cluster of differ-entiation 34, while they were negative for keratin, PDGFRA, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S‑ 100 protein, DOG‑ 1 and c‑kit. Sequencing analysis of c‑kit exons 9, 11, 13 and 17, and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 indicated a wild‑type status. The patient has remained well for 12 months after surgery without further treatment, with no recurrence of the tumor. Although spread of IFP under the muscularis propria is rare, identifi-cation of similar cases and further study will enhance {{our understanding of the}} nature of this tumor...|$|E
40|$|Pneumatosis intestinalis is a {{radiological}} {{sign that}} represents the presence of gas between the parietal layers of a bowel loop.

The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a large, almost stenotic, submucosal oval-shaped mass, with a diameter of 10 cm located in the gastric antrum, with an area of ulcerated gastric mucosa. The abdominal computer tomography revealed a homogeneous well-defined mass with negative densitometry values that corresponded to the fatty tissue.

Four major hypotheses have currently been proposed: (1) the mechanical theory, proposing that gas enters the digestive tract walls through mucosal injury in association with increased luminal pressure [3]; (2) the bacterial theory, proposing that gas-producing bacteria may cause intramural gas-filled cysts [4]; (3) the chemical theory, proposing that chronic exposure to chemicals, such as trichloroethylene, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, or steroids, may impair {{the integrity of the}} mucosa [5]; and (4) the lung theory, proposing that the intramural bowel gas may originate from pneumomediastinum caused by alveolar rupture in cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [6].|$|E

40|$|Cathepsin B, a thiol protease, is {{involved}} in cancer metastasis. To clarify the role of cathepsin B in tumor progression in human colorectal cancer, the relationship between its activity, immunohistochemical staining, and clinical tumor progression was investigated. Cathepsin B activity in adenocarcinomas was significantly elevated compared with that in the tumor-bearing tissue. Furthermore, the tumor/tumor-bearing tissue (T/Tb) ratio of the activity {{was significantly higher than}} that of colorectal adenoma. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated intense staining in the cancerous tissue. With respect to the clinical stage of tumors, the activity tended to be higher in tumors that had invaded the serosa or <b>subserosa</b> than in those that invaded the proper muscle.
