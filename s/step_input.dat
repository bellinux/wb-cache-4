25|$|A {{system with}} an {{intermediate}} quality factor (Qnbsp&=nbsp&) {{is said to}} be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state asymptote). Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a unit <b>step</b> <b>input.</b> Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the final value) possible without overshoot. Real system specifications usually allow some overshoot for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a safety margin against overshoot.|$|E

25|$|A {{system with}} low quality factor (Q<nbsp&) {{is said to}} be overdamped. Such a system doesn't {{oscillate}} at all, but when displaced from its equilibrium steady-state output it returns to it by exponential decay, approaching the steady state value asymptotically. It has an impulse response that is the sum of two decaying exponential functions with different rates of decay. As the quality factor decreases the slower decay mode becomes stronger relative to the faster mode and dominates the system's response resulting in a slower system. A second-order low-pass filter with a very low quality factor has a nearly first-order step response; the system's output responds to a <b>step</b> <b>input</b> by slowly rising toward an asymptote.|$|E
25|$|A {{system with}} high quality factor (Qnbsp&>nbsp&) {{is said to}} be underdamped. Underdamped systems combine {{oscillation}} at a specific frequency with a decay of the amplitude of the signal. Underdamped systems with a low quality factor (a little above Q =nbsp&) may oscillate only once or a few times before dying out. As the quality factor increases, the relative amount of damping decreases. A high-quality bell rings with a single pure tone {{for a very long time}} after being struck. A purely oscillatory system, such as a bell that rings forever, has an infinite quality factor. More generally, the output of a second-order low-pass filter with a very high quality factor responds to a <b>step</b> <b>input</b> by quickly rising above, oscillating around, and eventually converging to a steady-state value.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} 808s & Heartbreak draws heavily on {{electronic}} elements, particularly virtual synthesis, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks. Tracks {{on the album}} utilize <b>step</b> <b>input</b> drum machine and synth-bass parts. <b>Step</b> <b>input</b> sequencing, a product of vintage analogue devices limited to recording only 16 individual notes, was popular in music production during the 1980s, but also became available in digital workstations. The album's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synths, and somber piano. Andy Kellman of AllMusic writes of the music, [...] "Several tracks have almost as {{much in common with}} irrefutably bleak post-punk albums, such as New Order's Movement and The Cure's Pornography, as contemporary rap and R" [...] These musical elements help convey moods of despair and dejection that reflect the album's subject matter. NJ.com columnist Trist McCall wrote that the record [...] "stripped modern art-pop down to its iconic rudiments — beats, charismatic personalities, hand-selected melodies, and computer-assisted vocals." [...] Most of the lyrics are directed at an ex-lover; West refers to her treatment of him as [...] "the coldest story ever told" [...] on [...] "Heartless", and on [...] "RoboCop", she is called a [...] "spoiled little L.A. girl" [...] and is compared to the antagonist in the 1990 film Misery. On [...] "Welcome to Heartbreak", West's character faces an existential crisis as he dispassionately recounts sitting alone on a flight, with a laughing family seated ahead of him. He longs for his late mother on the album's penultimate track [...] "Coldest Winter", which samples the desolate 1983 song [...] "Memories Fade" [...] by Tears for Fears.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT FUZZY LOGIC PD CONTROL OF A NON-LINEAR INVERTED FLEXIBLE PENDULUM by Kou A. Kong Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering Electronic Engineering Option California State University, Chico Summer 2009 In {{automatic}} control systems, an inverted pendulum is a classical {{system to be}} controlled. The inverted pendulum is more complex and complicated to control when flexibility {{is present in the}} pendulum. Flexibility in the system can cause a system to be unstable. In this project, an intelligent fuzzy proportional-derivative (PD) control is proposed to control the flexible inverted pendulum. The flexible inverted pendulum is modeled in non-linearity using Euler-Lagrange energy method. The fuzzy proportionalderivative (PD) control is compared with the classical PD control in this system. Even though the classical PID control is widely used in industrial control systems, it will break down in most non-linear systems. The simulations of the flexible inverted pendulum are done in Simulink and Matlab. The linear and nonlinear flexible inverted pendulums are simulated for six different cases. The simulation results demonstrate the performance differences between the classical PD control and fuzzy PD control. The classical PD control works for the linear system in terms of oscillations and settling time for all <b>step</b> <b>inputs</b> and cases. On the nonlinear system, the classical PD control has more oscillations in all three modes of vibrations for the second and third <b>step</b> <b>inputs.</b> The fuzzy PD controller shows better system responses and steady-state performances for the nonlinear system. The second and third <b>step</b> <b>inputs</b> have fewer oscillations for all three modes of vibrations. The fuzzy PD controller has a better overall performance because it has the ability to adjust the gain values according to the system output response. On the other hand, the conventional PD controls have a constant gain value for different system output responses. These results are integrated in Chapter VI. It can also be seen by running the programs on the CD included with this report. The instructions to simulate the programs on the CD are in the Read Me Instructions in Appendix E. CSU, Chic...|$|R
