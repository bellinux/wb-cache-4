5|$|The team's {{original}} alternate logo was {{the foot}} of a Sasquatch/Bigfoot and was seen on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> the Avalanche's home and away jerseys. The logo was used on their jerseys since 1995; however, {{prior to the start of}} the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, the club unveiled a new alternate logo. The new logo features the insignia taken from the Colorado state flag and re-colored to match the team's color scheme. The logo will be featured on a patch located on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> the team's uniforms, along with a 20th anniversary logo, for the 2015–16 season.|$|E

This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E

5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of the Christ Child.

5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, the Belgian team {{directly}} supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 {{they played}} at minimum five unofficial games {{of which the}} returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D'Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus sign on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.|$|E
5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger King has used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in a defined geographic territory. This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a restructuring of its franchising system, tossing the old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 restructuring, led by a new director of operations, firmly placed the mantel of franchise oversight on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> the company.|$|E

5|$|A {{review of}} ankylosaur osteoderms was {{published}} in 2000, and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae. The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus, known from head, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal scutes. Only a few head osteoderms were identified, so it is unknown {{how much of the}} skull was armoured. Many cervical and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus. They include cervical bands, which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae, and large spines found on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia, although it is not known if the spines were fused like the later of separate like the former. It is quite possible that small ovoid scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids. The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough. Even though osteoderms are well-known, it is not certain where they were positioned on the body.|$|E
5|$|After Bab el Wad, {{the road}} wound to Jerusalem through deep, narrow valleys, over steep spurs, {{and around the}} <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> rocky hills. There were other ways through the hills, but they were a tangle of unmapped, rough and rocky hill tracks and pathways—often little more than donkey tracks—which made {{movement}} by infantry, dismounted cavalry, and artillery very difficult. The rough tracks meandered through narrow valleys and over distorted piles of razor-backed ridges, which were broken by groups of cone-shaped hills and successive shelves of rock jutting out from every hillside at intervals of a few yards. It was virtually impossible for advances to the north or south of the main road to be supported by artillery. In heavy rain and cold, wet and muddy conditions, it {{was found to be}} impossible to deploy the 75th Division's guns off the road. These guns had been brought forward by teams of up to eight horses to a gun the day before.|$|E
5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E
