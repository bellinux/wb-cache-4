5|$|However, in non-technical {{contexts}} and in {{software for the}} World Wide Web, the term URL remains widely used. Additionally, the term web address (which has no formal definition) often occurs in non-technical publications as a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> a URI that uses the scheme http or https. Such assumptions can lead to confusion, for example {{in the case of}} XML namespaces, which have a visual similarity to resolvable URIs.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|Several {{molecular}} phylogenetic analyses {{show that}} L.deterrimus, L.sanguifluus, Lactarius vinosus and L.fennoscandicus form {{a group of}} related species, which might include the North American species L.paradoxus and L.miniatosporus. Although L.deliciosus var. deterrimus qualifies as <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> L.deterrimus, the families, which had been characterized in North America as Lactarius deliciosus var. deterrimus, are not closely related with the European types. They also seem not to form a monophyletic group.|$|E

5|$|Stichometry was {{sometimes}} confused with colometry, {{the practice of}} some Christian authors in late antiquity of writing texts broken into rhetorical phrases to aid delivery. Some modern Jewish and Christian scholars use ‘stichometry’ as a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> ‘stichography,’ which is the occasional practice in ancient scriptures of laying out texts so that each biblical or poetic verse begins on a new line.|$|E
5|$|The genus Ochetellus {{was first}} {{described}} by Steve Shattuck in 1992, {{placing it in}} the subfamily Dolichoderinae. The type species of the genus is Ochetellus glaber, originally described as Hypoclinea glabra by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. The genus was originally placed in the tribe Dolichoderini. It was later placed under the tribe Iridomyrmecini, now classified as a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> the tribe Leptomyrmecini.|$|E
5|$|Truth (satya) implies love, and {{firmness}} (agraha) engenders {{and therefore}} {{serves as a}} <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up {{the use of the}} phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha”....|$|E

5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), {{as well as other}} sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Latiolais {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} a cladogram (tree of descent) {{that attempts to}} show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 species in the genus Strombus (including Strombus canarium) and three species in the allied genus Lambis. The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I protein-coding gene regions. In this proposed phylogeny Strombus canarium, Strombus vittatus (a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> Doxander vittatus) and Strombus epidromis (Labiostrombus epidromis) are closely related, and appear to share a common ancestor.|$|E

5|$|Kamadhenu {{is often}} {{addressed}} by the proper name Surabhi or Shurbhi, which is also used as a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> an ordinary cow. Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi—"the fragrant one"—to have originated from the peculiar smell of cows. According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means fragrant, charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother") goddess. Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are Sabala ("the spotted one") and Kapila ("the red one").|$|E
5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E
5|$|No Depression was {{critically}} acclaimed and sold well {{for an independent}} release. Selling over 15,000 copies {{within a year of}} its release, the album's success inspired the roots music magazine No Depression. The record {{is considered one of the}} most important alternative country albums, and its title is often used as a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> the alternative country genre after being popularized by No Depression magazine. After regaining the rights to the album through a lawsuit, Uncle Tupelo released a remastered version in 2003 through Legacy Records, expanded to include six bonus tracks.|$|E

5|$|Several metamorphosing insects' {{scientific}} names reference the myth. Myrrha is a genus of ladybug beetles, {{such as the}} 18-spot ladybird (Myrrha octodecimguttata) Libythea myrrha, the club beak, is a butterfly native to India. Cupido myrrha is a rare species of butterfly named by Herrich-Schäffer found on Mount Erciyes in south-eastern Turkey. Catocala myrrha is a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> a species of moth known as married underwing. In total the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum lists eight Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) with the myrrha name.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Carl Ludwig Hablitz in 1783 as Colymbus caspicus, from {{a bird in}} Bandar-e Anzali. This was originally {{thought to be a}} <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> the horned grebe, until Erwin Stresemann discovered that the description applied more to the black-necked grebe in 1948. Before this, the earliest description was thought to be by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, who gave this bird its current scientific name of Podiceps nigricollis from a German bird. To resolve this, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the name C. caspicus. The genus name Dytes is sometimes used for this species, a placement which was formalized by Robert Ridgway in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Ireland is {{subdivided}} into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In {{a system that}} developed between the 13th and 17th centuries, Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland {{are all in the}} province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, Ulster is often used as a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.|$|E

5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the squall line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
5|$|Lactuca sativa is {{a member}} of the Lactuca (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family. The species was first {{described}} in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum. Synonyms for L.sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa, L.scariola var. integrata and L.scariola var. integrifolia. L.scariola is itself a <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> L.serriola, the common wild or prickly lettuce. L.sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce. Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L.serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.|$|E
5|$|One <b>synonym</b> <b>for</b> {{the species}} has been {{published}} – Ponera ruginoda (also titled Myrmecia ruginoda), described by Smith in the same work, and a male holotype specimen was originally described for this synonym. Ponera ruginoda was initially placed into the genera Ectatomma and Rhytidoponera, but it was later classified as a junior synonym of the jack jumper ant, after specimens of each were compared. The ant {{is a part of}} the Myrmecia pilosula species complex, a species group that was first defined by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery. The species complex is a monophyletic group, where the species are closely related to each other but their actual genetic relationship is distant. Members of this group include M. apicalis, M. chasei, M. chrysogaster, M. croslandi, M. cydista, M. dispar, M. elegans, M. harderi, M. ludlowi, M. michaelseni, M. occidentalis M. queenslandica, M. rugosa and M. varians. Additional species that were described in this group in 2015 include M. banksi, M. haskinsorum, M. imaii and M. impaternata.|$|E
