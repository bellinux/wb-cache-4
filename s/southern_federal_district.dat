40|$|Arboviruses are arthropod-borne viruses, {{which include}} West Nile fever virus (WNFV), a mosquito-borne virus, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne virus, and Crimean-Congo {{haemorrhagic}} fever virus (CCHFV), a tick-borne virus. These arthropod-borne viruses can cause disease in different domestic and wild animals and in humans, posing {{a threat to}} public health because of their epidemic and zoonotic potential. In recent decades, the geographical distribution of these diseases has expanded. Outbreaks of WNF have already occurred in Europe, especially in the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, CCHF is endemic in many European countries and serious outbreaks have occurred, particularly in the Balkans, Turkey and <b>Southern</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Districts</b> of Russia. In 2000, RVF was reported {{for the first time}} outside the African continent, with cases being confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This spread was probably caused by ruminant trade and highlights that there is a threat of expansion of the virus into other parts of Asia and Europe. In the light of global warming and globalisation of trade and travel, public interest in emerging zoonotic diseases has increased. This is especially evident regarding the geographical spread of vector-borne diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach is now imperative, and groups need to collaborate in an integrated manner that includes vector control, vaccination programmes, improved therapy strategies, diagnostic tools and surveillance, public awareness, capacity building and improvement of infrastructure in endemic regions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ Background: Worldwide, {{populations are}} aging {{and the health}} of elderly {{individuals}} is deteriorating. Healthy habits may slow the process of health deterioration, but research investigating relationships between health and various health behaviors is lacking. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between health and health behaviors (alcohol consumption, smoking, dietary behavior, and physical activity) among older men and women in Russia. Methods: Wave 1 Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health data (2007 – 2010) collected in the European portion of the Russian Federation, <b>southern</b> <b>federal</b> <b>districts</b> of the European portion of Russia and from the Asian portion of the country were used for this study. Relationships between self-rated health and four risk behavior measures [physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary behavior (fruit and vegetable consumption) ] were examined. Analyses controlled for several socioeconomic factors: gender, age, marital status, educational level, area of residence, ethnicity, and employment status. To estimate the effect of healthy behavior on the probability that participants rated their health as very good/good/moderate/bad/very bad, the ordered logit model and average marginal effects were used. Results: Sufficient physical activity affected self-rated health most significantly in both genders, whereas excessive alcohol consumption had no significant effect. Smoking had explanatory power (being a current smoker decreased the probability of a very good health assessment and increased the probability of a very bad rating compared with being a non-smoker) among men, but not women. Fruit and vegetable consumption had a strong effect on self-rated health among women, but not men. Conclusions: The results {{of this study indicate that}} health behaviors, especially physical activity, are important for the health of Russia’s older population. Smoking behavior had a strong impact on the health of men, whereas fruit and vegetable consumption was a relevant factor for women. Policies promoting smoking reduction and healthy diet should thus target older men and women, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Rationale: Enterococci are {{the leading}} cause of a number of {{nosocomial}} and community-acquired human diseases. In the last decade, these pathogens are becoming resistant to antibacterials, including vancomycin. Multidrug-resistant enterococci have been also isolated from agricultural animals in many countries worldwide, which raises concern of scientists because of possible horizontal transfer of resistance genes. Aim : To assess antibacterial sensitivity of Enterococcus spp. isolates collected from the poultry in the Russian Federation from 2013 to 2016, and to identify vancomycin-resistance genes in their genomes. Materials and methods : Eightyseven enterococci isolates belonging to E.   faecalis (n= 47, 54 %), E.   faecium (n= 25, 28. 7 %) and other species (n= 15, 17. 2 %) were collected from clinical samples of 297  heads of poultry (liver, lungs, heart, spleen, contents of the nasal and sinus cavities) from 17   poultry farms of the Northwest, Central, Volga, Ural and <b>Southern</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>districts</b> of the Russian Federation. Sensitivity of enterococci to antibacterials was determined by disk-diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Vancomycin resistance genes van was detected by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers. Results : Most enterococci isolates were resistant to erythromycin (74 / 87, 85. 1 %), gentamicin (70 / 87, 80. 5 %), ceftriaxone (61 / 87, 70. 1 %), ciprofloxacin (56 / 87, 64. 4 %), tetracycline (57 / 87, 65. 5 %), and rifampicin (48 / 87, 55. 2 %), fewer ones to trimethoprim (38 / 87, 43. 7 %), ampicillin (28 / 87, 32. 2 %), linezolid (15 / 87, 17. 2 %) and chloramphenicol (5 / 87, 5. 7 %). The vanC type genes (vanC 1 and vanC 2 / 3) were identified in 10   isolates. Vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations for these isolates were 2 to 8   mg/L. E.  faecium with vanC 1 gene was isolated from poultry probably for the first time ever. Conclusion : Commercial poultry in the Russian poultry farms is an important reservoir and source of antibiotic-resistant enterococci populations, including enterococci carrying vanC 1 and vanC 2 / 3 vancomycin resistance genes.  </p...|$|R
