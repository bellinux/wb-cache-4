40|$|This paper {{extends the}} normal mixture {{diffusion}} (NMD) local volatility model of Brigo and Mercurio (2000, 2001 a,b, 2002) {{so that it}} explains both short-term and long-term <b>smile</b> <b>effects.</b> Short-term <b>smile</b> <b>effects</b> are captured by a local volatility model where excess kurtosis in the price density decreases with maturity. This follows from the central limit theorem and concords with the ‘stylised facts’ of econometric analysis of ex-post returns of different frequencies. We introduce a term structure for option prices in the NMD model by assuming there is a fixed probability of each volatility state occurring in every time interval Dt, and we show that with this assumption the mixing law for the price density is the multinomial density. This very parsimonious model can easily be calibrated to observed option prices. However, <b>smile</b> <b>effects</b> in currency options often persist into fairly long maturities, and to capture at least some part of this {{it is necessary to}} introduce stochastic volatility. The last part of this paper considers only two possible volatility states in each Dt with probabilities l and (1 - l).

In this parsimonious class of complete market models, option pricing and hedging is straightforward since model prices and deltas are simple weighted averages of Black–Scholes prices and deltas.

40|$|Abstract—Earth Observing- 1 Hyperion {{data were}} found to be {{relatively}} noisy and to contain significant cross-track spectral cur-vature nonlinearity disturbances, known as the smile/frown effect. A method for the correction of spectral curvature effects (smile) in Hyperion images, termed trend line smile correction (TLSC), is presented. The method {{is based on the assumption}} that there is a partial correlation between data spectral nonuniformity, due to the smile and eigenvalues gradient that mostly appears in the first minimum noise fraction (MNF) image (MNF- 1). However, MNF- 1 consists of both spatial and spectral information. Therefore, it is hypothesized that adaptation applied to MNF- 1, according to exclusively spectrally derived parameters (e. g., atmospheric ab-sorption features) can account specifically for the <b>smile</b> <b>effect</b> in the data. A set of normalization factors, calculated from the spectral derivative at the right-hand side of the O 2 absorption fea-ture (760 nm), MNF- 1 and the moderate-resolution atmospheric transmittance radiative transfer model, are used to scale the initial MNF- 1. The image is corrected after the inverse conversion of the MNF to radiance space. The methodology was tested on four different Hyperion scenes and consistently outperformed other tested methods by up to nine times. As a result, thematic mapping, using the TLSC-corrected reflectance data cube, was shown to be consistent with the geology maps of the study area.

40|$|Exotic equity {{options are}} {{specialized}} instruments which are typically traded over the counter. Their prices are primarily determined by option pricing models {{which should be}} able to price exotic options consistently with the market prices of corresponding vanilla options. Additionally, option pricing models should have intuitive dynamics which are able to capture real world behavior (such as stochastic volatility effects and jumps in the price of the underlying). This dissertation tackles the question of which option pricing model to use; it compares diffusion, pure jump and jump-diffusion models. All models are fitted to one-day price data on S&P 500 European vanilla options; the models with the best fit exhibit the smallest error in pricing between model prices and market prices. The stochastic volatility with jumps (SVJ) models are found to perform the best. The SVJ-DE model, a new variant of this type of model (which is based on Heston-type stochastic volatility and Kou-type double exponential jumps in the log price), is presented and tested. The Heston SV model is ranked third best. There is a significant performance gap between the SV/SVJ models and the remaining models. The variance-gamma model with stochastic time is found to be the best performing model from the pure jump and simple jump-diffusion categories. The Kou jump-diffusion model with double exponential jumps and constant diffusion volatility ranks next, followed by the Merton jump-diffusion model and the variance-gamma pure jump model. On comparison of model and market implied volatility surfaces, the pure jump and simple jump-diffusion models are found to be efficient at generating volatility <b>smile</b> <b>effects,</b> but not volatility skew effects. The converse holds for the Heston SV model. The SVJ models exploit this behavior in an attempt to use the jump component to generate the <b>smile</b> <b>effects</b> on the short end of the volatility surface and the stochastic volatility diffusion component to generate the skew effects on the long end of the volatility surface. The application of the SV and SVJ models is demonstrated by computing the prices of barrier options via Monte Carlo simulation. Both of the SVJ models give similar barrier option prices. Diffusion processes and jump processes are the two main building blocks of any option pricing model. This research finds that simple jump-diffusion models and pure jump models are unable to demonstrate good performance when fitting to a complete grid of market option prices. The Heston stochastic volatility pure diffusion model gives better performance compared to these jump models. The SVJ models which have both a stochastic volatility diffusion component and a jump component are found to give the best performance. The SVJ-DE model has the added advantage of being able to generate upward and downward jumps from different exponential distributions, versus the Bates model which generates jumps from a normal distribution...|$|R

High resolutions airborne systems such as APEX, AISA, HYSPEX, and CASI- 2 /SASI have been developed, and powerful space systems such as ENMAP will soon be available.

This paper presents a novel digital sensor simulator for the pushbroom Offner hyperspectral imaging spectrometer, which is widely used in the hyperspectral remote sensing. Based on the imaging process, the sensor simulator consists of a spatial response module, a spectral response module, and a radiometric response module. In order to enhance the simulation accuracy, spatial interpolation-resampling, which is implemented before the spatial degradation, is developed to compromise the direction error and the extra aliasing effect. Instead of using the spectral response function (SRF), the dispersive imaging characteristics of the Offner convex grating optical system is accurately modeled by its configuration parameters.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find a {{suitable}} approach to model econometrically exchange-rate dynamics. In the first chapter, I examine the empirical properties of four exchange rates. The data used are daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly exchange rates of the German mark, the British pound, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen against the U. S. dollar from July 1974 to December 1987. 1 study the moment properties and time-series properties of these exchange rates and find in daily and weekly data leptokurtosis and heteroskedasticity. On the other hand, the hypotheses of no serial correlation, of a constant mean of zero, and of a symmetric distribution cannot be rejected. The fact that the daily and weekly data are not strictly equi-distant does not have a strong impact on these empirical regularities. In chapter 2, static distributional models (mixture of distributions, compound Poisson process, Student distribution, and stable Paretian distributions) are estimated. Chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests reject these models. Direct inferential evidence against stable distributions is found by estimating the characteristic exponent by FFT and by estimating the exponent of regularly varying tails. In chapter 3, dynamic models of heteroskedasticity (ARCH and Markov-switching models) are introduced. Quite satisfactory results are obtained for the EGARCH model and the Markov-switching model whereas the ARCH, GARCH and GARCH-t models are in conflict with stationarity conditions for the variance. Chapter 4 compares the static and dynamic models with respect to goodness-of-fit and forecasting performance. With respect to goodness-of-fit criteria, the dynamic models appear to be superior to the static models. Furthermore, the dynamic models outperform a naive model of constant variance with respect to unbiasedness but not with respect to precision. Chapter 5 studies the option-price implications of the static and dynamic models. The spot-rate effects of static models are rather small and they disappear, as expected, under temporal aggregation.
