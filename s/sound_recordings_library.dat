50|$|In 1959—roughly {{a decade}} after vinyl LPs first became widely {{available}} to consumers—the Library of Congress published Preservation of <b>Sound</b> <b>Recordings</b> (A.G. Pickett and M.M. Lemcoe), {{the first and most}} extensive investigation of the deterioration of grooved discs and magnetic tape. Funded {{by a grant from the}} Rockefeller Foundation, the purpose of the investigation was to establish suitable guidelines for the storage and preservation of <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> for <b>libraries.</b> Conducted at the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, the study involved subjecting <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> to a series of lab tests, from accelerated aging to fungal exposure. Though considered the definitive study in the field, the chemical makeup of plastics and how they perform under stress was the primary focus of the report, whereas playback deterioration—a significant concern to sound archivists and record collectors—was excluded from the investigation.|$|R
50|$|The Library of Congress National Digital Library Program (NDLP) is {{assembling}} a digital library of reproductions of primary source materials {{to support the}} study of the history and culture of the United States. Begun in 1995 after a five-year pilot project, the program began digitizing selected collections of Library of Congress archival materials that chronicle the nation's rich cultural heritage. In order to reproduce collections of books, pamphlets, motion pictures, manuscripts and <b>sound</b> <b>recordings,</b> the <b>Library</b> has created a wide array of digital entities: bitonal document images, grayscale and color pictorial images, digital video and audio, and searchable e-texts. To provide access to the reproductions, the project developed a range of descriptive elements: bibliographic records, finding aids, and introductory texts and programs, as well as indexing the full texts for certain types of content.|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the beats on Dream, Fulfilled are, like its predecessor, approximately two-and-a-half minutes long; however, a handful of instrumentals are significantly longer, giving the album a slightly longer playing time than Dream, Interrupted. Dream, Fulfilled marked a continuation in the departure from the sped-up soul samples Danny was first known for on his debut album The College Kicked-Out. Incorporating mixtures of bossa nova, Europop, <b>sound</b> <b>library</b> <b>recordings</b> and disco music helped Danny give Dream, Fulfilled a far superior album, musically, {{than any of his}} previous offerings, including his studio albums. Danny Is Dead would later feature [...] "Check It Out (Find A Way '07)" [...] as a full-length song with lyrics, titled [...] "Check It Out".

40|$|The {{basic concept}} that sound waves could be t:aced or {{recorded}} on a solid object was developed separately by Leon Scott, Charles Cros, and Thomas Alva Edison between 1857 and 1877 and, by 1890, {{the foundation of}} the present-day commercial record industry was established. Although cylinders were the first <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> to be sold commercially, discs were introduced in 1894 and ultimately became more popular. The <b>library</b> collection of <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> began with the founding of the Sadie Knowland Coe Music Collection at the Evanston Public Library in 1907 during the acoustic, or pre-electric era (1877 - 1925) when recordings were still made and reproduced by mechanical means. Following the introduction of electrical <b>recordings,</b> more <b>libraries</b> inaugurated record collections, albeit with some caution, and by the 1940 s, the idea that collections of records belonged in libraries had won acceptance.

50|$|Section 109(b) is an {{exception}} to the first sale doctrine, but it is limited in several ways. It applies only to rentals, and not to resale or other transfers.

It does not apply to <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> that contain other content, such as commentaries or dialog soundtrack, or to non-musical <b>sound</b> <b>recordings,</b> for example audiobooks. Lastly, libraries and educational institutions are exempt from this restriction, and may rent or loan musical <b>sound</b> <b>recordings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Very few <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> are in {{the public}} domain in the United States. <b>Sound</b> <b>recordings</b> fixed in a {{tangible}} form before February 15, 1972, have been generally covered by common law or in some cases by anti-piracy statutes enacted in certain states, not by federal copyright law, and the anti-piracy statutes typically have no duration limit. The 1971 <b>Sound</b> <b>Recordings</b> Act, effective 1972, and the 1976 Copyright Act, effective 1978, provide federal copyright for unpublished and published <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> fixed on or after February 15, 1972. Recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, are still covered, to varying degrees, by common law or state statutes. Any rights or remedies under state law for <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> fixed before February 15, 1972, are not annulled or limited by the 1976 Copyright Act until February 15, 2067. On that date, all <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> fixed before February 15, 1972, will go into the public domain in the United States.|$|R

[...] The performance right for <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> under the DPRA is limited to transmissions over a digital transmission, so it is not as expansive as the performance right for other types of copyrighted works.

5000|$|American {{copyright}} laws about <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> are uniquely restrictive compared to American {{copyright laws}} for other formats and international copyright laws about <b>sound</b> <b>recordings.</b> In addition to preventing access, existing laws sometimes prohibit {{the preservation of}} deteriorating carrier objects until the object has audibly degraded.Recommendation 3.4 recognizes the need for federal copyright coverage of <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> committed before February 1972. The federal copyright code does not address <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> made before 15 Feb. 1972, {{which means that the}} legal status of their use and reproduction is in [...] "limbo" [...] - decided by a complex network of state laws and court decisions. Federalization of copyright for these recordings would clarify their status, and potentially initiate conversations about reformatting and academic use. The recommendation also suggests that copyright protection for recordings require reasonable market availability.|$|R

40|$|A {{study is}} done on the {{protection}} of <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> in the decentralized peer-to-peer (DP 2 P) file sharing in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa. This study reveals that because <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> have unique features different from other copyright works, the illegal sharing of <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> can ordinarily be filtered, identified, and detected by the Internet service providers (ISPs) before granting access to users and without infringing the users‟ right to privacy. However, the ISPs have failed in this regard, hence, they are strictly held liable under the contributory, vicarious and inducing infringements notwithstanding the statutory law which prohibits ISPs from monitoring, and intercepting their networks. In fact and law, the terms filtering, identifying and detecting {{on the one hand}} and monitoring and intercepting on the other hand are different in relation to <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> and as such ISPs are not prohibited from filtering, identifying and detecting illegal <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> on their networks, thus, ISPs are not protected under the limitation law as it is generally believed. However, several recommendations are made for reform, inter alia: a review of the limitation law to include the terms filtering, identifying and detecting in pursuance of the terms monitoring, and intercepting, if the intention of the legislators was meant to include the latter terms; protection of access right in digital <b>sound</b> <b>recordings,</b> protection of the neighbouring rights of ISPs in the digital world, imposing levies on all recording equipment, the insurability of <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> and ISPs‟ signals, and bandwidth.
