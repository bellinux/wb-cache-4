They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They also felt that the later tracks in the album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since it does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

25|$|Paris {{has many}} {{buildings}} in a combined style of Renaissance Revival and Baroque Revival elements, {{such as the}} Opera Garnier, which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into neither category. However, the Parisian Hôtel de Ville is firmly emulating the true French Renaissance style as it evolved, complete with the steeply pitched roofs and towers. The rebuilding, completed circa 1880, faithfully reproduced the Renaissance architectural details of the previous Hôtel de Ville.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{overlap in}} the {{influences}} of the two authors (as could be expected from writers working {{in the same time}} period and location), such as a common interest in thinkers like Augustine of Hippo. However, the primary focus and concern of each writer seems to set them apart. For example, most of the works attributed to Fulgentius the bishop deal with his opposition to heretical factions such as Arianism, a topic for which Fabius Fulgentius seems to have no concern. Topics on which the bishop seemed to have been strongly opinionated (Arianism, free-will, etc.) are never discussed in the mythographer’s work, even when a discussion of such things would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> his discussion. From a linguistic standpoint, the mythographer’s unique style and inclusion of otherwise unused words and idioms is not replicated {{in the work of the}} bishop, which suggests further a negative identification.|$|E

McHatton called the emotional problems of the episode [...] "heart wrenching" [...] to watch", as they had him in tears; he gave a [...] "4.9 out of 5" [...] rating for the episode. Handlen complimented the [...] "powerful scene, as [...] tries to convince her father that he should do anything possible to avoid losing touch with his daughter", and also noted that the episode [...] "raises the stakes for , changing what he's come to accept as his routine {{for the first time since}} the start of the series: while bungee jumping at a fair with Rex and Emma in , [...] has a fainting spell, and comes to in [...] ".

500|$|Other reviewers {{praised the}} character's {{gameplay}} and design. An {{editor for the}} video game website GameZone wrote that his attacks compensated for his appearance and described him as [...] "cool", while also praising both his weapon and fighting style. Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb of X-Play stated that, while Necrid did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the aesthetic, the character did have some appeal. UGO's Doug Trueman stated Necrid's weapon had to be [...] "seen to be believed", and described him among other new characters as [...] " [...] something spectacular to the Soul Calibur pantheon". Tim Rogers of website Insert Credit called Necrid [...] "a work of digital art both in form and function" [...] and added that [...] "as far as console-only characters go—everybody wins with Necrid". Despite their negative remarks, an editor for IGN listed Necrid as eighth on their list of the top ten characters contributed to the Soulcalibur games by designers outside Namco and wrote that while they felt the character's gameplay was unbalanced, it added to Necrid's appeal; the editor wrote [...] "what do you expect {{from a man who}} shares a symbiotic relationship with the very energy that powers Soul Edge?

While Beyoncé worked on material for B'Day, she was pleased with the demo of the [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] that was presented to her. However, [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> on B'Day, which was supposed to be [...] "a hard-hitting club album". [...] Swizz Beatz, who was working on the album, declared that Beyoncé would be crazy not to include the song on the record. Beyoncé asked for changes to the song, including the addition of drums, vocal arrangements, and singing in a higher register than the demo. Espen Lind and Amund Bjørklund, from the Norwegian production team Espionage, wrote the chord structure and the guitar part. In an interview with MTV, Ne-Yo said, [...] "Beyoncé had some stuff that she wanted to get off her chest", while aiming to make a record that women could relate to, in keeping with the theme of the album.|$|E

500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com {{said the}} fact that the wedding scene works shows how genuine the {{characters}} are and how well they are presented by the writers. Sundermann also praised the cold open with Ron ripping his tooth out, and said he enjoyed the way Ann Perkins' character has continued to develop through the season. Steve Kandell of New York magazine called April and Andy perhaps the [...] "most convincingly matched and resoundingly sympathetic couple in sitcom history", and said their storylines have been handled much more effectively than those of Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly in the NBC comedy The Office. Kandell was more critical of the Ann character, and said she did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> {{as a part of the}} show anymore. Some reviews were less positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said there were individual elements of the episode she enjoyed, but felt the wedding happened too quickly and the lack of buildup reduced the tension leading up to the event. Joel Keller of TV Squad said, [...] "In a mostly stellar season, this one sits near the bottom of the list." [...] Keller said the wedding ruined an otherwise funny episode, and that it felt ineffective and rushed because April and Andy were fighting with each other only four episodes earlier. He also criticized the Ann Perkins character: [...] "I've never seen Rashida Jones play a character this wishy-washy before, and it's not pleasant to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|An academically gifted but {{socially}} inept freelance {{photographer who}} gets {{bitten by a}} genetically modified spider and gains spider-like abilities, all of which he uses to fight crime as a spider-masked vigilante learning for himself that great power comes with great responsibility. Maguire was cast as Peter in July 2000, having been Raimi's primary choice for the role after he saw The Cider House Rules. The studio was initially hesitant to cast someone who did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the ranks of [...] "adrenaline-pumping, tail-kicking titans", but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition. The actor was signed for a deal {{in the range of}} $3 to $4million with higher salary options for two sequels. To prepare, Maguire was trained by a physical trainer, a yoga instructor, a martial arts expert, and a climbing expert, taking several months to improve his physique. Maguire studied spiders and worked with a wire man to simulate the arachnidlike motion, and had a special diet. The studio had expressed interest in actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Edward Furlong, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Chris Klein, Wes Bentley, and Heath Ledger. Edward Furlong had been considered by James Cameron for the role in 1996, while Raimi joked of Prinze that [...] " [...] won't even be allowed to buy a ticket to see this film." [...] In addition, actors Scott Speedman, Jay Rodan, and James Franco were involved in screen tests for the lead role with Franco later being cast as Harry Osborn.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1850s, the {{scientist}} Richard Owen {{argued that a}} death mask discovered in Germany by Ludwig Becker in 1849, known as the Kesselstadt Death Mask, was probably used by Johnson to model {{the face of the}} effigy. The mask had been claimed to be of Shakespeare because of a similarity to an alleged Shakespeare portrait Becker had bought two years earlier. This was depicted by the painter Henry Wallis in his imaginary scene portraying Ben Jonson showing the death mask to the sculptor. However, measurements of the mask and the monument figure did not correspond, most notably the bony structure of the forehead, and the idea was discredited. Though the Kesselstadt mask does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit,</b> Park Honan asserts that the facial features of the monument do appear to have been modelled on a mask: [...] "His eyes stare, the face is heavy and the nose is small and sharp.

2500|$|Suzuki's Shenmue for the Dreamcast {{gave rise}} to a new style of {{adventure}} games, bending it away from the typical mold most games of its nature <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into, with Suzuki's own concept denoted as [...] "FREE" [...] (Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment). Shenmue was the most expensive game to be developed until Grand Theft Auto IV in 2008, with the whole project costing 70 million USD, equivalent to 93 million USD in 2011. Shenmue was a major step forward for 3D open world, nonlinear gameplay, touted as offering an unparalleled level of player freedom, giving them full reign to explore an expansive sandbox city with its own day-night cycles, changing weather, and fully voiced non-player characters going about their daily routines. The game's large interactive environments, level of detail and the scope of its urban sandbox exploration has been compared to later sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto III and its sequels, Sega's own Yakuza series, Fallout 3, and Deadly Premonition. The game also revived the quick time event mechanic and coined a name for it, [...] "QTE". The mechanic has since appeared in many later titles, including popular action games such as Resident Evil 4, God of War, , Heavenly Sword, and Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy.|$|E
2500|$|Time Machine II by George Pal and Joe Morhaim, {{published}} in 1981.

Their newborn son is rescued by an American ambulance driver and grows up in the United States under the name Christopher Jones. Sought out by the lookalike son of James Filby, Jones goes to England to collect his inheritance, leading ultimately to George's journals, and the Time Machine's original plans. He builds his own machine with 1970s upgrades and seeks his parents in the future. [...] Pal also worked on a detailed synopsis for a third sequel, which was partly filmed for a 1980s U.S. TV special on the making of Pal's film version of The Time Machine, using the original actors. [...] This third sequel, the plot of which does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> with Pal's second, opens with the Time Traveller enjoying a happy life with Weena, in a future world in which the Morlocks have died out.
