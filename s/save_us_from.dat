25|$|Suddenly the {{character}} of a Savior was vividly impressed upon my mind. It seemed {{that there might be a}} Being so good and compassionate as to Himself atone for our transgressions, and thereby <b>save</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> suffering the penalty of sin. I immediately felt how lovely such a Being must be; and imagined that I could cast myself into the arms of, and trust in the mercy of, such a One.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself to <b>save</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred {{three days later}} proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

60|$|The great deliverers of men have, for {{the most}} part, saved them from calamities which we all {{recognise}} as evil, from calamities which are the ancient enemies of humanity. The great law-givers <b>saved</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> anarchy: the great physicians <b>saved</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> pestilence: the great reformers <b>saved</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> starvation. But {{there is a huge}} and bottomless evil compared with which all these are flea-bites, the most desolating curse that can fall upon men or nations, and it has no name, except we call it satisfaction. Savonarola did not save men from anarchy, but from order; not from pestilence, but from paralysis; not from starvation, but from luxury. Men like Savonarola are the witnesses to the tremendous psychological fact at the back of all our brains, but for which no name has ever been found, that ease is the worst enemy of happiness, and civilisation potentially the end of man.|$|R

2500|$|Writing about {{attempts}} by CAMERA {{to get a}} local Pasadena, California church to cancel an appearance by Palestinian activist Reverend Naim Ateek, Rob Eshman, Editor-in-Chief of The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, wrote: [...] "I'm always leery when Jewish groups ride in {{from out of town}} to try to <b>save</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the bad guys. We have plenty of sharp-eyed Jewish defense groups locally who can tussle on our behalf. It's just a bit condescending to think we rubes, out in America's second-largest Jewish city, don't know how and when to fight. Or whom." [...] Eshman later clarified that his criticism was directed specifically at CAMERA's handling of the Ateek visit, and not toward the organization in general. [...] "I think CAMERA, which in so many cases I find useful and correct, is in this case making things worse," [...] he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|The {{link between}} the Incarnation and the Atonement within {{systematic}} theological thought is complex. [...] Within traditional models of the Atonement, such as Substitution, Satisfaction or Christus Victor, Christ must be Divine {{in order for the}} Sacrifice of the Cross to be efficacious, for human sins to be [...] "removed" [...] or [...] "conquered". [...] In his work The Trinity and the Kingdom of God, Jurgen Moltmann differentiated between what he called a [...] "fortuitous" [...] and a [...] "necessary" [...] Incarnation. [...] The latter gives a soteriological emphasis to the Incarnation: the Son of God became a man so that he could <b>save</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> our sins. [...] The former, on the other hand, speaks of the Incarnation as a fulfilment of the Love of God, of his desire to be present and living amidst humanity, to [...] "walk in the garden" [...] with us.|$|E
2500|$|The Bible {{presents}} Daniel and {{his companions}} as distinct, positive examples of individuals refusing {{to pay homage to}} another god, even at the price of their lives. During the time of the exile, Nebuchadnezzar erects a gold statue of himself and commands all subjects to worship it. Three Jewish officials – Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego – who had been taken to Babylon as youths along with Daniel, refuse to bow to the statue. As they face being burned alive in a furnace, they communicate their faith as well as their resolve: [...] "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to <b>save</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up." ...|$|E

2500|$|During this decade, {{rock music}} {{reached its peak}} in the island. Rock en Español fully reached the island, and artists like Miguel Mateos, Charly García, Soda Stereo, Hombres G Robi Draco Rosa and others were heard in radio stations. Mattador {{released}} the first instance of their album <b>Save</b> <b>Us</b> <b>From</b> Ourselves with guitarist Ramón Ortiz, who would later go on to play with Puya. The band even opened the Iron Maiden concert at the island. On January 4, 1990, John Rodriguez aka. MetalKid, a radio personality launched the first radio program to cater only Puerto Rican artists at La Mega Station 106 FM along with Edgardo [...] "El Bebo" [...] Adames; giving the opportunity to dozens of acts play their music on the radio. Later that year MetalKid created Brutal Noise Music, the first record label to include metal music on their roster. Bands like Crypta, Homicide, Morbid Death, Deathkross and the Christian act Deathless among others were the first metal releases to be available under Brutal Noise. Brutal Noise joined forces with local promoter Albert Morales from ShowNet and produced concerts like Iron Maiden, Pantera, Sepultura, Slayer making the way to promote local acts on their shows. Until today this tradition still alive. In 1994, former Menudo singer Robi Rosa released his first solo album, and Mattador re-released their album, this time with Tito Rodríguez (now with Sol D'Menta) as guitarist. La Secta Allstar is the most commercially successful rock band in Puerto Rico, selling over 250,000 copies from their last album Consejo and reaching platinum. Since their debut in Puerto Rican charts in 1998.|$|E
