5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden <b>scaffolding,</b> undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The <b>scaffolding</b> caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E

5|$|In humans, the 561 {{amino acid}} EFS protein {{acts as a}} <b>scaffolding</b> protein for cell {{signaling}} based on interactions with SRC, FAK, and other proteins, and {{has been linked to}} roles in the function of the immune system, and the development of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Neural {{precursor}} cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 9 (NEDD-9) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NEDD9 gene.

An important paralog of this gene is BCAR1.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the chapel}} were {{demolished}} {{at the start of}} 2006 on safety grounds, with <b>scaffolding</b> holding up some other sections. As of March 2008 the building has very little roof, with the walls, floors and ceilings in poor condition. The annex was also declared unsafe, but has since been reoccupied.|$|E

40|$|Scaffolds are {{temporary}} structures {{commonly used}} in construction to support various types of loads. Recently their collapse is becoming more common {{as shown by the}} number of accidents and injuries reported. The paper analyzes the main flaws and imperfections that could lead to the collapse of the <b>scaffoldings.</b> The study has been focused at the numerical level on three different types of steel scaffoldings: (i) joint tubes, (ii) multidirectional and (iii) prefabricated systems, which are {{commonly used in}} Italy. Several finite element simulations under different loading conditions on three types of steel <b>scaffoldings</b> have been performed, taking into account the imperfections during the assembly at the construction site, the base boundary conditions and the effects of lateral restraint arrangement. Finally, the study proposes an empirical formula to identify the critical load of different types of steel <b>scaffoldings</b> {{based on the number of}} story levels and the type of boundary conditions...|$|R

5|$|The team of restorers {{completed}} {{the first stage}} of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved spandrels around the upper sections of the windows, from aluminium <b>scaffolding</b> projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved to the ceiling, they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved cantilevering a shelf outwards from the <b>scaffolding</b> to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement {{along the length of the}} building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.|$|E
40|$|This article {{dedicated}} to structure of <b>scaffoldings</b> on facades with difficult shapes, which sometimes makes impossible for using usual facade equipment. Exactly, in this article, will be learnt angled facades. Considered experience of solutions in such works and suggested new variants of <b>scaffoldings</b> for sloping facades. Reviewed safety {{questions on the}} facades. Were given definitions of efficiency and laboriousness for that facade system, and enumerated factors influencing on them. The article is actual for today, because there is not any normative documents in construction sphere for buildings with irregular shapes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how circuits and systems made from molecular QCA devices might function. Our design constraints are “chemically reasonable ” {{in that we}} consider the characteristics and dimensions of devices and <b>scaffoldings</b> (circuit boards to attach devices to) that have actually been fabricated (currently in isolation). We will show {{that not only is}} the work presented here a necessary first step for any work in QCA CAD, but also that by considering issues related to design can actually help shape experiments in the physical sciences for emerging, nano-scale devices. Our work shows that circuits, <b>scaffoldings,</b> substrates, and devices must all be considered simultaneously. Otherwise, there is a very real possibility that the devices and <b>scaffoldings</b> that are eventually manufactured will result in devices that only work in isolation. This work is especially timely as experimentalists are currently working to merge the different experimental tracks – i. e. to selectively place a QCA device. 1...|$|R
5|$|At {{the angle}} of each aisle, a spiral {{staircase}} – still visible {{on each side of}} the surviving east wall – gave access to a passage inside the walls and to secondary stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to all parts of the building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring <b>scaffolding.</b> Nothing remains of the north or south transepts, which extended on the north side beyond the present boundary wall into the graveyard of St Nicholas's Church.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were overlooked by trench works, gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of <b>scaffolding,</b> sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{were able}} to save over 100 {{people out of the}} 180 {{families}} inhabiting the high-rise apartment building. According to Al Jazeera, the fire began at the <b>scaffolding</b> that surrounded the building, but spread to the complex's main building of around 500 apartments. Xinhua News Agency said the fire was contained at about 6:30pm local time (10:30 UTC), more than four hours after it began.|$|E

5|$|In 1861, a stone {{addition}} to the original 1774 Georgian structure was built. The large stone blocks used {{for the construction of}} the addition were quarried from the plantation's Mill Creek Mountain, a ridge located across the South Branch Potomac River {{to the west of the}} mansion. The stone blocks were hewed by sawyers, then transported across the river to the mansion, and lifted upon the addition's <b>scaffolding</b> with wheelbarrows. A Mr. Ferrybe supervised and managed the stone addition's construction.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, Galveston Arts Center will {{celebrate}} relocation {{to its original}} home, the historic 1878 First National Bank Building on the Strand. This Italianate-style 1900 Storm survivor was extensively damaged during Hurricane Ike in 2008. Fortunately, just weeks before Ike made landfall, <b>scaffolding</b> was installed to support the entire structural load of the building for repairs, likely preventing collapse under heavy winds and storm surge. After a lengthy fundraising campaign, restoration is nearing completion.|$|E
50|$|For 19 September 1818 Duke Charles of Mecklenburg {{arranged}} the laying {{of the foundation}} stone for the war memorial projected for {{the top of the}} Kreuzberg and designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. However, the walls and moats of the sconces and the redoubt could not be completely levelled until the ceremony, so that <b>scaffoldings</b> were erected, allowing to overlook the remnants of the so-called citadel. Masons laid a brick structure up {{to the level of the}} <b>scaffoldings</b> so that the foundation stone was to be laid on top of this structure, with the ground level around only later to be elevated to the same height. The laying of the foundation stone was attended - among others - by the king, Tzar Alexander I, Christian Daniel Rauch and Schinkel.|$|R

[...] "Ideal scaffoldings," [...] are odd enough, but when <b>scaffoldings</b> turn out to be [...] "fruits" [...] of an [...] "atmosphere," [...] and monstrous fruits of a [...] "bad transcendental atmosphere," [...] the brain reels in the fumes of mixed metaphors. [...] "Let him mend his pen," [...] cried Poe, [...] "get a bottle of visible ink, come out from the Old Manse, cut Mr. Alcott," [...] and, in fact, write about things less impalpable, as Mr. Mallock's heroine preferred to be loved, [...] "in a more human sort of way." ...|$|R
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness.
