40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of various carbon sources applied at different initial concentrations of phosphorus and growth conditions, on the phosphate release and uptake in a pure culture of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus DSM 1532. P-release and uptake studies with various carbon sources applied at different initial concentrations of phosphorus were carried out in alternating anaerobic/aerobic batch experiments. The best P-release and P-uptake rates were obtained when sodium propionate was the carbon source. Glucose addition in the synthetic wastewater caused lower P-release and uptake ratios, but did not have any significant influence on the final percentage of P-removal. The highest P-release and P-uptake rates were obtained with the highest phosphorus loadings. The highest P-release resulted in the highest P-uptake rates. The observed aerobic P-uptakes in a batch test, without preliminary resort to anaerobic conditions indicate the probable aerobic mechanism of P-uptake by A. calcoaceticus DSM 1532. The results of the <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>test</b> indicate the possibility of the adaptation of A. calcoaceticus DSM 1532 to high phosphorus loads (up to 100 mg P L- 1) in wastewater...|$|E
40|$|In this study, micro-oxygen was {{integrated}} into a rusty scrap iron (RSI) -loaded anaerobic digester. Under an optimal RSI dosage of 20 g/L, increasing O 2 levels were added stepwise in seven stages in a semi-continuous experiment. Results showed the average methane yield was 306 mL/g COD (chemical oxygen demand), and the hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) concentration was 1933 ppmv with RSI addition. O 2 addition induced the microbial oxidation of sulphide by stimulating sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and chemical corrosion of iron, which promoted the generation of FeS and Fe 2 S 3. In the 6 th phase of the <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>test,</b> deep desulfurization was achieved without negatively impacting system performance. Average methane yield was 301. 1 mL/g COD, and H 2 S concentration was 75 ppmv. Sulfur mass balance was described, with 84. 0 %, 11. 90 % and 0. 21 % of sulfur present in solid, liquid and gaseous phases, respectively. The Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis revealed that RSI addition could enrich the diversity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria to benefit methanogenesis and organic mineralization, and impoverish the methanotroph (Methylocella silvestris) to reduce the consumption of methane. Micro-oxygen supplementation could enhance the diversity of iron-oxidizing bacteria arising from the improvement of Fe(II) release rate and enrich the sulphur-oxidising bacteria to achieved desulfurization. These results demonstrated that RSI addition in combination with micro-oxygenation represents a promising method for simultaneously controlling biogas H 2 S concentration and improving digestion performance...|$|E

40|$|Oil sands mining {{operations}} in northeastern Alberta are rapidly expanding. Upgrading and extracting the bitumen from the sand requires {{large volumes of}} water generating large quantities of oil sands process water/materials (OSPM) which is high in organic content. Some of the major organic components found in OSPM include unrecovered bitumen, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), naphthenic acids (NAs) and humic acids. Concerns of acute and chronic toxicity resulting from OSPM have led to provincial legislation preventing the discharge of OSPM into local water and mandating the reclamation of areas affected by oil sands mining. To date, OSPM is stored on lease in settling basins while the mining companies evaluate reclamation strategies. One of the reclamation strategies {{involves the use of}} wetlands constructed with differing amounts of OSPM and organic amendments such as peat. Currently, numerous wetlands, both natural and constructed, are present on oil sands leases. To determine the sustainability of these wetlands for reclamation, the assimilation and flow of carbon and nitrogen within the systems need to be defined. Stable isotope analysis can enhance this understanding. To effectively use stable isotopes in the field, there is the need to determine the changes in stable isotope values occurring from the microbial degradation of organic components such as NAs which contribute a significant portion to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in reclamation sites. This study examined the microbial degradation of commercial and oil sands derived NAs by oil sands derived microbial cultures. Changes in stable isotopes values in the biomass (δ 13 C, δ 15 N), DOC and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (δ 13 C) arising from degradation of the DOC were tracked in both static and <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>tests.</b> Utilization of commercial and oil sands derived NAs resulted in minimal change of the DOC stable isotope values. The biomass was 13 C enriched for both the commercial (0. 3 to 2. 9 per mil (‰)) and oil sands derived NAs (3. 7 to 8. 5 ‰) relative to the DOC stable isotope values. DIC stable isotope values showed higher variability (- 5 to + 5. 5 ‰). The <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>tests</b> showed biomass that was 15 N enriched (3. 8 to 8. 4 ‰) with the assimilation of ammonium. Isotope trends established in the laboratory study provide further understanding into assimilation of carbon and nitrogen compounds in the field. DOC and DIC concentration and carbon stable isotope values were determined for water sampled from 13 oil sands aquatic reclamation sites varying in age, construction and organic material. Both DOC and DIC concentrations were elevated in OSPM affected sites, by an average of 40 mg/L for DOC and 83 mg/L for DIC concentrations. DOC concentrations were also elevated by approximately 10 mg/L at high organic sites. δ 13 C DOC values were slightly 13 C enriched in young sites: 0. 6 ‰ compared to δ 13 C DOC values at the mature sites. Also, from June to July 13 C enrichment (0. 3 to 1. 9 ‰) of the DOC for all sites was seen. Corresponding with the enrichment seen in the DOC, 13 C depletion (- 8. 8 to - 0. 3 ‰) of the DIC was seen for most sites from June to July. The trends seen from June to July may be a result of the release of readily degradable organics from the spring thaw stimulating the microbial community. The baseline values determined for DOC and DIC may assist future field food web studies...|$|R

This work aimed {{to assess the}} CeO 2 NP possible deleterious effects on the gills of Oncorhynchus mykiss. A <b>semi-continuous</b> acute <b>test</b> was conducted to expose the rainbow trout to a freshwater control, 0. 25, 2. 50 and 25. 00 mg/L CeO 2 NPs for up to 96 hours. Gills pathological index showed a dose-effect relationship for the individuals exposed to CeO 2. Gills showed aneurisms, epithelial lifting and hyperplasia. Furthermore exposure to CeO 2 NPs caused statistical differences in some biomarkers determinations, namely {{a significant increase in}} the catalase activity and genotoxicity the higher concentrations. No significant changes were however observed in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content, Na+-K+ ATPase and glutathione s-transferase activities. This study suggests that CeO 2 nanoparticles are toxic compounds that can lead to histological, biochemical and genotoxic alterations...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{patient data}} (IPD) meta-analyses are {{increasingly}} {{common in the}} literature. In the context of estimating the diagnostic accuracy of ordinal or <b>semi-continuous</b> scale <b>tests,</b> sensitivity and specificity are often reported for a given threshold or a small set of thresholds, and ameta-analysis is conducted via a bivariate approach to account for their correlation. When IPD are available, sensitivity and specificity can be pooled for every possible threshold. Our objective was to compare the bivariate approach, which can be applied separately at every threshold, to two multivariate methods: the ordinal multivariate random-effects model and the Poisson correlated gamma-frailty model. Our comparison was empirical, using IPD from 13 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the 9 -item Patient Health Questionnaire depression screening tool, and included simulations. The empirical comparison showed that {{the implementation of the}} two multivariate methods is more laborious in terms of computational time and sensitivity to user-supplied values compared to the bivariate approach. Simulations showed that ignoring the within-study correlation of sensitivity and specificity across thresholds did not worsen inferences with the bivariate approach compared to the Poisson model. The ordinal approach was not suitable for simulations because the model was highly sensitive to user-supplied starting values. We tentatively recommend the bivariate approach rather than more complex multivariate methods for IPD diagnostic accuracy meta-analyses of ordinal scale tests, although the limited type of diagnostic data considered in the simulation study restricts the generalization of our finding...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{campaign was}} performed on cheese whey (CW), a by-product of cheese manufacturing, in order to biologically treat the residual fraction of CW that cannot be used for other applications. In the present paper, the results of batch and <b>semi-continuous</b> anaerobic digestion <b>tests,</b> aimed at assessing the combined biological production of H 2 and CH 4 using a two-stage process, are discussed. The best performance under batch conditions corresponded to a yield of 179. 7 Nl H 2 /kg TOCwhey for the hydrogenogenic stage and 1156 Nl CH 4 /kg TOCwhey,i. Compared to the conventional single-stage process (which displayed a methane yield of 962 Nl CH 4 /kg TOCwhey,i), a 20 % gain in methane production was observed as best performance of the two-stage process. Semi-continuous two-stage conditions led to a maximum stable production of roughly 80. 8 Nl H 2 /kg TOCwhey,i and 660. 7 Nl CH 4 /kg TOCwhey,i...|$|R
40|$|Through a {{cooperative}} agreement with DOE, the Research and Development Department of CONSOL Inc. (CONSOL R and D) is teaming with SynAggs, Inc. and Duquesne Light to design, construct, and operate a 500 lb/h continuous pilot plant to produce road construction aggregate from {{a mixture of}} wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) sludge, fly ash, and other components. The proposed project is divided into six tasks: (1) Project Management; (2) Mix Design Evaluation; (3) Process Design; (4) Construction; (5) Start-Up and Operation; and (6) Reporting. In this quarter, Tasks 1 and 2 were completed. A project management plan (Task 1) was issued to DOE on October 22, 1998. The mix design evaluation (Task 2) with Duquesne Light Elrama Station FGD sludge and Allegheny Power Hatfields Ferry Station fly ash was completed. Eight <b>semi-continuous</b> bench-scale <b>tests</b> were conducted {{to examine the effects}} of mix formulation on aggregate properties. A suitable mix formulation was identified to produce aggregates that meet specifications of the American Association of State High Transport Officials (AASHTO) as Class A aggregate for use in highway construction. The mix formulation was used in designing the flow sheet of the pilot plant. The process design (Task 3) is approximately 80 % completed. Equipment was evaluated to comply with design requirements. The design for the curing vessel was completed by an outside engineering firm. All major equipment items for the pilot plant, except the curing vessel, were ordered. Pilot plant construction (Task 4) was begun in October. The Hazardous Substance Plan was issued to DOE.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the dominance of one species with respect to others is a pertinent challenge in HAB growth dynamics studies and the nutrient supply mode {{is one of the}} factors potentially involved. The competition for phosphorus (P) between a toxic species, Alexandrium minutum, and a non-toxic species, Heterocapsa triquetra, was studied (1) along a gradient of P depletion, (2) testing different P depletion degrees before a single PO 4 supply and (3) experimenting different PO 4 supply frequencies. In conditions of PO 4 depletion, H. triquetra stopped growing after two days both in monospecific and mixed batch cultures whereas A. minutum grew progressively from day 2 {{until the end of the}} experiment. This time-lag growth of A. minutum is associated to its ability to store P intracellularly and then mobilize it for cell division when P depletion becomes severe. Heterocapsa triquetra outcompeted A. minutum when it was submitted to less than three days of P depletion before the pulse. In contrast, A. minutum outcompeted H. triquetra after more than three days of depletion. This transition was related to the capacity for A. minutum to increase its cell PO 4 uptake rate in a higher proportion to face potential PO 4 supply. As a result of this physiological acclimatation to P starvation, A. minutum consumed the whole PO 4 pulse supplied after 3 to 10 days of P depletion. This resulted in a reduction of H. triquetra growth. These two acclimatations were confirmed in a P limited <b>semi-continuous</b> culture experiment <b>testing</b> several PO 4 supply frequencies (1, 2, 4, 6 day intervals). These experiments revealed that A. minutum is a “storage specialist ” species for P, which uptakes PO 4 pulses for luxury consumption, survives depletion periods and, then, utilizes P for cell growth. In contrast, H. triquetra is more a “velocity adapted ” species, whic...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reports on the}} potential for CO 2 pressurisation {{as a means of}} enhancing biogas production in the anaerobic digestion of co-settled sewage sludge, a technique reported in the commercial literature as showing great benefits. The possibility of using this technique {{to reduce the number of}} faecal indicator bacteria is also explored, as an alternative means of complying with the UK water industry's Safe Sludge Matrix. Initial research using pure cultures of both E. coli (a strain isolated from sewage sludge) and Salmonella enterica showed that the results from different methods for isolating, recovering, resuscitating and enumerating E. coli were comparable. Further testing using heat stressed and unstressed E. coli showed the advantages of resuscitation and the MPN technique with 2 -stage incubation was therefore used in the experiments to maximise the recovery of damaged but viable cells. The results for pure cultures showed conclusively that under the conditions of time and pressure used CO 2 pressurisation and rapid depressurisation could cause irreversible cell damage and loss of viability in both test strains. The effect was reproducible and a time-pressure relationship was established for the apparatus used. It was shown, however, that the sanitising effect was influenced by culture volume, probably as this affected mass transfer of CO 2 and hence its penetration into the cells. This finding may limit the practical application of the approach and further work is needed to establish design parameters and develop reactor systems to overcome this issue. Even under the favourable conditions used, exposure times required for 6 log reduction were too long for commercial application. Optimisation of the pressurisation vessel design may improve this and should be a focus of any future investigations. Batch and <b>semi-continuous</b> anaerobic digestion <b>tests</b> with co-settled sewage sludge were carried out to ascertain the effect of pressurised CO 2 treatment on biogas production. These showed conclusively that the treatment did not improve either biogas productivity or specific methane yield. Experimental work also showed that even treatment conditions which gave an 8 log reduction in E. coli in pure culture were ineffective in reducing the number of indigenous E. coli in the sludge, or of S. enterica when added to a sewage sludge matrix. These findings led to further investigation of the effects of the size of pressure vessel and sample used. The results showed that this was an important factor, but could not fully explain the lack of performance in comparison with pure culture. It was concluded that the sludge matrix itself must play a role in protecting the microbial consortia from the effects of pressurised CO 2. The exact reasons for this were not discovered but may be due to the effect of dissolved compounds present in the sludge and/or the structure and nature of the sludge flocs themselves...|$|R
