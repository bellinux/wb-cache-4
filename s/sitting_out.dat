5|$|On July 27, 2016, Nowitzki re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks.

After <b>sitting</b> <b>out</b> the Devils first five games, Niedermayer made his NHL debut on October 16, 1991, against the New York Rangers. He appeared in four games with the Devils, recording one assist, before he {{was sent back to}} junior.

Niedermayer tied for third place in playoff scoring with 23 points. At the 1992 Memorial Cup, he scored seven points in five games to lead the Blazers to the national championship.
