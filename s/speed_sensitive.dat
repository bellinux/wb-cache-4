25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, <b>speed</b> <b>sensitive</b> power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E

40|$|Subset {{selection}} from massive {{data with}} noised information is increasingly popular for various applications.

As a result, the robustness against outlier elements is greatly enhanced. Actually, data size is generally much larger than feature length, i. e. NL.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method to investigate wave propagation in single- and double- walled carbon nanotubes under initial compression stress is presented. The nanotube structures are treated within the multilayer thin shell approximation with the elastic properties {{taken to be}} those of the graphene sheet.

Frequency equations of wave propagation in single and double wall carbon nanotubes are described through the effects of initial compression stress and van der Waals force.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the disturbances resembles a Kelvin wave, although the speed of propagation is slower than anticipated from theory as applied to a dry atmosphere. However, a simple model of the tropical atmosphere demonstrates that the wave <b>speed</b> is <b>sensitive</b> to moisture effects.

50|$|The {{bulk modulus}} {{is defined by}} short range {{molecular}} interaction forces and depends mainly on molecular composition of tissue which is typically 75% water with little variation. In contrast to that, the shear modulus is defined by long range interactions and is highly sensitive to structural changes. The wide range of variability makes the shear elasticity modulus and, respectively, the shear wave <b>speed,</b> highly <b>sensitive</b> to physiological and pathological structural changes of tissue. For this reason, the use of shear waves in new diagnostic methods and devices has been extensively investigated {{over the last two}} decades. Numerous new methods were developed most notable of which are Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI), Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE), Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI), Shearwave Dispersion Ultrasound Vibrometry (SDUV), Harmonic Motion Imaging (HMI), Comb-push Ultrasound Shear Elastography (CUSE), and Spatially Modulated Ultrasound Radiation Force (SMURF).|$|R

A problem of such TSA implementation is it requires long response time to allow for sufficient TSA accuracy, {{which can lead to}} late and ineffective emergency control actions. To improve the TSA response speed, a self-adaptive TSA scheme has been proposed in [17, 18]. It monitors the credibility of the IS output over a progressively increasing observation window, and delivers the TSA decision once a credible result is obtained. In doing so, the TSA response time can be shortened without the impairment on TSA accuracy. Moreover, it is implied that, under the self-adaptive TSA scheme, the overall TSA accuracy and <b>speed</b> are <b>sensitive</b> to the values of a number of user-defined parameters involved in the credibility monitoring process. However, in [17, 18], those parameters are manually tuned, which is time consuming and cannot ensure the optimal TSA performance.|$|R
