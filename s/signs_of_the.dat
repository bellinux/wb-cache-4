50|$|Ell is most {{remembered for}} his strong {{interest}} in recreation and conservation. From 1900 onwards, Ell pushed for <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a network of scenic reserves along Christchurch's Port Hills, linked by the Summit Road and with a network of rest-houses to allow travellers and walkers to refresh themselves. Three of these rest-houses, designed by architect Samuel Hurst Seager, were completed during Ell's lifetime: <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird, <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi, and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse. The last, and grandest, <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe, was not completed until long after Ell’s death, in 1949. All four houses were built of local stone, and designed {{to blend in with}} <b>the</b> landscape. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe still function as commercial rest stops serving refreshments while <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird survives only as a shelter, but is still a useful stopping place for a picnic and the starting point for some short walks. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse is managed by <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Conservation and used as a hut by trampers.|$|R

5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Binky's cagemate Nuka {{suddenly}} became sick with the parasitic disease sarcocystosis, dying from associated liver failure on July 14, {{a week after}} her symptoms began. Shortly thereafter, Binky showed <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. On the morning of July 20, he went into convulsions and died. Zoo visitors left bouquets of flowers outside the bears' empty enclosure, and the zoo's memorial service saw a high turnout despite pouring rain. The bears were buried on zoo grounds.|$|E
5|$|The mutineers {{broke into}} the base's armoury {{on the morning of}} 20 February and pillaged the white quarter of the town. The town's {{inhabitants}} fled, and a Belgian officer and two white civilians were killed. The mutineers attacked visible <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial authorities and proclaimed their desire for independence. The mutineers then dispersed to their home villages, pillaging on the way; they failed to spread the insurrection to neighbouring garrisons. Two mutineers, including Mukalabushi, were executed for their part in the insurrection.|$|E
50|$|Rest {{houses were}} envisaged at regular intervals. The {{first to be}} built was <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird at Kennedy's Bush in 1914. This was <b>the</b> {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first scenic reserve that Ell managed to get established in 1906. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse, a smaller house on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kaituna Saddle, was the second one to be established in 1916. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi was the third rest house built by Ell. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe was the remaining house to be built.|$|R

5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many early <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able {{to steer the}} balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E

5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney {{to discuss what}} to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} neared land, a ridge over Mexico {{prevented}} Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less damage than forecast. As Kiko traveled {{parallel to the}} coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days. In Kiko's rough seas {{off the coast of}} Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-fivepassengers and crew. Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt. Authorities searched the beaches of San Francisco Ixhuatán and San Francisco del Mar for any <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. Only twopeople survived; fifteenbodies were recovered, and ninepassengers were never found.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{expected}} German ground attack.

Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were beaten back but ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved down the road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Billie was mixed; some critics {{felt that she}} was a strong addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy as <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's declining quality. After speculation about Billie's possible appearance in a spin-off series, it was confirmed all future plans for the show were canceled following The WB's closure to launch The CW. Cuoco later said that she prefer working on sitcoms over dramatic television shows due to demanding shooting schedule that she experienced while working on Charmed.|$|E
