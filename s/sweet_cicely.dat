They had a 2 acre garden in the eastern portion of the field south of the orchard and north of the current visitor center parking lot. They grew vegetables to sell door to door in Dune Acres. They grew asparagus, lima beans, yellow and green snap beans, beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery (white), kale, leaf lettuce, endive, cantaloupe, watermelons, okra, green onions, leeks, parsnips, peas, green and red peppers, red, white, and sweet potatoes, radishes, rhubarb, spinach, red rhubarb chard and white Swiss chard, Jerusalem and butternut squash, red and yellow tomatoes, turnips, rutabagas, kohl robi, <b>cicely,</b> <b>sweet</b> corn (yellow bantam and country gentleman), horseradish, dill, sage, chives, and parsley.|$|R

50|$|Climate-friendly gardeners {{therefore}} grow {{at least}} some of their food, and may choose food crops which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland soils if they grow such high-risk crops in small vegetable plots in their gardens, where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under commercial pressures. Climate-friendly gardeners may grow and eat plants such as <b>sweet</b> <b>cicely</b> which sweeten food, and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet. They may also choose to grow perennial food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland, but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens.|$|E
50|$|Most of Post Hill {{is covered}} in oak-birch woodland, in the {{southern}} part there are stretches of semi-natural ancient woodland that has contained trees since before the year 1600. Tree species include oak, birch, ash, hawthorn, hazel, yew, and field maple. In the undergrowth, bluebells, brambles, bracken, hart's tongue fern, and woodrush are found, as well as ramson (wild garlic), lesser celandine, wood anemone, yellow archangel, and <b>sweet</b> <b>cicely.</b> Two large areas of acid grasslands and meadows remain on {{the eastern side of the}} beck, and one west of it, adjacent to Pudsey Road. Wildflowers in these meadows include bird's foot trefoil, oxeye daisies, autumn hawkbit, tansy, and red clover. Fungi such as sulphur tuft and stinkhorn are also found.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is noted}} for its biodiversity. Eastern {{woodland}} flowers such as bloodroot, Canada Violet, phlox and <b>sweet</b> <b>cicely</b> can be found growing among prairie plants, including yucca, clover, and larkspur. The wild plum and gooseberry thickets were also noted by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, who passed these bluffs with their Corps of Discovery {{in the summer of}} 1804. Forested ravines and hillsides contain bur oak, basswood, elm, black walnut and hackberry. White-tailed deer and wild turkey are commonly seen. Coyotes, red and gray foxes, raccoons and bobcats might also be spotted. This area is also known for the concentrations of waterfowl that congregate during the spring and fall migrations. The barred owl is a vocal resident, and wintering bald eagles are often sighted. Many miles of trails wind through the deep ravines and over the windswept hilltop ridges of the park.|$|E

50|$|Mount Tabor {{was entirely}} covered with {{vegetation}} typical of northern Ancient Israel until {{the reign of}} the Ottoman Empire, during which period most of the trees were felled. The trees were felled for use in the charcoal industry. As part of the Jewish National Fund's efforts to recreate the landscapes of the country, the area was reforested with trees which are similar to its original vegetation during the 1960s and 1970s. Today, most of Mount Tabor is covered with trees, Mount Tabor Oak (Quercus ithaburensis) and Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos). Up to 400 plant species have been found on the Mount, including large yellow crocuses (Sternbergia clusiana), the Persian lily (Fritillaria persica) rain-bells flowers (Muscari parviflorum), while tulips (Tulipa agenensis), orchids, irises (including Iris haynei) and yellow asphodel (Asphodeline Lutea), spontaneous barley (Hordeum spontaneum), Mt. Tabor larkspur, a rather rare perennial grass with blue spring flowers (Delphinium ithaburense), <b>sweet</b> <b>cicely</b> (myrrhoides nodosa), a very rare plant of the umbelliferae family, Galileahn alkanet (Alkanna galilaea) and parsley-piert (Aphanes arvensis).|$|E
40|$|Garlic mustard is a cool season {{biennial}} herb with stalked, triangular to heart-shaped, coarsely toothed {{leaves that}} give off an odor of garlic when crushed. First-year plants {{appear as a}} rosette of green leaves close to the ground. Rosettes remain green through the winter and develop into mature flowering plants the following spring. Flowering plants of garlic mustard reach from 2 to 3 feet in height and produce buttonlike clusters of small white flowers, each with four petals {{in the shape of}} a cross. Recognition of garlic mustard is critical. Several white-flowered native plants, including toothworts (Dentaria spp.), <b>sweet</b> <b>cicely</b> (Osmorhiza claytonii), and early saxifrage (Saxifraga virginica), occur alongside garlic mustard and may be mistaken for it. Beginning in May (in the mid-Atlantic Coast Plain region), seeds are produced in erect, slender pods and become shiny black when mature. By late June, when most garlic mustard plants have died, they can be recognized only by the erect stalks of dry, pale brown seedpods that remain, and may hold viabl...|$|E
40|$|This type occurs principally on moraines {{composed}} of well-to-moderately-well-drained heterogeneous soils with inherently high moisture and nutrient availability. Vegetation Description Structurally, these uneven-aged forests {{were characterized by}} large volumes of coarse, woody debris lying beneath multi-storied canopies of different-aged cohorts, with supercanopies {{composed of}} trees centuries old (Tyrell and Crow 1994). The dominant tree species {{are among the most}} moisture and nutrient-demanding species in the eastern U. S. A., and their distribution is confined to glacial landforms underlain by fertile soils (Woods 2000, Whitney 1986). Composition of the ground flora and understory varies along a moisture-nutrient gradient, and typically consists of high densities of shade-tolerant tree species and mesophilic herbaceous species including blue cohosh, yellow violet, <b>sweet</b> <b>cicely,</b> various ferns, and ginseng. In the mid- 1800 ’s, there were 5. 8 million acres of northern hardwood ecosystems in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Cleland 2004 a, ongoing R- 9 /SRS/MTU study). Sugar maple, hemlock, yellow birch, balsam fir, cedar in swales, spruce, and beech were the dominant late-successional species recorded along section lines by GLO surveyors (figure 1). Early-successional aspen and white birch comprised only 2. 0 % of the GL...|$|E
40|$|Temperate and {{boreal forests}} in Canada and the northeastern United States are {{susceptible}} to attacks by multiple invasive species, including European earthworms (family Lumbricidae) and plant species such as garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata [M. Bieb] Cavara 2 ̆ 6 Grande) and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora Thunb.). Old-growth forests are considered less susceptible to invasion by introduced plant species than secondary growth forests but the ability of introduced earthworms to invade old-growth forest is unclear. In a series of growth chamber experiments, I determined (1) the palatability of garlic mustard and six native herbaceous forest species (shooting star, columbine, wild geranium, <b>sweet</b> <b>cicely,</b> butterfly weed, and yellow jewelweed) to the common nightcrawler and (2) {{the ability of the}} common nightcrawler to bury and digest garlic mustard and wild geranium. I also investigated relationships among introduced earthworms, introduced plants, and native plant communities in six paired old and secondary growth forests in four Indiana natural regions along interior and edge transects positioned on either a south or west facing edge. Garlic mustard seed was readily consumed by common nightcrawlers and found to be preferred over some native plant species suggesting that common nightcrawlers may reduce the presence of the garlic mustard in the forest seed bank. In the field experiment, densities and frequencies of earthworms did not differ between forest edges and interiors or between the old- and second-growth forest stands. Differences in percent cover and frequency were not detected among forest structural stage or location of transect for introduced plant species. Ordinations of earthworm densities, soil characteristics, and plant species suggested differences between old-growth and second-growth stands for three of the six pairs. Introduced plants and earthworms appear ubiquitous in Indiana forests and appear to influence the plant species composition of Indiana forests. ...|$|E
