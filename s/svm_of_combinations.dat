40|$|A {{single face}} {{classifier}} has difficulty in detecting multiview faces under real and complex scenes due to various poses, cluttering environment and {{small size of}} faces. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>SVMs</b> to detect multi-view faces, using both cascading and bagging methods. In our method, the faces are divided into seven views. Each of them models a typical pose under complex scenes. By the modified bootstrap method applied in our method, a cascade <b>of</b> <b>SVMs</b> are constructed to quickly select face candidates from image with expected accuracy. Bagging <b>of</b> different <b>SVMs</b> can further eliminate the false detections {{that are difficult to}} handle by single <b>SVM.</b> Such <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>SVMs</b> can effectively detect multi-view faces even with large rotation angles and heavy shadow.

40|$|Binary {{classification}} is a {{core data}} mining task. For large datasets or real-time applications, desirable classifiers are accurate, fast, and automatic (i. e. no parameter tuning). Naive Bayes and decision trees are fast and parameter-free, but their accuracy is often below state-of-the-art. Linear support vector machines (SVM) are fast and have good accuracy, but current implementations {{are sensitive to}} the capacity parameter. SVMs with radial basis function kernels are accurate but slow, and have multiple parameters that require tuning. In this paper we demonstrate that a very simple parameter-free implementation of logistic regression (LR) is sufficiently accurate and fast to compete with state-of-the-art binary classifiers on large real-world datasets. The accuracy is comparable to per-dataset tuned linear SVMs and, in higher dimensions, to tuned RBF <b>SVMs.</b> A <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> regularization, truncated-Newton methods, and iteratively re-weighted least squares make this implementation faster than SVMs and relatively insensitive to parameters. Our fitting procedure, TR-IRLS, appears to outperform several common LR fitting procedures in our experiments. TR-IRLS is robust to linear dependencies and scaling problems in the data, and no data preprocessing is necessary. TR-IRLS is easy to implement and can be used anywhere that IRLS is used.

METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six CRC patients were followed up for more than 3 years after radical surgery. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed to detect the expression of 14 pathway-related markers (p 53, APC, p 21 ras, E-cadherin, endothelin-B receptor, Shp 2, ADCY- 2, SPARCL 1, neuroligin 1, hsp 27, mmp- 9, MAPK, MSH 2 and rho) in specimens from these patients. Bioinformatics analysis involving a Support Vector Machine (SVM) {{was used to determine}} the best prognostic model from <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> these markers. RESULTS: Seven markers (SPARCL 1, Shp 2, MSH 2, E-cadherin, p 53, ADCY- 2 and MAPK) were significantly related to the prognosis and clinical pathological features of the CRC patients (P < 0. 05). Prognostic models were established through <b>SVM</b> from <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> these 7 markers and proved able to differentiate patients with dissimilar survival, especially in stage II/III patients. According to the best prognostic model, the p 53 /SPARCL 1 model, patients having high p 53 and low SPARCL 1 expression had about 50 % lower 3 -year survival than others (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: SPARCL 1, Shp 2, MSH 2, E-cadherin, p 53, ADCY- 2 and MAPK are potential prognostic markers in CRC.

This report introduces a robust framework for pose-free tracking of non-rigid face. Our method consists of two phases: training and tracking. In the training phase, a large offline synthesized database is built to train landmark appearance models using linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the tracking phase, a two-step approach is proposed: the first step, namely initialization, benefits 2 D SIFT matching between the current frame {{and a set of}} adaptive keyframes to estimate the rigid parameters. The second step obtains the whole set of parameters (rigid and non-rigid) using a heuristic method via pose-wise <b>SVMs.</b> The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these aspects makes our method work robustly up to 90 ° of vertical axial rotation. Moreover, our method appears to be robust even in the presence of fast movements and tracking losses. Comparing to other published algorithms, our method offers a very good compromise of rigid and non-rigid parameter accuracies. This study gives a promising perspective because of the good results in terms of pose estimation (average error is less than 4 ° on BUFT dataset) and landmark tracking precision (5. 8 pixel error compared to 6. 8 of one state-of-the-art method on Talking Face video).

Small pieces of DT were combined with mesenchyme of the rat urogenital sinus (18 -day fetal, UGM) or seminal vesicle (0 -day neonatal, <b>SVM).</b> Both types <b>of</b> <b>combinations</b> were grown under the kidney capsule of male athymic nude mice for 4 weeks. At harvest, the tissue recombinants were fixed and processed for electron microscopy. Grafts of parental DT were similarly processed for electron microscopy. The tumor was characterized by tubules lined by 2 - 3 layers of undifferentiated cells lacking secretory granules. The basal lamina was reduplicated, and epithelioid cells traversing gaps in the basal lamina were frequently observed. The stroma was composed of a mixture of fibroblastic and large epithelioid cells derived from the ductal lining epithelium through a process of micrometastasis. In UGM or SVM+DT combinations the mesenchyme influenced the differentiation and secretory activity of the DT epithelium. The induced DT epithelial cells exhibited a well-developed granular endoplasmic reticulum, a large Golgi apparatus and prominent secretory granules which were never observed in the parental DT. The basal lamina returned to normal, while the incidence of micrometastasis was decreased. The collagen content of the stroma was increased with a concurrent appearance of smooth muscle cells surrounding those tubules where secretory cytodifferentiation had occurred. While the mechanism involved in the mesenchyme-induced change in cytodifferentiation remains unknown, it is evident that the DT epithelial cells when associated with normal embryonic or neonatal mesenchyme can express a more normal cytodifferentiation and function. It is concluded (a) that the DT cells can be induced by mesenchyme to express more highly differentiated ultrastructural patterns and secretory cytodifferentiation, (b) that the induced secretory cytodifferentiation is associated with a reduction in invasiveness (micrometastasis) and a more normal-appearing basal lamina and (c) that the increased abundance of collagen fibers and the differentiation of smooth muscle in the stromal compartment are associated with secretory cytodifferentiation suggesting that reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are involved in the regulation of the pathobiology of the DT. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
