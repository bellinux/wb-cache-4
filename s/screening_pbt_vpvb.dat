30|$|Two reasons {{support the}} use of {{alternative}} assessment methods: alternative methods for hazard assessment are necessary, as animal testing should be avoided if possible. On the other hand, there is the problem that for specific situations reliable information needed for assessing the hazard potential of a substance is missed when only the established standard assessment schemes, which consist mostly of laboratory tests, are used. The latter leads to misjudgment of substances, which need to be identified as SVHC. To illustrate this point, a small number exercise can be employed: there is an obvious mismatch between the number of substances registered under REACH and the number of substances identified as PBT/vPvB. Currently, 9032 substances (as of the 31.12. 2015) are registered under REACH. However, there are only 22 substances (as of 3.12. 2015) identified as <b>PBT</b> and/or <b>vPvB</b> substances so far and not all of them have been registered. If all of these would have been registered, that would amount to 0.2  % of the registered substances. In a study by Strempel et al. [2], 94, 483 substances of the European Inventory of Existing Commercial chemical Substances (EINECS register) were <b>screened</b> for <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> properties. Based on their results, the authors estimate that approximately 3  % of all the substances in the register, i.e. 2930 substances, might be PBT/vPvB substances. In comparison to the 22 PBT/vPvB substances currently identified, this is a mismatch that can only partially be {{explained by the fact that}} the REACH registration has been in force for merely 9  years.|$|R
30|$|Other deficiencies, e.g. {{observed}} while <b>screening</b> {{for potential}} <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances are missing testing proposals, misuse of waiving, and missing documentation of structure activity relationships used to fulfil certain data requirements. In addition, exposure assessment, especially refinement and on-site risk management {{are used in}} an intransparent manner without documentation.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{criteria}} of Annex XIII were adapted to the scientific progress with regard to <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> properties in March 2011 [14], no decision concerning a <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> substance was made in 2011 and 2012. No proposal for a PBT-substance was submitted between August 2009 and July 2012.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances, we would suggest {{to extend the}} {{responsibility}} of the registrants to include a part of the SVHC-identification. If the results of screening for persistency and bioaccumulation indicate a substance is a <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> candidate, it should be the task of the registrant to evaluate whether the criteria of Annex XIII are fulfilled or not.|$|R
30|$|Because of {{the poor}} {{degradability}} of <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances, there is concern that effects in organisms cannot be predicted in the long run. Accumulation in organisms is virtually irreversible {{and the content of}} these substances in the environmental compartments can only very slowly be reduced by lowering the emissions. Moreover, some <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances, such as PFC, have the potential to pollute remote areas through long-range transport via air and water. Even when standardized tests in the laboratory show no toxic effects, chronic effects may occur through long-term exposure to low doses. Because of the long life cycles of organisms {{at the end of the}} food chain, these effects will hardly be predictable. And the concentrations of <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances in man and the environment cannot be predicted over long periods of time. This is another reason why chronic effects cannot be excluded. Therefore, according to the principles of REACH, for <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances no safe levels can be derived for the environment [24].|$|R

30|$|With {{regard to}} {{regulatory}} activities, identifying {{of at least}} <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances is challenging due to missing information. In addition to that, the interface between restrictions and authorisations needs to be improved to include SVHC in (imported) articles in the authorisation regime.|$|R
30|$|The {{different}} European substance regulations (e.g. REACH [1], {{plant protection}} products regulation [2], biocidal products regulation [3], human and veterinary medicinal products regulations [4, 5]) have all recognised that substances that are either persistent (P), bioaccumulative (B) and toxic (T) (PBT substances) or very persistent (vP) and very bioaccumulative (vB) (vPvB substances) must be considered as hazardous for the environment due to their potential for eliciting long-term adverse effects. The goal of preventing exposure of humans and the environment to <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances is thus shared among all EU-based regulatory frameworks. In a comparison between different European and International regulations, Moermond et al. [6] reported that {{there are differences in}} how this goal is achieved, not only regarding technical criteria but also conceptual criteria (e.g. regulatory consequences for <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances).|$|R
30|$|The EU Biocidal Products Regulation [3] {{refers to}} Annex XIII of REACH [7] {{and to the}} ECHA {{guidance}} for PBT/vPvB assessment [8, 9]. However, for biocides, generally no authorisation will be granted for products containing substances identified as <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB.</b> Additionally, biocides that fulfil {{two of the three}} criteria are flagged as candidates for substitution and are subjected to a comparative assessment.|$|R

30|$|A {{substance}} {{is considered a}} <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> substance if it fulfills the P, B and T or the vP and vB criteria. In the following sections, for each PBT criterion, the criteria for the ‘definitive assessment’ are presented first. This {{is followed by the}} criteria for the ‘screening assessment’, which is carried out in cases of limited data availability.|$|R
30|$|By contrast, the PPP Regulation [2] simply {{stipulates}} the PBT/vPvB criteria, {{oblivious to}} any other guidance. As for biocides, no authorisation will be granted for those substances identified as <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB.</b> Additionally, PPPs that fulfil {{two of the three}} criteria are flagged as candidates for substitution and are subjected to a comparative assessment, as is the case for biocides. The draft guidance developed by DG Sanco [11] focuses primarily on the identification of candidates for substitution.|$|R
30|$|This case, and {{the lack}} of {{proposals}} for additional <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> substances as SVHC made clear the need to re-establish a technical discussion about PBT-issues. Hence, the German Federal Environment Agency organised a PBT-workshop between Member States experts and ECHA in Dessau in November 2010, followed by several expert meetings to co-ordinate the activities on identification of additional PBT and vPvB-candidates. The activities ended up in the establishment of a PBT expert group by ECHA mandated by the meeting of the Member States competent authorities.|$|R

These exposure scenarios describe the processes, operational conditions and RMM for the safe use throughout the whole life cycle for a substance. This is the centrepiece of REACH by which standards of health and safety at work can be raised, but the requirements of the CSR are challenging.|$|R
30|$|According to this Article the {{following}} properties are characteristic for substances {{of very high}} concern: carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR substances) – all of them due to category 1 A or 1 B in accordance with section 3.5 - 3.7 of Annex I to CLP-Regulation [5]. With regard to the environment, substances of very high concern are characterized by persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic properties (PBT-substances), or very persistent and very bioaccumulative properties (vPvB-substances). The criteria for <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> are set out in Annex XIII of REACH.|$|R
30|$|The {{use of the}} {{relationship}} with KOW is proposed by Regulation 253 / 2011 (REACH) [5] as a preliminary <b>screening</b> procedure for <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> categorization but a criterion is not provided in the Regulation. The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) proposed the value of log KOW > 4.5 as a criterion for B [82]. However, KOW {{does not account for}} metabolic transformation and active excretion processes [24]. Therefore, false positives are highly probable and KOW must be assumed only as an indicator of worst-case conditions of the ‘potential’ for bioconcentration. More complex models, based on several molecular properties and descriptors, have been recently developed [83 – 85]. These models are more powerful than the simple relationship with KOW; however, with the exception of EPISUITE 4.1 [83], they are limited to prediction of bioconcentration and do not consider biotransformation and/or excretion. As bioconcentration studies are required for registration of PPPs with a log KOW of > 3, modeling or extrapolation of BCF from properties such as KOW is not necessary.|$|R
30|$|Regulation EC 1907 / 2006, the REACH, was amended in March 2011 [5] to {{take into}} account the {{identification}} of <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment. In Annex XIII [5], persistence criteria are specified as ‘degradation’ half-lives, which are identical with those of Annex II of Regulation 1107 / 2009 [10]. Moreover, information for the assessment of P and vP properties to be considered are results from simulation testing on degradation in surface water, soil, and sediment and other information from field studies or monitoring studies, provided that its suitability and reliability can be reasonably demonstrated.|$|R
30|$|According to Article 58, {{priority}} to including a substance {{on the list}} of SVHC in Annex XIV of REACH should be given to substances with <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> properties, with wide dispersive use, or with high production volumes. Currently, there are 84 listings for SVHC candidates, thereof one substance is vPvB (musk xylene, CAS 81 - 15 - 2), three are PBT (bis(tributyltin)oxide, CAS 56 - 35 - 9; anthracene, CAS 120 - 12 - 7; hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD; α-, β- and γ-HBCD), CAS 25637 - 99 - 4), and one is both vPvB (57 e) and PBT (57 d) (short-chain chlorinated paraffins, CAS 85535 - 84 - 8).|$|R
30|$|European {{regulatory}} {{frameworks for}} chemicals (i.e. registered under REACH, {{plant protection products}} (PPPs), biocides, human and veterinary medicinal products) require that substances undergo an assessment to identify whether they are persistent (P), bioaccumulative (B) and toxic (T), or very persistent (vP) and very bioaccumulative (vB), i.e. to identify them as <b>PBT</b> substances or <b>vPvB</b> substances according to their properties. We screened current practices, evaluated possibilities and made {{a proposal for a}} harmonised assessment. Our proposal assumes that {{it should be possible to}} identify <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances on the basis of the data available according to the requirements of the respective legal frameworks. For substances registered as PPPs and mostly also biocides and medicinal products, a ‘definitive assessment’ is often possible. Within REACH, the registrant has to provide all information necessary for PBT assessment regardless of the yearly tonnage of chemicals. But in cases of limited data availability, we suggest using a weight of evidence approach to account for such differences in data availability and type of data across different frameworks and to make use of valuable additional information. We propose to base the evaluation of persistence on degradation half-lives and to normalise a number of parameters (e.g. type of kinetics used, temperature). But further work is needed, e.g. for deriving DegT 50 for water and sediment compartments. For the B-criterion, information other than BCF in fish could be considered and more information related to bioaccumulation processes should be gathered (e.g. in species other than fish, different uptake routes). Testing for T identification is focused on standard aquatic species but could also be complemented by e.g. information from other species. Information such as those read-across from structurally related substances and QSAR are often of importance for screening assessments. The aim of <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> identification is to reliably target the problematic substances, with as few false negatives or positives as possible, regardless of the regulatory framework. Each aspect was thus considered in the context of the others for a final balanced decision. As the need for conservatism is interpreted differently under the various frameworks, harmonizing this identification is a challenging task.|$|R

30|$|In {{focussing}} {{solely on}} occupational health and safety, the authors {{do not agree}} with the identification of SVHC substances based only on their hazard classification without risk characterisation of the substance as applied at the moment. However, the legal text of REACH is not so specific. SVHC by definition of the REACH regulation are those substances that are included in the candidate list for authorisation {{on the basis of their}} classification as CMR, their <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> properties or of their equivalent level of concern (ELC) [27]. In 2010, the EU commissionaires Tajani and Potočnik asked the Member State Competent Authorities and ECHA to intensify their work to accomplish the inclusion of 136 substances into the candidate list. This goal was hardly achieved and therefore the European Commission initiated a roadmap of SVHC stating that until 2020, the candidate list should contain all relevant substances [28].|$|R

In addition, it includes exposure based triggering of testing. Waiving of testing {{is considered to be}} risk-based rather than exposure-based. One issue with risk-based waiving is that the toxicological study under discussion for waiving is sometimes needed in order to decide whether the exposure is negligible. In order to waive testing it is necessary with detailed and extensive knowledge on exposure over the whole life-cycle.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the multinational conventions, {{there are a number}} of other programs in Europe that consider persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) properties of chemicals. These criteria for PBTs are different from those used to classify POPs as they employ shorter half-lives, smaller bioconcentration factors, and do not consider long-range transport in the same way as for POPs. The Programs in the EU recently have been reviewed by Moermond et al. [1] who pointed out that there are significant inconsistencies in the criteria used for categorization of PBTs and that these inconsistencies extend to the procedures for management of risks from the PBTs. They also point out that these differences create a challenge to the harmonization of the assessment of substances that have the properties of <b>PBTs</b> and/or <b>vPvBs.</b> Some of categorization schemes, such as that used in Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) [5], make use of criteria that are followed by a weight-of-evidence analysis; while others, such as those for categorization of plant protection products (PPPs), base management decisions on basic PBT criteria only.|$|R

The outlined concerns related to short-chain PFASs, the already existing pollution, i.e., locally restricted very high pollutions (e.g., Rastatt and Uppsala) and global pollutions due to historical emissions, and very likely further increasing concentrations in the environment and biota illustrate that a fast regulation is mandatory. In accordance with the regulation of long-chain PFASs, {{the most effective way}} constitutes an SVHC identification of the short-chain PFAAs followed by a restriction, allowing also the regulation of precursors. The SVHC identification is not a prerequisite but will be advantageous, as the concerns attributed to short-chain PFASs do not comply with the “classical” concerns considered in the REACH Regulation and need to be clearly defined. In addition to a regulation by authorities, voluntary measures by industry could contribute substantially in reducing the emissions of short-chain PFASs.|$|R

However, none of the additives in these products was suspected of synergistic interaction, identified as candidate <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> substances [17], or listed in the Water Framework Directive as priority pollutant with an established EQS. Consequently, the necessity of including such additives in a CBA could not be experimentally verified in the present study. Hence, the only additives to be considered in the 21 products according to the draft guidance definition were a.s. from other PT (some preservatives at very low concentrations), solvents (on a case-by-case basis) and hazardous or dangerous additives that resulted in the product being classified as hazardous or dangerous. In the following, the predicted product toxicity based on the tentative categories will be compared to experimentally observed toxicity, taking also into account the SoC definition of the draft guidance as far as possible.|$|R

Two main policies that were changed by the PBT strategy were the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) which required more rigid chemical reporting and the New Chemical Program (NCP) under the Toxics Substances Control Act (TSCA) which required <b>screening</b> for <b>PBTs</b> and PBT properties.|$|R
30|$|Classification of a {{chemical}} as being persistent (P), bioaccumulative (B) and toxic (T) or very persistent (vP) and very bioaccumulative (vB) {{is an integral part}} of the chemical legislation in the European Union (EU). PBT/vPvB substances can give rise to specific concerns due to their potential to accumulate in parts of the environment, which is in practice difficult to reverse and the effects of such accumulation are unpredictable in the long-term [15]. Criteria for PBT/vPvB hazard assessment are laid down in the European regulation for industrial chemicals registered under REACH [23], biocidal products [25], plant protection products (PPP) [24], and veterinary medicines [21]. These criteria are identical across European regulatory frameworks but the consequences are quite different [36]. Guidance for PBT/vPvB assessment of industrial chemicals and biocidal products has been provided since 2003 in Technical Guidance Documents and their revisions [12, 13, 15, 17, 26]. Although chlorinated PPPs have been amongst the first acknowledged POPs (persistent organic pollutants), PBT/vPvB assessment of PPP was only introduced in 2009 with the new regulation EC 1107 / 2009 [24], but no guidance was provided on how to conduct a PBT/vPvB assessment [46]. A working document was issued by DG [10] which laid down the evidence needed to identify POP, <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> properties for PPPs.|$|R
30|$|Transformation {{products}} {{can be as}} or even more persistent than their parent compounds and thus must be included in chemical assessment. However, the regulatory frameworks for substances differ {{with respect to the}} inclusion of metabolites or transformation products in PBT identification. For PPPs, the consideration of metabolites in the context of PBT identification has been controversially discussed, as PPPs Regulation 1107 / 2009 [2] does not address this issue precisely and only refers to the relevance of metabolites in a general sense (Art. 3 (32) Annex II point 3.3). However, a current proposal envisages excluding metabolites in the process of PBT identification and in the identification of candidates for substitution (i.e. substances that meet two of the three criteria) [11]. REACH requires that registration documents for chemicals produced or imported in excess of 100  t/a include information about metabolites and transformation products [54]. They are to be considered in PBT identification if they exceed 0.1 % of the substance weight [9, 26]. For both human and veterinary medicinal products, transformation products > 10 % are considered to be ‘relevant’ and thus included in risk assessment as well as in PBT assessment. In the assessment of biocides, major metabolites (≥ 10 % or ≥ 5 % at two consecutive sampling points or maximum not reached but ≥ 5 % of the active substance at the final time point) are considered in PBT identification and minor metabolites only if data are available or there is any reason for concern. It is questionable whether relevance can be defined in terms of any percentage. Since humans and the environment should be protected from exposure to <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> substances, the same criteria should apply to metabolites or transformation products as to the parent compounds. We suggest that in all regulatory frameworks, metabolites and transformation products {{should be included in the}} assessment.|$|R
40|$|Safety Data Sheet (hereinafter SDS) is a {{document}} that provides a mechanism for transfer of adequate safety information on hazardous substances and mixtures. SDS allows users to undertake the necessary measures to protect human health and safety {{in the workplace and}} environment. SDS is defined by the REACH Regulation (1907 / 2006 /EC), Annex II. By the implementation of REACH for substances and mixtures which are dangerous to {{human health and the environment}} the SDS has become an extended document that contains the Exposure scenario. It is necessary to prepare Exposure scenario for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of more than 10 t/y that have <b>PBT</b> and/or <b>vPvB</b> properties or are classified into some other class of hazard in accordance with Art. 14 of the REACH Regulation. Exposure scenario is part of the Chemical Safety Report, within the Chemical safety assessment as a part of registration dossier. Classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures is carried out in accordance with the CLP Regulation (1272 / 2008 /EC). CLP Regulation follows the criteria for classification of chemicals given by the UN, the so-called Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). Regulation brings new classification criteria, hazard symbols (pictograms) and warning labels and statements H and P by replacing R and S phrases. Both of regulations have a major impact on the content of SDS, which has become larger and more complex document for its creator (manufacturer) and the end user. We believe that the industry should take some steps to create a compendious version of SDS, which will have practical application in everyday life and will be convenient to the storekeeper, carriers, end users of dangerous chemicals, i. e. for people who are in a direct contact with dangerous chemicals in order to protect themselves timely and adequately from undesirable effects...|$|R
30|$|Within Annex XIII of the REACH legislation, the {{identification}} of SVHC may also be justified on ‘weight-of-evidence’ information, i.e. results from monitoring in the field, from suitable laboratory experiments, or on elevated pollutant concentrations in organisms compared to concentrations in their environment, especially in endemic or endangered species. This goes along with the recommendations of ECHA who points out in Chapter R. 11 PBT Assessment of the Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment that remote areas and their ‘intrinsic value of pristine environments’ (p. 7) should be protected from adverse effects of chemical substances [2]. In addition, ‘borderline chemicals’ which fail {{at least one of}} the persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B) and toxicity (T) criteria but show an equivalent level of concern, e.g. by widespread distribution and long-range transport potential (LRTP), should be considered as SVHC within a PBT assessment. Nevertheless, the LRTP of an organic compound is not yet considered under REACH, although LRTP is also defined as a property of concern according to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) [3] in addition to persistence, bioaccumulation and adverse effects. Substances with LRTP cross international boundaries and may be transported via air, water [4] or with migrating animals to particularly sensitive ecosystems like the Arctic. This is of special interest when one substance fails or misses <b>PBT</b> or <b>vPvB</b> criteria slightly. Especially in these borderline cases, LRTP can be a significant property to indicate very high concern and support a prioritization of chemicals. Currently, the publicly available REACH database of end 2012 contains 5, 306 publishable compounds registered in the European Union and can be downloaded from the official homepage of the European Chemicals Agency [5]. ‘Publishable’ substances include all of the 5, 705 registered compounds except those where either the IUPAC name is claimed confidential according to REACH Article 119 (2) (f) or (g) or where there has been no dossier disseminated. For the remaining 5, 306 substances, at least one registration document has been processed and been published (in a filtered version) on the Dissemination Portal [5].|$|R
30|$|PBT/vPvB {{assessment}} became {{legally binding}} {{with the release}} of REACH [23], which laid down the persistence criteria from the TGD [26] plus a half-life in soil of 120  days, which is shorter than in the international agreements. Again, the relevant temperature (and other environmental conditions) for testing persistence was not defined in the regulation. In the first version of the Guidance in Information and Chemical Safety Assessment Chapter R. 11 [12], nothing is said on the relevant temperature for persistence testing. In version 2.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 11 [15], one sentence relates to temperature: “Please note that since its 32 nd meeting the Member State Committee has started to require new simulation degradation studies to be carried out around neutral pH values and at 12  °C, which is understood as the mean temperature of European surface waters”. The draft version 4.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 7 b Endpoint specific guidance [16] states that “New simulation studies should be conducted at environmentally relevant temperatures namely at 12  °C as this is seen as the average surface water temperature for the European Union (9  °C for sea water). If information on degradation half-life is already available from existing simulation degradation tests performed at a higher temperature, they should be normalised to a half-life corresponding to 12  °C by using the Arrhenius equation”. A generic activation energy of 65.4  kJ mol− 1 is proposed which has been derived by EFSA [19] (see below). The draft version 3.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 11 PBT/vPvB assessment [17] refers to this statement. Simulation degradation studies should be performed according to the OECD guidelines no. 307 for aerobic degradation in soil [37], no. 308 for anaerobic and aerobic transformation in water and sediment [38] and no. 309 for aerobic mineralisation in surface water [39]. However, Honti and Fenner [30] concluded that available OECD 308 data are insufficient to derive persistence indicators that had both acceptable robustness and uncertainty. Rauert et al. [42] proposed “…normalising DegT 50 values to 12  °C because this temperature is established or suggested under the majority of frameworks (i.e. Biocides Regulation, REACH and medicinal products Directives)”. However, the guidance for PBT/vPvB assessment is the same for the three mentioned frameworks. For PPP, DG [10] stated in its Working Document on “Evidence needed to identify POP, <b>PBT</b> and <b>vPvB</b> Properties for Pesticides”: “Laboratory studies: DT 50 values should be normalised to a temperature of 20  °C, as this is the current practice in recent assessments of soil degradation rates of active substances”. This Working Document has been applied for the initial establishment of the list of candidates for substitution [11] as required in Article 80 [7] of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 [24], i.e. half-lives at 20  °C have been considered when the list was compiled.|$|R

In this article, we evaluated the PBT properties of compounds reported to possess anti-fouling properties using QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) prediction programs such as BIOWIN™ (a biodegradation probability program), KOWWIN™ (log octanol-water partition coefficient calculation program) and ECOSAR™ (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship Programme). The analyses identified some small (Mr < 400) synthetic and natural products as potential candidates for environmentally benign biocides. We aim to demonstrate that while these methods of estimation have limitations, when applied with discretion, they are powerful tools useful in the early stages of research for compound selection for further development as anti-foulants...|$|R
