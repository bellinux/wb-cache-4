5|$|Despite the success, {{chairman}} Derek Pavis {{refused to}} spend money on transfers, and as a result fell out with Allardyce. Allardyce was eventually allowed to spend £50,000 on striker Kevin Rapley, who helped the club to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> relegation {{at the end of the}} 1998–99 campaign. In the summer he signed midfielder Craig Ramage and utility player Clayton Blackmore. Allardyce remained in charge at Meadow Lane until 14 October 1999, when he resigned his post at Notts County to return to Bolton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League games left {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, {{and the arrival of}} wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> the relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, John de la Pole married twice; {{his first}} {{marriage}} was annulled, but his second marriage, to Elizabeth of York, made him the brother-in-law of two kings, Edward IV and Richard III. It brought him eleven children, the eldest of whom, John, would eventually be named heir to Richard III in 1484 and die in battle in the Yorkist cause. John de la Pole, though, generally managed to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> involvement in the tumultuous events of the Wars of the Roses. Although he was politically aligned to the House of York, {{by virtue of his}} marriage, he avoided participating in the battles of the 1450s, not taking up arms until Edward IV had claimed the throne. De la Pole appears to have spent much of this period, in fact, feuding with his East Anglian neighbours, the Paston family over an inheritance—even interfering in parliamentary elections, for example, in attempt to gain the upper hand.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 5,000 RAF airmen {{prepared}} {{to take part in}} 817 heavy bombers which were fueled and armed in the evening. A trigger plan was prepared, which would act as a feint but, this night, Bomber Command amended the feint which was partially compromised by weather conditions. Restrictions on the flight path of the bombers was also changed. Bomber streams were permitted to fly over Ingoldmells Point to Filey; but not over coastal areas where no ground defences were stationed. The route took them downstream to southern England by Reading, and across the English Channel, as the trigger plan required. However, they were then ordered to turn back toward the North Sea. The reason behind this was the low-lying cloud which was ever-present over the continent that night. The clouds made it difficult for pilots to see and <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> zones heavily guarded by Allied ground defences near to the frontline. The possibility of losing aircraft to Friendly fire was too great.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the late}} 19th century, the British East India Company was {{interested}} only in trading, and tried {{as much as possible}} to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> Malay politics. However, Siam's influence in the northern Malay states, especially Kedah, Terengganu, Kelantan and Pattani, was preventing the Company from trading in peace. Therefore, in 1826, the British, through the Company, signed a secret treaty known today as the Burney Treaty with the King of Siam. The four Malay states were not present during the signing of the agreement. In that treaty, British acknowledged Siamese sovereignty over all those states. In return, Siam accepted British ownership of Penang and Province Wellesley and allowed the Company to trade in Terengganu and Kelantan unimpeded.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{the arrival}} of Channel 4, and its edgy new soap opera Brookside, {{was one of the}} biggest changes for Coronation Street. Unlike Coronation Street, which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, Brookside brought {{together}} working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in Coronation Street were largely about family affairs, Brookside concentrated on social affairs such as industrial action, unemployment, and the black market. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, EastEnders in 1985. Like Brookside, EastEnders had a more gritty premise than Coronation Street, although unlike Brookside it tended to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> blue language and politicised stories.|$|E

With the gradual extension into northern Somalia of Italian colonial rule, both Kingdoms were eventually annexed in the early 20th century. However, unlike the southern territories, the northern sultanates were not subject to direct rule due to the earlier treaties they had signed with the Italians.|$|E

25|$|Governor General the Viscount Monck had {{originally}} {{pushed for a}} distinct Canadian order of knighthood in 1867, {{to be called the}} Order of St. Lawrence. The idea was revived by Vincent Massey in 1935 and again in 1951, in between which he also suggested in 1940 a Royal Order of Canada. The Canadian Cabinet, however, never accepted these proposals, generally wishing instead to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> the controversial topic of orders. Still, the beginnings of a distinct Canadian honours system came in March 1934, with the creation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal by royal warrant of King George V, issued on the advice of the Cabinet of R. B. Bennett; {{this was the first time}} an honour specific to Canada and for service in Canada had been established by the monarch of Canada (as opposed to earlier campaign and service medals that had been issued to Canadians and British personnel alike by the British monarch). There was uncertainty amongst officials in Canada and Britain alike around how to go about creating such an honour, and delays were incurred not only as Canadian bureaucrats interpreted the Nickle Resolution as applying to medals, but also because the King himself was widening the project to consider all the Commonwealth and Empire police forces.|$|E
