40|$|The Australian {{government}} {{has introduced a}} policy to replace all inefficient incandescent lamps with energy saving compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> by 2010. However, unlike incandescence <b>lamps,</b> compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> do not draw sinusoidal currents at almost unity power factor. Therefore, implementation of this policy may introduce serious power quality problems for the power supply authorities. This paper investigates the impact of current harmonics generated {{by a number of}} different types of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> commonly available in Australia, {{on the quality of the}} conventional supply. Experimental results are presented to show a comparison of the actual energy consumption, power factor, costs, Lumen levels and current harmonics of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and incandescent lamps. These results show that the power quality and the amount of light output from compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> do not depend on the cost of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> Simulation results are presented using the experimental data to determine the impact of large influx of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> on the third harmonic component present neutral current.

40|$|Comparison {{was made}} between the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> and the {{incandescent}} lamp basing on qualitative experiments, and the following conclusion was reached. (1) In incandescent lamps when the reflection factor {{of the color of}} reflector is smaller, intensity of illumination will be so much the lower. The same tendency is seen with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> but the effect is generally smaller as compared with incandescent lamps. Furthermore, when the color of reflector belongs to the same color group as the dominant wave-length of the light-source, intensity of illumination will be stronger. In case it is of the complementary hue or of the same color group, illumination comes out weaker. (2) When various artificial light-sources are mutually compared by the quantities of filtered radiation, it is found that the light of daylight and white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> resembles most closely the daylight in cloudy weather. In incandescent lamps, the zone of long wave-length is in excess, while the blue and violet zones can hardly be seen. (3) Even among the persons with normal sense of color, a high percentage of misreading and hard-reading of Stilling's Charts occurs under the illumination by an incandescent lamp, whereas under that of a white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> the percentage is extremely lower. (4) As the color rendition of various light·sources are examined from the viewpoint of the "difference of color", de luxe daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> is most superior. Next comes de luxe white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> and it further worsens in the order of the daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> <b>fluorescent</b> filament <b>lamp,</b> and daylight lamp. Ordinary electric lamps are markedly inferior. However, daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are entirely the reverse of ordinary electric lamps in their status of the "difference of color".

50|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are used}} for UV curing {{in a number of}} applications. In particular, these are used where the {{excessive}} heat of mercury vapor is undesirable, or when an item needs more than a single source of light and instead the item needs to be surrounded by light, such as musical instruments. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> can be created that produce ultraviolet anywhere within the UVA/UVB spectrum. Additionally, lamps that have multiple peaks are possible, allowing a wider variety of photoinitiators to be used. While <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are less efficient at producing UV than mercury vapor, newer initiators require less total energy, offsetting this disadvantage. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> {{in a wide variety of}} sizes and wattages are available.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to clarify the effect of spectral power distribution of different <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and luminance levels on the human brightness perception in a building interior. The following psychological tests were conducted. The perception of room brightness over photopic luminance ranging from 100 cd/m^ 2 to 300 cd/m^ 2 was measured for 20 subjects using a pair of experimental chambers. The daylight, warm white, incandescent colour 3 band-type, white, 3 band-type and daylight 3 band-type <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> were used as lighting sources. Each <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> has different S/P ratio (scotopic lumince / photopic luminance). One experimental chamber was lit by daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and the other chamber was lit by one of the other five <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> After the subjects judged the brighter room, they were requested to adjust luminace level in one chamber to get equal brightness with the other. Ratios of luminance by the compared lamp to that by the daylight lamp were calculated. The following results were obtained: the subjects judge of that the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> with high S/P ratio is brighter than the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> with low S/P ratio. The differences of brightness perception between daylight flourescent lamp and the other lamps decreases with a rise in luminance level. It became clear with regression analysis that not only photopic luminance but also scotopic luminace contributes to perceped brightness in according to luminace levels. Both of scotopic and photopic luminance is required to account perceived brightness in interiors...|$|R
