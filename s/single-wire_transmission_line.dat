40|$|Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} (EMC) investigations often {{involve the}} assessment of whether signal integrity (SI) and radiated susceptibility (RS) in <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> comply with design margins and/or maximum levels provided by EMC regulations. Hence, worst-case analysis is a useful tool to flag potential problems in the early design stage. This paper presents a novel paradigm for the worst-case SI/RS analysis of <b>single-wire</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> The method {{is based on the}} theoretical framework of Taylor arithmetic, which represents each variable as a Taylor expansion, function of the selected design parameter, complemented by an interval remainder that encompasses all approximation and round-off errors in a conservative way. A suitable modification of the basic algebraic and nonlinear operations allows propagating this representation from the input design parameter to the desired outputs. The methodology is applied to the SI analysis of a coaxial cable with uncertain shield radius, and to the RS assessment of a wire illuminated by an impinging plane wave with uncertain polarization...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the bandwidth shortcomings of conventional inductive coupling biotelemetry systems for implantable devices, and presents two approaches toward an end-to-end biotelemetry system {{for reducing the}} power consumption of implanted devices at increased levels of bandwidth. By leveraging the transition zone between the near and far field, scattering in the near field at UHF frequencies for increased bandwidth at low power budgets can be employed. Additionally, taking advantage of surface wave propagation permits the use of single-wire RF transmission lines in biological tissue, offering more efficient signal routing over near field coupling resulting in controlled implant depth at low power budgets. Due to the dielectric properties of biological tissue, and the necessity {{to operate in the}} radiating near field to communicate via scattered fields, the implant depth drives the carrier frequency. The information bandwidth supplied by each sensing electrode in conventional implants also drives the operating frequency and regime. At typical implant depths, frequencies in the UHF range permit operation in the radiating near field as well as sufficient bandwidth. Backscatter modulation provides a low-power, high-bandwidth alternative to conventional low frequency inductive coupling. A prototype active implantable device presented in this thesis is capable of transmitting data at 30 Mbps over a 915 MHz link while immersed in saline, at a communication efficiency of 16. 4 pJ/bit. A prototype passive device presented in this thesis is capable of operating battery-free, fully immersed in saline, while transmitting data at 5 Mbps and consuming 1. 23 mW. This prototype accurately demodulates neural data while immersed in saline at a distance of 2 cm. This communication distance is extended at similar power budgets by exploiting surface wave propagation along a <b>single-wire</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> Theoretical models of single-wire RF transmission lines embedded in high permittivity and conductivity dielectrics are validated by measurements. A <b>single-wire</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> of radius 152. 4 um exhibits a loss of 1 dB/cm at 915 MHz in saline, and extends the implant depth to 6 cm while staying within SAR limits. This work opens the door for implantable biotelemetry systems to handle the vast amount of data generated by modern sensing devices, potentially offering new insight into neurological diseases, and may aid in the development of BMI's.

The length is 91  mm, which is <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> with the ground layer of silver paste. Although the <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> for the ground layer of copper tape and silver paste were fabricated with different length, however the loss was measured and calculated per unit length to compare the proposed <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> Figure  4 c shows the RF performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> with ground layer using the copper tape and silver paste.
