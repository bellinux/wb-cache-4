5000|$|By placing {{limits on}} the number of packets that can be {{transmitted}} or received at any given time, a sliding window protocol allows an unlimited number of packets to be communicated using fixed-size sequence numbers.The term [...] "window" [...] on the transmitter side represents the logical boundary {{of the total number of}} packets yet to be acknowledged by the receiver. The receiver informs the transmitter in each acknowledgment packet the current maximum receiver buffer size (window boundary). The TCP header uses a 16 bit field to report the receive window size to the sender. Therefore, the largest window that can be used is 216 = 64 kilobytes. In slow-start mode, the transmitter starts with low packet count and increases the number of packets in each transmission after receiving acknowledgment packets from receiver. For every ack packet received, the window slides by one packet (logically) to transmit one new packet. When the window threshold is reached, the transmitter sends one packet for one ack packet received. If the window limit is 10 packets then in slow <b>start</b> <b>mode</b> the transmitter may start transmitting one packet followed by two packets (before transmitting two packets, one packet ack has to be received), followed by three packets and so on until 10 packets. But after reaching 10 packets, further transmissions are restricted to one packet transmitted for one ack packet received. In a simulation this appears as if the window is moving by one packet distance for every ack packet received. On the receiver side also the window moves one packet for every packet received. The sliding window method ensures that traffic congestion on the network is avoided. The application layer will still be offering data for transmission to TCP without worrying about the network traffic congestion issues as the TCP on sender and receiver side implement sliding windows of packet buffer. The window size may vary dynamically depending on network traffic.|$|E

Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were dry and sunny with an air temperature of 25 C and a track temperature ranging from 37 to 42 C.

Pérez accelerated faster than Alonso off the line and was ahead of him before the Spanish driver retook the position around the outside at Curva Grande corner.Vettel made a good start, moving up to fifth by the end of the first lap but his teammate Ricciardo was forced wide onto the chicane's run-off area, dropping four positions over the same distance. Massa attempted to take over second place from Magnussen by braking later than he did at the start of lap two while Rosberg pulled away from the two drivers. Magnssen went wide at Curva Grande corner and fended off another overtaking manoeuvre from Massa. DRS was enabled on the next lap and Hamilton used it to attack Massa, allowing Magnussen to pull away from the Williams car. After starting 21st, Kvyat passed both Marussia drivers and Kobayashi to run in 17th. Magnussen continued to defend but in doing so he ran deep entering the Rettifilo chicane, causing Massa to slipstream the McLaren driving towards the Variante della Roggia chicane and overtook him around the outside to claim second. Magnussen entered the turn off the racing line, spun his tyres leaving the corner, enabling Hamilton to gain the advantage by accelerating faster than the McLaren driver and passed him for third going into the first Lesmo corner. Massa and Hamilton pulled away from Magnussen who was being caught by a group of cars compromising of Vettel, Button, Alonso and Pérez.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Development of {{mathematical}} model for calculation of <b>starting</b> <b>modes</b> of asynchronous motor connected {{in series with}} capacitors. Method. Mathematical modeling of dynamic modes of asynchronous motors with lateral capacitor compensation of reactive power. Results. The calculation algorithm and results of mathematic modeling of processes during <b>starting</b> <b>modes</b> of asynchronous motor feeding from the network through capacitors connected in series are presented.

The calculation algorithm is based on the mathematical model of asynchronous motor with high level of adequacy, which takes into account the magnetic core saturation and the current displacement in limbs of the rotor.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, Huang et al. (2012) employed a spinning disc apparatus to study deposition of fats on cooled stainless steel surfaces using model solutions of tripalmitin in non-crystallising paraffin. The apparatus was modified {{to give more}} accurate estimation of the test surface temperature, allowing the surface temperature and shear stress to be manipulated independently. The effect of different <b>starting</b> <b>modes,</b> simulating various situations which arise in pipelines, was studied. When fouling is induced by a step change in the test surface temperature, {{the presence of a}} subcooled surface promotes the rapid formation, initially, of a gel layer, followed by a period of linear fouling, and eventually falling rate fouling behaviour. When fouling is driven by a change in concentration the initial gel formation step is absent. The linear fouling regime was relatively insensitive to temperature, shear stress and <b>starting</b> <b>mode</b> for the conditions studied here. In the falling rate regime, the rate was determined by the deposit/solution interface temperature, following normal growth kinetics. At low tripalmitin concentrations, of 2. 5 wt. %, sigmoidal growth behaviour was observed, which is attributed to the wall shear stress being initially high enough to disrupt the gel. As time proceeded, the gel increased in strength and was able to grow as before...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper tackles the {{automatic}} matching of job seekers and recruiters, {{based on the}} logs of a recruitment agency (CVs, job announcements and application clicks). Preliminary experiments reveal that good recommendation performances in collaborative filtering mode (emitting recommendations for a known recruiter using the click history) co-exist with poor performances in cold <b>start</b> <b>mode</b> (emitting recommendations based on the job announcement only). A tentative interpretation for these results is proposed, claiming that job seekers and recruiters − whose mother tongue is French − yet do not speak the same language.

40|$|Governmental {{policies}} on renewable {{energy and environmental}} act are aggressively being enforced to mitigate recent climate change. Natural gas is not renewable {{but it is the}} most abundant and has the lowest Lifecycle CO 2 emission among fossil fuel. Realizing such promising alternative, many logistics and transportation companies are converting their existing diesel-fueled vehicle to CNG-fueled. Researchers have shown that CNG engines offer advantages compared to diesel and gasoline engines such as high efficiency and low emissions. Prior to this work, a 4. 3 L 4 - cylinder diesel engine was modified and retrofitted with a CNG mono gas system. However, it was observed that the engine, CNG-fueled combustion is not stable especially at idling speed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to optimize the ignition timing best suited for idling both in normal operating mode (700 - 850 rpm) and in cold <b>start</b> <b>mode</b> (1000 - 2000 rpm). The ignition timings tested were 20 oBTDC and 25 oBTDC. The measurements were made at engine speeds from 700 to 2500 rpm. Some irregularities were found in the result, but overall, the ignition timing 25 oBTDC is better than 20 oBTDC in terms of fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions. For this particular system, the results recommend that the idling engine speed should be at 700 - 800 rpm and 1500 rpm during the normal mode and cold <b>start</b> <b>mode</b> respectively. The use of engine speed of 1000 to 1300 rpm should be minimized to reduce overall exhaust gas emissions...|$|E

40|$|Reliable {{determination}} of integer ambiguities {{is a critical}} issue in high-precision global positioning system (GPS) applications such as kinematic positioning, fast control surveying and attitude determination. This paper discusses the integer ambiguity resolution procedures in attitude determination using single frequency carrier phase measurements. An optimised ambiguity search algorithm is proposed. This method can not only improve the computation efficiency and reduce the time for resolving ambiguities, but also improve {{the reliability of the}} ambiguity solution. The ambiguity search space is determined using float solutions and their variance and covariance matrices estimated by applying Kalman filter algorithm.
