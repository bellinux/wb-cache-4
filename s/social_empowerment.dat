5|$|In early 2014, {{as part of}} an {{incentive}} to close unlicensed buildings in the regency, police posted notification that the Kampoeng Rawa site was unlicensed. The manager of Kampoeng Rawa, Agus Sumarno, stated that they had tried to gain permission for their buildings, but both the provincial and regional governments had stated that they were unable to issue it. When the police banner later disappeared, there were reports that the site's management had taken it down, although the management stated that it had fallen under a hard wind. The head of the Semarang Regency Council, Bambang Kusriyanto, stated that he had confirmed Kampoeng Rawa's management had applied for permission and called for the government to process the request expediently. In February 2015, President Joko Widodo called for the issuance of permits to be expedited, citing the site's potential to promote <b>social</b> <b>empowerment.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Youth {{empowerment}} examines six interdependent dimensions: psychological, community, organizational, economic, {{social and}} cultural. [...] Psychological empowerment enhances individual's consciousness, belief in self-efficacy, awareness {{and knowledge of}} problems and solutions and of how individuals can address problems that harm their quality of life. This dimension aims to create self-confidence and give youth the skills to acquire knowledge. Community empowerment focuses on enhancing the community through leadership development, improving communication, and creating a network of support to mobilize the community to address concerns. Organizational empowerment aims to create a base of resources for a community, including voluntary organizations, unions and association that aim to protect, promote and advocate for the powerless. Economic empowerment teaches entrepreneurial skills, how to take ownership of their assets and how to have income security. <b>Social</b> <b>empowerment</b> teaches youth about social inclusion and literacy as well as helping kids find the resources to be proactive in their communities. Cultural empowerment aims to recreate cultural practices and redefine cultural rules and norms for youth. Through these dimensions of empowerment, programs can work on empowering youth {{in one or more}} aspects of their lives.|$|E

It is the {{centerpiece}} of the Berg Water Project (BWP) which is designed to capture the winter rainfall and store it for supply to Cape Town during the dry summer months. The project in turn forms {{an important part of the}} Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS), an intricate system of dams and bulk water infrastructure that provides water to more than 3 million people. At the inauguration of the dam in 2009, then President of South Africa Kgalema Motlanthe called the project [...] "a good example of how public infrastructure projects can be used to contribute meaningfully to poverty eradication and to foster <b>social</b> <b>empowerment</b> of the people." [...] The Berg River Dam was the first dam in South Africa to be designed and constructed, and is due to be operated, in accordance with the guidelines of the World Commission on Dams. It has been completed on time and within budget. The Berg River basin and the adjacent metropolitan area of Cape Town are of particular importance to the Western Cape region because, although the basin generates only about 3% of the country's water resources, it is home to about 8% of South Africa's population, and produces about 12% of GDP.|$|E
