5|$|Insurance {{coverage}} helps <b>save</b> <b>lives,</b> {{by encouraging}} {{early detection and}} prevention of dangerous medical conditions. According to a 2014 study, the ACA likely prevented an estimated 50,000 preventable patient deaths from 2010 to 2013. City University public health professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler wrote in January 2017 that a rollback of the ACA's Medicaid expansion alone would cause an estimated 43,956 deaths annually.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to <b>save</b> <b>lives.</b> Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E
5|$|On the Droits de l'Homme, many {{survivors}} {{were too}} weak to reach the boats, {{and a number of}} men fell from the hull and drowned in the attempt. Many more could not find room in the small boats, and only 150 men were rescued on 17January. The following morning, when the boats returned, they found only 140survivors left, at least as many again having died during the night. The last two people to leave the ship were the commanders General Humbert and Commodore Lacrosse. Taken to Brest, the survivors were fed and clothed and given medical treatment. All the surviving prisoners from the Cumberland were released and returned to Britain, in recognition of their efforts to <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> from the shipwreck.|$|E

From 1995 to 2009, he held the title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years, and held it consistently from 2014–July 2017, with an estimated net worth of US$89.9billion as of October 2017. However, on July 27, 2017, and since October 27, 2017, he has been surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who has an estimated net worth of US$93.9billion. In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy. The foundation works to <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.|$|E

25|$|In 1881, as {{a result}} of losses in the First Boer War, a Parliamentary Commission sought to equip the army with khaki uniform.

25|$|Still more pacifists {{would argue}} that a nonviolent {{reaction}} may not <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> immediately but would in the long run.

It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.|$|E

25|$|A tsunami {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} predicted, {{even if the}} magnitude and location of an earthquake is known. Geologists, oceanographers, and seismologists analyse each earthquake and based on many factors {{may or may not}} issue a tsunami warning. However, there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami, and automated systems can provide warnings immediately after an earthquake in time to <b>save</b> <b>lives.</b> One of the most successful systems uses bottom pressure sensors, attached to buoys, which constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 1848, a {{crowd of}} revolutionaries moved to the Quirinal and the Parliament {{to present to the}} Pope their demands, {{especially}} war against Austria. The Pope reportedly replied, his dignity as head of state and of the Church does not permit him to fulfil conditions of rebels. Following this, the Quirinal was covered by cannon fire, which caused several deaths. After that, to <b>save</b> <b>lives,</b> the Pope agreed to a list of proposed ministers, although stating that he would abstain from any cooperation with them.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{case for}} a {{coordination}} game is choosing {{the sides of the}} road upon which to drive, a social standard which can <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> if it is widely adhered to. In a simplified example, assume that two drivers meet on a narrow dirt road. Both have to swerve in order to avoid a head-on collision. If both execute the same swerving maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide. In the payoff matrix in Fig. 2, successful passing is represented by a payoff of 10, and a collision by a payoff of 0.|$|E

25|$|Today, the Senate sent {{a strong}} {{signal to the}} terrorists that we will {{continue}} using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and to prevent attacks on America. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that {{has been one of}} America's most potent tools in fighting the War on Terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country. Information we have learned from the program has helped <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of military commissions, the Act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.|$|E
25|$|The figures do {{not include}} the cost of {{operating}} military resources deployed to provide aid, and it is unclear how this should be quantified. While some would argue that military resources are already paid for and that the relief effort can be regarded as a logistics training exercise, the increased operational costs are an unbudgeted expenditure. Others would argue that the military resources provide the only infrastructure that will deliver aid in a timely manner to <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> to the hardest hit and neediest areas, and without this quickly deployable infrastructure the other contributions, no matter how large would be useless or arrive too late.|$|E

25|$|GIS {{offers a}} {{superior}} method for landslide analysis {{because it allows}} one to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, and display large amounts of data quickly and effectively. Because so many variables are involved, {{it is important to}} be able to overlay the many layers of data to develop a full and accurate portrayal of what is taking place on the Earth's surface. Researchers need to know which variables are the most important factors that trigger landslides in any given location. Using GIS, extremely detailed maps can be generated to show past events and likely future events which have the potential to <b>save</b> <b>lives,</b> property, and money.|$|E
25|$|Haig gave Foch {{the same}} advice at the Senlis Conference (25 October) – he was privately {{suspicious}} of French plans {{to occupy the}} Rhineland, writing to his wife (1 November) that {{the peace of the}} world for the next fifty years depended on not driving Germany to seek future revenge by humiliating her. He would later (e.g. in June 1919) defend the decision to <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> and money by offering Germany an armistice once she was clearly beaten, although with hindsight this allowed the myth to grow up that Germany had not really been defeated. The Allies agreed to offer peace {{on the basis of the}} Fourteen Points with a British opt-out for Point 2 (Freedom of the Seas).|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} years of World War II, Rabbi Elya Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz were in the United States on a fund raising mission. As the war broke out, their only option to ensure the {{longevity}} of the Yeshiva was to transfer the whole yeshiva to American soil. In October 1940, a group of students led by Rabbi Chaim Stein escaped from war-ravaged Lithuania as it was overrun by the Nazis. This daring flight took place on the Sabbath. While travel is ordinarily prohibited on the Sabbath, one must transgress this prohibition in order to <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> and escape great peril. The original faculty, their families and most of the student body who chose to be left behind in Europe, were killed in Lithuania by Nazi forces and Lithuanian collaborators.|$|E
