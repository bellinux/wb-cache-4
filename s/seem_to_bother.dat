5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He {{had hoped to}} write his thesis {{under the supervision of}} Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E
25|$|Leicestershire {{prevailed in}} a match at Old Trafford where 726 runs were scored in four {{completed}} innings and Leicestershire's young bowler Stuart Broad and captain HD Ackerman starred. Leicestershire chose to bat {{after winning the}} toss, and were taken apart by Glen Chapple and Murali Kartik, who shared nine wickets, while the highest partnership for Leicestershire was worth 53. The lack of veteran bowler Dominic Cork did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> Lancashire unduly, as Chapple got five wickets for 22 runs and Kartik four for 43. Only Jon Maunders and HD Ackerman passed 20 for the visitors, {{and they were all}} out for 165. Lancashire accumulated runs slowly, and their score was 61 for 2 at the close of play on the first day. With Mal Loye out with an injury, Lancashire posted 191, Maunders taking four for 28 and Stuart Broad three for 57 to limit Lancashire's lead to 26 runs. An opening partnership of 63 saw Leicestershire take the lead, but spinners Murali Kartik and Andrew Symonds took two wickets each, while the three seamers Chapple, Sajid Mahmood and Anderson took one each to round off the day. Ackerman was left overnight on 37 - 11 short of the highest score in the match so far.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{both girls}} decided to {{concentrate}} on beach volleyball full-time, working on improving their skills {{more and more and}} also getting more experience. The first tournament of the season was an Eredivisie event in Kijkduin where they finished 2nd. On international level they started participating in higher quality tournaments like the European Championship Tour. In Hamburg they reached the 13th position. In the same weekend they travalled to Assen in their home country and in addition they won the TopTeams Cup Assen. In another 6 Eredivisie tournaments they reached one 1st place, four 2nd positions and a 3rd position, before heading to Marseille to play in a FIVB World Tour event. They reached the 41st position on the highest possible level. At the European Championship Tour event in Valencia they finished in 21st position. August 2006 {{turned out to be a}} good month for Van Iersel/Wesselink. First they travelled to South Korea to participate in an exhibition tournament where they finished 5th. A 4th position was reached a few days later in Austria during the European Championships under 23, while they had the ages of 18 and 19. The following weekend they took part in the Dutch national Championships in Scheveningen finishing 4th again, behind the three top Dutch teams for many years. With these results in mind they travelled to Poland to play the World Championships under 21 in Mysłowice. Again they faced opponents quite older than they were themselves, but this didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> them much and they won the bronze medal. In the semi finals they lost from the eventual champions, while they had beaten the same team in the group stage earlier in the tournament. In addition they stayed in Poland to play the Warsaw FIVB World Tour event, finishing 33rd.|$|E

60|$|And so it {{was that}} Lop-Ear became a {{bachelor}} once more. That night I slept with him in the old cave, and our old life of chumming began again.

It was the wound in his leg that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him, and it was all of a week before he got back again to his old spryness.|$|R
2500|$|Beavis' {{family is}} {{occasionally}} mentioned but {{has never been}} seen in the show in person. An example is when Beavis states: [...] "My mom's a slut... meh heh heh." [...] According to discussion during some music video segments, Beavis' mother shares her son's peculiar hairstyle, is somewhat obese, and (most significantly) is an ignorant slut. While Beavis is conscious of his mother's promiscuity, it doesn’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him much, as he often laughs along in agreement whenever Butt-Head brings it up (in fact, when Butt-Head refers to Beavis' [...] mom as a whore, Beavis nonchalantly says [...] "She's not a whore, she's a slut, she doesn't charge for it"). The irony, however, is lost on Butt-Head, whose own mother's promiscuity is implied in Beavis and Butt-Head Do America.|$|E
2500|$|The river {{above and}} below Black Eagle Dam is used for fishing. Westslope {{cutthroat}} trout were first identified at Black Eagle Falls by Lewis and Clark in 1805, and the fish still are plentiful in the area. Rainbow trout are also plentiful upstream from the dam. The area below Black Eagle Falls has been rated by one guide as a good area for fly fishing smallmouth bass and walleye. For many years, the state of Montana managed the Long Pool reservoir as part of one fishing management area, and the river below the dam as part of another. This was changed in 1999, so that the two are now managed together. The change also instituted a new limit on trout caught and killed below the dam of five fish per day (only one {{of which could be}} over [...] ). Limits on the number of walleye caught per day were lifted in 2010 to protect the rainbow and brown trout populations (they had been five daily and 10 in possession). According to dam officials, there are no screens to prevent fish from going over the dam or through the penstocks and turbines. Fish [...] "go right through the turbines, it doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> them," [...] dam operators say.|$|E

[...] However, none of that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> the narrator as his {{focus is on the}} mayor's daughter, Coleen.

2500|$|Henry J. Wood {{performed}} the E minor organ concerto of Ebenezer Prout at the Hall with an orchestra under Joseph Barnby, {{in the late}} 1880s. Although the performance earned him much praise, {{he referred to the}} instrument as 'that terrible box of whistles at St. James's Hall'. [...] This had not <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> Camille Saint-Saëns when he premiered his third Symphony there (in which two sections make extensive use of the organ) in 1886. Saint-Saëns was a fine organist, and was titulaire of Église de la Madeleine in Paris. [...] If he had any objections to the organ of St. James Hall for the premier of his symphony, they do not appear in his writings.|$|R

The Indian came at him with the knife again, but he did not try to defend himself. Instead, he went on towards Bella, with the Indian still hanging to him and hacking at him. The Indian <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> and irritate him, and he shoved him away. He knelt down and turned Bella's face up to the light; but his own face was covered with blood and he could not see. So he stopped long enough to brush the blood from his eyes. He appeared to look in order to make sure. Then he put the revolver to her breast and fired.|$|R
