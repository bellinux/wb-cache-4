40|$|Early {{studies on}} the cardioprotective effects of high doses (up to 20 g of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, EPA and DHA, per day) of omega- 3 fatty acids (FAs) {{suggested}} that these FAs primarily lowered triglyceride levels. These <b>supraphysiological</b> <b>intake</b> studies soon gave way to trials using lower and lower intakes of omega- 3 FAs such {{that it is now}} clear that up to 45 % lowering of serum triglyceride levels can be achieved with 3 â€“ 4 g of EPA+DHA. This is an intake that can hardly be achieved by dietary means; direct supplementation is required. This is a public health challenge since implementing wide-scale supplementation programmes would be difficult. Relatively few investigators have examined the effects of low (< 2 g) EPA+DHA on serum lipid profiles, presumably because until recently there was little expectation that an...|$|E
