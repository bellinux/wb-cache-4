5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E
25|$|Sachin rested {{himself for}} the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the <b>subsequent</b> <b>Test</b> series. He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, Giardia {{was found}} in the water supply for parts of Oslo, {{prompting}} authorities to advise the public to boil drinking water; but <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> showed levels of contamination too low to pose a threat, so this advice has since been cancelled.|$|E

25|$|A <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> for the {{presence}} of PCP in Rodney King's body {{at the time of the}} arrest was negative. The incident was captured on a camcorder by local resident George Holliday from his apartment in the vicinity. The tape was roughly 12 minutes long. While the tape was presented during trial, some clips of the incident were not released to the public.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>subsequent</b> <b>Test</b> {{series against}} Bangladesh, Tendulkar {{returned}} to his opening slot and {{was chosen as the}} Man of the Series. He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs. He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people who}} have been {{infected}} with TB may have a negative reaction when tested years after infection, as the immune system response may gradually wane. This initial skin test, though negative, may stimulate (boost) the body's ability to react to tuberculin in future tests. Thus, a positive reaction to a <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> may be misinterpreted as a new infection, when in fact it {{is the result of the}} boosted reaction to an old infection.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{factors that}} {{influence}} a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not include: cost of the test, availability of additional tests, potential interference with <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> (such as an abdominal palpation potentially inducing intestinal activity whose sounds interfere with a subsequent abdominal auscultation), time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. Also, even if not beneficial for the individual being tested, the results may be useful {{for the establishment of}} statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals.|$|E
25|$|The G.I prototype, {{powered by}} 485kW (650hp) Hispano-Suiza 14AB-02/03 engines, had its first flight at Welschap Airfield, near Eindhoven on 16 March 1937 with Karel Mares at the controls. Later, Emil Meinecke took {{over much of}} the test flights. The maiden flight went well, but a <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> flight in September 1937 ended with a {{supercharger}} explosion that nearly caused the loss of the prototype. The accident prompted a replacement of the Hispano-Suiza engines with 559kW (750hp) Pratt & Whitney SB4-G Twin Wasp Junior engines.|$|E

25|$|ICC {{upheld the}} ban on Sehwag for the <b>subsequent</b> <b>Test,</b> but {{overturned}} the bans on Tendulkar and Ganguly. The subsequent England tour to India was placed in jeopardy when India picked Sehwag in the Test squad. Subsequent to this development, the ICC issued a warning that any Test match with Sehwag in the Indian team would not be considered an official Test until Sehwag served his ban. After negotiations with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the ICC, and in the general interest of cricket, Sehwag was dropped from the team for the first Test against England.|$|E
25|$|The {{first real}} flight was {{performed}} in September 1944 at the Erprobungsstelle Rechlin, the Reichenberg being dropped from a He 111. However, it subsequently crashed after the pilot lost control when he accidentally jettisoned the canopy. A second flight the next day also ended in a crash, and <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> flights were carried out by test pilots Heinz Kensche and Hanna Reitsch. Reitsch herself experienced several crashes from which she survived unscathed. On 5 November 1944 during the second test flight of the R-III, a wing fell off due to vibrations and Heinz Kensche managed to parachute to safety, albeit with some difficulty due to the cramped cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Also during 1965 through 1968, Dr. Albert M. Kligman was {{contracted}} by the Dow Chemical Company {{to perform}} threshold tests for TCDD on inmates at Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia after Dow studies revealed {{adverse effects on}} workers at Dow's Midland, Michigan plant were likely due to TCDD. A <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> by Dow in rabbit ear models when exposed to 4–8μg usually caused a severe response. The human studies carried out in Holmesburg failed to follow Dow's original protocol and lacked proper informed consent by the participants. As a result of poor study design and subsequent destruction of records, the tests were virtually worthless even though ten inmates were exposed to 7,500μg of TCDD.|$|E

50|$|The engine first ran on 28 October 2005 using a {{water brake}} as the load. During <b>subsequent</b> <b>testing,</b> the engine reached full power. On 28 February 2006 {{the engine was}} tested {{for the first time}} with the {{propeller}} installed.|$|R
25|$|The B6N1's Mamori 11 {{engine was}} found prone to severe {{vibrations}} and overheating at certain speeds {{and was at}} first judged too unreliable (an important consideration given that the plane was expected to fly long distances over open water). Following a series of modifications, though, the engine's performance was finally deemed promising enough that carrier acceptance trials were begun {{at the end of}} 1942. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>test</b> flights conducted aboard the carriers Ryuho and Zuikaku indicated the need to strengthen the tail hook mounting on the plane's fuselage. Some attempts were also made to use RATOG (rocket-assisted take-off gear) units on several B6N1s in order to qualify the aircraft for use on smaller carriers but the results were unsatisfactory.|$|E
25|$|The <b>subsequent</b> <b>Test</b> and ODI series {{involving}} Sri Lanka were {{overshadowed by}} a series of spiteful clashes. The Tests were won 3–0 by the Australians with heavy margins of an innings, ten wickets and 148 runs respectively. Taylor's highlight being a 96 in the First Test at Perth as he compiled 159 runs at 39.75. He also made his 100th Test catch during the series. After accusations of ball tampering were levelled against the tourists in the First Test, leading spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was no-balled seven times in the Second Test, and during the ODI series, the Sri Lankans accused Taylor's men of cheating. The season hit a low point with the Sri Lankans which saw the teams refuse to shake hands {{at the end of the}} second final of the triangular series which Australia won 2–0. The match had included physical jostling between McGrath and Sanath Jayasuriya mid pitch, with the latter accusing McGrath of making racist attacks. Later in the match, stump microphones showed Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy alleging that portly Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga was feigning injury and calling for a runner because of his lack of physical fitness.|$|E
25|$|Arnold {{made his}} Test debut against Pakistan in 1997 and his One day {{international}} debut against South Africa {{later in the}} year. Originally an opening batsmen, Arnold has since moved down the batting order. He is most famous in the pearl island as a utility and very versatile player, making him ideally suitable for the limited over version of the game. However, when he started his career, he was seen primarily as a solid top order batsmen where he impressed against Australia during the AIWA cup of 1999, {{as well as the}} <b>subsequent</b> <b>Test</b> series against them, where he batted at No. 3. Failure in the 2003 Cricket World Cup saw him sidelined for many months. However, he fought his way back into the side with a string of good scores in domestic cricket for his club, Nondescripts. A calm and cool player in a crisis situation, Arnold has dragged Sri Lanka out of many sticky situations. He is highly valued for his gritty qualities and is considered an unselfish team man. He is considered an ideal No. 6; he is a Methodist Christian of Tamil descent as is Muttiah Muralitharan.|$|E
50|$|Ideal yield {{is widely}} {{agreed to be}} 20%±2% (18%-22%). This was {{originally}} computed by the Coffee Brewing Institute, {{under the direction of}} Professor E. E. Lockhart at MIT in the 1950s, and has been verified by <b>subsequent</b> <b>tests</b> by the SCAA.|$|R
50|$|In the Austrian Armed Forces {{and almost}} all NATO countries, {{significantly}} lower physical performance requirements for entrance and <b>subsequent</b> <b>tests</b> apply to female soldiers in determining fitness for service. The Swiss Armed Forces abolished this advantage for female soldiers in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2016, {{the water}} supply for the town of Hugo was purportedly {{contaminated}} by THC, the main psychoactive component in cannabis. [...] <b>Subsequent</b> <b>testing</b> found no THC in {{the water supply}}, and authorities believe the initial tests were false positives.|$|R
500|$|For {{many of the}} Los Alamos scientists, Jumbo was [...] "the {{physical}} {{manifestation of}} the lowest point in the Laboratory's hopes {{for the success of}} an implosion bomb." [...] By the time it arrived, the reactors at Hanford produced plutonium in quantity, and Oppenheimer was confident that there would be enough for a second test. The use of Jumbo would interfere with the gathering of data on the explosion, the primary objective of the test. An explosion of more than [...] would vaporize the steel and make it hard to measure the thermal effects. Even [...] would send fragments flying, presenting a hazard to personnel and measuring equipment. It was therefore decided not to use it. Instead, it was hoisted up a steel tower [...] from the explosion, where it could be used for a <b>subsequent</b> <b>test.</b> In the end, Jumbo survived the explosion, although its tower did not.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} 747 was fully assembled, testing began on many {{components}} and systems. One important test involved {{the evacuation of}} 560 volunteers from a cabin mock-up via the aircraft's emergency chutes. The first full-scale evacuation took {{two and a half}} minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and several volunteers were injured. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>test</b> evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries. Most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft's upper deck; instead of using a conventional slide, volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel. Tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft. Boeing built an unusual training device known as [...] "Waddell's Wagon" [...] (named for a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) that consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck. While the first 747s were still being built, the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position.|$|E
500|$|Kapil Dev was {{appointed}} the Indian national cricket coach in September 1999 following {{the appointment of}} Sachin Tendulkar as captain of the Indian team in August 1999. As a player, Kapil Dev captained the team to their first Cricket World Cup victory in 1983. When he retired in 1994, {{he was the most}} capped Indian Test player, the holder of record for the highest number of Test wickets (434) and had earlier held the record for the highest number of wickets in ODIs as well. Due to his credentials as player and captain, he {{was appointed}} as the coach ahead of teammate [...] Kris Srikkanth. The team saw success in his first series at home against New Zealand but saw whitewash in the <b>subsequent</b> <b>test</b> series against host tour of Australia and visitors South Africa, India's first home series loss in 12 years. India's 3–2 win in the subsequent ODI series under new captain Sourav Ganguly will forever be remembered for the claims of match-fixing against South Africa's captain Hansie Cronje.|$|E
50|$|ABX {{tests are}} {{commonly}} used in evaluations of digital audio data compression methods; sample A is typically an uncompressed sample, and sample B is a compressed version of A. Audible compression artifacts that indicate a shortcoming in the compression algorithm can be identified with <b>subsequent</b> <b>testing.</b> ABX tests {{can also be used}} to compare the different degrees of fidelity loss between two different audio formats at a given bitrate.|$|R
50|$|In <b>subsequent</b> <b>tests,</b> the 0.10 {{reached a}} top speed of Mach 0.85 and {{demonstrated}} the viability of the ramjet as an aviation powerplant, with a rate of climb of 40 m/s to 11000 m, exceeding that of the best jet fighters of the time.|$|R
25|$|Although the <b>subsequent</b> <b>tests</b> {{encompassed}} {{more broadly}} in combined amphibious/ground reconnaissance efforts, its aerial reconnaissance elements cannot be overlooked since aircraft were both tested for direct combat support and reconnaissance.
