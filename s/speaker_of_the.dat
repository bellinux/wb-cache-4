40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} speakers' first language (L 1) dialect affects <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> word-final stops which are phonetically unreleased in Vietnamese. Furthermore, a /t/-/k/ merger has been reported for the Southern, but not the Northern dialect. Given this cross-dialectal phonetic difference, we tested the hypothesis that the stops produced by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern dialect are identified less accurately than those produced by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern dialect. The results showed that the speakers' dialect influenced the extent to which final stops are accurately identified and, in general, for all five vowels tested the stops spoken by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern dialect were more accurately identified than those spoken by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern dialect. However, <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> stop place identification depended on <b>the</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding vowels. 16 page(s...|$|R
