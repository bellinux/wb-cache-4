25|$|On 7 May 1817, a heavy gale drove Lord Eldon, Clay, master, onshore at Kirkwall {{while she}} was on her way from Sunderland to Quebec. Initial reports were that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be got off, but that she had lost her rudder and was leaky. She was got off, but with so much damage that she was unable to proceed. The Register of Shipping still lists Lord Eldon in 1818, but no longer lists her in 1819.|$|E
25|$|MacGill was {{admitted}} to the University of Toronto's Bachelor of Applied Sciences program in 1923. During the summers she worked in machine shops repairing electrical motors to supplement the theory and practical teachings during the school year. It is also here that Elsie became exposed to the nascent field of aeronautical engineering. Contracting polio just before her graduation, MacGill was told that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> spend {{the rest of her life}} in a wheelchair. She refused to accept that possibility, however, and learned to walk supported by two strong metal canes. When she convocated she was Canada's first woman graduate in electrical engineering.|$|E
25|$|City {{officials}} in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27, 2005, that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons {{in honor of}} Parks until her funeral. Parks' coffin was flown to Montgomery and taken in a horse-drawn hearse to the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, where she lay in repose at the altar on October 29, 2005, dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess. A memorial service was held there the following morning. One of the speakers, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said that {{if it had not}} been for Parks, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have never become the Secretary of State. In the evening the casket was transported to Washington, D.C. and transported by a bus similar to the one in which she made her protest, to lie in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.|$|E

But I haven’t asked what I didn’t know, and I kept not asking until now, you know. So I feel a little like, if I ask now, she may think that I am so stupid.|$|R
25|$|For example, if José Santos Almeida and Maria Abreu Melo had a daughter, {{her name}} could simply be Joana Melo Almeida (given name + mother's last name + father's last name). However, they {{could give her}} two given names, for example Joana Gabriela, and combine their {{surnames}} in various ways, such has Joana Gabriela Melo Almeida, Joana Gabriela Abreu Melo Almeida (two surnames from the mother, one from the father), Joana Gabriela Abreu Santos Almeida (one name from the mother, two from the father), or even Joana Gabriela Abreu Melo Santos Almeida (two names from each parent). It would also be possible to use surnames that {{are not part of}} either parent's legal name, but which the parents would be entitled to use, i.e., a surname from a grandparent or a great-grandparent that was not transmitted to the father or the mother. This child would probably become known by her final surname, Joana Almeida. However, her parents could decide to change the order of surnames and name her Joana Almeida Melo, etc. In this case <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be known as Joana Melo.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days before}} the election, the Social Democrats {{contacted}} Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf to inform her that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> receive {{a substantial number of}} votes. Widmer-Schlumpf reportedly did not state whether she would accept or decline her possible election. At the same time, the Christian Democratic party chief, Christophe Darbellay, publicly indicated his opposition to Blocher and hinted that he would accept if elected in his stead. On the eve of the elections, the leaders of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Christian Democrats secretly agreed to support Widmer-Schlumpf, after a test ballot in the Christian Democratic parliamentary group indicated {{that a majority of the}} group did not support Blocher. During the night, the Greens withdrew Recordon's candidacy and the center-left party leaders sought out support among individual representatives of the Free Democrats (FDP). All the while, Widmer-Schlumpf's name was kept secret to prevent her party from exerting pressure on her and to prevent her from appearing as a candidate of the Left. Only immediately before the elections were most center-left members of parliament asked by their leadership to support Widmer-Schlumpf.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Reese from Entertainment Weekly dubbed Rasheed [...] "one of {{the most}} repulsive males in recent literature". Lisa See said that, with the {{exception}} of Tariq, [...] "the male characters seem either unrelentingly evil or pathetically weak" [...] and opinionated, [...] "If a woman wrote these things about her male characters, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be labeled a man-hater." ...|$|E

She has also studied Spanish and is an {{accomplished}} dancer, having studied ballet, jazz, hip hop and tap as a child, which she credits with helping her through her fight scenes on Revenge.

500|$|Douglas disregarded {{advice from}} party {{officials}} {{to wait until}} 1952 {{to run for the}} Senate, when Republican Senator Knowland would be up for reelection. Fundraising for the campaign was a concern from the beginning; Douglas friend and aide Ed Lybeck wrote her that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> need to raise $150,000 ($1.8 million today), which Douglas considered a massive sum. Lybeck wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|Minogue thought {{people liked}} Charlene {{because she was}} portrayed as an average Australian teenager, {{experiencing}} a difficult relationship with her mother. She continued, [...] "She {{is a bit of}} a rebel and they probably relate to that, and while she has her problems she will always come out on top." [...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was. Minogue liked that Charlene often said what she thought, but joked that if she were in trouble and tried to punch someone like Charlene did, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> get [...] "flattened". Minogue also said Charlene was sensitive, but she was unlikely to show it and would [...] "rather die than be caught crying." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2012, Loder made a {{music video}} for [...] "Your Love Alone", {{one of the}} album's tracks, which was {{uploaded}} to YouTube. She later said she had written the song during a difficult phase in her life, and the song's lyrics revolve around {{the idea that the}} grace and mercy of God {{can be found in the}} most difficult situations. Through her experience, she became convinced that knowing God is all-important, expressing this concept in the chorus: [...] "Your love alone is sufficient. It needs no company." [...] She stated that she wrote the song [...] "One Name Away" [...] after having watched The Tyra Banks Show. The episode featured an interview with a girl who had been forced into prostitution at a young age; despite smiling on screen, the girl hopelessly declared that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> die before she turned 22.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course,' Lady Exmoor {{answered}} faintly, with {{a devout}} hope that Lord Connemara wouldn't question her any further upon the subject; {{in which case}} <b>she</b> thought it <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be the safest guess {{to say that she}} had seen it at the British Museum or in the Hamilton Library.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> have {{proceeded}} <b>probably</b> {{to state}} the difference betwixt their ages, as the only alloy to their nuptial happiness; but her lodger, who had no mind to be farther exposed to his gay friend's raillery, gave her, contrary to his wont, a signal to leave the room.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} Mr. Momson, the clergyman, and the Bishop {{came into the}} room, and were offered, as is usual on such occasions, cold tea {{and the remains of}} the buttered toast. The squire was not there. Had he been with the other gentlemen, Mrs. Stantiloup, violent as <b>she</b> was, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have held her tongue; but as he was absent, the {{opportunity}} was not bad for attacking the Bishop on the subject under discussion.

500|$|Laurentia Tan {{was born}} on 24 April 1979 in Singapore. She moved with her family to London {{at the age of}} three years due to her father's work. Tan {{developed}} cerebral palsy and profound deafness after birth, and doctors informed her parents that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not be able to walk. Her family decided to settle in the United Kingdom as they felt she would be better able to reach her full potential with the medical facilities and specialist educational support available there. When she was in school, she fell so often and sustained so many minor injuries that her teachers and the school nurse affectionately nicknamed her [...] "Trouble". At five years she was unable to sit and walk properly, and took up horse riding at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders in London as a form of physiotherapy. This activity also helped her confidence and self-esteem.|$|E
500|$|In March 1921, Shackleton renamed his {{expedition}} vessel Quest. She {{was a small}} ship, 125tons {{according to}} Huntford, with sail and auxiliary engine power purportedly capable of making eight knots, but in fact rarely making more than five-and-a-half. Huntford describes her as [...] "straight-stemmed", with an awkward square rig, and a tendency to wallow in heavy seas. Fisher reports that she was built in 1917, weighed 204tons, and had a large and spacious deck. Although she had some modern facilities, such as electric lights in the cabins, she was unsuited to long oceanic voyages; Shackleton, {{on the first day}} out, observed that [...] "in no way are we shipshape or fitted to ignore even the mildest storm". Leif Mills, in his biography of Frank Wild, says that had the ship been taken to the Beaufort Sea in accordance with Shackleton's original plans, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have been crushed in the Arctic pack ice. On her voyage south she suffered frequent damage and breakdowns, requiring repairs at every port of call.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected." [...] Instead of a [...] "quick and merciful death", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately. Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.|$|E

60|$|Was he, {{or was he}} not a wolf? That was the {{question}} which Mrs. Bell scarcely knew how to answer. Hetta had given her voice, saying he was lupine. Mr. Beckard's opinion she had not liked to ask directly. Mr. Beckard <b>she</b> thought <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> propose to Hetta; but as yet he had not done so. And, as {{he was still a}} stranger in the family, she did not like in any way to compromise Susan's name. Indirectly she had asked {{the question}}, and, indirectly also, Mr. Beckard's answer had been favourable.|$|R

"It's all right," [...] I sang out, {{emerging}} {{from behind the}} oxen, and in English, though before the words had left my lips I reflected {{that there was not}} the slightest reason to suppose that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> understand them. <b>Probably</b> <b>she</b> was Dutch, or Portuguese, although by some instinct I had addressed her in English.|$|R
500|$|Madonna {{has stated}} that the song she most regrets {{recording}} is [...] "Material Girl" [...] and if she had known that the label would be attached to her for decades, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> never have done so. After making the video, Madonna said she {{never wanted to be}} compared to Monroe, despite posing like her and recreating many of Monroe's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably in a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated a certain type of liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Author Nicholas Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage. In 1993, a conference was held at the University of California at Santa Barbara, with the subject as Madonna: Feminist Icon or Material Girl? The conference pondered on the duality of Madonna as both of them and deduced that the question of Madonna's feminism is not easy to decide. Some of the feminists left the conference, citing that they {{had not been able to}} make up their minds.|$|E
2500|$|Marleau was {{defeated}} by New Democratic Party candidate Glenn Thibeault in the 2008 federal election. [...] She later said that comments made by Sudbury Member of Provincial Parliament Rick Bartolucci shortly before election day played a [...] "crucial" [...] role in her defeat.

2500|$|In May 2014, Sulkowicz filed {{a report}} against Nungesser with the New York Police Department (NYPD), but {{declined}} to pursue an investigation after Sulkowicz discovered the case could extend past her graduation, when <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> want to [...] "erase all of [...] memories of Columbia". Sulkowicz further stated that NYPD officers [...] "badly mistreated" [...] her and [...] "were dismissive {{of what she had}} to say". The district attorney's office interviewed Sulkowicz and Nungesser, but did not pursue charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion.|$|E
60|$|But {{the way was}} {{difficult}} and dangerous. Once or twice her feet slipped on the smoothly-worn rock beneath; and she confessed to an inward thankfulness when her uncertain feminine hand-grip was exchanged for his strong arm around her waist. Not that he was ungentle; but Miss Alice angrily {{felt that he had}} once or twice exercised his superior masculine functions in a rough way; and yet the next moment <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>probably</b> rejected the idea that she had even noticed it. There was no doubt, however, that he WAS a little surly.|$|R
60|$|Major Willoughby even {{bent forward}} to listen, so intense was his curiosity {{to hear what}} Maud said; a {{circumstance}} which, had <b>she</b> seen it, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have closed her lips.

6000|$|If Claire Boltwood {{had been}} {{protected}} by Jeff Saxton or by a chauffeur, <b>she,</b> too, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have marveled at cars gray with dust, the unshaved men in fleece-lined duck coats, {{and the women}} wind-burnt beneath the boudoir caps they wore as motoring bonnets. But Claire knew now that filling grease-cups does not tend to delicacy of hands; that when you wash with a cake of petrified pink soap and half a pitcher of cold hard water, you never quite get the stain off--you merely get through the dust stratum to the Laurentian grease formation, and mutter, [...] "a nice clean grease doesn't hurt food," [...] and go sleepily down to dinner.|$|R
2500|$|Ninde is {{somewhat}} childish and watches many pre-Change movies {{to escape from}} her reality to that older world, into which <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be integrated well—she is emotional, dramatic, and attractive. Her Change Talent is telepathy: she can read minds within a limited level of complexity (she can't comfortably read human minds or Overlord minds) and distance, and tends to chew her [...] when concentrating. She develops a romantic relationship with Gold-Eye {{over the course of}} the novel. After the Change was reversed, she studied to become a [...]|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Hill {{was given}} a best-case {{prognosis}} of two years to live. Her father recalled that immediately after the diagnosis, [...] "I got weak, [...] Lisa got sick, and typical Lauren {{she wanted to know}} if she could still play basketball." [...] She indeed continued to play in her senior season at Lawrenceburg High despite undergoing regular chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and as scheduled came to MSJ for the 2014–15 season. In September 2014, she had an MRI that revealed that the tumor had grown; at that time, doctors told her and her family that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> die {{before the end of the}} year. Shortly after this diagnosis, she told new MSJ head coach Dan Benjamin, [...] "One game. I want to play one college game."

2500|$|The {{disciples of}} Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai {{asked him why}} [...] ordained that after {{childbirth}} a woman had to bring a sacrifice. He replied that when she bore her child, she swore impetuously in the pain of childbirth {{that she would never}} again have intercourse with her husband. The Torah, therefore, ordained that she had to bring a sacrifice, as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> violate that oath. Rabbi Berekiah and Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that because she fluttered in her heart, she had to bring a fluttering sacrifice, two turtle-doves or two young pigeons. The disciples asked Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai why [...] permitted contact between the father and mother after 7 days when the mother bore a boy, but [...] permitted contact after 14 days when she bore a girl. He replied that since everyone around the mother would rejoice upon the birth of a boy, she would regret her oath to shun her husband after just 7 days, but since people around her would not rejoice on the birth of a girl, she would take twice as long. And Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai taught that [...] ordained circumcision on the eighth day so that the parents could join their guests in a celebratory mood on that day.|$|E

Though {{we should all be}} happy to protect and cherish the dear girl, <b>she</b> herself <b>would</b> <b>probably,</b> prefer to be near those whom nature has {{appointed}} her friends. To me, she will always seem a sister, as you must ever be a brother. By uniting yourselves at once, all appearances of impropriety will be avoided; and in time, God averting evil, you can introduce your wife to her English connections." ...|$|R
500|$|Wanting to [...] "have a {{surprise}} in [...] " [...] {{of the sixth}} season episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On", the writers considered bringing back various deceased characters.
