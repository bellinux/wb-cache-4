40|$|AIM: On the one hand, to {{investigate}} the possibility of predicting dentoalveolar and skeletal discrepancies in persons seeking orthodontic treatment through simple observation of their extraoral frontal and profile photographs by experienced orthodontists and, on the other hand, to compare such data with the information given by other diagnostic means, such as <b>study</b> <b>casts</b> and lateral cephalometric radiographs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Department of Orthodontics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Material included <b>study</b> <b>casts,</b> orthodontic history records, cephalometric radiographs and photographs taken during the 1994 - 1995 period supplemented by questionnaires filled in by an expert referee group during the 1997 - 2001 period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 25 orthodontists of different ages, scientific expertise and clinical experience were presented with frontal and profile extraoral photographs of 67 people (36 men, 31 women) seeking orthodontic treatment at the Department of Orthodontics. This group of 25 referees filled in an extensive and detailed questionnaire consisting of 24 questions that concerned assessment parameters of sagittal and vertical relationships on the sagittal and frontal planes of the dentofacial complex. The referees assessed the frontal and profile photographs by simple observation. Analysis of <b>study</b> <b>casts</b> and cephalometric radiographs was performed by the first author. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spearman’s r statistical criterion was used {{to investigate}} possible correlation between the subjective responses of the referee group and the objective findings (findings from the analysis of <b>study</b> <b>casts</b> and cephalometric radiographs). RESULTS: Assessment of dentofacial discrepancies by orthodontists based on extraoral photographs may be reliable concerning facial profile, variables of skeletal profile on the sagittal plane, the lower third of the skeletal profile on the sagittal and vertical planes, overjet, overbite, traumatic occlusion and Angle Class occlusion. During assessment of the frontal facial view no variable was recognized by the referees, except for the lower anterior height of the facial skeleton...|$|R

SETTING: Bristol Dental Hospital, University of Bristol, United Kingdom. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment <b>study</b> <b>casts</b> of 150 patients were selected randomly from 1100 consecutively treated Caucasian orthodontic patients. Bolton tooth-size discrepancies and ratios were measured using two methods; one method employed entirely manual measurement and the Odontorule slide rule, while the other employed digital calipers and the HATS analysis software. Twenty <b>study</b> <b>casts</b> were measured twice, a week apart with both methods. Another three investigators also measured 20 <b>study</b> <b>casts</b> twice with the HATS analysis. RESULTS: There were small or no systematic errors within or between these two methods. A very significant difference was evident for mean time measurements between the two methods (mean time for HATS was 3. 5 minutes and for Odontorule was 8. 9 minutes). There was relatively high error variance of both methods of measurement {{as a percentage of}} the total variance. CONCLUSIONS: On-line electronic measurement was found to be more rapid than the manual method used. Both methods demonstrate relatively high random error and this has important consequences for the clinical use of Bolton's ratios.

5000|$|In 2014, the {{airframe}} cost went below $100 {{million for}} the first time, and the Air Force expected unit costs to fall. A 2014 Center for International Policy <b>study</b> <b>cast</b> doubt {{on the number of}} indirect jobs created by the program, which has been a key selling point for the F-35 to Congress. Lockheed stood by their job numbers and said that their accounting was in line with industry norms. A January 2014 report by J. Michael Gilmore said that new software delays could delay Block 2B release by 13 months. This estimate was reduced to 4 months in the DOTE report from November 2014. The F-35 program office considered software to be the top technical risk to the program. The USMC was maintaining their expectation of an Initial Operational Capability by July 2015. In 2014, U.S. Senator John McCain blamed cost increases in the program on [...] "cronyism". In 2014, the GAO found that the F-35 fleet would have operating costs 79% higher than the aircraft it was to replace. In 2014, the FY2015 Selected Acquisition Report stated that the program cost had increased 43% from 2001, with Program Acquisition Unit Cost up 68% and Unit Recurring Flyaway up 41%. The F-35A's cost per flying hour in BY2012 dollars is $32,500 while the F-16C/D is $25,500, but each F-35A is expected to fly only 250 hours a year, compared to the F-16's 316 hours a year, resulting in the same yearly operating cost. In July 2014, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and BAE Systems announced they would invest a combined $170 million in the program, which was anticipated to result in savings of over $10 million per aircraft. This initiative was said to have set the project on track for an $80M (including engine) price tag per aircraft (F-35A) by 2018, when full production is scheduled to begin. The December 2014 Selected Acquisition Report listed a cost decrease of $7.5 billion against a program cost of $391.1 billion ($320 billion in 2012 dollars). Lockheed Martin also stated that there would be an estimated decrease of nearly $60 billion to the operations and support costs.|$|E

When asked in an interview about the similarity of his work with Leary's, Griffiths explained the difference: [...] "We are conducting rigorous, systematic research with psilocybin under carefully monitored conditions, a route which Dr. Leary abandoned in the early 1960s." [...] The National Institute of Drug Abuse-funded study, published in 2006, has been praised by experts for the soundness of its experimental design. In the experiment, 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and methylphenidate (Ritalin) in separate sessions; the methylphenidate sessions served as a control and psychoactive placebo. The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood; 61% of subjects reported a [...] "complete mystical experience" [...] after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme [...] "experience of fear" [...] or dysphoria (i.e., a [...] "bad trip") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject's sense of well-being.|$|E
