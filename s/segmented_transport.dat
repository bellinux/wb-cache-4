40|$|Abstract: Urban {{transport}} database (UTD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important bases for academic research and management in transport sector. In this paper, comparison analysis between international and domestic urban transport database was implemented. Based on the Chinese practices, the objectives, framework and key technologies of the Urban Transport Database were presented. The upload and download mechanism of the urban transport data was presented as well. It will provide an efficient technical support for UTD construction in China. Background Urban transport database (UTD) {{is one of the}} most important bases for academic research and management in transport sector. In China, due to the <b>segmented</b> <b>transport</b> institutional system and lack of data statistics and reporting mechanism, the basic data of urban transport in the national level was insufficient. Therefore, construction of UTD is urgently required. This database will have two major merits. Firstly, it will provide a valuable urban transport resources sharing platform for all the academic organizations. Secondly, it will provide support for the decision makers in the transport sector. 1. 1 Review of UT...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand and}} the supply for tourism {{increased}} tremendous {{during the last}} ten years as a result of enlargement of leisure and free time availability, a growth in paid tourists packages, an increase in bought holidays using dedicated websites, the development of transportation, and in particular the air transport and the expansion of inclusive tours offered by tour operators. After the transition to a modern economy and started with the integration into the European Union, Romanian tourism has suffered changes and adaptation important to consider and analyze in the following article. Governments and local authorities also play a very important role in tourism industry, often a co-ordinating role, as the industry is highly <b>segmented</b> (<b>transport,</b> accommodation, food and beverages, events, guiding tours, travel agents, souvenirs, and other tourists’ ancillary services). The present paper will investigate the changes suffered by the Romanian tourism using the tourism indicators: the number of tourists’ accommodation units (for the supply), international tourist arrivals and international tourism receipts (for the demand). At the end some conclusions are to be made in order to highlight the development of international tourism in Romania in the last years...|$|E
30|$|Callus {{distraction}} using bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> {{systems is}} an applied {{process in the}} treatment of bone defects. However, complications such as muscle contractures, axial deviation and pin track infections occur in the treatment process using the currently available devices. Since successful treatment is influenced by the applied distraction force, knowledge of the biomechanical properties of the involved soft tissues is essential to improve clinical outcome and treatment strategies. To date, little data on distraction forces and the role of soft-tissue traction forces are available. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess traction forces generated by soft tissues during bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> using a novel intramedullary callus distraction system on eight human femora. For traction force measurements, bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> over 60 -mm femoral defects was conducted under constant load measurement using 40 - and 60 -mm bone segments. The required traction forces for 60 -mm bone segments were higher than forces for 40 -mm bone segments. This study demonstrates that soft tissues are of relevance biomechanically in bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport.</b> The size of the bone segment and the selection of the region for osteotomy are of utmost importance in defining the treatment procedure.|$|R

30|$|An {{intramedullary}} device {{has some}} advantages over external fixation in callus distraction for bone defect reconstruction. There are difficulties controlling motorized intramedullary devices and monitoring the distraction rate which {{may lead to}} poor results. The {{aim of this study}} was to design a fully implantable and non-motorized simple distraction nail for the treatment of bone defects. The fully implantable device comprises a tube-in-tube system and a wire pulling mechanism for callus distraction. For the treatment of femoral bone defects, a traction wire, attached to the device at one end, is fixed to the tibial tubercle at its other end. Flexion of the knee joint over a predetermined angle generates a traction force on the wire triggering bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport.</b> This callus distraction system was implanted into the femur of four human cadavers (total 8 femora), and bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> was conducted over 60 -mm defects with radiographic monitoring. All bone <b>segments</b> were <b>transported</b> reliably to the docking site. From these preliminary results, we conclude that this callus distraction system offers an alternative to the current intramedullary systems for the treatment of bone defects.|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} of this study demonstrate the feasibility of bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> by callus distraction using a novel CDS. Results achieved in mechanical experiments and in the cadaver study provide proof of concept that the mechanism designed is able to <b>transport</b> a <b>segment</b> of bone in the femur. These initial results have to be validated further and the novel CDS was introduced in animal experiments.|$|R
30|$|In step 1, {{the total}} costs {{for a single}} <b>transport</b> <b>segment</b> (per train / per barge / per truck) were calculated. Then the segment costs for a single {{container}} were worked out by dividing the total segment cost {{by the number of}} containers. In the final step, the total trip costs for a single container were calculated by adding the costs for all <b>transport</b> <b>segments.</b> In rail <b>transport,</b> each shunting process was considered as a new <b>transport</b> <b>segment</b> (the shunting segments consisted of: collection: siding -> shunting yard; mainline operation: shunting yard -> shunting yard; distribution: shunting yard -> siding).|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} difference {{is in the}} transport and encapsulation methods. MPLS is {{able to work with}} variable length packets while ATM transports fixed-length (53 byte) cells. Packets must be <b>segmented,</b> <b>transported</b> and re-assembled over an ATM network using an adaptation layer, which adds significant complexity and overhead to the data stream. MPLS, on the other hand, simply adds a label to the head of each packet and transmits it on the network.|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{introduce}} a fully implantable CDS {{for the treatment}} of femoral bone defects. This novel intramedullary callus distraction system was subjected to several mechanical tests and a cadaver study with promising results. In our cadaver experiment, bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> was accomplished without mechanical obstacles and the desired range of motion of the knee joint achieved. A major advantage of this CDS is that it allows physiological movement of the limb and helps prevent the frequently reported complication of knee joint contracture [9]. It is inevitable that some movement is lost, albeit temporarily, during the period of bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport.</b> However, this limitation can be minimized by adjusting the traction wire according to the patients’ knee movement range. For example, if the traction wire is adjusted such that the mechanism is triggered by flexing the knee joint more than 120 °, any movement between 0 ° and 119 ° is possible without any effect on the mechanism. At the end of transport, the wire and screw will be removed and further bending of the knee joint is possible without any restriction. Other mechanical devices either limit knee movement range or require frequent non-physiological and painful movement; in this novel CDS, only four cycles of knee flexion are necessary to reach the designated transport distance of 1  mm per day compared to 15 cycles of rotational movement of the femur using the Albizzia nail. An important consideration is that the data presented in this study are from an experimental setup; there are limitations on transferring the results into clinical practice. For the present time, this study confirms proof of concept that the mechanism designed for the purpose of bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> within an intramedullary nail works.|$|R

Using transfer impedance measurements for selected lightning protection materials and 3 D finite difference modeling, a retrofit design approach for the existing dielectric grain cover and railcar covers was evaluated and recommended for SRM <b>segment</b> <b>transport.</b> A safe level of 300 kV/m was determined for the propellant. The study indicated that a significant potential hazard exists for unprotected <b>segments</b> during rail <b>transport.</b> However, modified railcar covers and grain covers are expected to prevent lightning attachment to the SRM and to reduce the levels to several orders of magnitude below 300 kV/m...|$|R

40|$|Massive {{segmental}} {{bone loss}} due to chronic osteomyelitis represents a considerable challenge to orthopedic surgeons {{and is a}} limb threatening condition. The only option available in such a clinical situation is <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> using the Ilizarov technique of distraction osteogenesis; yet the most common problem in cases of bone transport with the Ilizarov technique in massive bone loss, is the long duration of the fixator. In addition to autologous bone grafting, several mechanical, biologic, and external physical treatment modalities may be employed to promote bone formation and maturation during <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> in osteomyelitis patients. Mechanical approaches include compressive loading of the distraction regenerate, increased frequency of small increments of distraction, and compression-distraction. Intramedullary nailing and hemicorticotomy can reduce the time in external fixation; however, these techniques are associated with technical difficulties and complications. Exogenous application of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound or pulsed electromagnetic fields may shorten the duration of external fixation. Other promising modalities include diphosphonates, physician-directed use (off-label use) of bone morphogenetic proteins, and local injection of bone marrow aspirate and platelet gel at the osteotomy site. Well-designed clinical {{studies are needed to}} establish safe and effective guidelines for various modalities to enhance new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis after segment transfer...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} improve on {{existing}} models and develop a novel callus distraction systems (CDS), basic biomechanical knowledge regarding traction forces involved in bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> (BST) is needed. A better understanding may help reduce frequent complications such as muscle contractures, axial deviation and traction injury to vessels and nerves but would also allow modifying the treatment regimen. There are little data on forces in callus distraction systems. Previous studies measured distraction forces either in complicated or in using inaccurate systems ignoring frictional force; many were conducted in animal experiments having less relevance for human callus distraction [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Whether the predominant part of the force is generated by the viscoelasticity of the soft tissues or by the callus itself, is uncertain.|$|R

The main advantage of the internal technique is that it eliminates the risk of transection of important structures, such as nerves. The main difficulty is the secure fixation of the internal transport construct to the bone <b>transport</b> <b>segment,</b> particularly if this is small and osteopenic.|$|R
30|$|Transposition of the ispilateral fibula to the tibia (fibula pro tibia) was {{suggested}} by Hahn [2] in 1884 and {{was first used}} successfully by Huntington [3] in 1903 to fill a 12.7 -cm tibial defect in a 7 -year-old boy. Subsequently, several authors have used similar techniques [4, 5, 6]. The technique which we describe here involves the transfer of fibula to tibia as a pedicle graft in a two-stage procedure. Due to the retention of the blood supply to {{one end of the}} transplant, the graft easily takes up and hypertrophies upon weight bearing {{over a period of time}} [3, 4]. This procedure was chosen for study as it does not require long-term treatment nor external fixator care associated with <b>segment</b> <b>transport.</b> This method is usually recommended for paediatric patients as the fibular graft in adult patients is considered to be inadequate in terms of size and strength and is therefore liable to fracture [8].|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of debridement and application of Ilizarov ring fixator (IRF) in the management of infected tibial non-unions. 				 					Patients and methods: Twenty six patients with infected non-unions of tibia were managed by debridement and resection of infected portion ± partial fibulectomy and stabilization by Ilizarov ring fixator. Bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> was done in 18 patients who had greater than 2. 5  cm bone defect after debridement. Bone grafting was required in three patients to augment union. 				 					Results: All fractures united and infection eradicated completely. There were 13 excellent, nine good, and four fair results. Functional results were excellent in nine, good in 11, fair in five and poor in one. Pin site inflammation was the most common problem and occurred in 23 (88 %) patients. There were no major complications or neurovascular complications.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} explore the {{feasibility}} of posterior maxillectomy reconstruction by transport distraction in a primate model. In each of 14 male adult rhesus monkeys, posterior partial maxillectomy was performed {{on one side of}} maxilla to create a posterior maxillary defect. Immediately after the maxillectomy, a dentoalveolar segment anterior to the defect was osteotomized as <b>transport</b> <b>segment</b> and a custom-made transport distractor was fixed on the residual maxilla. After a latency period of 5 days, the distractor was activated 1 mm daily to move the <b>transport</b> <b>segment</b> backward to the defect. This process lasted about 2 weeks. The <b>transport</b> <b>segment</b> was allowed to consolidate and the animals were sacrificed at different defined intervals. Transport distraction was successful in six animals. Three other cases were completed with minor wound dehiscence and one had a small oro-antral fistula with subsequent maxillary sinusitis. New bone bridging the distraction gap was confirmed by radiography and histology in the animals completing distraction.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the implantation of the nail and the system running, a cadaver study using both femora of four human cadavers was conducted. All experiments were approved and conducted {{in accordance with the}} guidelines of the Committee of Medical Ethics. Written informed consent from the donor was obtained prior to their inclusion in this study. Each cadaver was thoroughly checked, and none of the cadavers had a history of musculoskeletal disease that could have {{had an impact on the}} experiment. All cadavers were frozen to a temperature of − 18 ° Celsius exactly 48  h after death and defrosted for 24  h prior to the experiment. Implantation of the CDS was carried out in supine position using standard retrograde access though the knee joint. The femoral canal was reamed over a guide-wire to a diameter of 15.5  mm followed by temporary insertion of the nail. After removal of the nail, a bone defect was created via a medial approach in order to avoid major damage of the surrounding soft tissues of the femur. Forty-millimeter bone segments on the right femora and 60 -mm bone segments on the left femora were generated using a Gigli saw. The osteotomy was performed directly distal to the insertion of adductor brevis in such a way as to preserve as much of the periosteum as possible. The nail was then reinserted into the femoral canal across the bone <b>segment</b> to be <b>transported</b> and then locked proximally in an anteroposterior direction. Standard anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs were obtained to guide the nail to the correct position. Next, a 6.5 -mm lateral drill hole was generated on the bone segment followed by fixation of the bone segment on the threaded rod spindle. In order to perform distal locking of the nail, the femur had to be distracted on the side of the osteotomy as the tension force of the adherent soft tissues reduced the initial size of the bone defect. After the size of the bone defect was readjusted to a total length of 60  mm, distal locking was performed and the threaded rod was inserted into the nail. With the mechanism inserted into the nail, the traction wire was adjusted parallel to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and fixed to the tibial tuberosity using a cancellous bone screw (Fig.  6). At completion, the mechanism and the system were tested by flexing the knee joint. Radiographs were taken in AP and lateral direction in order to ensure correct bone <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> (Fig.  7). Bone transport was then conducted in all eight femora until impingement of the bone segment at the docking site. In clinical application, the screw in the tibial tuberosity will be removed at the end of <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> and the traction wire will be cut at the distal end of the nail leading to a retraction of the wire into the nail.|$|R

30|$|As {{with any}} cadaveric test set-up, {{this study has}} some limitations. Measurements in cadaveric {{specimens}} eliminate active muscle forces, which limits the documentation of generated forces to an observation of passive forces solely. As the CDS were released every 15  s to generate a transport distance of 0.25  mm per release until impact of the bone segment at the docking site, this would contrast to the clinical situation where the speed of <b>segment</b> <b>transport</b> is around 1  mm per day allowing some time for the soft tissues to relax between transport intervals. As the soft tissues in our experimental set-up were given 15  s to adapt after each release, {{it is likely that}} the viscoelasticity of the soft tissues maintains some resistant force that falsely increases the total amount of force measured. Despite these limitations, we believe that these findings are of value for clinicians designing the treatment regimen. The study shows that transport forces for 60 -mm bone segments were higher than transport forces for 40 -mm segments, which will have less adherent soft tissues. For this reason, not only the size but the site of the bone segment has to be taken into consideration while defining the treatment procedure.|$|R

As illustrated in an animal model, the induced membrane prevents protrusion of adjacent soft tissue and neurovascular structures into the defect and adheres to the resected bone edges without collapse despite removal of the spacer, thus delineating a cavity corresponding to the volume of the retrieved cement spacer [6, 29]. This so-called spacer effect can be utilized in the reconstruction of bone defects where the resulting cylindrical cavity forms a stable envelope through which a bone <b>segment</b> may be <b>transported.</b>|$|R
