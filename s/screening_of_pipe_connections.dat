50|$|The lowest drum of {{the three}} {{provided}} the heating surface. This was almost entirely filled with a cylindrical corrugated furnace. A length, approximately one diameter, {{was filled with a}} number of, around 60, small diameter fire-tubes. Compared to previous large-flued stationary boilers, such as the Lancashire or Galloway boilers, this was a larger heating area in a very compact space. The tubes were still short, compared to locomotive boilers, and offered good gasflow for the exhaust gases without needing additional exhaust draughting. The waterspace around the furnace was just thick enough to allow good circulation and leave space for mud to build up, but otherwise keeping the water volume to a minimum. This led to rapid heating of the water and so good thermosyphon circulation into the central drum above. This circulation was encouraged by the provision of a number <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>connections</b> between the drums.

40|$|End-to-side {{vascular}} anastomosis has {{a considerable}} complexity regarding the suturing of the juncture {{line between the}} artery and the graft. The present study proposes a stress–concentration methodology for the prediction of the stress distribution at the juncture line, aiming to provide generic expressions describing the response of an end-to-side anastomosis. The proposed methodology is based on general results obtained from the analysis <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>connections,</b> a topic that has been investigated {{in recent years in}} the field of offshore structural engineering. A key aspect for implementing the stress–concentration–factor approach is the recognition that the axial load due to pressure and flow dynamics exerted along the graft axis controls the “hot spots” on the juncture line, which in turn affects the mechanical response of the sutures. Several parameters, identified to influence the suture line response, are introduced in closed-form expressions for the suture line response calculations. The obtained results compare favorably with finite element results published in the literature. The proposed model predicts analytically the suture line response of end-to-side anastomosis, while capturing the influence of and interdependence among the problem parameters. Lower values of the graft radius, the distance between sequential stitches, and the intersecting angle between the artery and the graft are some of the key parameters that reduce the suture line response. The findings of this study are broad in scope and potentially applicable to improving the end-to-side anastomosis technique through improved functionality of the sutures and optimal selection of materials and anastomosis angle. © 2014, Biomedical Engineering Society...|$|R

40|$|Threaded <b>pipe</b> <b>connections</b> are {{commonly}} used in {{the oil and gas}} industry in particular to connect casing strings, drillpipe strings or production and transportation risers and pipelines. In order to maintain a sealed and secure connection while in service, the connections are generally preloaded. To introduce this preload, the connections commonly have tapered threads and they are assembled by applying a certain make-up torque. The combination of the make-up torque and external loads results in a multiaxial stress distribution over the coupling, where the coupling’s threads act as stress raisers. When used in offshore environments, waves and currents cause dynamic loads acting on the pipelines. The <b>pipe</b> <b>connections</b> remain the weakest points because fatigue cracks can initiate in the connection’s threads. A wide variety <b>of</b> patented threaded <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> designs exists, all claiming to improve a connection’s fatigue life. However, experimental data for such designs, available in literature, is limited. Published studies generally comprise experiments on a single connection type. In addition, as no uniformity in testing setup, loading conditions and damage detection techniques exists, results from different studies can not be used for a detailed fatigue analysis to compare the designs. Furthermore, current design curves in codes and standards lead to overly conservative or inaccurate results. The aim of this work is to provide a better understanding of the fatigue mechanisms <b>of</b> threaded <b>pipe</b> <b>connections</b> and to study the effect of different design features on a connection’s fatigue life. Final goal is to formulate guidelines for new fatigue resistant connection designs. In this study, the API Line <b>Pipe</b> <b>connection</b> is used as a reference. Several modifications and design features are applied to this connection type. To simulate the influence of these modifications, a parametric 2 D axisymmetric finite element model, called ThreadGen, is developed. The results of this model are compared with a 3 D finite element simulation to prove its validity for both make-up and bending. In addition the results of the 2 D axisymmetric simulations are validated by static strain gauge measurements during a make-up test, an axial tension test, a bending test and an internal pressure test. The validated model is then used to evaluate the influence of connection properties and design features on the threaded connection’s behaviour. Test rigs are developed to perform fatigue experiments on three scales: the small scale experiments on 1 ” (33. 4 mm outer diameter) connections are performed in four-point bending; the medium scale tests on 4. 5 ” (114. 3 mm) connections are carried out under axial tension and in four-point bending; for full scale testing of specimens in the range of 150 mm to 500 mm in diameter a resonant bending fatigue setup is developed. A significant part of this work is dedicated to this last setup. Two plain pipes without a threaded connection are tested in the setup to characterize its dynamic behaviour and to measure the response <b>of</b> a <b>pipe</b> subjected to a certain excitation frequency. The testing of full scale threaded <b>pipe</b> <b>connections</b> in this setup is part of future research. The majority of the performed fatigue tests comprises small scale experiments. Several modified configurations are tested. For each configuration an S-N curve is constructed, so that the effect of a certain configuration on the connection’s fatigue life can be quantified. It is observed that a local modification of the threaded connection’s geometry as well as the connection’s contact conditions can have an important influence on the fatigue life of the connection. During the medium scale four-point bending tests, advanced measuring techniques are used to monitor the fatigue crack growth during the test. Although these are existing techniques, they are applied to crack sizing in threaded connections for the first time. A dynamic 3 D optical displacement measurement system is used to detect changes in the bending deflection shape <b>of</b> the <b>pipe</b> as a result of a propagating crack. Besides, a local crack opening measurement is carried out and modal analysis techniques are applied to monitor changes <b>of</b> the <b>pipe’s</b> eigenfrequencies. To visualize the crack fronts at different moments during the tests, a beach marking technique is used so that the exact crack shapes can be seen during post-mortem analysis. It is shown that a crack initiates at the root of the last engaged thread of the male part of the connection, and propagates gradually over a large segment of the circumference, forming a long shallow crack. When the crack penetrates the pipe wall, it rapidly increases in size along two crack fronts. The observed crack shapes do not have a semi-elliptical shape as commonly used in fracture mechanics. A fatigue crack growth analysis that considers the crack as an annular flaw, is effective in describing the crack growth behaviour. The results from the finite element simulations and the experimentally obtained S-N curves are combined in a multiaxial damage evolution law. Using this fatigue analysis, the observed trends in the fatigue lives of the configurations are explained. The general concept of using a connection’s thread load distribution as a measure for its fatigue life is proven to be inaccurate. The main reason for this is that the load distribution is related to the axial stresses over the connection. However, the fatigue life of a threaded connection is determined by the local multiaxial stress distribution and strain range around the root of the last engaged thread. These local conditions are not only the result of the load distribution, but they are also affected by the hoop stress introduced during make-up, which can additionally be affected by a changed connection stiffness. In addition, the multiaxial damage evolution law is used to analyse the influence of several features on a connection’s fatigue life. Not for all patented modifications an increased fatigue life is predicted when applied to the API Line <b>Pipe</b> <b>connection.</b> It is finally stated that to optimize a fatigue resistant connection, it is appropriate to combine several design features. The thread shape can be optimized to obtain a low stress concentration factor and reduce the local strains at the thread root. The connection global geometry and make-up conditions can be optimized to improve the load distribution over the threads and reduce local stresses and strains at the threads...|$|R
