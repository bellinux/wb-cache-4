He compared the site's aggregate scores, based on critical and audience consensus, for films released in January, February, and March from 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average <b>scores.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} is to present <b>the</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> integrating common features between the Green Mark Scheme (GMS) and the Buildable Design Appraisal System (BDAS) requirements in building envelopes. The study presents the common features that influence both <b>the</b> GM <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building envelope and <b>the</b> buildability <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall system. A case study is developed to show <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> varying <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> a representative common feature in the GM score and the buildability score. The study finds that lengths of window and wall, and wall materials are the common features that can influence <b>the</b> GM <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building envelope and <b>the</b> buildability <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall system. The case study suggested that the window-to-wall ratio (WWR), which is the representative common feature, shows negative relationship with <b>the</b> GM <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building envelope and positive relationship with <b>the</b> buildability <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall system. The results show that varying the WWR influences <b>the</b> GM <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building envelope more strongly than <b>the</b> buildability <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall system. This seems to imply that building professionals when determining the WWR may have to concern themselves with theGM <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building envelope more as compared to <b>the</b> buildability <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall system. The study suggests that integrating the common features between GMS and BDAS requirements with other relevant factors such as cost, social and environmental impacts of design can help to save workload, time and budget, as well as facilitate <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> more reliable design, planning and management from a practical viewpoint...|$|R

5|$|Santos boxed for {{the vacant}} WBO light-middleweight title against Yori Boy Campas {{in a fight}} that took place at Bally's Event Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Santos won the fight when referee Joe Cortez intervened in the {{eleventh}} round. During {{the course of the}} fight numerous combinations hurt Campas and cut his face, in the eleventh round following one of Santos' punches Campas informed Cortez that his vision was not functioning properly. At the moment of the fight's conclusion the <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judges were 99–91, 97–93 and 99–90 in favor of Santos. On August 17, 2002, Santos defended this championship for a first time against Mehrdud Takaloo, in a fight that also involved the World Boxing Union Light middleweight championship. The event took place in the Cardiff Castle located in Cardiff, Wales. Takaloo began the fight by using his right hand often and on the fourth round he scored a knockdown. As the fight progressed Takaloo began to show signs of exhaustion and Santos managed to have a strong performance {{in the second half of}} the fight. Takaloo received cuts around both of his eyes which made the referee consider stopping the fight twice in the tenth round. When the fight ended Santos won the contest by unanimous decision and the judges' scores were 116–111, 116–112, 117–110.|$|E
