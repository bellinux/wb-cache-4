5|$|Edward II's close {{relationship}} to Gaveston {{had been a}} source of conflict at court, and Gaveston's execution by a group of rebellious barons in 1312 had brought the country to the brink of civil war. As Edmund came of age, he became an important member of the circle around his brother. In 1318, the Treaty of Leake was drafted as an effort to reconcile the opposing parties, and Edmund – as his first public act – was among the witnesses to <b>sign</b> <b>this</b> treaty. Further official appointments followed. In the spring of 1320 he took part in an embassy to Pope John XXII in Avignon, where the mission was to absolve the king of his oath to uphold the Ordinances, a set of restrictions imposed on royal authority by the baronage. Later that year, he joined his brother the king in Amiens, where Edward was paying homage to the French king. In October 1320, Edmund attended his first parliament.|$|E

25|$|Indic scripts {{indicate}} vowels through dependent vowel signs (diacritics) {{around the}} consonants, often including {{a sign that}} explicitly indicates {{the lack of a}} vowel. If a consonant has no vowel <b>sign,</b> <b>this</b> indicates a default vowel. Vowel diacritics may appear above, below, to the left, to the right, or around the consonant.|$|E
25|$|Regulatory {{signs are}} mostly {{circular}} and mostly black {{on a white}} background, with a red border. If the sign contains a prohibition, a red line will diagonally bisect the <b>sign.</b> <b>This</b> type of road sign was introduced in 1956 with the Traffic Signs Regulations, 1956. Some signs were added later.|$|E

25|$|Some union leaders, {{including}} Walter Reuther of the UAW, {{signed the}} Taft-Hartley affidavits and {{then proceeded to}} raid (attempt to replace) locals of UE and the Farm Equipment Workers (FE), whose leaders were still holding out and refusing to <b>sign.</b> <b>This</b> meant that the raiding union, UAW, would appear on the NLRB ballot, but the incumbent union, UE or FE, could not.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} been done into whether words used within the gay {{community}} are understood by heterosexuals.

25|$|This {{demonstrates}} that for integrals on unbounded intervals, uniform convergence of a function is {{not strong enough}} to allow passing a limit through an integral <b>sign.</b> <b>This</b> makes the Riemann integral unworkable in applications (even though the Riemann integral assigns both sides the correct value), because there is no other general criterion for exchanging a limit and a Riemann integral, and without such a criterion it is difficult to approximate integrals by approximating their integrands.|$|E
25|$|An {{elevation}} in serum bilirubin {{level of}} more than 2 times ULN with associated transaminase rise is an ominous <b>sign.</b> <b>This</b> indicates severe hepatotoxicity {{and is likely to}} lead to mortality in 10% to 15% of patients, especially if the offending drug is not stopped (Hy's Law). This is because it requires significant damage to the liver to impair bilirubin excretion, hence minor impairment (in the absence of biliary obstruction or Gilbert syndrome) would not lead to jaundice. Other poor predictors of outcome are old age, female sex, high AST.|$|E

25|$|A party {{committee}} which included Ion Popescu-Puțuri investigated {{the matter of}} his arrest and interrogation, concluding that evidence against Pătrășcanu was fabricated, {{that he had been}} systematically beaten and otherwise ill-treated, and that a confession had been prepared for him to <b>sign.</b> <b>This</b> was coupled with various irregularities in procedures (such as the court having been given only 24 hours to assess evidence from years of investigation, and the death penalty having been decided by the party leadership before being imposed on the panel of judges). Evidence was also presented that some of the false confessions were designed as political weapons in internal party struggles (implicating names of politicians who were not facing trial at the time).|$|E

500|$|Prior to 1994 {{other terms}} for the {{suspected}} psychological effect were used sporadically. Onomastic determinism {{was used as}} early as 1970 by Roberta Frank. German psychologist Wilhelm Stekel spoke of [...] "Die Verpflichtung des Namens" [...] (the obligation of the name) in 1911. Outside of science, cognomen syndrome was used by playwright Tom Stoppard in his 1972 play Jumpers. In Ancient Rome the predictive power of a person's name was captured by the Latin proverb [...] "nomen est omen", meaning the name is a <b>sign.</b> <b>This</b> saying is still in use today in English and other languages such as French, German, Italian, Dutch, and Slovenian.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of [...] "Gangnam Style", the American talent manager Scooter Braun, who {{discovered}} Justin Bieber on YouTube, asked on Twitter [...] "How did I not <b>sign</b> <b>this</b> guy (Psy)".

He made several incriminating statements during the interviews, at first admitting he had thrown stones, then during the second interview saying he had seen the attack on Blakelock. During the third, he said he had spoken to Silcott about the murder, and that Silcott owned a hammer with a hook on one side. After the fifth interview he was charged with affray, and during the sixth he described the attack on Blakelock: [...] "It was like you see in a film, a helpless man with dogs on him. It was just like that, it was really quick." [...] He did not <b>sign</b> <b>this</b> interview, Rose writes, and after it he vomited.|$|E
