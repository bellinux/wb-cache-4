40|$|A simple {{procedure}} {{has been}} established for controlling and measuring the pH of media in which the bicarbonate-carbonic acid system is the predominant buffer. The HCO- 3 concentration was maintained at 22. 5 mM and the H 2 CO 3 concentration was varied by equilibrating the media with 0. 5 to 40 per cent CO 2 in air. The curve relating extracellular pH to 3 day cell growth was similar for glass-attached HeLa and Chang liver cells. Maximum growth occurred over a pH range of 7. 38 to 7. 87. Cell growth declined precipitously on the alkaline side and more gradually on the acid side of the optimal pH range. Comparable pH growth curves were also obtained with newly isolated cells from rat liver and skeletal muscle. It was shown {{that the effect of}} pH on growth was independent of the CO 2 concentration and that the essential nutrients in the medium were stable over the pH range studied. Although alkalosis depressed the 3 day cell population, cells exposed to a pH of 8. 0 to 8. 2 grew at the maximal rate for the first 12 to 24 hours. Growth then ceased abruptly and the cells entered a steady state with respect to net protein synthesis. This was followed by cytoplasmic retraction and cell death. Increasing the concentrations of calcium or magnesium in the medium failed to prevent the effects of alkalosis. Moreover, the increase in CO- 3 concentration of the media and the concomitant decrease in Ca++ ion concentration that occur at high pH were eliminated as determining factors in the growth failure and death. While acidosis had a less pronounced effect on the 3 day cell population, its effect on the growth rate was immediate. The increase in cell generation time was proportional to the H+ ion concentration. In each of the cell lines studied, acidosis was accompanied by a striking {{increase in the number of}} cytoplasmic perinuclear granules. These granules which <b>stain</b> <b>supravitally</b> with Janus green are extracted from fixed cells with lipid solvents. They maintain their identity in cell homogenates and may be isolated from the other subcellular structures by differential centrifugation; at 100, 000 g they form a distinct layer at the top of the supernatant fraction. On the basis of their physical and chemical properties, these granules have been called lipid-rich particles. The accumulation of lipid-rich particles in acidosis was independent of the growth rate and the CO 2 concentration...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the Golgi apparatus in neurones has been done, the use being made of a rather wide range of materials of invertebrates such as grasshoppers, crayfishes, cuttlefishes and silkworms, and of vertebrates including domestic fowls, rabbits, cats, toads and silver carps. The investigations were based on classical methods involving Kolatchev's method, Nassonov's and Dolton's modifications of the Kolatchev method, and on the impregnation methods devised by Mann-Kopsch, Da Fano and Aoyama. Both light and phase contrast microscopes were used for observation. Baker's calcium saline solution, normal human plasma, Ringer's solution or 0. 88 M. sucrose were used as mounting medium of tissue pieces. Supravital staining method with neutral red or methylene blue, together with several other staining methods with Sudan black were employed in experiments. The Golgi apparatus occurring in neurones of invertebrate animals here under study consists of granular, short rod-like or crescentic bodies, the so-called dictyosomes which are scattered in the cytoplasm around the nucleus. They are impregnated dark brown to black with silver or osmium. Observations of fresh isolated invertebrate neurones under a phase contrast microscope have revealed the occurrence of canalicules or vacuoles lying in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus. They correspond in position, size and form to the dictyosomes as observed in the impregnation preparations. The dictyosomes differ in size and shape according to the difference of the species. Sudan black {{with the support of}} a variety of staining methods does not usually stain the dictyosomes, but colors a kind of granules occurring in the cytoplasm. Neutral red also does not stain the dictyosomes, but there are other granules stained uniformly red with this dye. These granules are identical in nature with the sudanophilic granules and are observable under the phase microscope. It seems apparent that they are the so-called 'lipochondria' designated by Baker. The Golgi apparatus as generally demonstrated with several classical methods in neurones of vertebrate animals appears in the structure of a network which is localized surrounding the nucleus or situated at one site of the cytoplasm, forming the so-called Golgi area. However, closer examinations reveal that it actually consists of individual strands which are entirely discontinuous from each other. Such Golgi strands show a variation in size and shape according to the species of animals (Textfig. 1) : they vary in a series ranging from a simple dictyosome-like body to an elongated one with their one end lying on the other. They are of a simple type in neurones of the silver carp and of a more developed or complex type in neurones of the domestic fowl, rabbit and cat. Observations of fresh neurones with phase optics have revealed the occurrence of canalicules or vacuoles, either scattered in the cytoplasm around the nucleus, or assembled in one portion of the cytoplasm. They are a general feature of the Golgi apparatus as found in living neurones. The Golgi strands are not stained with various Sudan black staining methods, although sudanophilic granules are observed in the cytoplasm of the neurones. These granules are stained homogeneously red with neutral red in the supravital staining method. They are similar in nature to those occurring in neurones of invertebrate animals and evidently are 'lipochondria'. Neutral red does not usually <b>stain</b> <b>supravitally</b> the Golgi canalicules or vacuoles. The results derived from the present author's investigations based on the neurones of some invertebrates and vertebrates have presented evidence indicating that there is no fundamental difference between the dictyosomes and the Golgi network-apparatus, and that the former consist of a number of simple Golgi strands, while the latter is an agglomeration of Golgi strands of variable size and shape in the general appearance of a network, the component elements of which are discontinuous from each other. The Golgi strands practically differ in length, girth and degree of bending in different species of animals: they tend to be greater in length and degree of bending in animals which are higher in evolutionary scale...|$|E

These changes are regarded as an inflammatory reaction to foreign body stimuli, being similar to that caused by other inflammatory stimuli. 2) Four days after inoculation, spindle-shaped tumor cells and large mononuclear cells appeared and thereafter the former proliferated focally to show a characteristic arrangement. The features of the tumor cells were presented by distinctly shaped nuclei, large nucleoli, and by amorphous homogeneous cytoplasms in which neutral red and janus green stainable granules could hardly be observed, except occasional appearance of large vacuoles in themselves. 3) From the <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> pictures of the tumor, {{it is probable that}} the spindle-shaped tumor cells are derived from both adventitial cells of the blood vessels and connective tissue cells.

40|$|The {{present study}} showed that many neurons in the adult rat brain possessed a perineuronal sulfated {{proteoglycan}} surface coat which reacted to cationic iron colloid and aldehyde fuchsin.

The surface coat was also stained with GÃ¶mÃ¶ri's ammoniacal silver and doubly stained with GÃ¶mÃ¶ri's ammoniacal silver and cationic iron colloid. The surface coat was usually expressed together with a nerve cell surface glycoprotein net detectable with lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin. These findings indicate that the perineuronal proteoglycan surface coat is identical to Cajal's superficial reticulum and contains some collagenous elements. It was further demonstrated that collagenase digestion erased GÃ¶mÃ¶ri's ammoniacal silver impregnation within the perineuronal proteoglycan surface coat...|$|R

In the presence of blood serum all the living cell nuclei observed were not <b>stained</b> <b>supravitally,</b> except some mature erythroblasts and nucleated red cells. 2. In isotonic saline, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 solutions all the erythroid cell nuclei were stained deep by B. C. B., N. B., N. R., slightly by J. G. but not by E.

In the case of the fixatives containing picric acid the results ware almost the same and yet the supravitally stainel granules changed the original color to rather yellowish ones. Whereas the method established by the author, the application of the Nessler's method, proved to be the most excellent one. By this method most of the <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> granules are fixed on the cells retaining their fine structure. The poet-staining of the nucleus can be made by hematoxylin.

40|$|In 1958, SENO et al has {{successfully}} fixed the dye granules in the <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> bone marrow cells and Yoshida tumor cells {{by the use}} of mercuric potassium iodide solution which is known as the reagent for the quantative determination of NH(3). But, the fixation method is not perfect for electron microscopy, because the resulted precitants of mercuric potassium iodine-dye complex is easily soluble in pure alcohol, and {{there is a possibility that}} the complex is lost during dehydration. Hereupon, the author tried to substitute the dye complex with mercuric sulfide which is insoluble in water, alcohol and ether and by this substitution the granules should be retained safely through dehydration for electron microscopy. Observations revealed that the stable complex of the dye. HgS can be produced in the site of dye granules by exposing the cells, which were previously <b>stained</b> <b>supravitally</b> and treated with mercuric potassium iodide, to (NH(4)) (2) Sx solution. The fine structure of the protoplasma proved to be retained through the treatment with (NH(4)) (2) Sx solution giving almost the same picture as those treated only with mereric potassium iodide solution added an equal volume of 2 % osmic acid solution (pH. 7. 4). Electronmicroscopic observation on the cells <b>stained</b> <b>supravitally</b> with Janus green B and fixed by the method just mentioned revealed that Janus green B granules appear as opaque masses of uniform in density or rings having thick opaque walls and scanty in contents. Morphologic observation proved granules are the mitochondria themselves, because some of them showed the inner structure like cristae. Treatment with (NH(4)) (2) Sx seems to increase the opacity the dye granules, and the prolonged treatment results in the formation of black masses irregulare in shape. The result obtained is almost the same as demonstrated by SENO et al, but in my experiment the possility of solving out of dyes from some cytoplasmic area has been complexely devoided. And now it can safely be said that Janus green stains mitochondria selectively. Dye, even in its lenco type, is not detected in the ground substance of cytoplasm. These observations refute the theory proposed by LAZAROW and COOPERSTEIN in which they claim that the Janus green B enters into the cytoplasma diffusely, but mitochondria only can be recognized as the stained granules by the oxidation of Janus green B. There are some of mitochondria remain without staining, but any other cytoplasmic elements are rat stained by Janus green B as far as the cells the author observed...|$|R

Observation revealed that the quantity of penetrated dye in a bone marrow cell at pH 7. 0 in one minute was 19. 4 x 10 (- 11) mg in average. The value was found to decrease with the decreased pH of the staining media reaching nearly zero at PH 3. 2. In a more acidc media the penetration of the dye increased again but supposed by the destruction of the cell wall.

40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} of the neurones of Cambarus clarkii consists, in osmium or silver preparations, {{of a number}} of small, black or dark brown bodies {{in the form of a}} rod, thread or crescent, and scattered in the cytoplasm around the nucleus.

Observations of living neurones with phase optics reveal the occurrence of corresponding bodies in the cytoplasm which are provided with canalicules or vacuoles and darker appearing walls. The canalicules and vacuoles have been observed to represent internal cavities of the Golgi bodies. The lipochondria are granular and homogeneously black or dark brown in classical Golgi preparations. Under the phase microscope, they are slightly yellowish with a dark periphery, showing no internal cavity. The Golgi bodies are not usually <b>stained</b> <b>supravitally</b> with neutral red or methylene blue.

40|$|The auther {{successfully}} fixed stained granules of the <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> {{bone marrow}} cells {{by the use}} of mercuric potassium iodide solution for quantative determination of NH(3). Insoluble complex of the dye can be produced by the reaction between dimethylamino rdaicals of the dye and mercuric potassium iodide. The fine structure of the protoplasma can be retained by using mercuric potassium iodide solution added an equal volume of 2 % osmic acid solution (pH 7. 4) for the fixation. Electronmicroscopic observation on the bone marrow cells <b>stained</b> <b>supravitally</b> with Janus green B and fixed by the solution just mentioned revealed that Janus green B granules appear as electron dense mass or rings having thick walls and it has been proved these granules are nothing but the mitochondria themselves, from the morphologic pictures of those less electron dense granules. The electron density of the granules should be given by mercury. As the reaction of the dye with mercuric potassium iodide should occur in both colored and non-colored leuco-Janus green as well, because the reaction has no relation with reduction or oxidation of the dye, then, the results, show that Janus green B stains mitochondria selectively, but on other elements of cytoplasma. Osmic acid is proven to have an ability to oxidize the leuco-Janus green B to a colored one in vitro, and the light microscopic observations of the cells treated with the fixatives just mentioned showed only the green mitochondria without any coloration of other cytoplasmic area. This again shows the Janus green enters into mitochondrira selectively. These observations refute the theory propored by Lazarow and Cooperstein in which they claim that the Janus green entors into the cytoplasma diffusely, but mitochondria only can be recognized as the stained granules by the oxydation of Janus green B. But, there are some of mitochondria remain without staining. Any other cytoplasmic elements are not stained by Janus green B as far as the cells the auther observed. As an exceptional case, in reticulocyte, Janus green stains endoplasmic reticulum but not the mitochondria, giving the picture of Substantia Granulo-Fiamentosa (SGF), themselves. This may mean the changes in chemical components of the organellae in reticulocytes as they are differentiated to synthesize haemoglobin...|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} of selected hydrolytic enzymes of oil-induced peritoneal, normal alveolar, and BCG-induced alveolar macrophages have been studied. On a per cell or nitrogen basis the normal alveolar cells contained considerably more acid phosphatase, cathepsin, acid ribonuclease, lysozyme, and lipase than peritoneal cells. The BCG-induced alveolar macrophage exhibited {{increased levels of}} acid phosphatase, lysozyme, and lipase as compared to alveolar macrophages from unstimulated rabbits. The morphological differences between these cells was discussed and electron micrographs of the BCG-induced macrophage presented. Fractionation of the BCG-induced macrophage by differential centrifugation showed that 60 to 80 per cent of the total cell content of acid phosphatase, cathepsin, beta glucuronidase, acid ribonuclease, acid deoxyribonuclease, aryl sulfatase, lysozyme, and lipase were localized in a postnuclear fraction which sedimented at 15, 000 g. This fraction also contained {{the majority of the}} mitochondria as evidenced by its content of cytochrome oxidase. Non-specific esterase was not localized to this fraction. A separation of the hydrolase-containing particles and mitochondria was achieved by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation. Under the conditions employed, the mitochondria distributed at densities of 1. 19 to 1. 20, whereas the hydrolase particles sedimented to a density of 1. 26 to 1. 27. Each of the hydrolases including acid phosphatase, beta glucuronidase, cathepsin, lysozyme, and acid ribonuclease exhibited maximum activities in the same gradient fraction. The isolated granules exhibited enzymatic latency, and activation could be achieved by cycles of freezing and thawing or surface active agents. The majority of each of the hydrolytic enzymes could be liberated in a non-particulate form by mechanical trauma.

But the granules appeared too opaque to see the detailed inner structure of mitochondria. Then, the author tried to retaine the potassium mercuric iodide dye complex through the dehydration process by using a specific dehydration media for electron microscopy. In vitro experiment on the precipitants, the mercuric potassium iodide dye complexes, proved that this complex is dissolved easily in pure ethanol, but is not dissolved in 50 % ethanol. On the author hand, the complex is not dissolved in ethyl-ether, but dissolved ether-ethanol mixture (1. 1). The test done by lowering the ethanol contents in ether proved that the dye does not dissolved in the ether containing 20 % ethanol. On {{the basis of these}} observations the author tried to retain the complex through dehydration and succeeded in observing the mercuric-dye complex in the cells under electron microscope by making the sections from the cells dehydrated through 50 % alcohol, ether containing 10 % of pure ethanol and then pure ether, imbibed with ether-methacrylatemonomer and methacrylatemonomer, and embedded in mathacrylate by the aid of benzoyl peroxide. The electronmicroscope observation on the cells <b>stained</b> <b>supravitally</b> with Janus green B, fixed by the method deviced by SENO, dehydrated and embedded by the method just mentioned, proved that the minute structure of the cells are kept as well as in those fixed with 1 % osmic acid and dehydrated by the routine method. In the series of observation on the cells treated with Janus green B in the different period of staining, the processes of the invasion of dye into mitochondria and the deformation of the inner structure have bean traced. After a short period of staining, the dye has acted as scarecely to increase the opacity of mitochondria but a marked change in they structure occured by the ring formation at one end of mitochondria. More deeply stained ones the appear very dark but in the dark area some opaque droplets are recognized. In this case, too, the less opaque pole were seen at the end of mitochondria, in which the structure of cristae were observed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of phagocytosis on the morphological and biochemical properties of macrophage hydrolase-containing granules {{has been studied}} in vitro. Following the uptake {{of large numbers of}} heat-killed bacteria, an intracellular rearrangement of hydrolytic enzymes occurred. This was associated with the solubilization of 50 to 60 per cent of the total cell content of acid phosphatase, cathepsin, lysozyme, beta glucuronidase, acid ribonuclease, and acid desoxyribonuclease and with a corresponding decrease in granule-bound enzyme. With more prolonged incubation the majority of the soluble intracellular pool of acid ribonuclease and lysozyme was lost to the extracellular medium. No change in the total content of any of the hydrolases was noted during 180 minutes of incubation in vitro. The morphological fate of the granules was studied by a histochemical method for acid phosphatase. After the phagocytosis of yeast cell walls there was a disappearance of acid phosphatase-positive granules and an accumulation of reaction product about the ingested particle. Experiments employing macrophages which were <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> with neutral red also demonstrated the loss of neutral red-positive granules and the accumulation of the dye about the yeast cell walls. These results strongly suggest that lysis of macrophage granules occurs following phagocytosis and that a portion of the granule contents are then resegregated within the newly formed phagocytic vacuole...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} suggests that human immunodeficien-cy virus (HIV) -infected macrophages and/or lymphocytes may mediate sexual transmission of HIV. We and others have previ-ously demonstrated that when vitally stained donor mouse lym-phocytes or macrophages are placed in the vaginas of mice, some of the stained cells can later {{be found in the}} iliac lymph nodes. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the extent of mono-nuclear cell trafficking from the vagina and to test the possibility that carrageenan formulation, a sulfated polysaccharide for-mulation containing 3 % PDR 98 - 15 carrageenan (PC- 515; FMC Biopolymer, Rockland, ME), a vaginal microbicide, would pre-vent vaginal transmigration of macrophages. When <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> mouse macrophages and T cells were inoculated into the vagina of recipient mice, discrete numbers of donor cells mi-grated to the recipient iliac and inguinal lymph nodes and spleen. When recipient mice were preinoculated with the car-rageenan formulation, the number of macrophages in lymph nodes and spleen was reduced by. 90 %. In contrast, a meth-ylcellulose formulation, which is believed to be inactive, did not significantly reduce migration to the lymphoid organs. Our find-ings suggest that the carrageenan formulation blocks cell traf-ficking of macrophages from vagina and that blocking does not result from cytotoxicity. Blocking cell trafficking may help to prevent sexual transmission of HIV. cervix, female reproductive tract, ovulatory cycle, toxicology, va-gin...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been directed {{to the definition of}} the mechanisms of ovum trans-port through the mammalian oviduct and the reasons for its discontinuous time course. In the rabbit, ova move through the ampulla in a few minutes and then take about 60 h to enter and traverse the isthmus. Although both ciliary and muscular activity have been suggested as the propulsive forces for movement of ova, direct evidence that contractions cause movement of mammalian ova has not been reported. Recent-ly, {{it has been shown that}} ovum-induced stretch of the avian oviduct promotes ovum transport (Tab and Kek#{ 228 }i#{ 228 }inen, 1976). Instan-taneous movements of natural rabbit ova within the oviduct can only be monitored by visual ob-servation of <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> ova in a cumu-lus mass. Transport of the cumulus mass through the midampulla can occur when isopro-terenol is used to abolish gross muscular activ-ity (Halbert et al., 1976). However, isopro-terenol has been shown to be diioexcitatory (Foster et al., 1976) and cilia appear to be in-efficient in moving denuded ova (Blandau, 1969). In the rabbit, ova rapidly become de-nuded of cumulus cells at the region of the ampullary-isthmic junction; the surface and physical properties of the transported parti-cle during the majority of the sojourn in the oviduct are those of a mucin covered sphere 1 50 - 400 p in diameter. As in other muscular tissues, mechanical activity of the smooth muscle of the oviduct is preceded and triggered by action potential...|$|R
40|$|By {{the methods}} {{reported}} in the previous papers the anther observed the <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> granules on the nucleus stained with hematoxylin. As the results it has been revealed that in lymphocytes, monocytes, myelocytic cells and Yoshida sarcoma cells, Janus green B stains mitochondria selectively but not the other components. The irregular forms of mitochondria stained with Janus green B can be recongnized frequently. This {{seems to be the}} result of the structural demolition caused by the staining itself. But in some cells the number of mitochondria which are stained by this dye, is rather small compared with those found under the phase-contrast or the electron-microscopes. Then it is assumed that Janus green B stains mitochondria selectively but not all of them. In general neutral red seems not to stain Golgi apparatus selectively, and neutral red granules are found to be irregular, both in their distribution in cytoplasma and in their size, all the granules being almost round in shape. But in small cells like monocytes, sometimes in lymphocytes the granules tend to gather in the area of Golgi zone. This thendency is recongnized especially markedly in the cells from the lower animals In the rosette formation of the neutral red Yoshida sarcoma cells have almost the same picture as that of monocytes but their mitochondria stainable with Janus green B are larger in number compared with those of monocytes. Brilliant crecyl blue and Nile blue seem also to stain mitochondria, but some other components like endoplasmic reticulum, neutrophilic granules and others in leucocytes, which can be stained by these dyes as the stained granules are very large in number and show marked variety in their sizes...|$|R
40|$|Toxic" {{neutrophils}} from humans {{with severe}} bacterial infections, {{identified by the}} presence of Döhle bodies, "toxic" granules, and vacuoles were shown to differ from normal neutrophils both in ultrastructure and in lysosome activity. Döhle bodies were identified as lamellar aggregates of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Toxic granules corresponded to the azurophilic granules usually identified by Romanowsky stains only in neutrophil precursors. By electron microscopy such granules were large, electron-dense, and peroxidase positive; they could usually be distinguished from the smaller, less dense, "specific" granules also present in control neutrophils, but in the latter they became visible by light microscopy only after prolonged staining or following fixation with glutaraldehyde. These observations suggest that toxic granules represent an abnormal staining reaction of the large dense granules in the toxic cells, and not phagocytized material, newly formed abnormal granules or autophagic bodies. Alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly greater in toxic neutrophils than in normal ones; 80 % of the activity of both was located in the lysosome fraction. Beta glucuronidase was normal. Total acid phosphatase was normal, but the percentage located in the nonlysosome fraction of toxic neutrophils was increased, suggesting that lysosomes were "labilized. " Formation of neutral red vacuoles in <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> preparations, an index of lysosome activity, occurred more rapidly in toxic neutrophils. This reaction paralleled degranulation and the formation of clear vacuoles in unstained wet mounts and could be blocked by colchicine, a lysosome stabilizer, or enhanced by procedures which activate lysosomes. "Autophagic" vacuoles were observed by electron microscopy in some toxic neutrophils. These observations are discussed in relation to the concept that the "toxic" neutrophils in severe bacterial infection reflect cellular immaturity and/or stimulation or degeneration...|$|R
40|$|The only method which satisfactorily {{preserves}} {{neutral red}} in sections of tissue <b>supravitally</b> <b>stained</b> is that reported by Cash (1) or certain modifications of it [...] {{for the study}} of monocytes and epithelioid cells in the lungs of animals experimentally infected with tuberculosis. Cash slowly injected into the ear vein 15 co. of a 1 per cent solution of neutral red, dissolved in normal salt solution. In this manner he secured a true supravital staining of the connective tissue cells of the lungs. Any damage to the cells brings about diffuse staining of cytoplasm and nuclei and obscures those structures which are significant in the so-called supravital reaction. It {{is an essential part of}} the technique, therefore, to secure this reaction first. 10 minutes after the injection the rabbit was quickly killed. Thin slices of the lungs were fixed in Zenker-formol solution for from 12 to 24 hours. These blocks of tissue were quickly dehydrated, without washing, in acetone, cleared in benzene or xylol, and rapidly embedded in paraffin. Thin sections were then stained with various dyes, avoiding alcohols and water as much as possible. This method gave uniformly good results with lung tissue. Prior to the experiments of Cash, McJunkin (2) reported a method forstaining tissue supravitally and embedding it in paraffin. He exsanguinated animals from the carotids under light ether anesthesia and then injected saline solution, saturated with neutral red, directly into the tissues. The tissues were fixed in a Zenker formol solution. McJunkin states that the contact with the dye is irregular and that no observations can be made within the areas in which the cells are injured. Indeed, the weakness of the interstitial method of introducing the neutral red is the unevenness and uncertainty of obtaining a supravital reaction of the cells. Gardner (3) states that the technique of lVIcJunkin proved to be inapplicabl...|$|R
