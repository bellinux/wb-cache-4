2500|$|The hair {{of the bow}} {{traditionally}} {{comes from}} {{the tail of a}} grey male horse (which has predominantly white hair), though some cheaper bows use synthetic fiber. Occasional rubbing with rosin makes the hair grip the strings intermittently, causing them to vibrate. Originally the stick was made out of <b>snakewood,</b> but modern day bows are now traditionally made of brazilwood, although a stick made from a more select quality (and more expensive) brazilwood is called pernambuco. Both types come from the same tree species. Some student bows are made of fiberglass or various inexpensive woods. [...] Some recent bow design innovations use carbon fiber for the stick, at all levels of craftsmanship. Inexpensive bows for students are made of fiberglass.|$|E
2500|$|Salazar Slytherin's wand {{contained}} {{a fragment of}} a basilisk horn, which allowed Slytherin and other parseltongues who possessed it to cast spells with it at a distance by speaking to it in Parseltongue. In the United States, wand cores are created from the horn of river serpents, Wampus hair, Snallygaster heartstring and Jackalope antlers, a practice originated in the 17th century by the first American wandmaker, Isolt Sayre, an Irish immigrant who founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Massachusetts, and the Slytherin wand's last owner. She buried it outside the school grounds, and within a year, an unknown species of <b>snakewood</b> tree grew from the burial spot. It resisted all attempts to prune or kill it, but after several years the leaves were found to contain powerful medicinal properties.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2016, J.K. Rowling {{revealed}} [...] on Pottermore that Slytherin's wand {{contained a}} fragment of basilisk horn, and was taught by its creator to [...] "sleep" [...] when instructed, which meant that it could place others who possessed the wand in a sleep from which they could only be awakened by {{the cries of the}} person's children. This secret was handed down through the centuries to each member of Slytherin’s family who possessed it. By the 1600s it belonged to the Irish witch Gormlaith Gaunt, though in about 1620 it was stolen by her then-17-year old niece Isolt Sayre, who fled to Massachusetts, where she founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She buried the wand outside the school grounds, and within a year, an unknown species of <b>snakewood</b> tree grew from the burial spot. It resisted all attempts to prune or kill it, but after several years the leaves were found to contain powerful medicinal properties.|$|E
60|$|His {{equipments}} were perfect. No {{one could}} excel him in, this respect. His bow was <b>snakewood,</b> backed with hickory. He carefully rubbed it down every evening {{with oil and}} beeswax, and it took its repose in a green baize bag. His arrows were Philip Highfield's best, his strings the finest Flanders hemp. He had shooting-gloves, and little leather tips that could be screwed fast {{on the ends of}} what he called his string-fingers. He had a quiver and a belt, and when equipped for the weekly meetings, he carried a fancy-colored wiping-tassel, and a little ebony grease-pot hanging from his belt. He wore, when shooting, a polished arm-guard or bracer, and if he had heard of anything else that an archer should have, he straightway would have procured it.|$|E

50|$|With Baroque bows {{the frog}} {{was made with}} either the same wood as the stick or ivory. The woods {{typically}} used were common exotic woods, such as <b>snakewood</b> or amourette.

50|$|Double bass bows vary in length, {{ranging from}} 60 to(-) 75 cm. In general, a bass bow is shorter and heavier than a cello bow. Pernambuco, {{also known as}} Brazilwood, is {{regarded}} as an excellent quality stick material, but due to its scarcity and expense, other materials are increasingly being used. Inexpensive student bows may be constructed of solid fiberglass, which makes the bow much lighter than a wooden bow (even too light to produce a good tone, in some cases). Student bows may also {{be made of the}} less valuable varieties of brazilwood. <b>Snakewood</b> and carbon fiber are also used in bows of a variety of different qualities. The frog of the double bass bow is usually made out of ebony, although <b>snakewood</b> and buffalo horn are used by some luthiers. The frog is movable, as it can be tightened or loosened with a knob (like all violin family bows). The bow is loosened {{at the end of a}} practice session or performance. The bow is tightened before playing, until it reaches a tautness that is preferred by the player. The frog on a quality bow is decorated with mother of pearl inlay.|$|E

Mapora palm (Oenocarpus mapora) is the dominant sub-canopy tree and Mabea occidentalis is the dominant shrub in the understory. Above 750 m there are cloud forests dominated by mapora palm.Higher up there are elfin forests dominated by Clusia species.|$|E
50|$|The Carnarvon RegionThe Carnarvon region {{comprises}} Quaternary alluvial, aeolian {{and marine}} sediments overlying Cretaceous strata.

The Limestone strata are covered with Acacia startii and binervia shrublands outcrop in the north, where extensive tidal flats in sheltered embayments support Mangal vegetation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Snakewood</b> grows as a {{spreading}} tree, {{usually with}} two or three main trunks. It can grow up to five metres high and eight metres wide. Like most Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. These are bluish grey in colour, and may be up to eight centimetres long and eight millimetres wide. The flowers are yellow, and held in cylindrical clusters about three centimetres long. The pods are up to twelve centimetres long and eight millimetres wide, and have constrictions between the seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Amn — A land of merchants {{that lies}} {{to the north}} of Tethyr along the Sword Coast, this region is a fertile plain between {{mountain}} ranges to the north and south.

The capital city of Athkatla is a port along the coast. Much of the trade in the country is carried by a series of rivers. Athkatla and Amn formed the setting for the video game Baldur's Gate II.|$|E
