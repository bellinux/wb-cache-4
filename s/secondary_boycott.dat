25|$|Until 1995, Israel's {{trade with}} the Arab world was minimal due to the Arab League boycott, which was begun against the Jewish {{community}} of Palestine in 1945.

25|$|The {{amendments}} {{gave the}} General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board discretionary power to seek injunctions against either employers or unions that violated the Act. The law made pursuit of such injunctions mandatory, rather than discretionary, {{in the case}} of secondary boycotts by unions. The amendments also established the General Counsel’s autonomy within the administrative framework of the NLRB. Congress also gave employers the right to sue unions for damages caused by a <b>secondary</b> <b>boycott,</b> but gave the General Counsel exclusive power to seek injunctive relief against such activities.|$|E

25|$|Like the ILWU, which {{conducted}} symbolic {{strikes in}} which it refused to handle goods going to fascist states in the 1930s or from apartheid-era South Africa in the 1980s, the ILA conducted similar boycotts aimed at trade with the Soviet Union during periods of crisis, such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Supreme Court ruled in two companion cases in the 1980s that the union's boycott could not be enjoined under the Norris-LaGuardia Act, {{but that it was}} an unlawful <b>secondary</b> <b>boycott</b> that could be outlawed on that basis under the Taft-Hartley Act.|$|E
25|$|With {{his party}} in the majority, Hartley served as the {{chairman}} of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 80th United States Congress. Along with United States Senator Robert A. Taft who was Chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee, the next year he introduced legislation to curb what he felt were the worst of labor's excesses. The resultant Taft-Hartley Act was a major revision of the 1935 Wagner Act (officially known as the National Labor Relations Act) and represented the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by the post-war Congress. The act placed limits on labor tactics such as the <b>secondary</b> <b>boycott,</b> and gave each state the option to enact right-to-work laws if it so chose (24 states have done so). This provision, known as Section 14 (b), {{was one of the most}} controversial of the entire act.|$|E
25|$|Medina {{began working}} {{full-time}} for the UFW in 1966. He worked in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, helping {{to ensure that}} non-union grapes were not shipped overseas and that wine made from non-union grapes was not sold in stores. He worked closely with Dolores Huerta, and was jailed. In the fall of 1967, César Chávez sent him to Chicago, Illinois, to launch the Midwestern segment of the national boycott that formed {{the second part of}} the Delano grape strike. He was so shy that he often could not speak during interviews or press conferences, but he built one of the most successful boycott operations in the country, which ultimately helped force the growers to sign historic contracts in 1970. While in Chicago, he also raised several thousand dollars for the UFW. In January 1968, Medina crossed the nation with a school bus of farmworkers to build support in the Northeast for a <b>secondary</b> <b>boycott</b> of products made from Delano grapes. He concluded that Ross' organizing techniques did not translate well into urban areas and to secondary boycotts, and he began developing his own techniques and ideas about building support among non-farmworkers based on his Chicago experiences. Medina returned to the Midwest, and began holding sit-ins in supermarket chains to publicize the farmworkers' plight, encourage consumers to stop eating table grapes, and pressure stores to stop carrying the produce. Many supermarket chains stopped selling grapes. He won widespread praise for his Midwest campaign.|$|E

500|$|In 1887, Taft, then aged 29, was {{appointed}} to a vacancy on the Superior Court of Cincinnati by Governor Joseph B. Foraker. The appointment was good for just over a year, after which {{he would have to}} face the voters, and in April 1888, he sought election for the first of three times in his lifetime, the other two being for the presidency. He was elected to a full five-year term. Some two dozen of Taft's opinions as a state judge survive, the most significant being Moores & Co. v. Bricklayers' Union No. 1 (1889) if only because it was used against him when he ran for president in 1908. [...] The case involved bricklayers who refused to work for any firm that dealt with a company called Parker Brothers, with which they were in dispute.

2500|$|Section 8(b)(4) of the Taft-Hartley Act forbade unions {{from putting}} {{economic}} pressure (such as a <b>secondary</b> <b>boycott)</b> on third party employers.

But prior to the passage of Taft-Hartley, this was common, especially in industries (such as construction and trucking) where on-time delivery of goods was critical. [...] Since the 1880s, many unions had negotiated [...] "hot cargo clauses" [...] in their collective bargaining agreements. [...] These agreements permitted the union's members at the secondary employer to refuse to handle goods or provide services to the primary employer with whom the union had a dispute.|$|E

2500|$|The Arab-Israeli {{war ended}} on 10 March 1949 with a decisive Israeli victory. On 6 February 1950, King Farouk of Egypt issued a decree under which manifests and cargoes of ships could be searched {{to ensure that}} no [...] "war contraband" [...] was present on vessels bound {{directly}} or indirectly for Israel. War contraband included arms, munitions, and war material. However, article 10 additionally stipulated that other goods were to be considered [...] "contraband" [...] and were to be treated as war material — ships, chemicals, motor vehicles, money, gold, and fuel of any kind. At the time 90% of Israeli oil was supplied by Iran and imported through the Straits of Tiran. To prevent Iranian oil from entering Israel, Egypt blockaded the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba. Oil tankers proceeding through the Suez Canal were required to submit documentation to guarantee none of their cargo would arrive at an Israeli port. To enforce the policy of denying strategic goods to Israel, the decree authorized {{the use of force against}} any ship attempting to avoid search, including live gunfire, to make it submit to inspection. If a ship were to subsequently allow a search and reveal that they were not carrying any [...] "contraband", the ship would be allowed to continue its voyage. However, if the ship resisted a search by force, it would be considered to have violated its neutrality. For this [...] "hostile act", ships were to be seized and their cargo impounded even if they were not found to possess any [...] "contraband". Ships found or suspected to transgress the Egyptian shipping practices delineated in this decree were blacklisted by Egypt and denied free use of the Suez Canal. The decree of February 1950 signaled a shift in the policy of the Arab League. The boycott's immediate purpose had originally been to prevent direct Arab trade with Israel (called a primary boycott). With this decree the boycott was expanded to the interruption of international trade with Israel (a <b>secondary</b> <b>boycott).</b> On 8 April 1950, the Arab League Council embraced this shift, approving a decision by its political committee to the effect that all ships carrying goods or immigrants to Israel were to be blacklisted.|$|E
