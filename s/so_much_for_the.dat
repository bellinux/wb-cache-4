He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club in the community.|$|E

500|$|From Lamia, Philip went to Phalara. There he met {{representatives from}} the neutral states of Egypt, Rhodes, Athens and Chios {{who were trying to}} end the war—they were trading states and the war was likely hurting trade. Livy says that they were {{concerned}} [...] "not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Aetolians, who were more warlike {{than the rest of the}} Greeks, as for the liberty of Greece, which would be seriously endangered if Philip and his kingdom took an active part in Greek politics." [...] With them was Amynandor of Athamania, representing the Aetolians. A truce of thirty days and a peace conference at Achaea were arranged.|$|E
500|$|Knox was notable not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{overthrow}} of Roman Catholicism in Scotland, but for assuring {{the replacement of}} the established Christian religion with Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism. It was thanks to Knox that the Presbyterian polity was established, though it took 120 years following his death for this to be achieved in 1689. Meanwhile, he accepted the status quo and was happy to see his friends appointed bishops and archbishops, even preaching at the inauguration of the Protestant Archbishop of St Andrews John Douglas in 1571. In that regard, Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination, whose members number millions worldwide.|$|E

Julie Nixon Eisenhower stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately, had she known of their existence.

Believing in her husband's innocence, she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him.

500|$|For many in Britain {{during this}} time, attitudes towards the {{breakaway}} colony were {{complicated by the}} fact that [...] "Plucky Little Rhodesia", often described as [...] "more British than the British", had given <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mother country in its fight against Nazi Germany. Smith's own military service and reputation for bravery gave rise to similar sentiments regarding him personally. White Rhodesians widely hailed him a war hero, as did many overseas commentators. In 1966, Smith's supporters in Britain sent him a painting depicting two Spitfires taking off for a dawn raid, [...] "on behalf of many British people who remained true despite the misguidance of government". Smith retained his affection for the Spitfire; in his memoirs he described it as [...] "the most beautiful aircraft ever made." [...] He also retained some proficiency in the Italian language, though according to one Italian visitor his accent was [...] "atrocious".|$|E

Thank you <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> support and appreciation. This means the world to me." [...] At the fourth Nokia Music Connect video conference, Chopra said that the commercial numbers for [...] "In My City" [...] were all the more surprising, since the music sales in the Indian market is not that much. Universal Music MD, India, Saarc Devraj Sanyal said that the label was surprised with the instant sales of the song. [...] "We have been in the non-film music business for a while and I must admit to mounting engines across all platforms that have been fired like never before on Priyanka's global single debut. But to see these results so quickly is beyond gratifying," [...] Sanyal said, before saying that the single debut would be followed by many promotional campaigns targeting different multimedia facets.|$|E

500|$|Jannon's career {{took place}} during a {{politically}} tense period. Jannon was a Protestant in mostly Catholic France. After apparently working with the Estienne family in Paris he set up an independent career as printer in Sedan {{in what is now}} north-eastern France, becoming printer for the Protestant Academy. By his report he took up punchcutting seriously in his thirties, although according to Williamson he would have cut decorative material and engravings at least before this. Sedan the time enjoyed an unstable independence as a principality {{at a time when the}} French government had conceded through the Edict of Nantes to allowing a complicated system of restricted liberties for Protestants. While acknowledging his talent and commissioning equipment from him, as documented by the surviving purchase order, it is known that authorities in 1644 raided an office in Caen where he had been commissioned to do printing. Warde initially assumed that this was the source of the Jannon materials in the Imprimerie Nationale before the government's purchase order came to light. Jannon's types and their descendants are recognizable by the triangular serifs on the top left of such characters as 'm', 'n' and 'r', which have a very steep slant in Jannon's design compared to Garamond's. The italics are also very different to Garamond's own or Granjon's, being much more ornate and with considerable variation in angle of the capitals. Opinions of Jannon's engraving quality have varied; Warde found them [...] "of slight value as a book face" [...] and Vervliet described them as [...] "famous not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> quality of the design but as for the long-term confusion it created", although many reproductions of his work were successful in printing in the twentieth century. Jannon cut far more types than those surviving in the Imprimerie collection: before the misattribution to Garamond, he was particularly respected for his engraving of an extremely small size of type, known for his workplace as sédanoise, which was popular.|$|E
