The Ohm and Tolmekians leave the Valley, and the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them to rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts next to Nausicaä's lost aviation goggles.|$|E
5|$|The ground has {{undergone}} several major changes since its original construction in 1905. The original Main Stand, boasting a press loft and a balcony above the roof, burnt down in 1921, {{and was replaced}} by the current <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 1922–23 campaign. The new Main Stand was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, so there was a ban on smoking in the stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.|$|E
5|$|Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for {{the opening}} <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> latter fell for 65. Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket. Barnes' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes. After Bradman {{departed}} at 403/3, wickets began to fall more regularly, but Hassett held up his end and made 110, while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50. Surrey's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4/104. On the second afternoon, Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings. Johnson took 5/53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out, but received little support, the next highest scores being 15 and 10. Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day. They made continual inroads on the final day, and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win. Johnston took 4/40 and Johnson 3/40.|$|E

5|$|The stadium {{was built}} with one <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> opening of another in 1928 which could hold 18,000 people to replace an earth embankment. It hosted its first {{international}} match in March 1911 with a Welsh match against Scotland. Towards {{the end of}} its lifespan, the ground eventually was replaced by Cardiff Arms Park as increasing doubts mounted over the safety of the aging ground. The club record attendance in the ground is 57,893 which was achieved during a league match against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. The record stands to this day, and is unlikely to be beaten due to the scaling down of grounds throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to safety fears, which saw the ground capacity fall to 22,000. In its final years of its use, the club was forced to seek special dispensation from authorities {{in order to keep the}} remaining standing areas of the ground open as clubs at Championship level or above were given three years to redevelop their grounds to remove standing areas.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} account (by the Official Annamese Chronicles) {{states that}} Taksin {{was ordered to}} be executed in the traditional siamese way by General Chao Phraya Chakri at Wat Chaeng: by being sealed in a velvet sack and beaten {{to death with a}} scented sandalwood club. There was an account claiming that Taksin was secretly sent to a palace located in the remote mountains of Nakhon Si Thammarat where he lived until 1825, and that a substitute was beaten to death in his place. King Taksin's ashes and those of his wife are located at Wat Intharam (located in Thonburi).

25|$|As Pino's narrow column {{advanced}} to pierce the Spanish right-center, {{it began to}} come under galling fire from the flanks. Ignoring his orders, Pino panicked and sent Fontane with one battalion each of the 2nd Light and 7th Line to the right. He directed General of Brigade Luigi Mazzucchelli to the left with the remaining two battalions of the 2nd Light and three battalions of the 4th Line. The attack broke the Spanish first line but came to a <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> second line, halfway up the hillside. Reding ordered the Españoles Hussars to charge and sent his whole line forward. Mazzucchelli's Italians faltered and were chased back to their starting point.|$|E
25|$|Australia's {{team was}} {{unchanged}} once again, while the sudden retirement of Swann prompted England to select Panesar. Prior was also dropped for Bairstow. Michael Clarke won the toss {{for the fourth}} time in the series and elected to bowl. Cook and Carberry started well and added 48 for the opening <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> former edged Siddle for 27. England's scoring rate was slow and their top order all made starts – Carberry scored 38, Bell made 27 and Root 24, but only Pietersen went on to score a half century. Johnson removed Stokes and Bairstow in quick succession {{at the end of the}} day to shift the advantage back to Australia, with the score 6/226 and Pietersen on 67.|$|E

25|$|Moore made a <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> old Roman town of Lugo on 6 January {{and offered}} battle but, initially, Soult's forces were too strung out. Over two days Soult {{concentrated}} his troops {{and tried to}} get Ney to send a division from Villa Franca del Bierzo but Ney sent few troops. By the 8th Soult was prepared for battle, but Moore, imagining Ney was outflanking him, slipped away that night, shooting 500 foundered horses and destroying artillery caissons and food stores. Now realizing he could not get to Vigo and fearing his army would disintegrate on the way, he ordered the transports to Betanzos Bay between Corunna and Ferrol and he headed for Corunna.|$|E
25|$|Among the Horseman's Word {{group in}} Angus, {{initiation}} ceremonies typically {{took place at}} night, preferably {{at the time of}} the full moon, in an isolated barn, byre, stable, or steading. An individual known as the High Horseman would be seated in this space, holding a cloven goat's hoof in his hand; he would preside over the ceremony. The apprentice was then stripped to the waste and blindfolded, and spun around by his fellows in order to disorient him before being brought into the ceremonial space and made to <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> High Horseman. The High Horseman asked a series of set questions of his fellows at which they responded with a series of set answers. Turning to the initiate, who I made to kneel and has his blindfold removed, the High Horseman then commanded the newcomer to provide vows to keep to the group's secrets. This achieved, all those assembled then recited the Horseman's Creed, which reminded them of the punishments that should befall them should they break their vows. Following the ceremony, a ceilidh was held in which toasts were made and the assembled horsemen drank from whisky that the apprentice had been required to bring with him.|$|E
25|$|The madbaha, {{arranged}} in the topmost platform {{at the eastern}} side of the building, represents Heaven. The primary altar is attached to the eastern wall. To the north of the madbaha is the diaqonikon (sacristry); to the south is the baptistery. The madbaha is protected with rails and is veiled by a red curtain most of the time; this is opened during the Holy Qurbana (Eucharist). An oil lamp within the sanctuary is kept glowing at all times to represent the presence of God. The madbaha is connected to the qestroma and haykla by a low-walled path called the sqaqona. The qestroma contains seats for the choir and lower clergy. The haykla contains an elevated platform or bema, which includes an altar, two lecterns for reading, and chairs for higher clergy. Worshipers <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> altar, with separate seating for men and women. The main entrance is on the western side of the building; a vestibule, pillars, pilasters, and other architectural ornaments adorn the front end, and a flag mast stands in the front yard. One or two bells are installed in the back yard to signal the timing of ritual services, the death of a church member, or to inform the public of calamities.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Main Stand burnt down in 1921, and {{was replaced}} by the current <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 1922–23 season. The ground underwent extensive redevelopment during the 1930s, and the capacity by the start of the Second World War was 30,000. Floodlights were installed before the 1953–54 season, but it was 20 years before any further modernisation was carried out. In 1973 the Bobbers Stand became all-seated, and in 1985 the grass pitch was replaced with an artificial playing surface; it quickly became unpopular and was derided as [...] "the plastic pitch".|$|E
