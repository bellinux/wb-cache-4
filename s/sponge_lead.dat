40|$|AbstractA {{time domain}} {{reflectometry}} (TDR) -based system for the localization of water leaks has been recently developed by the authors. This system, which employs wire-like sensing elements to be installed along the underground pipes, has proven immune to the limitations that affect the traditional, acoustic leak-detection systems. Starting from the positive results obtained thus far, in this work, an improvement of this TDR-based system is proposed. More specifically, the possibility of employing a low-cost, water-absorbing sponge to be placed around the sensing element for enhancing the accuracy in the localization of the leak is addressed. To this purpose, laboratory experiments were carried out mimicking a water leakage condition, and two sensing elements (one embedded in a sponge and one without sponge) were comparatively used to identify {{the position of the}} leak through TDR measurements. Results showed that, thanks to the water retention capability of the sponge (which maintains the leaked water more localized), the sensing element embedded in the <b>sponge</b> <b>leads</b> to a higher accuracy in the evaluation of the position of the leak...|$|R

The upper sediment layers (0 to 2 cm) in the immediate sponge vicinity were characterized by an increased bacterial colonisation with cell abundances on average 3 times higher than those in reference sediments. Similar results were obtained for bacterial secondary production, measured by simultaneous incorporation of the radioactive-labeled substrates 3 H-thymidine and 14 C-leucine. Our data show a high heterogene-ity of deep-sea sediments with a pronounced patchy distribution of particulate organic carbon (POC), and a significant enrichment of POC in the sediments next to T. semisuberites. Cell-specific 3 H-thymidine and 14 C-leucine incorporation rates indicate that the quality rather than the quantity of POC around <b>sponges</b> may <b>lead</b> to the observed increase in cell abundances and protein synthesis.

Basing on the preliminary evaluations on collagen content, four marine sponges Hyattella cribriformis, Fasciospongia cavernosa, Callyspongia fibrosa and Dysidea fragilis belong to the families Spongiidae, Thorectidae, Callyspongiidae and Dysideidae of the class Demospongiae, were chosen for macromolecular and micro-anatomical comparison. Microscopic examinations were performed to understand the form and arrangement of skeletal components in each sponge, where unique skeletal composition and spongin distribution is typical for all the sponges except D. fragilis, which is highly embedded with diversified oxeae. Biochemical analyses were performed to resolve the macromolecular content for each sponge species. Sponge D. fragilis was found to possess less protein content (57. 26 ± 3. 36 mg/g freeze-dried sponge wt) when compared to other sponges and significantly, C. fibrosa possess high protein (209. 55 ± 9. 53 mg/g) and other macromolecular contents, except pentose (24. 12 ± 1. 21 mg/g).

40|$|Bronchoplastic {{techniques}}: Plastic-reconstructive {{techniques in}} thoracic surgery {{have led to}} significant reductions of morbidity and mortality. Particulary the so-called sleeve resections are now commonplace in non-small cell carcinoma in stage I–IIIA, with rather similar five-year survival as conventional resections. Even with infiltration of large vessels (T 4 -stage), this technique can be applied even in the curative approach, e. g., replacement of the pulmonary artery by a vascular prosthesis (“double sleeve resection”). Extended resection of the anterior and lateral chest wall: Malignant tumors of the chest wall are caused by infiltration of the so-called T 3 -carcinoma of the lung, by primary bone tumors (e. g., chondrosarcoma) or by osseous metastases from extrathoracic malignancies (e. g., breast cancer). After “en bloc-resection” of the chest wall including the surrounding lung parenchyma, the large defect is covered by a muscle rotation flap (M. latissimus dorsi). Sometimes these muscle flaps can not be used, for example in cachexia. In these cases, the bony thoracic defect is reconstructed by a Goretex-patch (Goretex Dualmesh). Then the patient undergoes laparotomy or laparoscopy and dissection of the omentum of the great curvature of the stomach while preserving the right epiploic artery. Through a subcutaneous tunnel, the omentum is displaced to the thoracic wall to cover the Goretex-patch. To accelerate the wound healing, the omentum {{is covered with a}} polyurethane sponge, which is pressed with a suction of 125 mm Hg (vacuum therapy). At about 4 weeks, the healed omentum can be covered with a split skin graft. Intrathoracic infections: Severe thoracic infections (empyema, lung abscess) are usually caused by a pneumonia (80 %) or are the consequence of operative complications (e. g., bronchial stump insufficiency). The infection is not curable with the conventional irrigation drains. Often the muscle rotation flaps fail, too. The combination of the transposed greater omentum and polyurethane <b>sponges</b> (VAC) <b>leads</b> to a faster cleaning of the soiled thoracic cavity and accelerates the wound granulation. With this technique, even unfavourable cases could be rehabilitated. Sternal wound infections: The osteomyelitis of the sternum is a potentially life-threatening complication (mediastinitis), especially after cardiac surgery. In these cases, the vacuum therapy (VAC) with polyurethane sponges have contributed to the improved prognosis. Firstly, a more rapid debridement is provoked, and second the chest wall will be stabilized more quickly, because the VAC reduces the shear forces in a dehiscence of the sternum. After reaching clean conditions, a muscle flap or the greater omentum are interposed for final wound closure...|$|R
40|$|Sponges {{from the}} phylum Porifera, Latin porus, “pore”; ferous, “bearing”(Borror 1988) are {{essential}} yet often overlooked in coral-reef ecosystems. Marine sponges {{are among the}} oldest, structurally simplest multicellular sessile animals that {{bridge the gap between}} single celled organisms (protists) and more complex Metazoans (Kaplan 1988, Taylor et al 2007). Although they lack complex tissues and organs seen in higher Metazoa, they are nevertheless a highly successful group of animals due to their aquiferous filtering system, cell totipotency, and plasticity of their body (Brusca and Brusca 2003). As a prolific producers of bioactive metabolites, they have considerable ecological importance due to their abundance and ability to filter enormous volumes of seawater (Taylor et al 2007). In each section of this report, I will discuss a topic relating to all sponges, dive further into explination specifically for Clionid sponges, and lastly compare two case studies for the topic involving Clionids exclusively. The aim of this review is to examine recent developments in the understanding of a variety of sponge aspects and to help others understand basic sponge biology and lifestyles while further explaining why Clionid sponges specifically are of importance and how they impact the worlds oceans. A coral reef is a tropical shallow-water photosynthetic scleractinian coral community colonized and strongly affected by octocorals, algae, and other invertebrates such as sponges, that secrete calcium carbonate (Rutzler 2004). The entire reef system operates through different animal-plant symbioses which construct limestone through secretion and cementation (Rutzler 2004). The health of different coral reef communities have been attributed to how fast limestone is created versus eroded within certain vicinities, along with many other factors. Sponges participate in all aspects of these processes thus playing an especially important role (Neumann 1966, Diaz and Rutzler 2001, Rutzler 2004). Rutzler (2004) claims that modern sponges can no longer be solely included with coral reef framework builders because they clearly impact the coral reef stabilization as well as its destruction due to the major processes of bioerosion and lithification (Goreau et al. 1979). After Diaz and Rutzler (2001) studied sponge diversity, abundance, productivity and nutrient cycling from Carrie Bow Caye on the barrier reef in Belize, they explained that sponges have multiple properties that make them influential part of coral reef ecosystems. These characteristics include high diversity, high abundance, calcification capabilities, acting as primary producers of nitrification through symbioses, having different chemical and physical adaptations for space competition with the potential to change the chemistry of the water column. Sponges are of particular interest in the medical field and researchers have looked specifically at the sponge-bacteria relationship as a possible source of natural medicines after isolating antimicrobial compounds (Stierle and Stierle 1992, Imamura et al 1993, Jayatilake et al 1996, Bultel-Ponce et al 1997, Webster et al 2001 b). Also, many sponges produce and release antibiotics that play a role in their own defense by warding off hungry predators, being encroached on by aggressive neighbors, or overgrown by fouling organisms. (Ruppert and Fox 1988, Stierle and Stierle 1992, Imamura et al 1993, Jayatilake et al 1996, Bultel-Ponce et al 1997, Webster et al 2001 b). Recently, a collection of important bioactive compounds have been discovered as antibiotics in sponges, many having potential pharmacological significance (Brusca and Brusca 2003). Specifically, two different Clionid species; Cliona celata (Keyzers et al 2008), Cliona patera (Sawangong et al 2008). I will not discuss these in this report, but they are noted for completeness sake. The discovery of these natural products in sponges has led to a renewed interest in and a desire to understand sponges. Sponges of the family Clionidae have long been known for the ecological impact they cause by riddling limestone objects which they inhabit in most marine environments (Rutzler 1975). Clionid sponges {{are one of the most}} important framework bioeroders on coral reefs. They have the ability to out compete stressed corals, so any dramatic increases in the area or abundance of these <b>sponges</b> could <b>lead</b> to an increase in the breakdown of the reef framework and reduce the opportunity for reef recovery (Callahan et al 2005). They are extremely strong reef space competitors aggressively undermining and displacing live coral tissue (Rutzler 1975, 2002 a; Lopez Victoria et al 2003, Lopez-Victoria 2 ̆ 6 Zea 2005). Researchers also find boring sponges of importance when reconstructing paleoenviromental records by measuring the size of bore holes in reefs compared to the geological record (Edinger and Risk 1996, Zundelevich et al 2007) ...|$|R
