5|$|On August 24, 2011, the Palomar Transient Factory {{automated}} survey {{discovered a}} new Type Ia supernova (SN 2011fe) in the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101) shortly after it burst into existence. Being only 21 million lightyears away and detected <b>so</b> <b>early</b> after the event started, it will allow scientists {{to learn more about}} the early developments of these types of supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Triton {{is thought}} to be a {{captured}} dwarf planet. Phoebe is a captured body that, like Vesta, is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, but {{is thought to}} have been <b>so</b> <b>early</b> in its history.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidate}} that wins {{the election and}} assumes office is eventual President of South Korea Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil). His administration begins with his undertaking the grand task of forwarding talks of reunification between the North and South after witnessing the grim reality that is the struggle between the two nations. With strong ambitions, he leads diplomatic outreaches with the North that no one expected of a candidate <b>so</b> <b>early</b> in his term.|$|E

5|$|The huge {{extent of}} the mediaeval parish of Llanbadarn made Sunday worship {{impossible}} for distant inhabitants, <b>so</b> <b>early</b> centres with a Christian identity like Llanychaearn and Llaneithr would act as chapels of ease, and later churches whether built by Welsh princes (such as Llanfihangel-y-Creuddyn) or Norman lords (e.g. Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn) were also subordinate to Llanbadarn before developing as separate parishes. Churches like Llanbadarn with a large hinterland of lesser churches are often known as mam-eglwysi, mother churches. There were no parishes in Wales prior to {{the coming of the}} Normans.|$|E
5|$|The third type was the Canadian Pacer, {{which was}} {{historically}} better documented {{than the other}} two types. Canadian Pacers were likely the result of breeding pacing horses imported from France with Narragansett Pacers from New England. The resulting horses were known for their ability to race on ice. From there, they were exported to the United States, where North Carolina became a breeding center, later exporting them to Tennessee in the late 1700s. Pedigrees were not maintained, <b>so</b> <b>early</b> breeding histories are often impossible to trace. The Canadian Pacer influenced the Tennessee Walker, the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred.|$|E
5|$|These were {{difficulties}} {{which seemed}} rather {{to require the}} superior force of a Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of a raw and unexperienced pen; for I believe I may boast that none ever appeared <b>so</b> <b>early</b> upon the stage. However, such was the candour of the audience, the play was received with greater satisfaction than I should have promised myself from its merit, had it even preceded the Provoked Husband.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{division}} of Francia into a Neustrian, Austrasian, and Burgundian Kingdom dates {{only from the}} late 6th century, <b>so</b> <b>earlier</b> kings who ruled from Soissons or Paris are here excluded.|$|R
50|$|Estoppel by silence or acquiescence: Estoppel that {{prevents}} {{a person from}} asserting something {{when he had the}} right and opportunity to do <b>so</b> <b>earlier,</b> and such silence put another person at a disadvantage.|$|R
50|$|Deuring {{the fifteenth}} and sixteenth centuries, there are records {{of people from}} Raon {{repopulating}} the neighbouring village of Bellefontaine, which had been abandoned a century or <b>so</b> <b>earlier,</b> probably {{as a result of}} plague.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the early}} exit in the Houston Regional {{due to the}} upset by the Aggies, Humber {{looked forward to the}} Major League Baseball Draft. Niemann, and Townsend were all {{selected}} along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft— the first time three teammates had ever gone <b>so</b> <b>early</b> in the same draft. Only twice had three teammates been taken in the first round, most recently when Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected {{in the first round of}} the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{were less}} prepared. While they {{anticipated}} a German invasion, with possible Finnish support, Stalin {{did not expect}} an attack along the entire border <b>so</b> <b>early.</b> The border was heavily fortified, but Soviet leadership was unprepared for the German attack. The formation opposing Silver Fox was the Northern Front, consisting of the 7th and 14th Armies. They were commanded by Lieutenant-General Markian Popov. On 23 August 1941, the Northern Front was split up into the Karelian Front and the Leningrad Front, commanded by Valerian Frolov and Popov. Frolov remained {{in command of the}} Karelian Front until 1 September, when he was promoted and replaced by Roman Panin. During the first weeks the Axis would have a numerical superiority, as the Soviets only had 150,000 men north of Lake Ladoga along the border.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} sense of {{imminent}} threat in Grand Forks, but the cities could not prepare for such an enormous flood. The National Weather Service (NWS) had a long-standing forecast for the river to crest at 49feet (14.9m), which was the river's highest level during the 1979 flood. The cities {{had been able to}} get their dikes to this level, but the river continued to rise past it, to the astonishment of the NWS (which did not upgrade its forecast until April 16, the day the river actually reached 49feet). The dikes in the low-lying Lincoln Drive neighborhood of Grand Forks were the first to break, doing <b>so</b> <b>early</b> on April 18. Other dikes over the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks area would fail that day and the next, flooding thousands of homes.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{consular}} office Verus held was {{as governor of}} Germania Inferior, possibly arriving there in 154. Birley notes that [...] "Verus' dispatch to govern a province where he had commanded a legion a decade or <b>so</b> <b>earlier</b> is relatively unusual." ...|$|R

5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} <b>so</b> <b>early</b> in the primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, {{as well as from}} Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{now known}} as Opuntia ficus-indica, or the Indian fig cactus, {{has long been an}} {{important}} source of food. The original species is thought to have come from central Mexico, although this is now obscure because the indigenous people of southern North America developed and distributed a range of horticultural varieties (cultivars), including forms of the species and hybrids with other opuntias. Both the fruit and pads are eaten, the former often under the Spanish name tuna, the latter under the name nopal. Cultivated forms are often significantly less spiny or even spineless. The nopal industry in Mexico was said to be worth US$150million in 2007. The Indian fig cactus was probably already present in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived, and was soon after brought to Europe. It spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area, both naturally and by being introduced—so much <b>so,</b> <b>early</b> botanists assumed it was native to the area. Outside the Americas, the Indian fig cactus is an important commercial crop in Sicily, Algeria and other North African countries. Fruits of other opuntias are also eaten, generally under the same name, tuna. Flower buds, particularly of Cylindropuntia species, are also consumed.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, thus ruining her emotionally, but subsequently apologizes. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back to work <b>so</b> <b>early.</b> Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, causing him to cry in front of Meredith and Yang.|$|E
50|$|Local {{residents}} {{believed the}} gas blowout started before SoCalGas admitted to discovering it, and many residents reported having unexplained illnesses {{a week or}} <b>so</b> <b>earlier.</b> According to KPCC's website, some residents posted complaints of earlier symptoms on a Porter Ranch gas leak Facebook page.|$|R
50|$|Members had {{originally}} wished {{to call themselves}} simply The Club until {{it was discovered that}} they had been beaten to it: a hundred years or <b>so</b> <b>earlier</b> the name had been claimed by Dr Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds for their renowned dining society.|$|R

25|$|Davis began {{fundraising}} for his 2002 {{reelection campaign}} {{early in his}} governorship. Davis raised $13.2 million in 1999 and $14.2 million in 2000, both unprecedented sums at the time <b>so</b> <b>early</b> in an elected term. Davis' 1999 and 2000 contributions included contributions from Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International. Davis also received large contributions from labor groups, environmental groups and individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of Vernanimalcula <b>so</b> <b>early</b> in {{the fossil record}} was believed to have had important implications if it were really bilaterian. The radiation of animals into many phyla would have occurred before any animal became much larger than microscopic size, making the sudden {{appearance of}} many animal phyla in the Cambrian explosion an illusion and merely represented a (geologically) sudden increase in size {{and the development of}} easily fossilised body parts by species in existing phyla.|$|E
50|$|Guaymas, Mexico (GYM) {{also appears}} on this route map; however, Bonanza was not serving Guaymas {{at this time}} {{although}} it {{had the authority to}} do <b>so.</b> <b>Earlier</b> in 1968, the airline also served Apple Valley, California (APV) with F-27 flights; however, service to this destination was then discontinued.|$|R
50|$|Coincidentally, California {{record company}} {{executive}} Burt Stein also was visiting WNBC. He asked out loud if anyone knew what Bob Pittman was doing.

25|$|Because {{they were}} {{superseded}} <b>so</b> <b>early</b> {{in their lives}} by more modern forms of traction, and because they spent {{so much of their}} remaining lives stored for seasonal grain traffic and/or in poor condition, the R class achieved one of the lowest average mileages of any VR locomotive. The lowest was that of R 716, which recorded just 88,909 miles (143,085km) in just four years of service before being withdrawn in 1956 and scrapped in 1962.|$|E
25|$|The dikes in the low-lying Lincoln Drive {{neighborhood}} of Grand Forks {{were the first}} to break, doing <b>so</b> <b>early</b> on April 18, as the river kept rising. Other dikes in the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks area failed that day and the next, flooding thousands of homes. During this time, Grand Forks mayor Pat Owens ordered the evacuation of more than 50,000 people, much {{of the population of the}} city. This was the largest evacuation in the United States since the evacuation of residents in Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|EuroBasket 2001 ended as an {{unexpected}} failure to Lithuania. The group stage started with two victories, 82–60 over Ukraine and 68–59 with Israel, before losing to France 65–76. A match against fellow Balts Latvians {{would give a}} spot in the knockout stages. And there Lithuania suffered {{an unexpected}} and overwhelming defeat to the Latvians, 64–94. By falling <b>so</b> <b>early,</b> Lithuania lost all the chances of participating in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, and was threatened to miss the next EuroBasket as well. The disappointment made head coach Jonas Kazlauskas resign.|$|E
50|$|He printed {{huge numbers}} of texts for the {{expanded}} public school system, but in the 1920s there was no agreement about how the Mexican Revolution should be portrayed, <b>so</b> <b>earlier</b> history texts by Justo Sierra, who headed the ministry of public education {{in the government of}} Porfirio Díaz continued to be used.|$|R
