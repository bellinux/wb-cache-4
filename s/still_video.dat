50|$|Nikon's first {{digital camera}} (<b>still</b> <b>video</b> camera, with analog storage) was the Nikon <b>Still</b> <b>Video</b> Camera (SVC) Model 1, a {{prototype}} which was first presented at photokina 1986. The follower Nikon QV-1000C <b>Still</b> <b>Video</b> Camera was produced since 1988 mainly for professional press use. Both cameras used QV mount lenses, {{a variant of}} Nikon F-mount lenses. Via an adapter (QM-100) other F-mount lenses can be fitted.|$|E

30|$|For face {{recognition}} in surveillance scenarios, identifying a person captured on image or video {{is one of}} the key tasks. This implies matching faces on both <b>still</b> images and <b>video</b> sequences. It can be further classified into three categories: still image to <b>still</b> image matching, <b>video</b> sequence to video sequence matching, and <b>still</b> image to <b>video</b> sequence matching.|$|R
40|$|Many {{consumers}} {{use both}} <b>still</b> and <b>video</b> cameras to capture memorable events. The {{purpose of this}} research is Lo determine why conwmers choose to use both kinds of cameras to capture these events. To explore this issue, we conducted an ethnographic study combining sem-structured interviews with questionnaires and observations of events that consumers captured with <b>still</b> and <b>video</b> cameras...|$|R

50|$|Examples {{of spatial}} {{applications}} include {{the requirement to}} display small characters and to resolve fine detail in <b>still</b> <b>video,</b> or in motion video that contains very limited motion.|$|E
5000|$|Video floppies {{were first}} {{developed}} by Sony and introduced under the [...] "Mavipak" [...] name in 1981 for their Mavica <b>still</b> <b>video</b> camera (not {{to be confused}} with their later line of Mavica digital cameras introduced in the mid-1990s, which stored JPEG images to standard 3.5-inch floppy disks readable by computers instead). The video floppy format was later used by Minolta, Panasonic, and Canon for their <b>still</b> <b>video</b> cameras introduced in the mid-to-late 1980s, such as the Canon Xapshot from 1988 (also known as the Canon Ion in Europe and the Canon Q-PIC in Japan).|$|E

50|$|For {{an image}} of {{specified}} quality, e.g., resolution and color fidelity, freeze-frame television has a lower bandwidth requirement than that of full-motion television. For this reason, NASA, which refers to this technique as sequential <b>still</b> <b>video,</b> uses it on UHF when Ku band full-motion video signals are not available.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, Sony {{unveiled}} the Portapak, the first self-contained video tape analog recording {{system that was}} portable. On 25 August 1981, Sony unveiled a prototype of the first <b>still</b> <b>video</b> camera, the Sony Mavica. This camera was an analog electronic camera that featured interchangeable lenses and an SLR viewfinder.|$|E
50|$|A <b>still</b> <b>video</b> {{camera is}} a type of {{electronic}} camera that takes still images and stores them as single frames of video. They peaked in popularity in the late 1980s and {{can be seen as the}} predecessor to the digital camera. The best known models include the Sony Mavica and Canon's Ion and Xapshot cameras.|$|E
40|$|Three {{trends that}} promise to {{increase}} CMOS image sensor system performance are presented: (i) modifications of deep submicron CMOS processes to improve their imaging characteristics, (ii) developments that {{take advantage of these}} modified deep submicron processes, and (iii) high frame rate sensors and applications to <b>still</b> and <b>video</b> imaging, specifically to extending sensor dynamic range. Recent research on Digital Pixel Sensors and applications of its high frame rate to <b>still</b> and <b>video</b> imaging are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The Sony Ruvi is {{an analog}} video and <b>still</b> <b>video</b> camera {{released}} in 1998. The Ruvi was considerably smaller {{than any other}} camcorder available at the time, at 124 &times; 66 &times; 44.1 mm and 380g. This made the Ruvi small enough to keep inside a shirt pocket. Ruvi is an abbreviation of Recording Unit by Video.|$|E
50|$|A {{monoscope}} was {{a special}} form of video camera tube which displayed a single <b>still</b> <b>video</b> image. The image was built into the tube, hence the name. The tube resembled a small cathode ray tube (CRT). Monoscopes were used beginning in the 1950s to generate TV test patterns and station logos. This type of test card generation system was technologically obsolete by the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Besides <b>still</b> <b>video</b> cameras, {{stand-alone}} recorders & {{players were}} also {{available for the}} VF format, that could record from or output a composite video signal, to or from an external source (such as a video camera, VCR, video capture card, or computer graphics output). Some VF recorders also had the feature of recording {{a couple of seconds}} of audio that accompanied each video frame.|$|E

50|$|Cinema EOS is {{a branch}} {{off from the}} {{existing}} EOS line of cameras that date back to 1987 {{with the introduction of}} the analog Canon EOS 650. With many Canon DSLRs adding motion video capabilities starting with the Canon EOS 5D Mark II in 2008, Canon decided to focus on making cameras specially designed for motion video instead of just producing <b>still</b> <b>video</b> cameras with some motion video capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Zoom and superzoom lenses are {{commonly}} used with <b>still,</b> <b>video,</b> motion picture cameras, projectors, some binoculars, microscopes, telescopes, telescopic sights, and other optical instruments. In addition, the afocal part of a zoom lens {{can be used as}} a telescope of variable magnification to make an adjustable beam expander. This can be used, for example, to change the size of a laser beam so that the irradiance of the beam can be varied.|$|E
50|$|The Canon EOS C500 is Canon's second {{camera to}} {{form part of}} the Canon Cinema EOS line, {{complementing}} the previous Canon EOS C300. Notable new features compared to the previous camera are the addition of 4K and QHD motion video capture to the previous 2K and HD capture of the C300 {{and the ability of}} the C500 to record raw motion video to the Motion RAW format as well as raw <b>still</b> <b>video</b> to Still RAW format.|$|E

50|$|Video is {{shot through}} the same lens as <b>still</b> images. <b>Video</b> {{resolution}} choices are 176 x 144 and 128 x 96 and appear to be 15 frames per second. Video clip length choices are Maximum and Default. Default will produce a clip suitable for sending via MMS, or roughly less than 300KB. Other menu choices for video mirror those for still images. Both <b>still</b> and <b>video</b> images may be saved either to the phone memory or to the storage card.|$|R
