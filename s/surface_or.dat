5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road <b>surface,</b> <b>or</b> suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E
5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> seepage erosion.|$|E

After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up into the cell and may remain in the intracellular space, be shipped to the cell <b>surface,</b> <b>or</b> be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into secreted proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase. ApoE may be the signalling ligand responsible for ApoER2's role in modulating the JNK signalling pathway.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Phobos is below {{synchronous}} altitude, the tidal forces from the planet Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50 million years, it could either crash into Mars's <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> break up into a ring structure around the planet.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} onto the <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle {{onto the surface}} of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E

40|$|The surface {{modeling}} capability of CAD systems {{is widely used}} to design products bounded by free form surfaces and curves. However, the <b>surfaces</b> <b>or</b> curves generated by popular data fitting methods usually have shape imperfections such as wiggles. Thus, fairing operations are required to remove the wiggles, which makes the <b>surfaces</b> <b>or</b> curves smooth. This paper proposes a new method based on the wavelet transform for fairing the <b>surfaces</b> <b>or</b> curves while preserving the continuity with adjacent <b>surfaces</b> <b>or</b> curves. The wavelet transform gives a hierarchical perspective of the surfaces and the curves, which can be decomposed into the overall sweep and details, i. e., local deviations from sweep like the wiggles. The proposed fairing method provides a similar effect on the mathematical surface {{as that of the}} grinding operation using sandpaper on the physical surface...|$|R

5|$|About 40% of {{the subway}} system runs on <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> {{elevated}} tracks, including steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole exceptions of at-grade junctions of two lines in regular service are the 142nd Street junction, the Rogers junction and the Myrtle Avenue junction, whose tracks both intersect at the same level.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the <b>surface,</b> <b>or</b> photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E

5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body <b>surface,</b> <b>or</b> lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E
5|$|Paint-like gels (which are {{dispensed}} from {{pipes and}} can be transported through portals) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them. Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly, blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface, and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals. Only one type of gel can be effective on a certain surface at a time only. Some surfaces, such as grilles, cannot be coated with a gel. Water can block or wash away gels, returning the <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> object to its normal state.|$|E

5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E

The structural coloration on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.|$|E

It is not motorway standard from the M54 J7 to the Shrewsbury ring road, because laybys {{would need to be}} removed and a hard shoulder would also need to be built which could cause delays to traffic.|$|E

5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{placement}} of P.auricoma within Parasola is somewhat controversial. It {{has often been}} classified in the section Auricomi, a grouping of species characterized {{by the absence of}} a veil, and the occasional presence of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem), pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap <b>surface),</b> <b>or</b> dark setae-like elements. Several molecular phylogenetics studies have confirmed its inclusion in the Parasola clade, but its relationship to other members of the group have not been fully resolved due to limited sampling. A recent analysis suggests that in the phylogenetic tree of Parasola, P.auricoma and P.conopilus form a tritomy with the crown Parasola species.|$|E
5|$|The structuralist {{movement}} originated {{primarily from}} the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a system of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the <b>surface</b> <b>or</b> the appearance of meaning.|$|E
