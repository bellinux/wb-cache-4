40|$|Intra-ply shear is an {{important}} mechanism in thermoforming processes of UD fibre reinforced thermoplastic laminates. Various methods {{have been developed to}} characterise this shear mechanism, but measured properties differ for several orders of magnitude. The potential of another technique is shown in this paper. This approach considers a strip with a rectangular cross section, subjected to torsion. Several analyses have been carried out to determine the significant material properties for this loading mechanism. For clarity, isotropic and orthotropic elastic material behaviour was considered first. The response torque mainly depends on the in-plane shear modulus G 12. An extension was made to the analysis of anisotropic viscous material behaviour. Closed form solutions and FE simulations were compared, using a fibre reinforced viscous fluid model. The torsional response of a partially clamped strip was highly influenced by the fibre stiffnesses. Nevertheless, it is possible to relate the longitudinal viscosity to a closed form solution directly, if bulging is not suppressed and constant through the length of the strip. A <b>smart</b> <b>clamping</b> design is therefore required...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA <b>Smart</b> <b>Clamping</b> Force Control (SCFC) {{is adapted}} to hold {{sensitive}} workpiece using magnetic proximity switch during a machining operation on the CNC machine tool. It has been ascertained that work-holding of different workpiece materials and shapes during machining operation {{is one of the}} problems encountered during CNC milling machining operations. This work proposes a novel clamping strategy for workpieces with the aid of SCFC. The purpose of the study is to adjust the forward movement of the clamp and reduce the damage caused by the clamp on the workpiece, this depends on the material of the work-piece. The speed of the clamp is reduced using the inlet flow control throttle valve and a magnetic proximity switch (MPS). It provides careful handling of workpiece and prevent it from damage and as well optimizes the forward movement of the cylinder. The proposed strategy is based on dynamic machine loading in which the impact of applied forces were monitored to optimize the clamping control system of the machine tool. The mode of operation and performance of the SCFC were simulated in the FluidSIM® software, and the validated results was presented on Festo workstation. This work therefore further elucidate the fundamental design criterion for machine tool clamping forces and the sustainable manufacture of its components...|$|R

Verdigris claims that its patented sensors track energy through an always-on AI that consumes more detailed information {{than any other}} solution. Its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points than a utility smart meters—every hour. This enables Verdigris AI technology and algorithms to “learn” a building’s equipment over time. It tracks energy output down to the microsecond and has equipment-level data.|$|R
40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} <b>smart</b> {{composite beam}} <b>clamped</b> {{at one end}} and free at the other hand is considered. It consists of perfectly bonded elastic, viscoelastic and piezoelectric layers. The piezoelectric layer is activated by a voltage source. Fully dynamic and electrostatic approaches due to Maxwell's equations are both used to model the piezoelectric layer. By assuming that the complaint-layer has a negligible weight and stiffness, a Rao-Nakra type smart composite model is obtained in the state-space form, i. e. ẋ = A x + Bu. Next, we obtain a Mead-Marcus type model by neglecting the in-plane and rotational inertia terms. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions are obtained in the appropriate Hilbert spaces. Even though the fully dynamic Rao-Nakra model is shown to be unstable for certain choices of material parameters, by using the spectral multipliers, the electrostatic model is shown to be exponentially stable with three feedback controllers, as opposed to four controllers in Ozkan 3. We also show that the fully dynamic Mead-Marcus model lacks of stability for certain solutions whereas the electrostatic model is asymptotically stable by one feedback controller applied to the bending moment only.
