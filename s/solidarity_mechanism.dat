30|$|The first {{component}} is the tradable quotas system. Its principle {{is to determine}} a total number of asylum seekers/refugees to be hosted by the EU and a distribution of initial quotas across countries.

These issues must be addressed in any <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanism,</b> not just ours. The advantage of a tradable quotas system, however, is that it allows for revealing information on the true costs of accommodating refugees in the participating countries, and it allows (actually, forces) countries to exploit their comparative advantages in either “hosting” or “funding.” In other words, there are two ways by which countries can contribute to the public good of the “international protection of refugees:” through visas or through money. The market for admissions will allocate refugees so that the marginal cost of hosting them is equalized across destinations. The solution is efficient in that it minimizes the total cost (or, for a given total cost, allows for the accommodation of more refugees).|$|E

Similarly, little research has been done into CLIL discursive features and teacher student positioning in the Spanish university context. Focusing on university lectures by non-native speakers, the present paper explores the use of two relevant areas of stance: (i) pronominal forms, and their discursive functions; and (ii) modal verbs occurring within verbal clusters that accompany pronouns. The study is based on a quantitative analysis of these two linguistic devices in terms of number of occurrences and frequency. The results show that inclusive we {{is by far the most}} frequent pronominal form, functioning as a <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanism</b> and helping to establish common ground.

40|$|According to {{the brain}} drain argument, {{there are good reasons}} for states to limit the exit of their skilled workers (more specifically, {{healthcare}} workers), because of the negative impacts this type of migration has for other members of the community from which they migrate. Some theorists criticise this argument as illiberal, while others support it and ground a duty to stay of the skilled workers on rather vague concepts like patriotic virtue, or the legitimate expectations of their state and co-citizens. In this article, on the contrary, we suggest that the liberal conception of states’ legitimate political authority demands, and not just permits, that developing states from which migration of skilled workers occurs set up contractual mechanisms. These mechanisms will ensure that state-funded training in the health sector is provided against a commitment on the part of future professionals to reciprocate with their services for the benefits obtained. If one of the conditions for the state to maintain legitimate political authority is to provide basic services such as healthcare to its subjects (while respecting at the same time their autonomy and freedom), then this is what developing states affected by the brain drain ought to do. What we call the authority-based approach {{to the brain}} drain also helps to clarify the obligations that other states have not to interfere with these contractual mechanisms when they exist, and not to profit from their absence. Inspired by FIFA’s legal instruments of training compensation and <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the transfer of players, we conclude by suggesting a plausible global policy to complement this authority-based approach...|$|E

40|$|A decade ago, as the 1990 's opened, {{many small}} {{tentative}} steps were {{ventured into the}} new (at that time) business age. Which of football's leaders could then have foreseen the sheer scale and speed of football's economic revolution? Associated industries such as media, sportswear, advertising, and so forth have seen football as an attractive business and thus many off-the-field developments have speeded up its expansion. On the other hand, some sensible and regulative issues are threatening the traditional structure of European football. The change in the international transfer system, the continuous threat of a Super League, the discussion about regional leagues and the supremacy of UEFA as the single governing body are important matters {{that have to be}} handled carefully. The situation has become almost dramatic at the European level. Most of the participants are now swept along, whereas very few can claim to be in control. To have a chance within an era of stock market flotation, corporate takeovers and digital television, it is needed a defined strategy, a clear focus, top class people, financial resources and some luck! In this thesis we analyse how football is changing nowadays and which forces are pushing the industry to another direction at the clubs' level. The question here is to see to what extent the `golden era' for football with colossal sums of money entering the game through TV deals, sponsorship contracts, etc. - is turned into a situation where the football authorities put things back on an even keel. The particularities of football as a sport of masses and passions make it a very special business, where pure business strategies have to be combined together with social, cultural and educational issues totally intrinsic into the game. Those competitors taking part in UEFA competitions must look for profitable opportunities, where they can perform and increase their appeal among fans. Thus, the UEFA Champions League, as the most lucrative and prestigious European competition must be the target market for those `small' clubs outside the football elite. This study regards business strategy as mandatory for the survival of non-elite clubs in European competitions. We dearly hope to see investment in youth development, stadia & facilities, skilled business managers, the marketing and commercial infrastructure and brand development that will secure revenues for many years to come, community and fan base programmes, etc. But we worry that the lack of both support from the EU to the UEFA and powerful recognition of the specific nature of sport might drive the industry to a paradise just for the elite, where individual interests overwhelm the traditional football economics (competitive balance, <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanism,</b> input allocation, etc.) ...|$|E

Therefore, herds are still necessary for pastoral survival, but the security provided by herds is not always sufficient.

They are therefore obliged to remove too many animals from their herds, thus preventing the recovery of their stock. The economic situation of these settlements, at least 40 % of the population, is very precarious.

This article seeks to analyse how Germany has been portrayed in the French political discourse by focusing on the vast array of reactions to this new treaty. It will show a discursive struggle between three discourse types representing Germany as an evil force intent on dominating Europe, a virtuous ant unwittingly dominating Europe and an economic giant but a political dwarf.

The Alliance for Sweden electoral coalition who won the 2006 elections endorsed the idea that each section of the labour market should carry its own costs of unemployment benefits paid out to put pressure on the wage level and make the demand for labour to rise again and unemployment diminish. They claimed that a substantially larger part of the costs for the insurance should be financed by individual fees of the involved workers, conceiving to stop the intra-fund <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Consequently, from January 2007 fees to unemployment funds were raised significantly, most in funds with a high unemployment rate among the members. From July 2008 the differentiation of fund fess increased considerably. Massive membership losses followed in funds and trade unions. From 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008 Swedish unions lost in all 245 000 members (8% of active members) and union unemployment funds almost 400 000 members (11% of members). Including non-union unemployment funds (the independent Alfa fund and the unemployment funds for self-employed and employers) almost half a million members left the funds. From 1 January 2014 fund fees were restored to about the same level as before 2007.|$|R

Durkheim quite superﬁcially touches upon the topic of solidarity in contemporary society, but the reader has {{every reason to believe that}} durkheimian theory implies the upgrade of the fundamental bases and <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This article proposes to rebuild durkheimian social theory in order to demonstrate the continuity between religion and morality, as Durkheim supposes. Key to successful shift in emphasis from religion to morality is a return to the very key category of «sacred». Sacred is viewed as an integral part of the religious system which is true, but not comprehensive. The interpretation of «sacred» via «religious» overshadows an important fact, that the ﬁrst one is a generator for the latter. This weighty remark allows us to take the next step and say that just as for religious system of representations, sacred becomes the basis of morality. Here and now the author undertakes an attempt to release the category of «sacred» from a strict religious interpretation, traces the line of functional continuity between religion and morality and reveals a new perspective on the <b>mechanisms</b> of <b>solidarity</b> in contemporary society...|$|R
40|$|Solidarity {{is one of}} {{the core}} values of the European Union and has been {{recognised}} as a guiding principle of the EU asylum policy since the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is now incorporated into Article 80 TFEU, which provides that EU policies on border checks, asylum and immigration must be ‘governed by the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility, including its financial implications, between the Member States’. The need for solidarity in the area of asylum and migration {{stems from the fact that}} some Member States have more asylum seekers than others, some have more refugees than others, and some have more difficulties in coping with them for a number of geographic, economic and other reasons. A range of measures could be used to support the functioning of solidarity, such as: financial assistance, practical cooperation, relocation, resettlement, and joint processing. This paper will discuss the potentials and (limited) progress in applying some of these measures. It will start by discussing Member States’ obligations towards refugees under international and EU asylum law. The discussion will then move on to identifying the meaning of solidarity, its value in practice and Member States’ motivations for establishing <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Potential differences between solidarity, burden-sharing and responsibility-sharing will also be considered.

40|$|The article {{examines}} transfers between regions via {{the central government}} budget, referring essentially to the regional household accounts published by the National Accounts Institute. It examines only the aspects concerning allocation between the regions of that part of government revenue and expenditure {{for which there is}} no direct counter-consideration. The Flemish Region is currently a net contributor to transfers between regions via the central government budget, whereas the Walloon Region is a net recipient. The Brussels Capital Region also makes a net contribution, though only a small one. These transfers between regions are due largely to variations in the contributions of each region to government revenues. In the case of households, the contribution of the Flemish Region exceeds that of the other two regions; for businesses, it is the Brussels Capital Region that makes the largest contribution. In addition, these transfers originate from the regional allocation of social benefits. Thus, unemployment benefits entail transfers from the Flemish Region to the Walloon Region and the Brussels Capital Region. In contrast, transfers between the regions via pensions currently favour the Flemish Region. In regard to health care expenditure, there are hardly any transfers between the regions at present. Projections also show the importance of both the expected demographic trends and labour market developments for the future pattern of transfers between regions. The influence of demographic trends is most favourable for the Brussels Capital Region and least favourable for the Flemish Region. This is likely to increase the net contribution from the former while the latter’s net contribution will decline, even if the current labour market divergences largely persist in the future. In contrast, in the event of full convergence of employment levels, the inter-regional transfers paid by the Flemish Region would actually disappear altogether, and the Brussels Capital Region would become the sole net contributor, though in that case the inter-regional transfers received by the Walloon Region would decline sharply. Finally, international comparison shows that transfers between regions are relatively small in Belgium, compared to what is seen in other EU Member States. regions, transfers, <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} Communication for Development and Social Change (CDSC henceforth) has {{enriching}} practices in peacebuilding contexts, especially in post-conflict and fragile states, {{with the use}} of approaches like behaviour change, edutainment and participatory media that aim to contribute to peace goals of reconciliation and reconstruction of social fabrics. Despite this, what happens ‘on the field’ has not been translated into theoretical developments of CDSC and peacebuilding studies, with few exceptions like Citizens’ Media (Rodríguez, 2000), Communication for Peace (Hoffmann, 2013) and ICT for Peacebuilding (Hattotuwa, 2004). Based on the above-mentioned frameworks and retaking the seminal CDSC works of Andreas Fuglesang (1982), this dissertation explores the potentialities and uses of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs henceforth) {{in one of the most}} sensitive aspects for reconciliation in post-conflict countries, collective memory. Particularly, the research seeks to explore methods used by the organisations and its dialogue with local expressions of memory in the creation of content and narratives that might contribute to the local peacebuilding processes. This is done through two case studies of memory-related initiatives in Colombia that use digital literacy and content production as part of their process. The first case study is the Alfabetizaciones Digitales (AD, Digital Literacies in Spanish), a project of the National Centre for Historical Memory, that worked with victims’ memory initiatives in the creation of websites and multimedia content. The second is Revelando Barrios (RB, Revealing Barrios in Spanish) an initiative of the NGO Ciudad Comuna based on social photography with youngsters of the Comuna 8 of Medellín, Antioquia. Using a methodology that combines Key Informant Interviews, content and data analysis, the main findings pointed to three aspects. First, that there is a general pattern of non-deterministic ICT use in both projects, with potential to foster ‘empowering’ collective actions and inter-generational dialogue. Second, the content analysis allowed the identification of a potential influence of what Fuglesang calls ‘conventions’ of digital language -i. e. the rules for writing on the web- in the content produced for the AD case study. Thirdly, that the main limitations of ICT use are those linked to the digital divide and the sustainability of the process; though, it is noted that participants and implementers developed <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to alter the limitation of access to Internet and devices such as photo cameras.

In particular, it is suggested that solidarity potentially offers greater depth and maturity than principles such as cooperation, which have previously been the focus of attention, thereby better reflecting the diversity and complexity of our international society.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims to shed a {{light on}} the development of EU asylum law by recourse to the legal concept of 'mutual trust'. It argues that the quest for mutual trust between Member States constitutes one of the driving factors behind the development of EU asylum law, so that it provides an explanation for most of the tensions that have emerged between EU asylum law and the ECHR. It further explores ways of enhancing mutual trust between Member States while fully respecting the ECHR. Therefore, the dissertation starts with a definition of the legal concept of 'mutual trust'; it examines the emergence of mutual trust within the jurisprudence of the CJEU and its close ties with the EU harmonisation process. The dissertation then studies how and why the development of the EU asylum acquis aims to build mutual trust between Member States regarding the effective enforcement of asylum seekers' fundamental rights. Thanks to a study of the ECtHR and national (mainly Belgian) jurisprudence, the dissertation also identifies where and how mutual trust enters into tension with the obligation to respect asylum seekers' fundamental rights. Thereafter, the dissertation explores how the reinforcement of procedural rights and the development of <b>solidarity</b> based <b>mechanisms</b> between Member States could enhance mutual trust while guaranteeing the respect of asylum seekers' fundamental rights.

40|$|In this article, {{published}} in the August 2015 issue of THE GLOBAL ANALYST (magazine), the author provides {{a detailed analysis of}} the unfolding of the Greek crisis since it sparked off the Eurozone crisis in 2010 when it revised its early deficit prediction from 3. 7 per cent and estimated to be 13. 6 per cent. This article aims to explore, through granular economic data, how the high debt-stricken country has failed to assure a clear path to real long-term economic growth and sovereign debt sustainability, despite the implementation of tough austerity measures (i. e. internal adjustments’ program) over a period of five years (“The Great Recession” in the Euro zone) and major sacrifices for the Greek people. The article also has been written {{in one of the most}} acute phases of the Greek crisis (mid-July 2015), just a few days after the date when the country failed to make its € 1. 6 billion payment to the IMF, thus becoming the first developed country to go into arrears with the International Monetary Fund. Those were the days when Prime Minister Alex Tsipras unexpectedly called a referendum on the country’s latest bailout offer that international creditors have proposed to keep the debt-stricken country afloat, and when a new potential bailout program (a third bailout of would cost € 82 billion-€ 86 billion) was discussed by its major creditors (European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) to avoid the country’s potential exit from the Eurozone and default on the ECB payment due on July 20 th, 2015. Given the level of uncertainty on the potential future outcome of the new bailout decision at the time of writing, the author has explored in this article the pros and cons of a potential “Grexit” scenario (i. e. an exit of Greece from the Eurozone). The article aims to contribute to the debate about the changes needed to the Eurozone rules and treaties in order to avoid in the future other similar crises through a closer political and fiscal integration, and a strengthened financial, capital markets, and banking union, adequate <b>solidarity</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> permanent or at least temporary fiscal transfers, co-funded public mechanisms to support job flexibility in countries with high unemployment, and timely and effective “burden sharing” (fiscal backstop) crisis resolution mechanisms. and economic sustainability. Conclusion The new dramatic Greek crisis of 2015 and the political tensions that followed between the country’s government and its creditors concerning a potential “Grexit” scenario, the decision to grant a potential third bailout in five years, and the feasibility of potential debt relief to assure the country’s debt sustainability, have certainly contributed to increase uncertainty and volatility in the markets, while the Eurozone is still facing a phase of fragile economic recovery. Nevertheless, in spite of the painful tensions between the Greek government and the creditors and the dramatic resurgence of the Greek crisis, probably one positive outcome of this new crisis could be related to the sense of urgency experienced by a number of Eurozone leaders in the search of sustainable long-term solutions to such crises. Thus, this new dramatic event might represent a painful but necessary step towards a more integrated and unified Eurozone. The lesson learned from this new Greek crisis could lead to a new framework of the European rules and governance that might strengthen its resilience in the future to potential systemic shocks (economic, financial, banking, political or social crises). Yet, the ability and speed of the European political leaders and authorities to envision and implement, with the consensus of their citizens, new and effective institutional frameworks and rules to avoid in the future other potential member states' exit scenarios, will determine whether this new crisis has been useful to strengthen the Eurozone and its geopolitical, economic, social scope, otherwise, the currency area will remain incomplete, fragile, and fragmented and new potential crises might just be around the corner...|$|R
