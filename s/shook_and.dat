5|$|The North Acropolis of {{the ancient}} Maya city of Tikal in Guatemala is an {{architectural}} complex {{that served as a}} royal necropolis and was a centre for funerary activity for over 1300 years. The acropolis is located near the centre of the city {{and is one of the}} most studied of Maya architectural complexes. Excavations were carried out from 1957 to 1969 by the University of Pennsylvania, directed by Edwin M. <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> William Coe.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, a small {{airstrip}} {{was built}} at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days' travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In 1956 the Tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area. From 1956 through 1970, major archaeological excavations were {{carried out by the}} University of Pennsylvania Tikal Project. They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures. Excavations directed by Edwin M. <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969. The Tikal Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site. In 1979, the Guatemalan government began a further archeological project at Tikal, which continued through to 1984.|$|E

25|$|The Brooklyn Theatre stood a {{block from}} Fulton Street, the main {{thoroughfare}} to the Manhattan ferries and readily accessible to both New York and Brooklyn residents. It seated about 1,600 patrons. Both Conway and <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> Palmer sought out upscale productions with well-known actors and actresses. The Brooklyn Theatre became a well-respected house in Brooklyn's nascent theatre district, which included the smaller and older Park, Olympic, and Globe theatres.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 and 2008, {{people in}} {{southern}} Kalinga around Binuluan spoke of an 'eruption' at Sugo-oc in 1986 or 1987.

When speaking in English, the locals {{there at the}} time called this an 'eruption'. Gentle questioning of locals over months led to the conclusion that there are difficulties in communicating the difference between an eruption and an earthquake.|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and whether they are associated with co-sleeping. In Japan, co-sleeping is common during infancy and early childhood. This study investigates the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and their associations with co-sleeping among 4 -month-old infants in Japan. A questionnaire was administered to mothers who participated in a 4 -month health checkup program in Kamagaya City in Japan (n = 1307; valid response rate, 82 %). The questionnaire investigated the frequency of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering during the past one month, co-sleeping status, and living arrangements with grandparents, in addition to traditional risk factors such as stress due to crying. Associations between co-sleeping <b>and</b> self-reported <b>shaking</b> or smothering were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. The prevalence of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering at least one time during the past one month was 3. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 2. 4 %– 4. 3 %) and 2. 4 % (95 % CI, 1. 5 %– 3. 2 %), respectively. Co-sleeping was marginally associated {{with the amount of}} crying and not associated with stress due to crying. Further, co-sleeping was not associated with either self-reported shaking or smothering, although stress due to crying showed strong association with <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering. Co-sleeping was not a risk factor for <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering...|$|R

25|$|The King's County coroner, Henry C. Simms, {{convened a}} jury on the {{disaster}} which heard testimony through December and January 1877. When {{it was published}} {{at the end of}} January 1877, it was especially harsh on the theatrical managers, Sheridan <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> A. M. Palmer. The jury held <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> Palmer responsible for failing to take adequate precautions against fire, failing to train stage hands in either fire prevention or the management of incipient fires, failing to establish clear chains of command in the theatre's management, permitting the stage to become cluttered with properties and failing to maintain in good working order fire fighting equipment and emergency exits that had originally been installed. The jury found lesser fault with the design of the building, observing that the five-year-old structure had better exits than many other public buildings in the city. Fault was found with the stairways leading to the family circle and the auditorium, which lacked a firewall between the audience and the stage. In delivering the verdict, the jury reported that death occurred mainly through suffocation in the dense smoke that prevailed in the gallery, likely in the few minutes after Charles Vine dropped from the family circle to the balcony below.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the cave has been well known in modern times. Edward Thompson and Alfred Tozzer visited it in 1905. A.S. Pearse {{and a team of}} biologists explored the cave in 1932 and 1936. E. Wyllys Andrews IV also explored the cave in the 1930s. Edwin <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> R.E. Smith explored the cave on behalf of the Carnegie Institution in 1954, and dug several trenches to recover potsherds and other artifacts. Shook determined that the cave had been inhabited over a long period, at least from the Preclassic to the post-conquest era.|$|E
25|$|While the {{immediate}} {{root cause of}} the conflagration found by Brooklyn police and fire authorities was negligence {{on behalf of the}} theatre lessees, <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> Palmer, as time went on, theatre production practices that were regarded as acceptable risks in the 1870s were examined critically as the 20th century approached. Soon after the fire, New York Mirror began a campaign to eliminate or regulate many common theatre practices. Its agitation eventually spurred 1880's New York City fire code revisions barring the use of the stage in producing props and scenic elements, barring paints, wood, and construction material from the stage area, and widening theatre exits.|$|E

25|$|He {{was also}} {{forcibly}} {{struck by a}} certain laxness {{in the management of}} theatre by <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> Palmer, especially in comparison to Sara Conway's management prior to her death. Many witnesses reported that Conway had insisted on filled water buckets to be positioned in various places back stage or in the rigging loft and kept the fire hose maintained. In contrast, Mike Sweeny could recall using the hose only once, and was not certain of its condition {{on the day of the}} fire; many of his colleagues thought the hose leaked and was up in the painter's gallery in the roof above the stage.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1861, Chase and an aide, Captain Ebenezer Farrand, {{formerly}} {{second in}} command at the Pensacola Navy Yard, appeared at Fort Pickens to demand the surrender of the fort and garrison. Slemmer and his {{second in command}}, Second Lieutenant J. H. Gilman, met Chase outside the fort. Slemmer refused to allow Chase and Farrand in the fort, even though Chase said he had built the fort and would learn nothing from entering it. Slemmer replied that Chase {{did not know what}} preparations he had made and Chase proceeded to state his business. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase said he wanted to avoid bloodshed and that he had written his demand in proper form and would read it. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase's voice <b>shook</b> <b>and</b> his eyes filled with tears as he began his demand that the U.S. Army surrender Fort Pickens, a structure that he had designed and built as a captain with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Chase handed the paper to Farrand to read but Farrand could not see it well at night without his glasses so Gilman had to read it aloud.|$|E

[...] On June 15, McCain torpedoed and sank the {{freighter}} Koyo Maru (6400 tons) in the Tsushima Strait. [...] Early on June 19, McCain engaged a Japanese convoy that was headed for Shanghai. [...] He torpedoed and sank the freighter Tokiwa Maru (7000 tons) and hit a smaller vessel.

500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I <b>shook</b> <b>and</b> tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> Palmer {{were already}} enjoying success with their Union Square Theatre Company in New York {{and went on}} to {{transplant}} a number of their productions to the Brooklyn house. Their speciality was the adaptation of French plays to the American stage. The Two Orphans, featuring Miss Kate Claxton, which was presented {{on the night of the}} fire, was a melodrama about two young homeless orphans separated by abduction. [...] One was blind and fell into poverty-stricken circumstances; the other was kidnapped into an affluent household. It had been a particularly successful play, running for 180 performances in 1874 at the Union Square Theatre. Originally Les Deux Orphelines, by Adolphe d'Ennery and Eugène Cormon, it had been adapted to the American stage by N. Hart Jackson. <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> Palmer brought it to the Brooklyn Theatre in March 1876 after an American tour, including one performance at the Brooklyn Theatre on April 12, 1875, two weeks before Sara Conway's death. The 1876 run at the Brooklyn Theatre was well received but was ending. At the time of the fire, Palmer indicated that a number of Union Square Theatre productions had been scheduled for the Brooklyn Theatre and that all the scenes and properties for Ferrsol, Rose Michel, Conscience, and Colonel Sellers, as well as the wardrobe for The Two Orphans and a suite of furniture for Rose Michel had been stored on the premises.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{many years}} <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> Kidder {{developed}} the Kaminaljuyu ceramic sequence, and it remains, with refinements by <b>Shook</b> <b>and</b> Marion Popenoe de Hatch, {{one of the}} most secure and reliable ceramic chronologies in Mesoamerica, although some doubts remain about the absolute dates due to a paucity of radiocarbon anchors (a revision by Inomata, et al. to the following chronology, based on Bayesian analysis, would push forward the ceramic phases by as much as 300 years, setting the Miraflores apogee to a 100 BC – AD 100 time frame). With Inomata, et al's revision in mind, the first significant settlement dates to the Arévalo phase, c. 900–800 BC, with indications of dense populations no later than c. 400 BC. By the end of the Las Charcas culture (800–350 BC), Kaminaljuyu was developing [...] "religious and civic institutions." [...] Scattered Las Charcas remains throughout the Valley of Guatemala mark a major occupation of the area at sites such as El Naranjo; at this latter site, as well as at El Portón some 50 kilometers to the north and Takalik Abaj, about 130 kilometers to the west in the lower piedmont, plain uncarved upright shaft stones called stelae, mark the first appearance of a cult of time-reckoning and which became one of the bases for the institution of Maya kingship. The architecture of Middle Preclassic structures consisted of hardened adobe bricks that served, later, as foundations for raised platforms and pyramidal temples.|$|E
