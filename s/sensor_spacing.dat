This paper presents the analysis and modeling of the power spectral density of traffic information as a 2 -D stochastic signal using highly detailed field data. The field data were captured by the Next-Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) program in 2005. To the best knowledge of the authors, field data with such a level of detail were previously unavailable. The resulting model enables the derivation of a characterization curve that relates sensor error to <b>sensor</b> <b>spacing.</b> The characterization curve, concurring in general with observations of a previous work, provides much more detail to facilitate sensor deployment.

The array consists of 13 short-period, three-component seismometers with an aperture of about 550 m and average <b>sensor</b> <b>spacing</b> of 90 m. The reduced <b>sensor</b> <b>spacing,</b> joined to the spatially-white character of the background noise allows for quick and reliable detection of coherent wavefront arrivals even under very poor SNR conditions. We apply high-resolution frequency-slowness and polarization analyses {{to a set of}} 27 earthquakes recorded between November, 2002, and September, 2003, at epicentral distances spanning the 20 - 140 km interval.

For the case of S-wave, the discrepancies among the two set of locations never exceed 10 km; the largest errors are instead observed for the case of P-waves.

40|$|Although the {{long-range}} temporal correlation (LRTC) of the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal EEG/MEG oscillations is widely acknowledged, {{the majority of}} studies to date have been performed in <b>sensor</b> <b>space,</b> disregarding the mixing effects implied by volume conduction and confounding noise. While the effect of mixing on the evaluation of evoked responses and connectivity measures has been extensively studied, there are, to date, no studies reporting on {{the differences in the}} values of the estimated Hurst exponents when moving between <b>sensor</b> and source <b>space</b> representations of the multivariate data or on the effect of noise. Such differences, if not duly acknowledged, may lead to erroneous data interpretations. We show in simulations and in theory that measuring Hurst exponents in <b>sensor</b> <b>space</b> may lead to an incomplete picture of the LRTC properties of the underlying data and that noise may significantly bias the estimate of the Hurst exponent of the underlying signal. Moreover, these predictions are confirmed in real data, where we analyze the amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations in the resting state from EEG data. By moving either to an independent components representation or to a source representation which maximizes the signal to noise ratio in the alpha frequency range, we observe greater variance, skewness and kurtosis over measured Hurst exponents than in <b>sensor</b> <b>space.</b> We confirm the suitability of conventional source separation methodology by introducing a novel algorithm HeMax which obtains a source maximizing the Hurst exponent in the amplitude dynamics of narrow band oscillations.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} problem of robot {{navigation}} using only landmark bearings. The proposed system allows a robot {{to move to a}} ground target location specified by the sensor values observed at this ground target posi- tion. The control actions are computed based on the difference between the current landmark bearings and the target landmark bearings. No Cartesian coordinates with respect to the ground are computed by the control system. The robot navigates using solely information from the bearing <b>sensor</b> <b>space.</b> Most existing robot navigation systems require a ground frame (2 D Cartesian coordinate system) in order to navigate from a ground point A to a ground point B. The commonly used sensors such as laser range scanner, sonar, infrared, and vision do not directly provide the 2 D ground coordi- nates of the robot. The existing systems use the sensor measurements to localise the robot with respect to a map, a set of 2 D coordinates of the objects of interest. It is more natural to navigate between the points in the <b>sensor</b> <b>space</b> corresponding to A and B without requiring the Cartesian map and the localisation process. Research on animals has revealed how insects are able to exploit very limited computational and memory resources to successfully navigate to a desired destination without computing Cartesian positions. For example, a honeybee balances the left and right optical flows to navigate in a nar- row corridor. Unlike many other ants, Cataglyphis bicolor does not secrete pheromone trails in order to find its way home but instead uses the sun as a compass to keep track of its home direction vector. The home vector can be inaccurate, so the ant also uses landmark recognition. More precisely, it takes snapshots and compass headings of some landmarks. To return home, the ant tries to line up the landmarks exactly as they were before it started wandering. This thesis introduces a navigation method based on reflex actions in <b>sensor</b> <b>space.</b> The <b>sensor</b> vector is made of the bearings of some landmarks, and the reflex action is a gradient descent with respect to the distance in <b>sensor</b> <b>space</b> between the current sensor vector and the target sensor vec- tor. Our theoretical analysis shows that except for some fully characterized pathological cases, any point is reachable from any other point by reflex action in the bearing <b>sensor</b> <b>space</b> provided the environment contains three landmarks and is free of obstacles. The trajectories of a robot using reflex navigation, like other image- based visual control strategies, do not correspond necessarily to the shortest paths on the ground, because the sensor error is minimized, not the moving distance on the ground. However, we show that the use of a sequence of waypoints in <b>sensor</b> <b>space</b> can address this problem. In order to identify relevant waypoints, we train a Self Organising Map (SOM) from a set of observations uniformly distributed with respect to the ground. This SOM provides a sense of location to the robot, and allows a form of path planning in <b>sensor</b> <b>space.</b> The navigation proposed system is analysed theoretically, and evaluated both in simulation and with experiments on a real robot...|$|R
