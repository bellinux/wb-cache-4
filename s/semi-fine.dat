40|$|ABSTRACT Biochemical {{and genetic}} markers {{have not yet}} been used in {{selection}} and breeding of agricultural animals in Armenia. The objective behind the experiments was to assess the small cattle bred in Armenia- the semi-coarse wool and <b>semi-fine</b> wool sheep, as well as goats of different genotypes characterized by different milk productivity, polymorphic blood proteins-transferrin, ceruloplasmin, aiming to use them in breeding. Another objective was to study the genetic distance between the researched breeds and crossbreeds aiming to reveal the genetic similarity. The findings of research studies come to show that goats with polymorphic transferrin locus and a big set of genotypes are characterized by higher milk productivity; therefore it is recommended that they be used in selection as a supplementary milk productivity marker. The genetic distance between the researched goats comprised 0, 60 which comes to show that <b>semi-fine</b> wool sheep were also bred with the help of semi-coarse wool crossbreeds. The high coefficients of genetic distance of crossbreed goats compared to both the highly milk producing imported breeds and the locals are indicative of inherited high adaptability qualities of locals and high milk producing quality of pure breeds...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine possible relationships between the disease and mineral deficiencies. Samples of tissue and blood were collected from affected and unaffected sheep. Samples of soil and forage were collected from affected and unaffected areas. The samples were used for biochemical analyses and mineral nutrient measurements. Results showed that phosphorus (P) concentrations in forage samples from affected areas were significantly lower than those from unaffected areas (P < 0. 01) and the mean ratio of calcium (Ca) to P in the affected forage was 12 : 1. Meanwhile, P concentrations of blood, bone, tooth, and wool from the affected sheep were also significantly lower than those from the unaffected group (P < 0. 01). Serum P levels of the affected animals were much lower than those of the unaffected ones, whereas serum alkaline phosphatase levels from the affected were significantly higher than those from the unaffected (P < 0. 01). Inorganic P levels of the affected sheep were about half of those in the control group. Oral administration of disodium hydrogen phosphate prevented and cured the disease. The study clearly demonstrated that the disease of Guizhou <b>semi-fine</b> wool sheep was mainly caused by the P deficiency in forage, as a result of fenced pasture and animal habitat fragmentation...|$|E

The {{creation}} of the Italian "Industrial Triangle" stemed from the steady growth of rural areas which coincided with the localization of a rural industry intended for the market. This industry, concentrated in the Piedmont Alpine region, {{was the result of}} both work possibilities opened to the peasant population and the international markets' demand for products, namely for raw and <b>semi-fine</b> silk. Because {{of the size of the}} industry's income the division of labour which ensued from it and the high population density of the area, this type of labour market was well suited to the social needs of the proto-workers of Northern Italy. Concerning capital, the peripheral position of the peninsula in the international division of labour necessitated a slow accumulation of capital in the rural areas which was reinforced by the entrepreneurs' rejection of the factory system. But wherever capital existed and developed, it did not affect the basic socio-economic stability of the proto-industrial communities, a phenomenon which explains both the success and limits of the transition towards the second phase of industrialization.

40|$|Suffolk breed is the English hornless breed which {{belongs to}} the breed of meat yield. Typical {{features}} are excellent maternal qualities, good milkiness of ewes and fertility, less fertile period (lambing mostly in winter and spring) and good adaptability to different climatic conditions and breeding conditions. The breed {{is characterized by a}} black outer coat {{on the face of the}} head and lower part of legs, wool is short, white, <b>semi-fine.</b> Suffolk breed is characterized by high fertility throughout the production period ewes. Season, age, interval among lambing, body weight and body conditions score, nutrition, genetics, breeding and heat stress belong to the factors affecting fertility. When we compare fertility sheep breed Suffolk in the Czech Republic and Slovakia we achieved a higher number of ewes, improved fertility and fertilization. On the contrary, Slovakia has achieved better results in fertility at lambing ewe. It was also achieved in Canada in comparison with our republic. It is a major prerequisite of the production of heavy great muscled slaughter lambs with very good quality meat at meat production. Meat production is influenced by hormones, nutrition, gender, influence year and month of lambing, ewes age, litter size on the dependent variable. The values are not very different when meat production in Suffolk breed is evaluated in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In spite of it, the Czech Republic achieves better results in weight of lambs at 100 days and the average daily gain. If we evaluate the difference between meat production in Canada and the Czech Republic in selected parameters such as birth weight of lambs, weight of lambs at 100 days of age and avarage daily gain, Canada clearly has much better results. The main cause is a different type of breed. Increase fertility and meat production can be achieved mainly by improving reproduction and production indicators...|$|E

En el presente trabajo se describen, por primera vez, algunas características citoquímicas de los cultivos celulares de A. aegypti, infectados con la cepa (MHOM/CO/ 87 CL 412) de Leishmania panamensis. También se realizó un estudio morfológico de las células del cultivo. Se observaron 30 células pequeñas con apariencia fibrolastoide de 10. 84 ± 2. 54 µm de largo y 5. 31 ± 1. 26 µm de ancho; otras 30 presentaron apariencia epitelioide con 23. 04 ± 4. 00 µm de largo y 13. 96 ± 3. 70 µm de ancho; éstas últimas predominaron sobre las de apariencia fibroblastoide. De 113 células, un 7. 08 %, presentaron abundantes gránulos citoplasmáticos positivos con la coloración de PAS, indicando presencia de polisacáridos. La prueba de peroxidasa dio un resultado negativo. El mayor porcentaje de infección (18. 90 %), de un total de 101 células, se presentó el día 6. Ultraestructuralmente, las células presentaron un citoplasma con aspecto vacuolado; algunas contenían parásitos, otras {{material}} fibrilar y otras estaban vacías. Los resultados indican que los cultivos celulares de A. aegypti pueden ser infectados por L. panamensis y mantener dicho proceso por aproximadamente una semana. Morphology and cytochemistry of Aedes aegypti’s cell cultures (Diptera: Culicidae) and {{susceptibility to}} Leishmania panamensis (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae). The first cellular line of Aedes aegypti {{was developed by}} Grace in 1966; afterwards, other cellular lines of this species have been generated. These {{have been used for}} the study of pathogenic organisms like viruses, bacteria and parasites, which demonstrates their importance in biomedical applications. This research describes, for the first time, some cytochemical characteristics of A. aegypti cell cultures, that were infected with (MHOM/CO/ 87 CL 412) strain of Leishmania panamensis. A morphological study of the cell culture was also carried out. Maintenance of the cell culture, parasites and infection in vitro were carried out in the Laboratory of Entomology, Cell Biology and Genetics of the Universidad de La Salle. The cell cultures infected with the parasite were maintained in a mixture of mediums Grace/L 15, supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) at pH 6. 8 and a temperature of 26 ºC, during 3, 6 and 9 post-infection days. After this, these cell cultures were processed through High Resolution Light Microscopy (HRLM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) based on standard protocols defined by the Group of Microscopy and Image Analyses of the Instituto Nacional de Salud. <b>Semi-fine</b> slices of 1 µm colored with toluidine blue were used for the morphological analysis of the culture, and ultra fine cuts of 60 to 90 nm stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate where used for the ultrastructural study. In addition, PAS and peroxidase staining was carried out in cells fixed with methanol. The morphometric study was analyzed with software ImageJ (NIH). In the <b>semi-fine</b> slices, small cells were observed showing fibroblastic appearance 10. 84 ± 2. 54 µm in length and 5. 31 ± 1. 26 µm wide; other cells had epithelial appearance with a great peripheral nucleus, voluminous and vacuolated cytoplasm, 23. 04 ± 4, 00 µm in length and 13. 96 ± 3. 70 µm wide. These last ones predominated over the ones with fibroblastic appearance. Regarding the PAS coloration, 7. 08 % of the cells presented abundant PAS positive cytoplasmatic granules which indicated polysaccharides presence. The peroxidase test gave a negative result. The greatest percentage of infection (18. 90 %) of one total of 101 cells, turned up by day 6. Some cells analyzed by TEM presented a vacuolated aspect cytoplasm; some contained parasites, other fibrillar material and others were empty. The results indicate that A. aegypti cell culture can support the internalization and transformation of the parasite, which demonstrates the capacity that these cell cultures have to be infected with L. panamensis and to maintain the infection for approximately one week.
