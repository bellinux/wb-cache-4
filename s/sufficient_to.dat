5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
