5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was {{a translation of}} source code and embodied in a <b>silicon</b> <b>chip,</b> it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we put the}} {{emphasis}} on the reclaiming high purity silicon materials from waste electronic grade <b>silicon</b> <b>chips</b> which is collected from semiconductor industry, so as to meet the demand of solar grade silicon materials to a certain extent. We adopted sand blasting and acid etching in the recovering process of waste <b>silicon</b> <b>chips.</b> On the experiment we removed the impurity layers {{on the surface of the}} waster <b>silicon</b> <b>chips</b> and reclaimed the high purity <b>silicon</b> <b>chips</b> by sand-blasting method. In addition, the admixture of HF 、HNO 3 and CH 3 COOH was used to etch the metal-intermingled layers on the surface of the waster <b>silicon</b> <b>chips</b> so that high purity <b>silicon</b> <b>chips</b> were reclaimed. We can identify that the two methods of sand-blasting and acid etching would be available in reclaiming high purity silicon materials from waste electronic grade <b>silicon</b> <b>chips.</b> Sand-blasting is suitable to reclaim <b>silicon</b> <b>chips</b> with large size, and acid-etching is suitable to reclaim <b>silicon</b> <b>chips</b> with small size or silicon grains. Of course, we can use the two methods together to reclaim high purity silicon materials with high efficiency and low cost. 本篇论文针对当前半导体行业留下来的废弃电子级硅芯片进行回收处理，以期有效去除废弃硅芯片表面的金属掺杂层，回收高纯硅料，从而补充供不应求的太阳能级硅料。 在处理过程中，主要采用喷砂和化学腐蚀两种方法。喷砂是利用喷枪将白刚玉均匀地喷到硅片表面，以除去表面金属杂质层，从而回收高纯硅料。化学腐蚀法是利用混合酸溶液将废弃硅芯片表面的金属杂质层腐蚀干净，从而获得纯度较高的硅片。实验证明，通过喷砂和化学腐蚀两种回收处理废弃电子硅芯片的方法都是切实可行的。机械喷砂适宜于样品尺寸比较大的硅片，对于样品尺寸比较小的碎片或者颗粒则适宜于采用化学腐蚀法。为了有效地回收高纯硅材料，可以将两种方法综合加以利用...|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, MOSFETs {{are widely}} used in many types of analog {{circuits}} because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors {{the size of the}} device does not significantly affect its performance. MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and gyrator circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a <b>silicon</b> <b>chip</b> in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.|$|E

500|$|A new {{technology}} emerging in mechanical filtering is microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). [...] MEMS {{are very small}} micromachines with component sizes measured in micrometres (μm), but not as small as nanomachines. [...] These filters can be designed to operate at much higher frequencies than can be achieved with traditional mechanical filters. [...] These systems are mostly fabricated from silicon (Si), silicon nitride (Si3N4), or polymers. A common component used for radio frequency filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the cantilever resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, photolithography and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single <b>silicon</b> <b>chip.</b>|$|E
