2500|$|Suspicion rose {{that the}} post-1989 {{officials}} were helping organize a cover-up, {{in order to}} protect former Communist structures whose support it needed. Political scientist Stejărel Olaru singled out the SRI as an obstacle in Voinea's way, arguing that this was owed to the survival of Securitate structures within its framework, and accusing the service of hampering access to the archives. In June 1996, Horia Andrei Ursu addressed an open letter to Romanian President Ion Iliescu, asking him to appoint an objective and willing prosecutor in the case. He continued to object to the case's handling after Iliescu was succeeded by Emil Constantinescu, and, in November 2000, entered a hunger strike protesting against the delays. Writing in 1998, historian Vladimir Tismăneanu argued that the Ursu case tested [...] "the very notion of a state of law and the trustworthiness of post-communist justice". He defined Voinea's replacement as [...] "an obedient clerk who did his best to procrastinate." [...] Gheorghe Ursu's cause was taken up by the prominent civil society forum, the Group for <b>Social</b> <b>Dialogue</b> (GDS), who publicized the case and established the Gheorghe Ursu Foundation in his memory.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the levels of}} <b>social</b> <b>dialogues</b> and the specific links among them that have emerged during the post-communist transformations {{of central and eastern}} Europe. Using evidence from Bulgaria, the author adds to the debate over the type of worldwide change in bargaining structures, with the argument that currently the post-communist region is experiencing neither decentralization nor centralization of bargaining structures. Instead, surviving state socialist structures designed to resolve conflicts on a hierarchical basis and the new, transformation-driven centralization of power have combined with decentralizing and democratizing efforts to create specific multi-level bargaining cartels. In such cartels, the scope of bargaining is both more extensive and intensive. It involves the interplay of participants and issues from different levels that contributes importantly for the advancement of economic restructuring and political democratization...|$|R
