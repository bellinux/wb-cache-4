40|$|The {{interest}} for thermography {{as a method}} for spot weld inspection has increased during the last years since it is a full-field method suitable for automatic inspection. Thermography systems can be developed in different ways, with different physical setups, excitation sources, and image analysis algorithms. In this paper we suggest a single-sided setup of a thermography system using a flash lamp as excitation source. The analysis algorithm aims to find the spatial region in the acquired images corresponding to the successfully welded area, i. e., the nugget size. Experiments show {{that the system is}} able to detect spot welds, measure the nugget diameter, and based on the information also separate a spot <b>weld</b> from a <b>stick</b> <b>weld.</b> The system is capable to inspect more than four spot welds per minute, and has potential for an automatic non-destructive system for spot weld inspection. The development opportunities are significant, since the algorithm used in the initial analysis is rather simplified. Moreover, further evaluation of alternative excitation sources can potentially improve the performance. Funding Agencies|Vinnova (the FFI program) </p...|$|R
500|$|Welders wear {{protective}} clothing, including {{light and}} thin leather gloves and protective long sleeve shirts with high collars, to avoid exposure to strong ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the absence}} of smoke in GTAW, the electric arc light is not covered by fumes and particulate matter as in <b>stick</b> <b>welding</b> or shielded metal arc welding, and thus is a great deal brighter, subjecting operators to strong ultraviolet light. The welding arc has a different range and strength of UV light wavelengths from sunlight, but the welder is very close to the source and the light intensity is very strong. Potential arc light damage includes accidental flashes to the eye or arc eye and skin damage similar to strong sunburn. [...] Operators wear opaque helmets with dark eye lenses and full head and neck coverage to prevent this exposure to UV light. Modern helmets often feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to the bright light of the struck arc.

Thermography is a non-destructive testing method based on measurement of the heat distribution by an infrared camera. The method is suitable for automatic inspection since it is a full filed and non-contact method. A thermography system with an analysis tool developed by Termisk Systemteknik AB is investigated as an inspection method for spot weld. The system is able to detect spot welds, measure the diameter and separate a spot <b>weld</b> from a <b>stick</b> <b>weld.</b> The algorithms used in the analysis are rather simplified and the development opportunities are significant. A fully automated NDT-cell for spot weld inspection is presented. The automation includes a six axis industrial robot and communication for handling the information flow. This comprised {{the identification of the}} inspected spot weld and the reporting to the overall system as to the operator. A failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) of the automated NDT-cell is accomplished and the most important actions are reported A business case for implementing a automated NDT-cell was included in the project.

40|$|Car {{bodies are}} today more often made of high {{strength}} steel. In {{high strength steel}} spot welds are more friable and {{it is necessary to}} have higher demands on the inspections of spot welds. Quality control of spot weld can be either destructive or non-destructive. Destructive testing is still the most common method to test spot weld. The non-destructive methods that are investigete in this project are visual inspektion (VT), penetrant testing (PT), eddy current testing (ET), ultrasonic testing (UT), magnetic paticle testing (MT) and X-ray testing (RT). Other NDT methods are acoustic emission (AE), digital sheargraphy and IR-termography (IRT). These methods are investigated with focus on the possibility to detect Lens Diameter, <b>stick</b> <b>welds,</b> expulsions, porosity and cracks. And the possibility to automation of the method with focus on size and weight of the system, protection equipment, contact or contactless, one or two sided, position accuracy, and result in real-time. Only tree NDT methods, UT, RT and IRT, can detect all discontinuities that we looking for in RSW. The thermography system has the largest potential to be a NDT system for spot weld in the future, mainly because the method is non-contact, which helps when you have the opportunity to searching on a surface instead of a specific position.

40|$|During {{ultrasonic}} welding of sheet metal, normal and shear forces {{act on the}} parts to be welded and the weld interface.

In this study a mechanics based model was developed which included a model for the temperature generation during welding and its effect on the mechanical material properties. This model was then used to calculate the interface forces during welding.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{temperature}} fields, cooling rates, torque on the tool, stir zone geometry, and the magnesium concentra-tion profiles {{were examined}} experimen-tally and theoretically for the {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) of AA 1200 and AA 6061 dissimilar aluminum alloys. The thermal cycles, torque on the tool, and the magne-sium concentration profiles were experi-mentally determined for various welding conditions. A heat, momentum, and solute transport model based on a rectan-gular fixed grid finite difference method was developed. Four important parame-ters, friction coefficient, the extent of sticking, heat transfer coefficient at the bottom surface, {{and the extent of}} viscous dissipation converted to heat significantly affected both the temperature fields and the torque on the tool. The reliability of the model predictions was improved by optimizing these four parameters that cannot be prescribed either from the weld-ing conditions or from fundamental prin-ciples, using a genetic algorithm and mea-sured thermal cycles and torques for different welding conditions. The magne-sium concentration profiles showed that the plasticized materials moved in layers without significant diffusive interlayer mixing. The computed results showed that the extent of viscous dissipation converted to heat was fairly low consistent with lim-ited atomic mixing. The optimized values of the extent of slip between the tool and the workpiece indicated extensive <b>sticking</b> for various <b>welding</b> conditions. The ap-proach to determine values of uncertain parameters led to reliable model predic-tions as evidenced by good agreement be-tween both the experimentally measured and computed torque values and thermal cycles...|$|R
