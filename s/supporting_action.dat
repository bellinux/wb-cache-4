5|$|Eddy {{believed}} that with military {{assistance from the}} Thirteen Colonies, {{he might be able}} to bring down the strongly Loyalist administration of Nova Scotia. Early in 1776, Eddy went to Massachusetts in an attempt to interest political and military leaders there in <b>supporting</b> <b>action</b> in Nova Scotia, while Allan worked to raise interest in Nova Scotia. Allan's work was made more difficult by the arrival of Colonel Goreham and his troops to refortify Fort Cumberland, and by the activities of Michael Francklin, a former Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia and a vocal Loyalist. Eddy returned empty-handed to Nova Scotia in June 1776, only to learn that Goreham had put a price on his head. The activities of Goreham's Fencibles in the Cumberland area were successful enough that Patriot activities there were effectively forced underground; the center of these activities was shifted to Maugerville in part as a consequence of this. Goreham, a veteran of the French and Indian War, was also able to blunt Patriot inroads in the native communities, where the Mi'kmaq refused to take sides, and the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy, at first supportive of the Patriots, ultimately did not turn out in the numbers Eddy had hoped for or been promised.|$|E
25|$|In 1745, Jean-Antoine Nollet {{developed}} {{a theory of}} electrical attraction and repulsion that supposed {{the existence of a}} continuous flow of electrical matter between charged bodies. Nollet’s theory at first gained wide acceptance, but met resistance in 1752 with the translation of Franklin’s Experiments and Observations on Electricity into French. Franklin and Nollet debated the nature of electricity, with Franklin <b>supporting</b> <b>action</b> at a distance and two qualitatively opposing types of electricity, and Nollet advocating mechanical action and a single type of electrical fluid. Franklin's argument eventually won and Nollet’s theory was abandoned.|$|E
