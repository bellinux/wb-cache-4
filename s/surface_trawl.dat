Abundance and distribution of fish data were derived from three sampling schemes: (1) an otter trawl in basins (1984 – 1985, 1994 – 2001), (2) a <b>surface</b> <b>trawl</b> in basins (1984 – 1985), and (3) a <b>surface</b> <b>trawl</b> in channels (1984 – 1985). Results from surface trawling only included pelagic species. Collections made with an otter trawl in basins on a bi-monthly basis were emphasized. Nonparametric statistics were used to test spatial and temporal differences in the abundance of species and seagrasses. Fish species accounts were presented in four sections – Life history, Diet, Abundance and distribution, and Length-frequency distributions.

Surface trawling provided a broad spatial {{sampling of the}} fish and macroinvertebrate communities in the upper 10 m of the water column, but caught few salmon (23). Gillnetting was more effective at capturing post-smolt (60) and adult (24) salmon.

40|$|Global aquatic {{ecosystems}} are impacted {{by a variety}} of mechanisms including habitat destruction, fish overharvest, and the introduction of invasive species. Long term monitoring of an ecosystem’s fish community, along with abiotic and biotic factors that influence the fish community, is crucial in establishing effective management strategies. Currently, numerous monitoring programs exist across the United States. However, a long term monitoring program of non-game and non-commercial fish community dynamics has not been established within Kentucky Lake in Western Kentucky. Preliminary sampling of the Kentucky Lake fish community was performed using boat electroshocking and <b>surface</b> <b>trawling.</b> Four embayments within Kentucky Lake were sampled with a randomized block experimental design. Within each embayment, 5 separate electrofishing samples were obtained from randomly chosen 500 -meter shoreline segments; each sample utilizing 1 of 6 different randomly selected electroshocking wave forms.

40|$|Abstract: Habitat use {{and early}} marine ecology of {{juvenile}} (age-. O) Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) were studied monthly at inshore, strait, and coastal habitats along a seaward migration corridor in southeastern Alaska from May through October 1997 - 99. A total of 31, 853 fish from 40 taxa were captured with 283 <b>surface</b> <b>trawl</b> hauls; juvenile salmon made up 61 % {{of the total}} catch. Predation on juvenile salmon was observed in 4 of 19 fish species examined, and occurred in 33 (5 %) of the 661 predators examined. Juvenile salmon catches typically peaked in June and July and in strait habitats, where two Alaska hatchery chum salmon (0. ketal stocks made up> 50 % of the chum salmon sampled. Of the juvenile chinook salmon (0. tshawytscha) and coho salmon (0. kisutch) stocks of known origin, marine migration rates averaged 1 and 3 km/d for Alaska stocks and 19 and 29 km/d for Columbia River Basin stocks. Our results imply that seasonal habitat use patterns of juvenile salmon are related to favorable temperatures and zooplankton abundance and are also linked to species and stock of salmon. Long-term ecological monitoring of key juvenile salmon stocks is needed over varying environmental conditions to understand relationships among habitat use, marine growth, yearclass strength, and ocean carrying capacity...|$|E
40|$|Ocean currents, water masses, and {{seasonal}} sea ice formation determine linkages among and barriers between the biotas of the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. The Bering Sea communicates with the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas via northward advection of water, nutrients, and plankton through Bering Strait. However, {{continuity of the}} ocean's physical properties is modulated by regional differences in heat, salt, and sea ice budgets, in particular, along the meridional gradient. Using summer density data from zooplankton, fish (bottom and <b>surface</b> <b>trawl),</b> and seabird surveys, we define three biogeographic provinces: the Eastern Bering Shelf Province (the eastern Bering Sea shelf south of Saint Lawrence Island), the Chirikov-Chukchi Province (the eastern Bering Sea shelf north of Saint Lawrence Island [Chirikov Basin] and Chukchi Sea), and the Beaufort Sea Province. Regional differences in summer distributions of biota largely reflect the underlying oceanography. Climate warming will reduce the duration and possibly the extent of seasonal ice cover in the Eastern Bering Shelf Province, but this warming may not lead to increased abundance of some subarctic species because seasonal ice cover and cold (< 2 °C) bottom waters on the Bering shelf form a barrier to the northward migration of subarctic bottom fish species typical of the southeastern Bering Sea. While Arctic species that are dependent upon the summer extent of sea ice face an uncertain future, other Arctic species' resilience to a changing climate will be derived from waters that continue to freeze each winter...|$|E

Using <b>surface</b> <b>trawls,</b> we monitored prey abundance before and after construction of a 30 turbine offshore wind farm sited close to an internationally important colony of Little terns. Observations confirmed that young-of-the-year clupeids dominated chick diet, which trawl samples suggested were mainly herring. Multivariate modelling indicated {{a significant reduction in}} herring abundance from 2004 onwards that could not be explained by environmental factors. Intensely noisy monopile installation during the winter spawning period was suggested to be responsible. Reduced prey abundance corresponded with a significant decline in Little tern foraging success. Unprecedented egg abandonment and lack of chick hatching tentatively suggested a colony-scale response in some years.

We compared chemical concentrations in plastics {{of different types}} and sizes, assessed ocean plastic potential risks using sediment quality criteria, and discussed the implications of our findings for bioaccumulation. Our results suggest that at least {{a fraction of the}} NPAC plastics is not in equilibrium with the surrounding seawater. For instance, ‘hard plastic’ samples had significantly higher PBDE concentrations than ‘nets and ropes’ samples, and 29 % of them had PBDE composition similar to a widely used flame-retardant mixture. Our findings indicate that NPAC plastics may pose a chemical risk to organisms as 84 % of the samples had at least one chemical exceeding sediment threshold effect levels. Furthermore, our <b>surface</b> <b>trawls</b> collected more plastic than biomass (180 times on average), indicating that some NPAC organisms feeding upon floating particles may have plastic as a major component of their diets.

40|$|In Hokkaido, {{northern}} Japan, although relatively constant numbers (approximately 140 million fish) of hatchery {{pink salmon}} juveniles {{have been released}} annually since the 1990 s, even and odd year catches of pink salmon in coastal fisheries consistently differ. The reason(s) for this interannual pattern is unknown. There is little consistently gathered information on the ecology and status of pink salmon in Hokkaido although Morita et al. (2005) documented their population structure. It {{has been suggested that}} ocean conditions can limit salmon production and high mortality occurs during their early sea life (Parker, 1968; Mortensen et al. 2000). Consequently, we wished to improve our understanding of the early marine ecology of juvenile pink salmon with respect to their offshore movement and growth. We monitored the distribution and growth of juvenile pink salmon and environmental conditions off the Abashiri coast of the Okhotsk Sea beginning in 2002 (Ando et al. 2005). Four transects were established (A–D; Fig. 1), each with three sampling sites 1 km, 4 km, and 7 km from the shore. Sampling occurred every ten days from late April to early July, 2002 – 2005. In coastal waters, we captured juvenile pink salmon using a <b>surface</b> <b>trawl</b> net pulled by two boats. We also beach seined littoral waters (St. E; Fig. 1) starting in 2003. Because juvenile pink salmon captured in the coastal or littoral waters of the Abashiri coast might include hatchery-origin fish released from several sites as well as naturally spawned fish, we designed an otolith-marking experiment in 2005 to survey the distribution and growth of juveniles of known origin.

40|$|In July/ August 1991 the Institute of Marine Research (IMR, Norway) {{performed}} a pairtrawling (two boat trawl) experiment with a <b>surface</b> <b>trawl</b> to catch young herring in the northem Norwegian Sea. 34 postsmolts and two 1 - sea-winter salmon were caught as bycatch. This {{was the first}} time that postsmolts were recorded in larger numbers during fishery in open sea in the North East Atlantic, although the area is believed to be the one of the main feeding areas for salmon during summer. A (one boat) pelagic research trawl has been developed by IMR for scientific surveys of the pelagic fish stocks. This trawl, an Åkra trawl, can be rigged both for mid water and surface trawling (0 - ~ 25 m), and is currently in use on all pelagic research cruises. In 1993 a study was made to test whether the new trawl would catch salmon. This study proved successful, and consequently, Atlantic salmon was included in a large scale ecology study in the Norwegian Sea, the so called "Mare Cognitum Programme" (MCP). In 1995, the first year of salmon surveys in the MCP framework, in addition to the trawl surveys, otter- board salmon trolling and salmon drift line fishery with an experimental line with 200 hooks were developed and tested from the R/V "Johan Hjort". A total of 157 postsmolts and nine 1 -sea-winter salmon have been caught in surface hauls since 1991.

40|$|The coastal Pacific Ocean off {{northern}} and central California encompasses the strongest seasonal upwelling {{zone in the}} California Current ecosystem. Headlands and bays here generate complex circulation features and confer unusual oceanographic complexity. We sampled the coastal epipelagic fish community of this region with a <b>surface</b> <b>trawl</b> {{in the summer and}} fall of 2000 – 05 to assess patterns of spatial and temporal community structure. Fifty-three species of fish were captured in 218 hauls at 34 fixed stations, with clupeiform species dominating. To examine spatial patterns, samples were grouped by location relative to a prominent headland at Point Reyes and the resulting two regions, north coast and Gulf of the Farallones, were plotted by using nonmetric multidimensional scaling. Seasonal and interannual patterns were also examined, and representative species were identified for each distinct community. Seven oceanographic variables measured concurrently with trawling were plotted by principal components analysis and tested for correlation with biotic patterns. We found significant differences in community structure by region, year, and season, but no interaction among main effects. Significant differences in oceanographic conditions mirrored the biotic patterns, and a match between biotic and hydrographic structure was detected. Dissimilarity between assemblages was mostly the result of differences in abundance and frequency of occurrence of about twelve common species. Community patterns were best described by a subset of hydrographic variables, including water depth, distance from shore, and any one of several correlated variables associated with upwelling intensity. Rather than discrete communities with clear borders and distinct member species, we found gradients in community structure and identified stations with similar fish communities by region and by proximity to features such as the San Francisco Bay...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} the behavioral {{flexibility of the}} trawling long-legged bat, Macrophyllum macrophyllum (Phyllostomidae) in flight cage experiments by exposing it to prey suspended from nylon threads {{in the air and}} to food placed onto the water surface at varying distances to clutter-producing background (water plants). The bat revealed flexibility in foraging mode and caught prey in the air (aerial hawking) and from the water <b>surface</b> (<b>trawling).</b> M. macrophyllum was constrained in finding food very near to and within clutter. As echolocation was the prime sensory mode used by M. macrophyllum for detection and localization of food, the bat might have been unable to perceive sufficient information from prey near clutter as background echoes from the water plant increasingly overlapped with echoes from food. The importance of echolocation for foraging is reflected in a stereotypic call pattern of M. macrophyllum that resembles other aerial insectivorous and trawling bats with a pronounced terminal phase (buzz) prior to capture attempts. Our findings contrast studies of other phyllostomid bats that glean prey very near or from vegetation, often using additional sensory cues, such as prey-produced noise, to find food and that lack a terminal phase in echolocation behavior. In M. macrophyllum, acoustic characteristics of its foraging habitat have shaped its sonar system more than phylogeny...|$|R

To investigate community structure and the role that zooplankton may play in utilizing this productivity, animals were collected at six stations {{inside and outside the}} ASP using paired “day-night ” tows with a 1 m 2 MOCNESS. Stations were selected according to productivity based on satellite imagery, distance from the ice edge, and depth of the water column. Depths sampled were stratified from the surface to ∼ 50 – 100 m above the seafloor. Macrozooplankton were also collected at four stations located {{in different parts of the}} ASP using a 2 m 2 Metro Net for krill <b>surface</b> <b>trawls</b> (0 – 120 m).

A segregation of increasing zooplankton trophic position with depth was observed in the MOCNESS tows. In general, zooplankton abundance was low above the mixed layer depth, a result attributed to a thick layer of the unpalatable colonial haptophyte, Phaeocystis antarctica. Abundances of the ice krill, Euphausia crystallarophias, however, were highest near the edge of the ice sheet within the ASP and larvae:adult ratios correlated with temperature above a depth of 60 m.

40|$|Marine plastic {{pollution}} is an ever-increasing problem that demands immediate mitigation and reduction plans. Here, a model based on satellite-tracked buoy observations and scaled {{to a large}} data set of observations on microplastic from <b>surface</b> <b>trawls</b> was used to simulate the transport of plastics floating on the ocean surface from 2015 to 2025, with the goal to assess the optimal marine microplastic removal locations for two scenarios: removing the most surface microplastic and reducing the impact on ecosystems, using plankton growth as a proxy. The simulations show that the optimal removal locations are primarily located {{off the coast of}} China and in the Indonesian Archipelago for both scenarios. Our estimates show that 31 % of the modeled microplastic mass can be removed by 2025 using 29 plastic collectors operating at a 45 % capture efficiency from these locations, compared to only 17 % when the 29 plastic collectors are moored in the North Pacific garbage patch, between Hawaii and California. The overlap of ocean surface microplastics and phytoplankton growth can be reduced by 46 % at our proposed locations, while sinks in the North Pacific can only reduce the overlap by 14 %. These results are an indication that oceanic plastic removal might be more effective in removing a greater microplastic mass and in reducing potential harm to marine life when closer to shore than inside the plastic accumulation zones in the centers of the gyres...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{and spatial}} {{patterns}} of age 0 threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense) abundance and growth, in the Overton Arm of Lake Mead, were examined {{to evaluate the}} effects of resource availability on the young fish. This {{was part of a}} larger, game fishery enhancement study (Lake Mead Fertilization Project), designed to assess feasability of increasing survivorship of larval/juvenile shad by boosting phosphate levels, thereby increasing algal and zooplankton biomass, during the shad spawning period. Shad are the primary forage base for the striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and black bass (Macropterus salmoides) fisheries. Weekly samples were taken by night <b>surface</b> <b>trawl</b> with a 1 meter diameter ring net, from early June to mid-August, at 12 stations in 1988 and 21 stations in 1989. To examine vertical distribution, depth series samples were taken with a Tucker Trawl at some stations and dates. Chlorophyll a concentrations and Daphnia pulex egg/adult female ratios, used as indicators of resource availability, were also determined for some stations and dates. Patterns of abundance were analyzed with log-log regressions of shad abundance on resource availability and more complex models including large-scale geographic factors with chlorophyll a. In 1988 shad abundance was not significantly correlated (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) with chlorophyll a concentration, or Daphnia egg ratios, but was significantly higher in west-side coves. Conversely, in 1989 abundance correlated significantly with chlorophyll a and Daphnia egg ratios, and the west-side effect was insignificant. Abundance was not correlated with distance from inflow, independent of chlorophyll a, in either year. To conclude, there was an apparent link between resource availability and young shad abundance, with evaluation of this relationship being confounded in 1988 by lowered predation in the west-side coves. There was little temporal or spatial variation in mean length from 20 millimeters total length, possibly due to a combination of net bias and selective predation upon larger fish. Growth rates could not be determined. With regard to vertical distribution, greater than 75...|$|E

Sizeable populations of large medusae, primarily Chrysaora fuscescens and Aequorea sp., appear annually in shelf waters of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Previous research has shown that C. fuscescens is abundant seasonally in the inner shelf and exhibits high feeding rates on zooplankton.

C. fuscescens abundances generally peaked in late summer, whereas Aequorea sp. peaked in May or June. General additive models of the mesoscale data indicated that station catches for both species correlated with latitude, temperature, salinity, and distance from shore (and chlorophyll a for Aequorea sp.). Analysis of interannual variability revealed that highest catches of medusae correlated with cool spring–summer conditions, or negative anomalies of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and low winter–summer runoff from the Columbia River.

The salmon of mean weights 1. 56 and 5. 5 kg were released from 2 commercial fish farms in late September 2006. All fish were tagged with external tags, and 48 were also equipped with acoustic transmitters. A surface pair-trawl (50 m wide and 8 m deep) was constructed to optimize catchability and maneuverability in the fjord environment. Trawling was unsuccessful, and caught only 6 simulated escapees. Telemetry data confirmed that the fish were available along the towing tracks, and we assume that towing speed and/or trawl size may have been suboptimal with regard to avoidance by fish in the fjord environment. Gillnetting proved to be an efficient method of recapture. The total reported recapture rate (of 114 fishers) was 40 %, but a significantly higher recapture rate (67 %) of the more highly rewarded acoustic transmitters, and the distribution of the fish in time and space, suggest that the actual catch may have been substantially higher. Approximately 90 % of the catches were taken within 40 km of the release sites over the course of 4 wk.

40|$|The largest {{component}} of natural mortality affecting Atlantic salmon {{populations in the}} marine environment occurs {{during the first year}} at sea. The juveniles are referred to as post-smolts during this period, which begins after their migration to the ocean and continues up until the first winter. The stock complexes for Europe and North America appear to have different climate-controlling mechanisms reflecting theorized differences in post-smolt distribution and ecology. The nursery zone for European post-smolts is located in the open ocean whereas North American post-smolts appear to utilize inshore habitats. Holm et al. (2000) described the distribution of European post-smolts from <b>surface</b> <b>trawling</b> operations in the Northeast Atlantic. The nursery is confined to a region within the Norwegian Sea, the northern extent of which would appear to be defined by current transport. In North America, post-smolts can be found in high numbers in the Labrador Sea during the fall of the year (Reddin and Short 1991). However, during the earlier part of the post-smolt period, i. e. through the spring and summer months, fish are also found in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the coast of Nova Scotia, and elsewhere (Dutil and Coutu 1988; Ritter 1989; Friedland et al. 1999). Furthermore, North American stocks may not physically mix for many months after entering the ocean whereas it appears European stocks are concentrated in a single, albeit large, ocean area (Friedland and Reddin 2000). If in some years the North American post-smolt nursery is distributed along the coast, it would function i...|$|R

Sagittal otoliths were collected from juvenile Chum Salmon in summers 2007, 2012, and 2013 via <b>surface</b> <b>trawls</b> in the southern Chukchi and northern Bering seas. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to discriminate between freshwater and marine environments, and daily growth increments were counted to determine marine-entry dates and growth rates of juvenile Chum Salmon to make temporal and regional comparisons of juvenile characteristics. Marine-entry dates ranged from mid-June to mid-July, with all region and year combinations exhibiting similar characteristics with respect to entry timing, i. e., larger individuals at the time of capture entered the marine environment earlier in the growing season than smaller individuals. Juvenile growth rates were estimated to be, on average, 4. 9 % body weight per day in both regions in summers 2007 and 2012, and 6. 8 % body weight per day in the Chukchi Sea in 2013. This study shows consistent conditions among regions with respect to juvenile Chum Salmon marine-entry timing, with some variation in growth rates. These results provide a novel and more thorough evaluation of juvenile Chum Salmon early life-history characteristics in the Alaskan Arctic and provide a baseline for comparisons with future climate change studies...|$|R
40|$|Northeast Atlantic Mackerel (Scomber scombrus) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and {{economically}} most valuable fish stocks in the world. However, due to a large area of distribution, low acoustic backscatter and highly dynamic and migratory behaviour between several Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), reliable abundance estimation and fish stock assessment are difficult and include a large level of uncertainty. In order to reduce uncertainties in the mackerel stock abundance estimates, a new pelagic trawl methodology and standardized swept-area surveys for mackerel abundance estimation was established in 2011. The new method included development of a new <b>surface</b> <b>trawling</b> method and a new trawl, the multipurpose pelagic ecosystem trawl (Multpelt 832). However, various uncertainty is still linked to the new trawl methodology. This thesis uses Deep Vision images, GoPro videos and total catch data from a methodological cruise conducted in June 2015 as well as catch data from the 2015 International Ecosystem Summer Survey in the Nordic Seas (IESSNS) in order to investigate the demanding curved trawl method used in the IESSNS survey today. The analyses conducted show that the curved trawling method did not have significantly different catch rates or length distribution compared to less demanding straight forward trawling. Consequently, a change of the trawling method used in the IESSNS survey from a curved to a straight forward trawling procedure is recommended in order to simplify trawling. Furthermore, analyses of mackerel distribution during the methodological survey indicate small shoaling and loosely aggregating behaviour within individual hauls. Patchiness rarely led to only a single or few aggregations being encountered over the course of 30 -minute- long hauls, supporting the use of a swept area survey for mackerel in this location and time. The swept area method in the IESSNS survey therefore seems to be a reliable and consistent method for abundance estimation of NEA mackerel...|$|R

Saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis) is abundant in nearshore waters and appears in the diet of many Arctic sea birds and marine mammals; however, little is known about its early ecology and consequently how they might be affected by environmental changes. We aimed to characterize the mechanisms of spatial and ontogenetic variation in trophic biomarkers (lipid classes, fatty acids and bulk C and N stable isotopes) of saffron cod from the Western Arctic, Chukchi and Bering Seas. Size-standardized analyses showed a significant difference in lipid condition metrics and trophic biomarkers as a function of survey location.

Higher lipid storage in Arctic juveniles was associated with elevated levels of diatom fatty acid markers, but not with nearshore carbon input. Increased lipids were found in age- 1 juveniles from Prudhoe Bay in the Western Beaufort that were feeding at a lower trophic level than similarly sized age- 0 juveniles from <b>surface</b> <b>trawls</b> in the Bering Sea.

Macrozooplankton were also collected at four stations located {{in different parts of the}} ASP using a 2 m 2 Metro Net for krill <b>surface</b> <b>trawls</b> (0 – 120 m). The most abundant groups of zooplankton were copepods, ostracods, and euphausiids. Zooplankton biovolume (0. 001 to 1. 22 ml m- 3) and abundance (0. 21 to 97. 5 individuals m- 3) varied throughout all depth levels, with a midsurface maximum trend at ∼ 60 – 100 m. A segregation of increasing zooplankton trophic position with depth was observed in the MOCNESS tows. In general, zooplankton abundance was low above the mixed layer depth, a result attributed to a thick layer of the unpalatable colonial haptophyte, Phaeocystis antarctica. Abundances of the ice krill, Euphausia crystallarophias, however, were highest near the edge of the ice sheet within the ASP and larvae:adult ratios correlated with temperature above a depth of 60 m. Total zooplankton abundance correlated positively with chlorophyll a above 150 m, but negative correlations observed for biovolume vs. the proportion of P. antarctica in the phytoplankton estimated from pigment ratios (19 ’hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin:fucoxanthin) again pointed to avoidance of P. antarctica. Quantifying zooplankton community structure, abundance, and biovolume (biomass) in this highly productive polynya helps shed light on how carbon may be transferred to higher trophic levels and to depth in a region undergoing rapid warming...|$|R

Since predatory fish often feed on eel larvae, it is presumed by scientists and ichthyologists that they feed on snipe eel larvae as well.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Salmonid run {{sizes are}} {{strongly}} affected by their early marine stage. Fully understanding the life history of salmonids means understanding how {{they interact with}} their marine environment and with other fishes. Changes in the biological and physical environment off the Columbia River region affects the distribution and abundance of predatory fishes and their feeding, forage fishes, and juvenile salmonid marine survival. From 1998 - 2004, forage fish and predatory fish distribution and abundance off the Columbia River was quantified by <b>surface</b> <b>trawling</b> at night during spring/summer. The effect of predation on salmonids was measured by stomach analysis of predatory fishes. During the study period (1998 - 2004), forage fishes increased in abundance by orders of magnitude and were strongly related to the abundance of cold-water copepods the previous year. Higher forage fish populations were also linked to cooler ocean conditions and perhaps fewer predatory Pacific hake (Merluccius productus). Most forage fishes were distributed nearshore while predators had a more offshore distribution. Pacific hake was most abundant in 1998, 2003, and 2004; warm ocean years. Jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus) was most abundant during 1999 - 2002; relatively cool ocean years. Deep (50 -m) ocean temperatures and {{the date of the}} spring transition, when nearshore currents switched from northward to southward, were good predictors of Pacific hake abundance in the study area. Forage fish or salmonid occurrence in a haul was negatively related to the occurrence of predators. Pacific hake and jack mackerel ate primarily euphausiids and small fishes. Salmonids were rarely eaten by either predator. However, because the Pacific hake population can be very large, hake predation can be a significant source of juvenile salmon mortality off the Columbia River during some years. A trophic model showed that marine mortality of Columbia River juvenile salmonids {{may be related to the}} abundance of Pacific hake and forage fishes. A multiple regression using the predictions from the trophic model of annual numbers of juvenile salmonids eaten by hake and Columbia River spring flows as independent variables, accounted for much of the variation observed in the annual marine survival of Columbia River coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), the dependent variable. Future research should identify the physical and biological forces that alter the feeding habits, migration and movements of Pacific hake and jack mackerel off the Northwest, and how Columbia River flows affect trophic interactions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the spatial}} distribution of fishing effort {{in a sample of}} 25 Dutch commercial beam trawlers fishing for sole and plaice in the period 1993 - 1996, based on an automated recording system with an accuracy of about 0. 1 nautical mile. Intensive fishing occurred along the borders of the closed areas (12 mile zone and the 'plaice-box', a protected area {{in the eastern part of}} the North Sea) and at certain off-shore grounds in the southern and central North Sea. Effort distribution was studied within 30 x 30 (ICES rectangles), 10 x 10, 3 x 3 and 1 x 1 nautical mile squares and showed a patchy distribution. The degree of patchiness decreased with resolution. Within 3 x 3 mile squares, beam trawling was randomly distributed in some parts of the most heavily fished ICES rectangles but patchily distributed in others. Within 1 x 1 mile squares, the distribution became random within more than 90 % of the squares. The micro-distribution showed a remarkable similarity between the 4 years with a mean coefficient of overlap of 0. 66, range 0. 56 - 0. 76. The microdistribution of the sampled vessels was raised to the total Dutch fleet in order to estimate the frequency at which the sea bed was trawled. It was estimated that during the four year study period in eight of the most heavily fished rectangles of the North Sea, 5 % of the <b>surface</b> area was <b>trawled</b> less than once in 5 years and 29 % less than once in a year. The surface area of the sea bed that was trawled between 1 and 2 times in a year was estimated at 30 %. The <b>surface</b> area <b>trawled</b> more than five times in a year was estimated at 9 %. The relevance of the findings for the study of the impact of beam trawling on the benthic fauna is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This study {{described}} {{the distribution and}} feeding of juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) in Puget Sound to explore the potential for resource competition among these species. We used <b>surface</b> townets, midwater <b>trawls,</b> and acoustics surveys to assess distributions of fish in surface waters, among bathymetric zones, and depth strata in the water column. Seasonal and spatial variability was evident in epipelagic biomass. Occurrence of biomass generally increased progressively {{during the summer and}} shifted to deeper depths. Despite considerable variability, spatial, temporal, and dietary overlap was observed among herring and juvenile salmon, especially for Chinook and coho salmon. Crab larvae and amphipods were important prey for most salmon species and herring. Herring were present in higher abundances than salmon and had high population-level consumption demand. If food resources are limiting, there is potential for competitive interactions among salmon and herring...|$|R

The episodes was interrupted by the abrupt abatement of the strong wind which promotes coastal upwelling. The mean hourly upwelling index is calculated {{to be higher than}} the 20 year mean monthly value. During 3 days of light wind commercial bottom trawl operations were possible. Shipboard estimates of chlorophyll content in <b>surface</b> waters during <b>trawling</b> show the high concentrations that are indicative of a rich biomass of phytoplankton, a result of the upwelling episode. Satellite imagery shows the extent of the upwelling water to be of the order of 100 km offshore; the result of many upwelling episodes. Shipboard echo sounder data show the presence of various delmersal species and of zooplakton; the latter graze on the phytoplankton in the upper euphotic layers.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} impacts of climate change is the changing sea ice cover, which has implications for sea ice-associated ecosystems that depend on carbon produced by ice-associated algae. In order to fully understand these ecosystems {{there is a need}} to understand both the physical and biological components. We present preliminary results from Polarstern cruises to the Eastern Central Arctic Ocean (summer 2012) and Weddell Sea (fall-winter 2013). Biological samples were acquired from the under-ice environment using the <b>Surface</b> and Under-Ice <b>Trawl</b> (SUIT) and from within the ice by extracting ice cores. Biophysical properties of sea ice and under-ice environments were characterized using a sensor array mounted on the SUIT that measured ice thickness, under-ice light spectra, water properties and chlorophyll a biomass (in- and under-ice). Modal ice thicknesses were between 0. 45 - 1. 38 m (Arctic) and 0. 23 - 0. 70 m (Weddell Sea). Sea ice properties were related to the distribution of some key under-ice species (e. g. Polar Cod and Antarctic Krill). Previous studies have used under-ice light spectra to derive ice-algal biomass but were limited to local-scale point measurements. We present a new method for calculating ice-algal biomass from under-ice spectra on local- to meso-scales and compare the results using both methods...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} the Northeast Atlantic (NEA) mackerel research cruise from 1 st to 20 th of October 2012. Two chartered fishing vessels, M/V “Brennholm” and M/V “Christina E” covered areas {{in the northern part of}} the North Sea and west of the British Isles with the overall aim to estimate spatial distribution and abundance of mackerel by means of echo sounder and pelagic trawling. In addition, herring distribution and abundance were also estimated by means of acoustics and pelagic trawl sampling. Systematic CTD casts were conducted by both vessels during the survey period, as well as collection of sea surface temperatures (SST) from weekly satellite information. The SST during the survey period was close to the long-term average for the survey area. Temperature at 10 m depth ranged from 8. 5 to 13. 5 °C, with coldest water in the north, while temperature at 50 and 100 m depth showed cold water stretching from the south in the areas surrounding the Norwegian trench. The highest mackerel concentrations were found south-east of Shetland and in the northernmost areas of the North Sea. Vertical and horizontal distribution, behavior and abundance of mackerel were to a large extent different compared to what we expected and compared to previous established knowledge from both the fishing fleet and scientific surveys in similar areas and periods. In contrast to a general deep distribution in dense schools observed previously at this time of the year, mackerel were also found swimming close to the surface in small and loose aggregations. Total abundance of NEA mackerel within the covered area was estimated to 1. 144 million tons. Total abundance of herring was estimated acoustically to be 2. 934 million tons. The estimated mackerel abundance was significantly lower than expected, probably due to low availability to echosounder and sonar detection as well as considerable concentrations of mackerel distributed outside the covered area during the survey period. Most of the pelagic trawl samples with the new Multpelt 832 sampling trawl were taken in <b>surface</b> waters. <b>Trawl</b> samples west of 2 °W were dominated with 0 -group mackerel and had a wide distribution...|$|R
