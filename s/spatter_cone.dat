2500|$|Fort of Santa Cruz ( [...] or Castelo da Santa Cruz), is a 16th-century {{fortification}} {{located in}} the civil parish of Angústias, municipality of Horta, {{on the island of}} Faial in the Portuguese Azores. Occasionally referred to as the Castelo de Santa Cruz by locals, it is situated in the historic centre of the city, on the edge of Horta Bay. It was constructed to work in conjunction with the Fort of Bom Jesus (...) {{at the mouth of the}} Ribeira da Conceição and Fort of Greta (...) along the coast of the extinct <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> Monte da Guia, to defend the entrance to the harbour and southern access to the Bay.|$|E
2500|$|The roughly {{trapezoidal}} {{island is}} formed by a complex volcano immediately {{southwest of the}} Campi Flegrei area at {{the western side of}} the Bay of Naples. The eruption of the trachytic Green Tuff ignimbrite about 56,000years ago was followed by caldera formation. The highest point of the island, Monte Epomeo (788m), is a volcanic horst consisting of a Green Tuff ignimbrite deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least [...] of uplift has formed as a result of resurgent doming during the past 33,000years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows. The latest eruption of Ischia, in 1302, produced a <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> caves {{are located}} at the vent for the Horse system. Characterized by small and short surface tubes or blister cavities. Most of the <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> caves are within {{a foot or two}} of the surface, and lie in or {{adjacent}} to the spatter cones of the vent area. There are roughly 40 of these small <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> caves in the vent area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spatter</b> <b>cones</b> {{are built}} out of thicker lava. The lava is {{thrown out of the}} vent and builds, layer by layer, a chimney {{surrounding}} the vent. Fleener Chimneys and Black Crater are examples of <b>spatter</b> <b>cones.</b>|$|R
500|$|Big Craters and <b>Spatter</b> <b>Cones</b> (...) sit {{directly}} {{along the}} local {{part of the}} Great Rift fissure. <b>Spatter</b> <b>cones</b> are created by accumulations of pasty gas-poor lava as they erupt from a vent. Big Craters is a cinder cone complex less than [...] up a steep foot trail.|$|R

50|$|A small {{collection}} of caves {{similar to the}} <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> caves exist {{just north of the}} <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> area. They are called rootless vent caves only because they are not sitting directly on the vent, like the spatter cones are. The rootless vent caves are also separated from the <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> caves by a younger lava flow associated with Klawhop Butte. There are about 16 rootless vent caves in the Horse system.|$|E

25|$|Cinder <b>cones</b> and <b>spatter</b> <b>cones</b> are {{small-scale}} features {{formed by}} lava accumulation around a small vent on a volcanic edifice. Cinder cones are formed from tephra or ash and tuff which is thrown from an explosive vent. <b>Spatter</b> <b>cones</b> are formed by accumulation of molten volcanic slag and cinders ejected {{in a more}} liquid form.|$|R

50|$|The volcano {{is formed}} by thick lava flows that {{surround}} a lava dome. A <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> {{is also found}} on the northeastern flank of the volcano.|$|E
50|$|The volcano {{is made of}} andesite. Lava flows contain clinopyroxene, olivine and quartz, {{the latter}} {{in the form of}} xenocrysts. Rocks on the <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> are aphyric.|$|E
50|$|In June 2014, a {{lava flow}} dubbed the June 27th flow started flowing from a vent of a <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> called Pu'u O'o {{on the east}} rift zone of Kilauea Volcano in a {{northwest}} direction towards the villages of Kaohe Homesteads and Pahoa.|$|E
50|$|Hornitos {{are formed}} in lava flows and are small {{openings}} that release {{small amounts of}} lava. Similar to <b>spatter</b> <b>cones,</b> Hornitos are rootless, meaning they form {{on the surface of}} lava flows like <b>spatter</b> <b>cones.</b> They are usually created by the slow upwelling of lava through the roof of a lava tube. High pressure causes lava to ooze and spatter out. The lava builds up on the surface and solidifies creating the initial structure. Hornitos can grow and exceed 10 meters in height.|$|R
50|$|Devil's Garden Volcanic Field is a {{volcanic}} field located south east of Newberry Caldera in Oregon. The lava field consists of several flows of pahoehoe lava that erupted from fissure vents {{in the northeast}} part of the Devils Garden. The main vent on {{the north end of}} the fissure fed two large gutter/tube systems. Several small vents to the south produced The Blowouts (two large <b>spatter</b> <b>cones),</b> several small <b>spatter</b> <b>cones,</b> and flows. Several older hills and higher areas were completely surrounded by the flows to form kipukas. The distal ends of the flows show excellent examples of inflated lava.|$|R
5000|$|Lava Beds National Monument is geologically {{outstanding}} {{because of}} its great variety of [...] "textbook" [...] volcanic formations, including lava tube caves, fumaroles, cinder <b>cones,</b> <b>spatter</b> <b>cones,</b> pit craters, hornitos, maars, lava flows, and volcanic fields.|$|R
50|$|A line of volcanoes {{extends from}} Cerro Cebollar to Cerro Palpana in south-north direction, of which Cerro de las Cuevas is the {{youngest}} volcano. Potassium-argon dating of the <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> on the northeastern flank of the volcano has yielded ages of 3.15±0.15 and 3.36±0.13 millions before present.|$|E
50|$|Open {{vertical}} conduits are vertical passages {{through which}} lava {{rose to the}} surface then receded. Their mouth is usually, though not necessarily, {{at the top of}} a vent structure like a <b>spatter</b> <b>cone,</b> spatter ridge, or hornito. Hornitos are open vertical conduits that form atop lavatubes.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} areas of Amoreiras and São João, that hug the coastal roadway, the parish extends into the interior, into a plain of {{volcanic}} spatter cones. The area {{is represented by the}} Lagoa do Congro (Lake of the Conger), a former <b>spatter</b> <b>cone,</b> now inundated with water.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} waterfalls, pools, cinder cones, tree moulds, lava tubes, <b>spatter</b> <b>cones,</b> a lava-dammed lake, caves and other {{features}} created by lava flows. The park aims to protect moose, goats, marmots, bears and many other species of wildlife.|$|R
5000|$|Pico Volcano - It {{occupies}} the western {{portion of the}} island, and corresponds to the central volcano with a 2341 m altitude. Along its flanks are diverse lava and <b>spatter</b> <b>cones</b> that are formed along radial fractures and faults.|$|R
50|$|Volcanic cones {{are among}} the {{simplest}} volcanic landforms. They are built by ejecta from a volcanic vent, piling up around the vent {{in the shape of}} a cone with a central crater. Volcanic cones are of different types, depending upon the nature and size of the fragments ejected during the eruption. Types of volcanic <b>cones</b> include stratocones, <b>spatter</b> <b>cones,</b> tuff cones, and cinder cones.|$|R
50|$|An {{eruption}} in {{the region}} on January 29, 2010 surprised volcanologists because no previous volcanic activity had ever taken place there before. A local scientist reported that fissures opened, then emitted gases {{for a little while}} before the eruption began. The eruption produced a small <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> and a lava flow that only travelled 8.2 metres, and caused some minor damage. The lava is trachybasalt and basaltic andesite.|$|E
50|$|Pukeiti {{is one of}} the volcanoes in the Auckland {{volcanic}} field. The <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> is {{the smallest}} volcano in Auckland, reaching 30 m above sea level, and has a shallow crater over 30 m wide. The crater rim was quarried on the south and east side. Extensive lava poured out from this vent to form a lava flow field to the north and east. It is now part of the Otuataua Stonefields reserve.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> is a low, steep-sided hill or mound that {{consists}} of welded lava fragments, called spatter, which has formed around a lava fountain issuing from a central vent. Typically, spatter cones are about 3-5 m high. In case of a linear fissure, lava fountaining will create broad embankments of spatter, called spatter ramparts, along {{both sides of the}} fissure. Spatter cones are more circular and cone shaped, while spatter ramparts are linear wall-like features.|$|E
50|$|Volcán Ecuador is the {{smallest}} of six shield volcanoes comprising Isabela Island of the Galápagos with an elevation of 790 m. It contains a caldera that is breached to the west by edifice collapse. The caldera floor is largely covered by youthful lava flows and contains several chains of <b>spatter</b> <b>cones</b> and small scoria cones.|$|R
50|$|Mount Washington is {{a deeply}} eroded shield volcano in the Cascade Range of Oregon. The {{mountain}} dates to the Late Pleistocene. However, {{it does have a}} line of basaltic andesite <b>spatter</b> <b>cones</b> on its northeast flank which are approximately 1,330 years old according to carbon dating. The main peak is a volcanic plug that was heavily eroded by glaciers in the last ice age.|$|R
500|$|Sawtooth Mountain {{is one of}} {{the many}} shield volcanoes topped by cinder <b>cones</b> and <b>spatter</b> <b>cones</b> that make up the Indian Heaven Volcanic Field. About 60 eruptive centers lie on the [...] long, N10°E-trending, Indian Heaven fissure zone. The [...] field has a volume of about [...] and forms the western part of a [...] Quaternary basalt field in the {{southern}} Washington Cascades, including the King Mountain fissure zone along which Mount Adams was built.|$|R
50|$|The radial fissure vents of Hawaiian volcanoes {{also produce}} “curtains of fire” as lava fountains erupting along {{a portion of}} a fissure. These vents build up low ramparts of basaltic spatter {{on both sides of the}} fissure. More {{isolated}} lava fountains along the fissure produce crater rows of small spatter and cinder cones. The fragments that form a <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> are hot and plastic enough to weld together, while the fragments that form a cinder cone remain separate because of their lower temperature.|$|E
50|$|The main volcano vent {{is located}} {{slightly}} {{to the east of}} the center of the lava flows, rising about 150 ft in a broad but conspicuous cone about a mile (1.6 km) in diameter. Within the outer cone are a series of nested spatter cones interspersed with lava pools. On the south side the innermost <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> rises to nearly 90 ft above the surrounding lava pools, and surrounds an intact symmetrical crater 245 ft across and about 30 ft deep.|$|E
50|$|There {{are over}} one-hundred caves in the system, varying {{from the very}} small <b>spatter</b> <b>cone</b> caves, to the very large and multi-lateral lava tubes. Generally, only a few caves within the system are known to the public because the {{majority}} lie on private property. Over time, {{the popularity of the}} caves wax and wane, but a few seem to always remain in the awareness of the public. These include: The Horse Caves, The Redmond Caves, Stevens Cave, Lewis Farm Cave no. 1, and Youngs Cave.|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} fissure vents, cinder <b>cones,</b> <b>spatter</b> <b>cones,</b> rafted blocks, and {{overlapping}} lava flows are accessible from the Loop Drive, [...] long. Wildflowers, shrubs, trees, and wild animals {{can be seen}} by hiking on one of the many trails in the monument or by just pulling over into one of the turn-offs. More rugged hiking opportunities are available in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area and Backcountry Area, the roadless southern and major part of the monument.|$|R
50|$|The Gedamsa Caldera is a 7 x 9 km caldera in the Main Ethiopian Rift valley. The caldera has {{steep sides}} with 100 - 200 m high walls, the upper parts of which consist {{predominantly}} of rhyolitic lava flows deposited {{in a series}} of trachite ignimbrite eruptions. There are small basaltic <b>spatter</b> <b>cones</b> and fumarolic activity inside the caldera floor along with a series of (Late Pleistocene to Holocene) rhyolite and pumice deposits and a Holocene lava dome/flow.|$|R
50|$|Lava once {{flowed from}} the {{numerous}} volcanic cones that {{rise above the}} plateau, consisting mainly of overlapping shield volcanoes, <b>spatter</b> <b>cones,</b> and cinder cones, which averages 4500 ft in elevation. The wilderness' highest point is Lemei Rock (5,927 ft), whose crater now contains Lake Wapiki. Other prominent volcanic peaks include Bird Mountain, Sawtooth Mountain, Gifford Peak, East Crater, and Red Mountain. Big Lava Bed {{is the result of}} the most recent volcanic activity about 8,200 years ago.|$|R
