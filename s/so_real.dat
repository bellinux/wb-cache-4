5|$|The band Pylon was {{a long-standing}} and {{influential}} {{part of the}} Athens scene, and became critical darlings in the 1980s, but never achieved significant mainstream success. This was partially because they eschewed several record contracts from the major labels {{due to a lack}} of trust in their corporate goodwill. Pylon's dance rock style was not very accessible or commercial, and was accompanied grating, chanting-style vocals, funky guitars and bass-heavy beats. Other 1980s local bands with nationwide alternative followings included Love Tractor, Oh-OK, with Michael Stipe's sister Lynda Stipe, vocalist Linda Hopper (later of Magnapop) and future solo performer Matthew Sweet, Dreams <b>So</b> <b>Real.</b> The members of R.E.M. have remained fixtures in Athens as they have also become international stars, helping out local performers like Vic Chesnutt, the Chickasaw Mudd Puppies and Jack Logan. The Elephant 6 Collective, a group of like-minded indie bands, gained limited nationwide exposure starting in the mid-1990s with the rise of Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and Olivia Tremor Control. The same period saw the Kindercore Records roster find critical acclaim, including the bands Sunshine Fix, Masters of the Hemisphere, Japancakes, Love Tractor, Gresham Disco and Of Montreal. Candy, a DJ store owned by Michael Lachowski of Pylon, opened in 1998; the store became an important part of the burgeoning dance music scene that produced Danger Mouse, Phungus and DJ 43.|$|E

Then during the thirty years he acted as secretary of the Royal Society he exercised an enormous if inconspicuous influence on the advancement of mathematical and physical science, not only directly by his own investigations, but indirectly by suggesting problems for inquiry and inciting men to attack them, and by his readiness to give encouragement and help.|$|E

[...] He further cites Fast Eddie Felson as one of [...] "only a handful of movie characters <b>so</b> <b>real</b> that the audience refers to them as touchstones."

The San Diego Unions Fritz Quindt said the animators [...] "did [...] likeness good," [...] and noted that in the game the [...] "colors on the Lakers jerseys and the Forum court were correct.

[...] In a review of Salaam Namaste, Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, [...] "While Preity Zinta isn't the subtlest actress, she's quite a comedienne– for a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics you might {{have to go back to}} Natalie Wood."

Simultaneously, the U.S. began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness. The [...] "dangers, toils, and snares" [...] of Newton's lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for Americans. This became poignantly true during the most serious test of American cohesion in the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865).

The hymn was translated into other languages as well: while on the Trail of Tears, the Cherokee sang Christian hymns as a way of coping with the ongoing tragedy, and a version of the song by Samuel Worcester that had been translated into the Cherokee language became very popular.|$|E
500|$|Pinocchio was a {{groundbreaking}} {{achievement in the}} area of effects animation. In contrast to the character animators who concentrate on the acting of the characters, effects animators create everything that moves other than the characters. This includes vehicles, machinery and natural effects such as rain, lightning, snow, smoke, shadows and water, as well as the fantasy or science-fiction type effects like Fairy Dust. The influential abstract animator Oskar Fischinger, who mainly worked on Fantasia contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy's wand. Effects animator Sandy Strother kept a diary about his year-long animation of the water effects, which included splashes, ripples, bubbles, waves and the illusion of being underwater. To help give depth to the ocean, the animators put more detail into the waves on the water surface in the foreground, and put in less detail as the surface moved further back. After the animation was traced onto cels, the animators would trace it once more with blue and black pencil leads to give the waves a sculptured look. To save time and money, the splashes were kept impressionistic. These techniques enabled Pinocchio {{to be one of the}} first animated films to have highly realistic effects animation. Ollie Johnston remarked [...] "I think that's one of the finest things the studio's ever done, as Frank [...] said, 'The water looks <b>so</b> <b>real</b> a person can drown in it, and they do.'" ...|$|E
