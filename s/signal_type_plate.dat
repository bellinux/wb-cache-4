40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} acoustic <b>signal</b> <b>typing</b> and perceptual evaluation of sustained vowels produced by tracheoesophageal (TE) speakers {{and the use of}} <b>signal</b> <b>typing</b> in the clinical setting. Methods Two evaluators independently categorized 1. 75 -second segments of narrow-band spectrograms according to acoustic <b>signal</b> <b>typing</b> and independently evaluated the recording of the same segments on a visual analog scale according to overall perceptual acoustic voice quality. The relationship between acoustic <b>signal</b> <b>typing</b> and overall voice quality (as a continuous scale and as a four-point ordinal scale) was investigated and the proportion of inter-rater agreement as well as the reliability between the two measures is reported. Results The agreement between <b>signal</b> <b>type</b> (I-IV) and ordinal voice quality (four-point scale) was low but significant, and there was a significant linear relationship between the variables. <b>Signal</b> <b>type</b> correctly predicted {{less than half of the}} voice quality data. There was a significant main effect of <b>signal</b> <b>type</b> on continuous voice quality scores with significant differences in median quality scores between <b>signal</b> <b>types</b> I-IV, I-III, and I-II. Conclusions <b>Signal</b> <b>typing</b> can be used as an adjunct to perceptual and acoustic evaluation of the same stimuli for TE speech as part of a multidimensional evaluation protocol. <b>Signal</b> <b>typing</b> in its current form provides limited predictive information on voice quality, and there is significant overlap between <b>signal</b> <b>types</b> II and III and perceptual categories. Future work should consider whether the current four <b>signal</b> <b>types</b> could be refined.

40|$|Abstract:- Automatic <b>signals</b> <b>type</b> {{classification}} (ASTC) is {{a technique}} for recognizing the modulation scheme of an intercepted signal and has seen increasing demand in both military and civilian. Most of previous tech-niques can identify only a few kinds of <b>signal</b> <b>types.</b> Also, usually, they request high SNR to achieve a mini-mum acceptable performance and don’t include higher order and new <b>types</b> of <b>signals</b> (e. g. QAM types). The work presented here proposes novel high performance method for identification of digital <b>signal</b> <b>types.</b> In this method it is proposed a hierarchical multiclass classifier based on support vector machine (SVM). The inputs of this classifier are higher order moments and cumulants (up to eight). Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select the best model of SVMs {{in order to improve}} the performance. Simulation results show that proposed method can recognize a lot of digital <b>signal</b> <b>types</b> and achieves a highly probability of classification even at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs) ...|$|R

This study presents the development and testing of an acoustic <b>signal</b> <b>typing</b> system based on visual inspection of a narrow-band spectrogram that can be used by researchers for classification of voice quality in tracheoesophageal speech. In addition to this classification system, a selection of acoustic measures [median fundamental frequency, standard deviation of fundamental frequency, jitter, percentage of voiced (%Voiced), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), glottal-to-noise excitation (GNE) ratio, and band energy difference (BED) ] was computed to provide more insight into the acoustic components of tracheoesophageal voice quality. For clinical relevance, relationships between the acoustic <b>signal</b> <b>types</b> and an overall judgment of the voice were investigated as well. Results showed that the four acoustic <b>signal</b> <b>types</b> form a good basis for performing more acoustic analyses and give a good impression of the overall quality of the voic...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that two peroxisomal enzymes involved in ether lipid synthesis, i. e., dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase and alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase, are directed to peroxisomes by different targeting signals, i. e., peroxisomal targeting <b>signal</b> <b>type</b> 1 and type 2, respectively. In this study, we describe a new human fibroblast cell line in which alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase was found to be deficient both at the level of enzyme activity and enzyme protein. At the cDNA level, a 128 base pair deletion was found leading to a premature stop. Remarkably, dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase activity was strongly reduced to a level comparable to the activities measured in fibroblasts from patients affected by the classical form of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (caused by a defect in peroxisomal targeting <b>signal</b> <b>type</b> 2 import). Dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase activity was completely normal in another alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase activity-deficient patient. Fibroblasts from this patient showed normal levels of the synthase protein and inactivity results from a point mutation leading to an amino acid substitution. These results strongly suggest that the activity of dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase is dependent on the presence of alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase protein. This interpretation implies that the deficiency of dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (targeted by a peroxisomal targeting <b>signal</b> <b>type</b> 1) in the classic form of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata is a consequence of the absence of the alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase protein (targeted by a peroxisomal targeting <b>signal</b> <b>type</b> 2...|$|R
