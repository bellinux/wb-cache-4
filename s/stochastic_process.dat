5|$|If {{the state}} space is the {{integers}} or natural numbers, then the <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> {{is called a}} discrete or integer-valued <b>stochastic</b> <b>process.</b> If the state space is the real line, then the <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> {{is referred to as}} a real-valued <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> or a process with continuous state space. If the state space is -dimensional Euclidean space, then the <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> is called a -dimensional vector process or -vector process.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a <b>stochastic</b> <b>process,</b> {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E

In this paper, we discuss the different approaches {{to the teaching of}} a first course in <b>stochastic</b> <b>processes</b> to researchers.

5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> has a separable version. It {{is also used}} {{when it is not}} possible to construct a <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|If a continuous-time real-valued <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> meets certain moment {{conditions}} on its increments, then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem {{says that there}} exists a modification of this process that has continuous sample paths with probability one, so the <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> has a continuous modification or version. The theorem can also be generalized to random fields so the index set is -dimensional Euclidean space {{as well as to}} stochastic processes with metric spaces as their state spaces.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} concerns pathwise integrability of <b>stochastic</b> <b>processes</b> {{which are}} non-semimartingales with unbounded power variation. In this dissertation, {{a class of}} <b>stochastic</b> <b>processes</b> which can be represented as a composition of a Hölder continuous process with a nonrandom function of locally bounded variation is studied. Since the nonrandom function may contain discontinuities, <b>stochastic</b> <b>processes</b> in this class are usually of unbounded power variation.

5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the <b>stochastic</b> <b>process.</b> In other words, {{the behavior of the}} process in the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given {{the current state of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random walk {{is known as the}} simple random walk, which is a <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> in {{discrete}} time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers.

5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a <b>stochastic</b> <b>process</b> and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E
