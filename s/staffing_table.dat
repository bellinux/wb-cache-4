40|$|The Resource Allocation Criteria (RAC) {{began to}} develop in 1972, {{responding}} to management requirements of the Indian Health Service (IHS). The RAC is now the principal management tool of the IHS Manpower Management Program, which justifies all manpower-related budgetary requests to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). RAC fulfills its obligations by identifying necessary tasks to provide quality resources for each segment {{of the health care}} system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the reliability of the data inputs to RAC, the degree to which the quality of the input affects the reliability of the output. and Identification of means to improve the quality of input data. The study first identified input data elements through the use of archival (RAC) records and interviews with IHS personnel. From this data, flow charts and profile sheets were compiled. IHS Program/Area Offices site visits were then initiated. Here, patient records were sampled, meetings with site personnel to review methods in use were held, and local finance and contract personnel were interviewed to determine volume of and tracking method for services. Using these data, flow charts were developed and data estimates were constructed using all previously gathered material. From these data estimates, the accuracy of RAC input data was compared with the actual data collected and the constructed data estimates. The findings of the study included: 1) as a result of perceived undercounting, population data from IHS suffers from a lack of confidence at the Area Offices; 2) both inpatient and outpatient data are suspect because of the practice of issuing one patient more than one patient number and, conversely issuing the same patient number to more than one patient; 3) illegible record entries hinder accurate patient data gathering; 4) a high turnover in record keeping personnel; 5) a significantly lower error rate in inpatient data than in outpatient data; 6) a number of inpatient and outpatient records never enter the IHS data system; 7) alcoholism is not always reported as the cause of medical attention in projecting demand for contract health services; 8) RAC does not adequately project the additional need for P. L. 638 contracting; 9) data is often lacking from HSA- 43 and HSA- 64 reporting forms; 10) contract health service providers are not always audited; 11) many contract service bills are submitted after the close of the fiscal year; 12) RAC <b>staffing</b> <b>tables</b> are relatively insensitive from a statistical perspective; and 13) Service Units and Area Offices are more accurate predictors of direct service needs than are contract providers. Numerous recommendations are made concerning: 1) the national decennial census; 2) population migration and projections; 3) a unique patient identification numbering system; 4) inpatient and outpatient data verification procedures; 5) feasibility of developing the HSA- 44 - 1 and the HSA- 406 as clinical management tools; 6) an inventory of the patient record system; 7) Area Offices review systems checks; 8) the accuracy of patient data; 9) use of HSA- 406 forms during itinerant visits; 10) a training program for Community Health Aides (CHAs); 11) reporting alcoholism as a primary diagnosis; 12) projected utilization of contract services to actual contract services needs; 13) a method of identifying and projecting P. L. 638 costs; 14) efforts to obtain all contractor invoices before the end of the fiscal year; 15) algorithms that support <b>staffing</b> <b>tables</b> and then perform another sensitivity analysis; and 21) standardization of collection, reporting, and recording parameters of projected and actual data and ensure a consistent application in developing RAC input data...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The paper discusses electronic information resources as library materials use for information works in contemporary information age by library staff. The paper purposely identified the available electronic information resources and their extent of use by library staff. The study employed a descriptive survey design. The instrument of data collection is questionnaire while, population of the study comprises 19 library staff who work in Kogi State University Library, Anyigba. Data gathered by use of questionnaire were analyzed by simple percentage to determine availability of electronic information resources (table, 1) and use of available electronic information resources by library <b>staff</b> (<b>table,</b> 2); while mean {{were used to determine}} the extent of use of available electronic information resources (table, 3). The findings shows that out of 20 itemized electronic information resources 8 (40. 0 %) were considered available while 12 (60. 0 %) were considered not available. More to this, out of population of 19 library staff 6 (31. 6 %) know how to use available electronic information resources while, 13 (68. 4 %) do not know how to use them. Furthermore, out of 8 available electronic information resources 5 were used to great extent while, 3 to low extent. Hence, data analyzed in (table 1, 2 & 3) are presented in charts. Recommendations were proffered on how to make adequate electronic information resources available, examples/ categories / types of electronic information resources to be provided (table, 4) as well as uses of them in the library (table, 5...|$|R

Initially these systems were not sophisticated {{and many of the}} early systems did not support a remote printer in the kitchen. Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations. Most tablet systems upload all information to the Internet so managers and owners can view reports from anywhere with a password and Internet connection. Smartphone Internet access has made alerts and reports from the POS very accessible. Tablets have helped create the Mobile POS system, and Mobile POS applications also include payments, loyalty, online ordering, table side ordering by <b>staff</b> and <b>table</b> top ordering by customers.

Cognizant of this, the NQS goals are expected to be achieved slowly by 2016 (DEEWR, 2009).

More specifically the objectives {{of this study are}} to assess the health practices ofSevastopol teachers. The {{participants in this study were}} selected from the Sevastopol School District in the state of Wisconsin. A survey instrument was adapted and used by the researcher. A total of 80 surveys were distributed and thirty-nine were obtained. The first section of the survey consisted of two demographic questions dealing with years of teaching experience and grade level taught. Section two focused on personal wellness practices and attitudes towards wellness policy. Frequency counts and percentages were used on all items. The study found that Sevastopol staff are practicing healthy habits and are in support ofwellness policy in the school. The staff is generally in excellent to goodIII health.

Some of the recommendations made in this chapter focus on policy changes, such as the budgeting shifts needed to blend funds from both CWS and AOD systems. Other suggestions involve changes at the practice level, such as the nature of the actual forms to be used in assessment and the training needed to ensure a connection between new practice and the attitudes and competencies of existing <b>staff.</b> In <b>Table</b> 14, we set out recommendations according to the corresponding element of our policy framework and the related observations...|$|R
