40|$|A design can {{be defined}} as {{context-sensitive}} when it achieves effective technical and functional transportation solutions, while preserving and enhancing natural environments and minimizing impacts on local communities. Traffic noise {{is one of the most}} critical environmental impacts of transportation infrastructure and it affects both humans and ecosystems. Tire/pavement noise is caused by a set of interactions at the contact patch and it is the predominant source of road noise at the regular traffic speeds. Wearing course characteristics affect tire/pavement noise through various mechanisms. Furthermore, acoustic performance of road pavements varies over time and it is influenced by both aging and temperature. Three experimentations have been carried out to evaluate wearing course characteristics effects on tire/pavement noise. The first study involves the evaluation of skid resistance, surface texture and tire/pavement noise of an innovative application of multipurpose cold-laid microsurfacing. The second one involves the evaluation of the surface and acoustic characteristics of the different pavement sections of the test track of the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT) at the University of Waterloo. In the third study, a set of highway sections have been selected in Southern Ontario with various types of pavements. Noise measurements were carried out by means of the Statistical Pass-by (<b>SPB)</b> <b>method</b> in the first case study, whereas in the second and in the third one, Close-proximity (CPX) and the On-Board Sound Intensity (OBSI) methods have been performed in parallel. Test results have contributed to understand the effects of pavement materials, temperature and aging on tire/pavement noise. Negligible correlation was found between surface texture and roughness with noise. As a general trend, aged and stiffer materials have shown to provide higher noise levels than newer and less stiff ones. Noise levels were also observed to be higher with temperature increase...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransportation noise has {{a growing}} {{detrimental}} {{impact on the}} environment, humans health and living conditions. In addition to noise mitigation by erection of the expensive noise barriers, tire/pavement noise can be reduced “in source” by construction of special asphalt pavements. While that solution is commonly known in regions with moderate maritime climate (e. g. The Netherlands), in places with more harsh climate it is not popular. High number (> 100 /year) of freeze and thaw (F&T) cycles in Poland is a significant limitation for porous asphalt technology. This paper presents results of the research work conducted within research project called “Innovative pavement technology with reduced noise emission” with acronym CiDRO. The project was conducted by a consortium composed of Mostostal Warszawa (leader of the consortium), Warsaw University of Technology – Faculty of Civil Engineering and Road and Bridge Research Institute – Department of Pavement Technology (members of the consortium). This project was supported by Polish National Centre for Research and Development. Within {{the scope of the}} CiDRO project presented in this paper, various noise reducing asphalt technologies were tested in both laboratory and field sections. Those sections included the following types of wearing course: asphalt concrete AC 11 (reference), stone mastic (matrix) asphalt SMA 5 and SMA 8, open graded friction course OGFC 8 and OGFC 11, porous asphalt PA 8 and PA 11. The range of laboratory research program consists of typical quality control and evaluation studies of functional characteristics such as resistance to water and frost, low temperature cracking resistance, aging resistance, rheological properties and fatigue life. In addition, field tests such as noise emissions by CPX and <b>SPB</b> <b>methods,</b> texture depth, friction coefficient and in-situ water permeability were performed. Field tests were repeated following winter period. Moreover, to simulate clogging, dirt (previously collected road debris) was spread on the surface and cleaning treatment was performed using specialized equipment. Selected properties of the pavement surface were tested to determine the effectiveness of cleaning process. Finally, two most promising sections were proposed for construction as real traffic exposed roads and subjected for observation during their exploitation. An initial conclusions and recommendations were drawn regarding the mixture maximum aggregate size and air void content...|$|R

In this approach, single cells or small collections of cells are co-encapsulated within an enzymatically-degradable hydrogel block {{along with a}} random collection of fluorescent beads, whose number, color, and position encode {{the identity of the}} cell, enabling samples to be transferred in bulk between single-cell assay platforms without losing the identity of individual cells. The application of SPB is demonstrated for transferring cells from a subnanoliter protein secretion/phenotyping array platform into a microtiter plate, with re-identification accuracies in the plate assay of 96 ± 2 %. Encapsulated cells are recovered by digesting the hydrogel, allowing subsequent genotyping and phenotyping of cell lysates. Finally, a model scaling is developed to illustrate how different parameters affect the accuracy of SPB and to motivate scaling of the method to thousands of unique blocks.

The AFM images reveal three stages of bilayer formation: localized disklike features that are single bilayer footprints of the vesicles, partial continuous coverage, and finally complete bilayer formation. The mechanism of supported phospholipid bilayers formation is the fusion of proximal vesicles, rather than surface disk migration.

40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} an {{important}} branch of the environment pollution which deeply affects the population {{and for that reason}} it has been included in the set of pavement performance indicators.

The level of the noise is influenced by traffic density and traffic composition, as well as vehicle speed and the type of surface. The article presents the results of studies on tire/road noise from passing vehicles at a speed of 40 – 80 kph, carried out by using the statistical pass-by <b>method</b> (<b>SPB),</b> on seven surfaces with different characteristics. It has been shown that increasing the speed from 40 kph to 50 kph contributes to the increase in the maximum A-weighted sound pressure level by about 3 dB, regardless of the type of surface. For larger differences in speed (30 kph– 40 kph) increase in noise levels reaches values about 10 dB. In the case of higher speeds, this increase is slightly lower. In this article, special attention is paid to the noisiness from surfaces made of porous asphalt concrete (PAC), BBTM (thin asphalt layer), and stone mastic asphalt (SMA) with a maximum aggregate size of 8 mm and 5 mm. It has also been proved that surfaces of porous asphalt concrete, within two years after the commissioning, significantly contribute to a reduction of the maximum level of noise in the streets and roads with lower speed of passing cars. Reduction of the maximum A-weighted sound pressure level of a statistical car traveling at 60 kph reaches values of up to about 6 dB, as compared with the SMA 11.

40|$|Introduction: Safe driving {{requires}} {{the ability of}} the driver to receive the messages and complying with them. The most significant consequences of noise pollution are on the human auditory system. Disorders in the auditory system can have harmful side effects for human health. By reducing this kind of pollution in large cities, the quality of life, {{which is one of the}} biggest goals of the governments, can be considerably increased. Hence, in the present research, some parameters of vehicle tires were examined as a source of noise pollution, and the results can be taken into consideration in noise pollution reduction. Material and Method: Several vehicles with different tire width were selected for measuring sound level. The sound levels were measured for moving vehicles with the use of the Statistical Pass By <b>Method</b> (<b>SPB,</b> ISO 11819 - 1). Following sound level measurements for moving vehicles and by considering tire width, mathematical model of noise level was predicted on the basis of the obtained information and by usage of SPSS program and considering vehicle tire parameters. Result: The result of this study showed that the vehicle speed and tire width can affect different sound levels emitted by moving tire on road surface. The average speed of vehicles can play an important role in the noise pollution. By increasing speed, rotation of the the tires on the asphalt is increased, as it is a known factors for noise pollution. Moreover, changing the speed of vehicles is accompanied with abnormal sounds of vehicle engine. According to regression model analysis, the obtained value of R 2 for the model is 0. 8367 which represents the coefficient of determination. Conclusion: The results suggest the main role of the vehicle speed and tire width in increasing the noise reaches to the drivers and consequent noise pollution, which demonstrates the necessity for noise control measures. According to the obtained model, it is understood that changes in noise levels and tire width are more than those of vehicles speed. The coefficient of 0. 1482 for tire width, comparing to coefficient of 0. 1195, shows that considering the proper tire width can be effecttive in reduction of sound level...|$|R
40|$|Noise is {{a growing}} health concern as urban {{residents}} increases rapidly and more reports of noise causing sleep disturbances and increasing the risk of cardiovascular health problems are published. Noise has a negative influence on life quality. This life quality deficiency also shows in housing and office pricing in noisy environments. Housing and office prices are often higher in quiet areas than in noisy areas. Therefore noise is both a health issue and has big economic consequences. The biggest contributor to the road traffic noise is the tire/road noise at speeds above 50 km/h. Therefore {{this is an important}} aspect to monitor and the problem has to be alleviated. In this thesis the client Ramböll has gotten many contracts concerning the state of the roads from governmental institutes. As a part of the evaluation of the roads they want to implement the noise emission as a factor. This gives the government institutions another parameter that helps in the decision of which part of the road network to refurbish first. In the effort to decide what is best way for Ramböll to measure noise a new setup for measuring noise has been developed. The most used ways of measuring tire/road-noise is the close proximity (CPX) -method and the statistical pass-by (<b>SPB)</b> -method. These <b>methods</b> both give accurate results but they have drawbacks. The SPB measurements are time consuming and only give noise levels for a small patch of a road. CPX measurement on the other hand require costly and time consuming development of a measurement trailer. Certifying the trailer and maintenance work of it is expensive. So this report shows a first step in how to build a measurement setup and what aspects were taken into consideration when it was designed. A close proximity measurement setup {{in the form of a}} tube with a microphone placed inside it was built and installed underneath the measurement vehicle. The  measurement setup designed and built was named the Tube-CPX measurement setup in this report. The measurements performed with this Tube-CPX measurement setup show promising results. Similarities between CPX measurement setup and the Tube-CPX setup have been found both in the frequency spectrum as well as in the relation with pass-by measurement noise levels. The repeatability of the Tube-CPX measurements is even better than the compared CPX measurements. Although results are promising more work is required before the Tube-CPX setup can be seen in operation at Ramböll. In particular the question which source causes which sound pressure is required to understand the measured levels. And also more controlled pass-by measurements have to be performed to determine the relation of the absolute values measured at the tire/road impact spot to the values that are most interesting, namely the sound pressure levels that the human at the side of the road depicts...|$|R
40|$|When using {{surfaces}} {{with special}} qualities, {{there is a}} need for tools to assess these qualities. Two <b>methods,</b> <b>SPB</b> (Statistical Pass-by) and CPX (Close Proximity), have been used for testing the noise properties of the surfaces in the other countries. Both of these methods had to be modified to suit the Finnish environment. SPBmod-method adheres to the ISO-standard quite closely. It was decided that heavy vehicles are not included in the test, as stipulated in the standard. The normalisation speeds used are 60, 80 and 100  km/h which are not the same as in the standard. There is only a draft standard for the CPX-method. In this standard it is suggested that four different tyres representing different vehicle types should be used. In Finland the method was modified so that measurements are done with one slick tyre (ASTM E  524). This method is called CPXmod. In this research it was recommended that SPBmod-method should be used. Noise levels of the different products can be expressed by comparing them to the virtual references. Virtual reference is an average of several SPBmod-results of different SMA  16 surfaces of different ages. Virtual references are: 60  km/h, 76  dB; 80  km/h, 80  dB; 100  km/h, 83. 5  dB. According to the standard, measurements can be taken when the air temperature is 5 - 30  °C. It was noticed that in Finland there is a seasonal variation in the results. The variation is smaller during the summer months. That is why it was suggested that in Finland the measurements should be taken during June, July and August. Standard also suggests that results should temperature corrected to the reference temperature (20  °C). There is also no common understanding at the moment about the formula of the temperature correction. That is why it is suggested that the measurements should be taken as close to the reference temperature as possible. Measurements should be taken after the first winter. Because of studded tyres the wearing of surfaces has been a problem in Finland. With the "normal" asphalt surfaces a commonly used method is the Prall method. It was found out that this test does not predict almost at all the wearing of quiet surfaces. One problem was that the test was too "rough" for the core samples and they got broken during the test. The Prall test was modified a little to keep the samples whole but the result was the same. It did not predict the wearing measured from the roads. The only way to evaluate the wearing of the quiet surfaces is to compare the profilometer results with the results of the "normal" asphalt products on the same road. Based on the test roads it seems that during the HILJA-project contractors have succeeded in developing surfaces which have good noise reducing qualities (even over 6  dB less noise than the virtual reference) and do not wear more than the normally used asphalt surfaces on the same roads. The enquiries show that there is still need and willingness to use these surfaces in future. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the {{interest}} regarding solar powered aircraft has increased significantly and, in particular, the attention {{has been focused on}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), able to perform High Altitude and Long Endurance (HALE) missions for telecommunication, remote sensing, surveillance and control, both for civil and military applications. The present dissertation shows the results of a research about Solar Powered Biplanes (SPBs), dealing with the definition of a design methodology and the introduction of new design tools for this kind of aircraft. Chapter 1 illustrates the purpose of thesis and the potential benefits of choosing a biplane architecture, among which the most important is the increase of structural stiffness without reducing the aerodynamic efficiency. In order to understand the challenge represented by the solar powered flight and to give a picture of {{the context in which the}} present research is placed, the history of the solar powered flight and the state of the art about solar powered aircraft are presented in Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 4, then, gives an overview of the research activities about the box-wing systems and presents the state of the art on the solar powered biplanes, which have been studied in the past years at the Department of Aerospace Engineering (DIA) of Pisa. Chapter 5 introduces the mission requirements and the definition of two types of mission, conceived in order to perform the two main tasks of such kind of UAVs: Telecommunication (TLC) and Intelligence, Reconnaissance and Surveillance (IRS) operations. The selection of system components is presented in Chapter 6, where the characteristics of different types of solar cells, solar panels technologies and rechargeable batteries are illustrated. Chapter 7 provides the geometric definition of a generic SPB configuration and some simplifications are introduced in order to define the main design parameters. The design procedure is illustrated in Chapter 8, which opens with a description of the effects of each design parameter on the <b>SPB</b> design. A <b>method</b> for the preliminary aircraft sizing, based on design curves, is proposed and the other steps of the procedure are introduced: a section for input data, one for the definition of additional requirements, one for the procedure settings, and the last one for the optimization method adopted. This latter is the most important part of the procedure and it is presented with particular attention to the related objective function, defined as the aircraft mass multiplied by a penalty function, which is activated when the aforementioned additional requirements are not fulfilled. The objective function evaluation is performed by means of the so-called "sizing process", which is described in Chapter 9. It is composed of several models for Aerodynamics, Flight Mechanics, energy balance evaluation, structural analysis and propulsion system sizing. When describing such models, the thesis focuses on some important aspects, such as the definition of wings' airfoils, the method for the minimum required power and cruise speed calculation and the fulfillment of Flight Mechanics requirements by means of a mass balance strategy. The models for the evaluation of accumulators, structures and motors masses are presented as well. Finally, Chapter 10 presents the designed SPBs and, by means of a tool introduced in this work and called "Operating Domain", the flexibility in terms of altitude-latitude-day conditions is analyzed for such configurations. Among the achieved results, it is worth of notice a SPB configuration able to fly in each year's day, at latitudes up to 45 ° and altitudes up to 18000 m. Such performances meet some of the requirements defined by the U. S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for the ongoing Vulture Program and indicated as goals of the HALE flight. In conclusion, an example of a multi-purpose configuration is presented to show the flexibility of the SPB concept. The presented aircraft can perform both TLC and IRS missions, flying at altitudes up to 17000 m, and, since its modular geometry, it can be modified to fly above 18000 m during Summer...|$|R
