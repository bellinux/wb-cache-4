5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in <b>society</b> <b>will</b> be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E
25|$|Adaptation: The future {{level of}} {{adaptive}} capacity in human and natural systems {{to climate change}} will affect how <b>society</b> <b>will</b> be impacted by climate change. Assessments may under- or overestimate adaptive capacity, leading to under- or overestimates of positive or negative impacts.|$|E
25|$|Compared to science, another social movement, {{religion}} {{is more efficient}} because it motivates people more effectively. According to Adler, only when science begins to capture the same religious fervour, and promotes the welfare of all segments of <b>society,</b> <b>will</b> the two be more equal in peoples' eyes.|$|E

50|$|In practice, the FCA {{expects that}} most non-directive {{friendly}} <b>societies</b> <b>will</b> be PRA-authorised persons. Where {{that is the}} case, the small friendly <b>society</b> function <b>will</b> not apply. PRA approval is required instead.|$|R

25|$|Indeed {{it can be}} said {{in advance}} that the {{measures}} required to deal with the full potential amount of motor traffic in big cities are so formidable that <b>society</b> <b>will</b> have to ask itself seriously how far it is prepared to go with the motor vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The {{society is}} so small that {{the death of one}} member—a little boy named Joey—seems likely to {{determine}} for many generations to come whether the emerging <b>society</b> <b>will</b> or won't be literate...As Ish thinks of it, each new baby is a candle lit against the dark.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Society</b> <b>will</b> {{advance the}} sum {{necessary}} to make good whatsoever may be deficient for these purposes... The emigrants will he required to repay to the Society {{the whole of the}} sums advanced to them, which will again be applied {{in the same manner as}} the original fund.|$|E

25|$|The {{society does}} not have any bylaws. Unlike the New Republican Society, the Republican Society does not {{undertake}} actions to bring the republic closer. It proceeds from the notion that the mere existence of the Republican <b>Society</b> <b>will</b> be enough to enable the restoration of the Dutch Republic in the long term. One can only become a member by co-optation.|$|E
25|$|Such {{externalities}} are {{a result}} of firms externalising their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost. As a result of externalising such costs we see that members of <b>society</b> <b>will</b> be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm. In this case, we see that an increased cost of production on society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve.|$|E
25|$|It is envisaged that {{achieving}} {{the aim of}} a 2000-watt <b>society</b> <b>will</b> require, amongst other measures, a complete reinvestment in the country's capital assets; refurbishment of the nation's building stock {{to bring it up}} to low energy building standards; significant improvements in the efficiency of road transport, aviation and energy-intensive material use; the possible introduction of high-speed maglev trains; the use of renewable energy sources, district heating, microgeneration and related technologies; and a refocusing of research into new priority areas.|$|E
5000|$|All <b>societies</b> <b>will</b> always stigmatize some {{conditions}} and some behaviors because doing so provides for group solidarity by delineating [...] "outsiders" [...] from [...] "insiders".|$|R

50|$|The {{prosecution}} largely {{attempted to}} portray the Methodist clergy as a dangerous, almost secret <b>society,</b> <b>willing</b> to defend their minister and the good name of their church at any cost.|$|R
25|$|Many local chevra kadishas {{in urban}} areas are {{affiliated}} with local synagogues, and they often own their own burial plots in various local cemeteries. Some Jews pay an annual token membership fee to the chevra kadisha of their choice, {{so that when the}} time comes, the <b>society</b> <b>will</b> not only attend to the body of the deceased as befits Jewish law, but will also ensure burial in a plot that it controls at an appropriate nearby Jewish cemetery.|$|E
25|$|In March 1992, Pope John Paul II stated At {{this moment}} in the Church's history, the Charismatic Renewal can play a {{significant}} role in promoting the much-needed defense of Christian life in societies where secularism and materialism have weakened many people's ability to respond to the Spirit and to discern God's loving call. Your contribution to the re-evangelization of <b>society</b> <b>will</b> be made in the first place by personal witness to the indwelling Spirit and by showing forth His presence through works of holiness and solidarity.|$|E
25|$|The eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses {{is central}} to their {{religious}} beliefs. They believe that Jesus Christ has been ruling in heaven as king since 1914 (a date they believe was prophesied in Scripture), and that after that time a period of cleansing occurred, resulting in God's selection of the Bible Students associated with Charles Taze Russell to be his people in 1919. They also believe the destruction of those who reject their message and thus willfully refuse to obey God will shortly take place at Armageddon, ensuring that {{the beginning of the}} new earthly <b>society</b> <b>will</b> be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|From 6 September 2010, {{the value}} limit for all payment-types {{was raised to}} £100,000. However, [...] "individual banks and {{building}} <b>societies</b> <b>will</b> continue to set their own value limits for their corporate and consumer customers." ...|$|R
50|$|In Britain, {{the main}} {{predator}} is the badger. Hedgehogs in the UK have demonstrably lower populations {{in areas where}} badgers are numerous, so that British hedgehog rescue <b>societies</b> <b>will</b> not release hedgehogs into known badger territories.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{aggregate}} distribution of declared opin- ions and behavior when heterogeneous individuals make the trade- off between being true to their private opinions and conforming to an endogenous social norm. The model {{sheds light on}} how various punishment regimes induce conformity or law obedience, and by whom, and on phenomena such as societal polarization, unimodal concentration and alienation. In orthodox <b>societies,</b> individuals <b>will</b> tend to either fully conform or totally ignore the social norm, while individuals in liberal <b>societies</b> <b>will</b> tend to compromise between these two extremes. Furthermore, the degree of orthodoxy determines whether those who fairly agree with the norm or those who strongly disapprove it will conform. Like- wise, the degree of liberalism determines which individuals will compromise the most. In addition, orthodox societies may adapt norms that are skewed {{with respect to the}} private opinions in society, while liberal <b>societies</b> <b>will</b> not do so...|$|R
25|$|The Bill {{provides}} us with a framework to establish objectives with a biophysical bottom line that must not be compromised. Provided that those objectives are met, what people get up to is their affair. As such, the Bill provides a more liberal regime for developers. On the other hand, activities {{will have to be}} compatible with hard environmental standards and <b>society</b> <b>will</b> set those standards. Clause 4 sets out the biophysical bottom line. Clauses 5 and 6 set out further specific matters that expand on the issues. The Bill has a clear and rigorous procedure for the setting of environmental standards – and the debate will be concentrating on just where we set those standards.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Government of China {{released}} its medium {{and long term}} national ICT in education master plans, which stated explicitly that ICT would have a historic impact {{on the development of}} education and called for a strong emphasis on ICT in education. In order to realize the scientific and orderly development of ICT in education, China has developed a holistic and top-down approach. The Ten Year Development Plan for ICT in Education 2011-2020 was formalized in 2012. It states that by 2020, all adults will have access to quality education resources in an ICT-enabling environment, an ICT support service system for the learning <b>society</b> <b>will</b> take shape, and all regions and schools at all levels will have broadband internet access.|$|E
25|$|The Communist radical {{of today}} will be the {{administrator}} of tomorrow, and the Communist <b>Society</b> <b>will</b> need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be {{the business of the}} radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function {{as a part of the}} established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The Basel III {{rules are}} {{expected}} to phase out PIBS' inclusion in Tier 1 regulatory capital, meaning that building <b>societies</b> <b>will</b> be looking to replace PIBS as the opportunity arises. A replacement instrument has been created as Core Capital Deferred Shares.|$|R
50|$|The Thals {{appear in}} the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel War of the Daleks (1997) by John Peel, which depicts them having become a warlike <b>society</b> <b>willing</b> to destroy an {{inhabited}} planet simply {{as part of a}} trap to defeat a Dalek attack fleet.|$|R
50|$|David Cutter {{will become}} chief {{executive}} of the enlarged <b>Society,</b> which <b>will</b> be called Skipton Building <b>Society</b> and <b>will</b> be headquartered at The Bailey, Skipton. As previously announced, the current chief executives of both societies, John Goodfellow and John Carrier, will continue with their planned retirements on 31 December 2008.|$|R
500|$|Nicola's {{second wife}} died in 1797, and he retired the {{following}} year. In 1798, {{he moved to}} Alexandria, Virginia {{to be closer to}} his daughter. [...] He died on August 8, 1807. Earlier in that year, because of financial troubles, he had added the words [...] "any deficiency I presume the Cincinnati <b>society</b> <b>will</b> make good" [...] to his will. [...] At the time of his death, Nicola possessed only $55.|$|E
500|$|Surat Singh, {{director}} of the Haryana Institute of Rural Development, Nilokheri , anticipated that the verdict will end the diktats of khap panchayats. The khaps had never worried before because their [...] "political bosses refrained people [...] from acting against them. With this verdict, those who try to impose a medieval order on <b>society</b> <b>will</b> think twice". Political analyst Ranbir Singh agreed that the judgement will [...] "act as a deterrent". Additional Advocate General Arun Walia hailed the decision: [...] "before passing ruthless judgments, the members will surely take note of this decision".|$|E
500|$|In Rothbard's view of parenthood, [...] "the parent {{should not}} have a legal {{obligation}} to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights." [...] Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have {{the legal right to}} let any infant die by starvation, and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect. However, according to Rothbard, [...] "the purely free <b>society</b> <b>will</b> have a flourishing free market in children". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, [...] "the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum".|$|E

30|$|It is a {{difficult}} task to implement a specific training standard nationally because resources and training conditions differ between local hospitals.
