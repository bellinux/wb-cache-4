50|$|Asian Americans {{are often}} {{represented}} as affluent, well educated {{individuals with a}} high work ethic, and tend to feature more often in advertising that promotes technology and business than African American or Latino models. Asian Americans were shown in the workplace in 50% of the print ads that they featured in, whilst African Americans and Latinos were more diversely featured {{in a variety of}} activities such as outdoor and sporting pursuits or at leisure. Ads that Asian American men feature in often perpetuate a stereotype of success and sacrifice to achieve financial rewards, such Paek and Shah's (2003) example of a print ad, in which an Asian man talking to his wife tells her he will have to work late tonight. The ad suggests that the man is already at work and ready to make his company's goals a reality, whilst being prepared for his personal life to come as a <b>secondary</b> <b>commitment.</b> Many may argue that the stereotype of hard work and affluence may be a positive one and {{does not appear to be}} problematic. To be wealthy and successful is surely a benefit in American society, however passive viewing of television and print advertising goes a long way towards shaping viewers' perceptions of minorities, and this representation of Asian Americans in the media can be damaging in so far as presenting an inaccurate picture of Asia as a whole, and an incorrect defining point for each individual within that culture.|$|E
40|$|Under current Illinois law, {{criminals who}} have been {{adjudicated}} guilty of committing certain types of sex offenses can, at any point during their incarceration, be involuntarily committed indefinitely. They are sent to the Treatment and Detention Facility in Rushville, Illinois, where they are to undergo treatment for various disorders, and are not released until the Department of Human Services determines they no longer present a danger of re-offending. While this is {{the intent of the}} law, in practice this <b>secondary</b> <b>commitment</b> is violating these offenders’ Due Process rights. This Comment examines the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act in Illinois; its background, what the Act allows, and how it is operating in practice. It compares Illinois’s Act with those of other states, shows why the Act in Illinois is violating the resident’s Due Process rights, and offers some solutions for the State to apply to make the Act conform to the law so the State is no longer violating the U. S. Constitution and U. S. Supreme Court precedent...|$|E

His involvement with the temperance movement was criticized by Samuel Rodman, who believed that French's commitment to temperance was <b>secondary</b> to his <b>commitment</b> [...] "to the ascendency of his political friends". In 1841, Rodman reported on French's disruptive effect on local temperance and town meetings. Charles W. Morgan described French [...] "verbose & violent" [...] and possessing [...] "the faculty and talent to outrun and distract every meeting he attends & he generally is successful". French was considered persona non grata in the city's aristocratic circles.|$|R

40|$|Uncovering The Legacy of Policy. An Ethnographic Account of a <b>Secondary</b> School’s <b>Commitment</b> to Creativity By Pauline Moger In {{the field}} of policy to date there is a {{tendency}} to focus upon the complexities of process associated with policy enactment; investigating the relationship between national policy discourse and the ways in which this discourse is creatively reconstituted in school-based contexts of practice. This thesis is concerned with the ways in which a school-based commitment to a specific policy – in this instance creativity – is sustained and has a legacy even after national policy discourse and priorities have changed. The thesis employs an overarching ethnographic method and qualitative inquiry of the ‘field’ through which the research questions and aims are explored. The research approach adopted is a case study. The nature of relations and relationships in consideration and enactment of policy as legacy is examined and presented. A symbolic interactionist framework is employed to understand and interpret the interactional processes involved in the policy legacy of creativity. The study identifies key factors and elements that play a critical part in a continued commitment to creativity in education, enacted through policy as a continuum of practice, building upon the seminal work of scholars such as Ball, Braun and McGuire. In this process this study locates and understands the context and significance of interaction between key policy actors pivotal to sustaining and embedding a commitment to creativity and as such questions established policy enactment conceptualization. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{introduced}} for decision making on curricular contents of Knowledge Organization for academic programs of Library Science, Documentation and Information Science, orientated to the Mercosur region. The {{design of the}} model has taken into account the core contents recommended by the Mercosur meetings of directors and teachers from library schools, the so called ISKO trend, and the contributions of several authors related to both sources. The model has three primary categories: foundations, applications and ethics of Knowledge Organization. The foundations are considered from a multidimensional approach. The applications are divided into three secondary categories: a) construction of knowledge organization systems, b) content description, and c) quality management of Knowledge Organization. The ethics is also divided into three <b>secondary</b> categories: ethical <b>commitment,</b> ethical values and ethical problems. The model should be understood as an empty mold {{that needs to be}} filled with the contents determined by each academic program or curricular space, and it is expected that facilitates the assessment, updating and comparison of those contents. The limitation of the model is that {{it is based on the}} Mercosur recommendations and ISKO trends, which are not accepted by all the specialists. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and {{discusses}} {{to what extent}} this paradigm can contribute to sustainable development. The thesis considers how transnational companies {{have an impact on}} human development and resource management through their business activities and introduction of agendas for CSR. The thesis is based on a study of a subsidiary of the Norwegian corporation Norsk Hydro ASA operating in Argentina. The logic of corporate behavior is analyzed through organizational theory. It concludes that behavior in accordance with the principles for CSR has resulted from both institutional and rational-economic mechanisms. Hydro has contributed to a new way of strategic thinking, as measures have been introduced that favor both employees and the firm. This thesis shows that a strategic CSR agenda might contribute to development, but that its implementation may be limited to what are win-win measures. The implication of this might be that the commitment to the stakeholders might be <b>secondary</b> to the <b>commitment</b> to the stockholders. In other words, it is uncertain to what extent a corporation can be depended upon to make voluntary efforts for the improvement of the society at large...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{perceptions}} and attitudes towards enterprise education at secondary level[1] in Ireland from a multi-stakeholder perspective. The key stakeholders involved in enterprise education are teachers, principals, pupils and parents. The examination encompassed profiling the Irish educational system and the evolution of enterprise education, appraising the role of the teacher in enterprise education and the identification and evaluation of the various programmes for enterprise at secondary level. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology adopted for this study was a subject-specific questionnaire personally administered to 95 respondents comprising teachers, principals, pupils and parents. Findings - The research findings suggest that tangible and intangible learning is obtained from such programmes, which create awareness of the possibilities for self-employment, encourage more enterprising behaviour and result in important personal skills and competency development. It also indicates very positive feedback for the need and continued development of such programmes as an important intervention in creating a more entrepreneurial mindset in students. Originality/value - The research findings add value to the empirical base of research at secondary schools by addressing a number of stakeholders. The findings highlight and provide the rationale for the need by policy makers to consider the mainstreaming of enterprise education at <b>secondary</b> level. Furthermore, <b>commitment</b> by the Irish government to the provision of increased resources, the development of programme material and teacher training are fundamental to the effectiveness of these programmes. To encourage greater participation by teachers and pupils, there is a need for formal recognition and accreditation of such programmes within the curriculum. Finally, greater awareness of the benefits of the programmes needs to be communicated to parents for them to encourage their children to participate in such programmes...|$|R

Advisors:Dr. Deanne Magnusson & Dr. Gerald Fry. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 118 pages, appendix A-B. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the impact on undergraduate college admissions decisions at selective U. S. colleges and universities of student enrolment in the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs of international schools. A total of 30 interviews were conducted by the researcher with admissions personnel from selective colleges and universities in the United States. Additionally, two tracer studies were conducted from two similar international schools; one offering the IB Diploma program and the other offering the AP program. The tracer studies focused on AP/IB enrolment and its impact on college admissions success. Results of the study indicate that there is a strong correlation between enrolment in these programs and admission to selective undergraduate institutions (high correlations of r = -. 77 and r = -. 75 were found in both tracer studies). However, this correlation is influenced by specific <b>secondary</b> school leader <b>commitments</b> to these programs. It is not essential for secondary school students to be enrolled in these programs in order to gain admission to the most selective colleges and universities in the United States since AP and IB enrolment explains roughly 58 % of the variance in admissions. Other important factors explain 42 % of the variance. These factors were not identified in this study. These results have significant implications for both secondary schools, institutions of higher education, the IBO and College Board. The data from the two tracer studies and the interviews with admissions personnel indicate that participation in these programs enhance admissions chances, but admission is possible without such participation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} constraint diagrams (CD) notation, {{which is a}} formal representation for program specification that has some promise {{to be used by}} people who are not expert in software design. Multiple methods were adopted in order to provide triangulated evidence of the potential benefits of constraint diagrams compared with other notational systems. Three main approaches were adopted for this research. The first approach was a semantic and task analysis of the CD notation. This was conducted by the application of the Cognitive Dimensions framework, which was used to examine the relative strengths and weaknesses of constraint diagrams and conventional notations in terms of the perceptive facilitation or impediments of these different representations. From this systematic analysis, we found that CD cognitively reduced the cost of exploratory design, modification, incrementation, searching, and transcription activities with regard to the cognitive dimensions: consistency, visibility, abstraction, closeness of mapping, <b>secondary</b> notation, premature <b>commitment,</b> role-expressiveness, progressive evaluation, diffuseness, provisionality, hidden dependency, viscosity, hard mental operations, and error-proneness. The second approach was an empirical evaluation of the comprehension of CD compared to natural language (NL) with computer science students. This experiment took the form of a web-based competition in which 33 participants were given instructions and training on either CD or the equivalent NL specification expressions, and then after each example, they responded to three multiple-choice questions requiring the interpretation of expressions in their particular notation. Although the CD group spent more time on the training and had less confidence, they obtained comparable interpretation scores to the NL group and took less time to answer the questions, although they had no prior experience of CD notation. The third approach was an experiment on the construction of CD. 20 participants were given instructions and training on either CD or the equivalent NL specification expressions, and then after each example, they responded to three questions requiring the construction of expressions in their particular notation. We built an editor to allow the construction of the two notations, which automatically logged their interactions. In general, for constructing program specification, the CD group had more accurate answers, they had spent less time in training, and their returns to the training examples were fewer than those of the NL group. Overall it was found that CD is understandable, usable, intuitive, and expressive with unambiguous semantic notation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to assess the}} degree of professionalism associated with the teaching of English in the secondary schools of St. John's, Newfoundland. The data were obtained by means of questionnaires and an interview schedule. The questionnaires were completed by principals, heads of English departments and individual English teachers from the thirteen secondary schools {{in the city of}} St. John's. The interview schedule was used in interviewing school superintendents. All the instruments were geared to the ten criteria for professionalism in English identified by the investigator. The study {{attempted to}} ascertain {{the extent to which the}} teaching of English in the secondary schools of St. John's met the conditions implicit in the ten criteria. These criteria are: professional autonomy for teachers of English, the requirement of special training and knowledge in English, professional monopoly which requires that, as far as possible, only qualified English teachers teach English in <b>secondary</b> schools, career <b>commitment,</b> the inservice education of English teachers, involvement in research and development, group consciousness and integration in the form of an association of English teachers, an equitable workload for the teacher of English, special classrooms for English instruction, and the secondary school English department. The main findings of the study indicated that there was a gap between what participants accepted as constituting criteria for professionalism in English on the one hand, and on the other the extent to which these criteria were being met in the study schools. Analysis of the findings suggested several facts among which were the following: (1) The restrictions implicit in the provincial Education Act placed English in the same category as other subjects thereby making it difficult for the English teacher to teach English as he considered appropriate to his particular situation. (2) By the standards of the criteria used in this study, there appeared to be a scarcity of qualified English teachers in the study schools. (3) Analysis of data indicated apparent lack of commitment, on the part of English teachers, to English instruction as a career. The major recommendations arising from the study include the following: (1) Teachers of English in each school should be allowed more responsibility over the English programme and should, as far as possible, be free to teach in the way they consider appropriate to their individual situations. (2) Teachers of English in St. John's should set up a system to foster contacts among themselves as a professional group. (3) Consideration should be given, by the school administrators in St. John's, to the conditions under which the English teacher works, for example, an equitable work load that takes special note of the demands which English instruction makes on the teacher, and classrooms designed and equipped specifically for the teaching of English...|$|R
