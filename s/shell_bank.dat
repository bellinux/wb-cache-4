50|$|The first United States lightships {{were small}} wooden vessels with no {{propelling}} power. The first United States iron-hulled lightship was stationed at Merrill's <b>Shell</b> <b>Bank,</b> Louisiana, in 1847. Wood {{was still the}} preferred building material at the time because of lower cost and ability to withstand shock loading. Wooden lightships often survived more than 50 years in northern waters where the danger of rotting was reduced. Lightvessel 16 guarded Sandy Hook and Ambrose stations for more than 80 years; she had both an inner hull and an outer hull with the space between filled with salt to harden the wood and reduce decay. Several lightships built with composite wood and steel hulls in 1897 proved less durable than either wood or steel. The first modern steel lightship in United States service was lightvessel 44 built in 1882. One of the last United States wooden hulled lightships built, lightvessel 74, went into service at Portland, Maine, in 1902. The first United States lightships with steam engine propulsion were built in 1891 for service on the Great Lakes where seasonal ice required prompt evacuation of light stations to avoid destruction of the lightships.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the find of an early Mesolithic skeleton from Österöd, Bro parish, in central Bohuslän. The skeleton was originally found in 1903 by diggers in a <b>shell</b> <b>bank,</b> but was only recovered in 1933 by Johan Alin. In 2007, 14 C analysis of a tooth produced the date 9025 ± 65 BP uncalibrated, making the skeleton {{one of the oldest}} known from Scandinavia. Osteological determinations show that the bones are from a woman of old age, at least 60 and probably 84 – 88 years old. Her stature can be estimated to about 170 cm. Although the bones are fragmented, all body parts are represented, and the body was most likely intact when interred. We interpret the find as a grave, possibly in a sitting position. Interestingly, the δ 13 C value of - 18. 0 ‰ indicates only a moderate intake of marine protein, in spite of the location of the site in a highly marine environment...|$|E
