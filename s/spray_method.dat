50|$|Brushing {{preservatives}} is a long-practised {{method and}} {{often used in}} today's carpentry workshops. Technological developments mean {{it is also possible}} to spray preservative over the surface of the timber. Some of the liquid is drawn into the wood as the result of capillary action before the spray runs off or evaporates, but unless puddling occurs penetration is limited and may not be suitable for long-term weathering. By using the <b>spray</b> <b>method,</b> coal-tar creosote, oil-borne solutions and water-borne salts (to some extent) can also be applied. A thorough brush or spray treatment with coal-tar creosote can add 1 to 3 years to the lifespan of poles or posts. Two or more coats provide better protection than one, but the successive coats should not be applied until the prior coat has dried or soaked into the wood. The wood should be seasoned before treatment.|$|E
50|$|Upon departing {{the spray}} gun, the {{graphene}} flake’s tendency to aggregate is reduced {{due to its}} quick evaporation and dispersion. Much to the researchers’ surprise, this <b>spray</b> <b>method</b> produces flakes that contain substantially less defects that would commonly occur. Common graphene defects including holes and lumps in the layer, and the Stone-Wales defect were absent upon surface impact. The large amount of kinetic energy delivered by the supersonic nozzle creates the healing of these defects, as the graphene flakes stretches upon impact. The carbon atoms within the graphene rearrange to create seamlessly perfect hexagonal lattice structures. The result of these perfect hexagon structures {{is the creation of}} a smooth, even layer of graphene. This is a large contrast to the applications of graphene onto large-scale substrates prior {{to the creation of the}} graphene spray gun. The graphene layers would commonly contain defecting clumps and spaces, which troubled scientists ever since the discovery of graphene. The graphene spray gun is also regarded as inexpensive when compared to the other methods of large-scale graphene applications. One main factor for its inexpensiveness is that the graphene layers require no post-processing treatment, which was common in the other methods. The other factor is that the spray gun is remarkably simple in both its production and utilization.|$|E

Pristine FWCNT/ TEOS-based field emitters revealed higher current density, lower turn-on field, and a higher field enhancement factor than the oxidized FWCNTs-based field emitters.

We measure the optical absorption and electrical conductivity in order to optimize the conditions for obtaining optimum performance films with both high electrical conductivity and transparency. We observe a square resistance of 1 to 8.5 [*]kΩ for samples showing 65 % to 85 % optical transmittance, respectively. For some applications, we need flexibility and not transparency: for this purpose, we deposit a thick film of single-walled {{carbon nanotube}}s on a flexible silicone substrate by <b>spray</b> <b>method</b> from an aqueous suspension of carbon nanotubes in a surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate), thereby obtaining a flexible conducting electrode showing an electrical resistance as low as 200 [*]Ω/sq.
