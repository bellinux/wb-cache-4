25|$|Although {{the source}} does not name the Anglo-Saxons {{as the enemy}} {{in any of the}} three battles, it has been claimed that the failure to specify the enemy was simply because this was <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> to all, and that any other opponents would have been clearly named.|$|E

25|$|Decryption {{is exactly}} the same as encryption, except that P1, P2, …, P18 are used in the reverse order. This is not <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> because xor is {{commutative}} and associative. A common misconception is to use inverse order of encryption as decryption algorithm (i.e. first XORing P17 and P18 to the ciphertext block, then using the P-entries in reverse order).|$|E
25|$|David S. Percy – TV {{producer}} {{and member of}} the Royal Photographic Society. He is co-author, along with Mary Bennett, of Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers and co-producer of What Happened On the Moon? He is the main proponent of the 'whistle-blower' accusation, arguing that mistakes in the NASA photos are <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> that they are evidence that insiders are trying to 'blow the whistle' on the hoax by knowingly adding mistakes that they know will be seen. Most of his allegations of photographic anomalies have been refuted by Doug Millard of the Science Museum in London.|$|E
25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found <b>so</b> <b>obvious,</b> and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick {{originally}} planned a voice-over {{to reveal that}} the satellites seen after the prologue are nuclear weapons, and that the Star Child would detonate the weapons {{at the end of}} the film. However, he decided this would create associations with his previous film Dr. Strangelove, and decided not to make it <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> that they were [...] "war machines". A few weeks before the release of the film, the U.S. and Soviet governments had agreed not to put any nuclear weapons into outer space.|$|E
500|$|In 446 BC, a more {{dangerous}} uprising erupted. Euboea and Megara revolted. Pericles crossed over to Euboea with his troops, but {{was forced to}} return when the Spartan army invaded Attica. Through bribery and negotiations, Pericles defused the imminent threat, and the Spartans returned home. When Pericles was later audited for the handling of public money, an expenditure of 10 talents was not sufficiently justified, since the official documents just referred that the money was spent for a [...] "very serious purpose". Nonetheless, the [...] "serious purpose" [...] (namely the bribery) was <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> to the auditors that they approved the expenditure without official meddling and without even investigating the mystery.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, when Jean {{announced}} {{the title of}} the episode at the Television Critics Association summer tour, several news outlets suspected that Krusty the Clown would be killed off. Jean later told of his surprise at this theory, saying [...] "I was like, 'What? [...] "In the dumps" [...] doesn't mean you're dead. It means you're sad.' I thought it was <b>so</b> <b>obvious.</b> I would be nuts to kill Krusty. Everybody loves that character". [...] He said of the episode, [...] "It turned out bigger than we {{thought it was going to}} be. It's not going to be this blood bath where they all get murdered." ...|$|E

500|$|Bridge {{topology}} is {{an important}} topology with many uses in both linear and non-linear applications, including, amongst many others, the bridge rectifier, the Wheatstone bridge and the lattice phase equaliser. [...] There are several ways that bridge topology is rendered in circuit diagrams. [...] The first rendering in figure 1.8 is the traditional depiction of a bridge circuit. [...] The second rendering clearly shows the equivalence between the bridge topology and a topology derived by series and parallel combinations. [...] The third rendering is more commonly known as lattice topology. [...] It is not <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> that this is topologically equivalent. [...] It {{can be seen that}} this is indeed so by visualising the top left node moved {{to the right of the}} top right node.|$|E
500|$|Jarrold's {{adaptation}} {{also came}} {{in the wake of}} a number of literary biographical films, such as Shakespeare in Love and Miss Potter. Deborah Cartmell, author of Screen Adaptations: Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: A Close Study of the Relationship between Text and Film, found similarities between Becoming Jane and Shakespeare in Love [...] "almost <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> that the [...] film risks the accusation of being dangerously derivative." [...] A given example included the characters of Austen and William Shakespeare inputting their personal experiences directly into their works. Marina Cano López and Rosa María García-Periago explained that the film [...] "follows the path opened by John Madden’s Shakespeare in Love. The numerous intertextual connections between both movies can be reduced to one: [...] just as Shakespeare is imagined as the hero of his own play, Jane Austen becomes the heroine of her own novel." [...] Among other listed similarities, they noted that the romantic interests of both protagonists serve as their literary muses, and that the middle part of both films [...] "lie" [...] when viewed from a historical perspective.|$|E
500|$|Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was {{negative}} in her review and dismissed the episode for feeling [...] "like a plateful of warmed-up leftovers." [...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, or maybe it only seems that way because it's long been <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are too important to be killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time". The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005, calling it [...] "note-perfect." ...|$|E

500|$|Intelligent {{steering}} from C. G. F. Bryan, the Oxford cox, saw the Dark Blues [...] "hugging the Surrey bank" [...] {{to reduce}} the Cambridge lead to about a length by Chiswick Eyot. [...] It was short-lived however, as Bryan steered back over towards the Middlesex side of the river, losing his crew a length in doing so and moving into rougher water, and by Chiswick Steps, the Light Blues were {{four and a half}} lengths ahead. [...] Cambridge's stroke Ran Laurie called for a spurt {{and by the time they}} passed under Barnes Bridge they were five lengths ahead. [...] They crossed to the Middlesex side of the river before passing the finishing post with a lead of four and a half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 48 seconds. [...] It was a record twelfth victory for the Light Blues and took the overall record in the event to 46–40 in their favour. [...] Former Oxford rower E. P. Evans, writing in The Manchester Guardian, stated that Cambridge [...] "won in the easiest manner possible, having led from start to finish" [...] and described the race as a [...] "fiasco". [...] The rowing correspondent for The Times suggested that [...] "never was it <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> after the first few strokes that there was only one crew in the race ... Oxford's form was too bad to be true." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Leonard Strong, William T. Noon, Robert Boyle {{and others}} have argued that Joyce, later in life, {{reconciled}} with the faith he rejected earlier in life and that his parting with the faith was succeeded by a not <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> reunion, and that Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are essentially Catholic expressions. Likewise, Hugh Kenner and T. S. Eliot believed they saw between the lines of Joyce's work the outlook of a serious Christian and that beneath the veneer of the work lies a remnant of Catholic belief and attitude. Kevin Sullivan maintains that, rather than reconciling with the faith, Joyce never left it. Critics holding this view insist that Stephen, the protagonist of the semi-autobiographical A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as well as Ulysses, is not Joyce. Somewhat cryptically, in an interview after completing Ulysses, {{in response to the}} question [...] "When did you leave the Catholic Church", Joyce answered, [...] "That's for the Church to say." [...] Eamonn Hughes maintains that Joyce takes a dialectic approach, both affirming and denying, saying that Stephen's much noted non-serviam is qualified—"I will not serve that which I no longer believe...", and that the non-serviam will always be balanced by Stephen's [...] "I am a servant..." [...] and Molly's [...] "yes". He attended Catholic Mass and Orthodox Sacred Liturgy, especially during Holy Week, purportedly for aesthetic reasons. His sisters noted his Holy Week attendance and that he did not seek to dissuade them. One friend witnessed him cry [...] "secret tears" [...] upon hearing Jesus' words on the cross and another accused him of being a [...] "believer at heart" [...] because of his frequent attendance at church.|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E
