40|$|Somatostatin (SS) exerts a {{negative}} inotropic effect in isolated atria. Here {{we report that}} in guinea-pig isolated right atria, <b>seglitide,</b> a potent cyclic hexapeptide somatostatin agonist, behaves as a competitive somatostatin receptor antagonist with pA 2 values against SS 14, SS 25 and SS 28, of 6. 50 +/- 0. 40, 6. 24 +/- 0. 08 and 6. 09 +/- 0. 06, respectively. <b>Seglitide</b> {{had little or no}} effect on the negative inotropic action of carbachol or N 6 -cyclohexyladenosine. Our findings indicate that the receptor-response coupling characteristics of guinea-pig atria are such that in this preparation <b>seglitide</b> has low intrinsic activity and behaves specifically as a somatostatin receptor antagonist...|$|E
40|$|Somatostatin {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{peptides}} in interneurons of the hippocampus. It is believed to play a role in memory formation and to reduce the susceptibility of the hippocampus to seizurelike activity. However, at the cellular level, the actions of somatostatin on hippocampal neurons are still controversial, ranging from inhibition to excitation. In the present study, we measured autaptic currents of hippocampal neurons isolated in singleneuron microcultures. Somatostatin and the analogous peptides <b>seglitide</b> and octreotide reduced glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, autaptic currents via pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. This effect was observed whether autaptic currents were mediated by NMDA or non-NMDA glutamate receptors. Furthermore, somatostatin did not affect currents evoked by the direct application of glutamate, but reduced the frequency of spontaneously occurring excitatory autaptic currents. Thes...|$|E
40|$|Somatostatin (SST), an {{important}} neuropeptide of the gastrointestinal tract {{has been shown}} to stimulate sodium chloride absorption and inhibit chloride secretion in the intestine. However, the effects of SST on luminal butyrate absorption in the human intestine have not been investigated. Earlier studies from our group and others have shown that monocarboxylate transporter (MCT 1) plays {{an important}} role in the transport of butyrate in the human intestine. The present studies were undertaken to examine the effects of SST on butyrate uptake utilizing postconfluent human intestinal epithelial Caco 2 cells. Apical SST treatment of Caco- 2 cells for 30 – 60 min significantly increased butyrate uptake in a dose-dependent manner with maximal increase at 50 nM (∼ 60 %, P < 0. 05). SST receptor 2 agonist, <b>seglitide,</b> mimicked the effects of SST on butyrate uptake. SST-mediated stimulation of butyrate uptake involved the p 38 MAP kinase-dependent pathway. Kinetic studies demonstrated that SST increased the maximal velocity (Vmax) of the transporter by approximately twofold without any change in apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km). The higher butyrate uptake in response to SST was associated with an increase in the apical membrane levels of MCT 1 protein parallel to a decrease in the intracellular MCT 1 pool. MCT 1 {{has been shown to}} interact specifically with CD 147 glycoprotein/chaperone to facilitate proper expression and function of MCT 1 at the cell surface. SST significantly enhanced the membrane levels of CD 147 as well as its association with MCT 1. This association was completely abolished by the specific p 38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB 203580. Our findings demonstrate that increased MCT 1 association with CD 147 at the apical membrane in response to SST is p 38 MAP kinase dependent and underlies the stimulatory effects of SST on butyrate uptake...|$|E
