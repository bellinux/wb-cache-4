40|$|Decomposable {{negation}} {{normal form}} (DNNF) was developed primarily for knowledge compilation. Formulas in DNNF are linkless, in {{negation normal form}} (NNF), and have the property that atoms are not shared across conjunctions. Full dissolvents are linkless NNF formulas that do not in general have the latter property. However, many of the applications of DNNF can be obtained with full dissolvents. Two additional methods — regular tableaux and <b>semantic</b> <b>factoring</b> — are shown to produce equivalent DNNF. A class of formulas is presented on which earlier DNNF conversion techniques are necessarily exponential; path dissolution and <b>semantic</b> <b>factoring</b> handle these formulas in linear time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A crucial issue during {{semantic}} {{integration of}} different geographic metadata sources is category comparison and reconciliation. We {{focus on the}} development of a framework for identification and resolution of semantic het-erogeneity between geographic categories. The framework is divided in three processes: extraction, comparison and reconciliation. The first process performs semantic information extraction and formalization based on definitions of geo-graphic category terms. Definitions constitute important sources of semantic in-formation for geographic categories. Based on specific rules, definitions are analyzed in a set of semantic elements (properties and values). This information is further used in the second process to identify similarities and heterogeneities between geographic categories. Heterogeneity reconciliation is implemented by <b>semantic</b> <b>factoring,</b> a conceptual analysis process which results in a set of non-redundant, non-overlapping categories. ...|$|E
40|$|Process {{languages}} {{remain a}} vital area of software process research. Among the important issue for process languages are semantic richness, ease of use, appropriate abstractions, process composability, visualization, {{and support for}} multiple paradigms. The need to balance semantic richness with ease of use is particularly critical. JIL addresses these issues {{in a number of}} innovative ways. It models processes in terms of steps with a rich variety of semantic attributes. The JIL control model combines proactive and reactive control, conditional control, and more simple means of controlflow modeling via step composition and execution constraints. JIL facilitates ease of use through <b>semantic</b> <b>factoring,</b> the accommodation of incomplete step specifications, the fostering of simple sub-languages, and the ability to support visualizations. This approach allows processes to be programmed in a variety of terms, and to a variety of levels of detail, according to the needs of particular processes [...] ...|$|E

The formalization of the semantic graph has been intuitively built to solve a real problem which is browsing and searching for lectures in a vast repository of colleges/courses located at Western Kentucky University 1. This study combines Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) with <b>Semantic</b> <b>Factoring</b> to decompose complex, vast concepts into their primitives in order to develop knowledge representation for the HyperManyMedia 2 platform. Also, we argue that {{the most important factor in}} building the semantic representation is defining the hierarchical structure and the relationships among concepts and subconcepts.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} from adult pronoun comprehension suggests that <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> such as verb transitivity affect referent salience and thereby anap- hora resolution. We tested whether the same <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> influence pronoun comprehension in young children. In a visual world study, 3 -year- olds heard stories {{that began with}} a sentence containing either a high or a low transitivity verb. Looking behaviour to pictures depicting the subject and object of this sentence was recorded as children listened to a subsequent sentence containing a pronoun. Children showed a stronger preference {{to look to the}} subject as opposed to the object antecedent in the low transitivity condition. In addition there were general preferences (1) to look to the subject in both conditions and (2) to look more at both potential antecedents in the high transitivity condition.

40|$|Two {{decades after}} its inception, Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) {{has become part}} and parcel of every modern {{introduction}} to Information Retrieval. For any tool that matures so quickly, it is important to check its lore and limitations, or else stagnation will set in. We focus here on the three main aspects of LSA that are well accepted, and the gist of which can be summarized as follows: (1) that LSA recovers latent <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> underlying the document space, (2) that such can be accomplished through lossy compression of the document space by eliminating lexical noise, and (3) that the latter can best be achieved by Singular Value Decomposition. For each aspect we performed experiments analogous to those reported in the LSA literature and compared the evidence brought to bear in each case. On the negative side, we show that the above claims about LSA are much more limited than commonly believed. Even a simple example may show that LSA does not recover the optimal <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> as intended in the pedagogical example used in many LSA publications. Additionally, and remarkably deviating from LSA lore, LSA does not scale up well: the larger the document space, the more unlikely that LSA recovers an optimal set of <b>semantic</b> <b>factors.</b> On the positive side, we describe new algorithms to replace LSA (and more recent alternatives as pLSA, LDA, and kernel methods) by trading its l 2 space for an l 1 space, thereby guaranteeing an optimal set of <b>semantic</b> <b>factors.</b> These algorithms seem to salvage the spirit of LSA as we think it was initially conceived...|$|R

Much emphasis will be put especially on the relation between the occurrence of for-to complementation and the <b>semantic</b> <b>factor</b> proposed by Kiparsky and Kiparsky, that is, the presupposition of factivity and non-factivity. The conclusion will be to the effect that the parallelism between the occurrence of 'for-to' and the non-factivity is not necessarily appropriate and that in some cases the presupposition seems to come from the complement construction, not from the verb. Such <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> as factivity, emotivity, and so on may complicate the semantic subclassification but have no syntactic relation with the occurrence of 'for-to' form.

40|$|Introduction 1 Preparing {{an index}} or {{concordance}} for an analytic {{language in which}} each word has only one <b>semantic</b> <b>factor</b> is a simple task easily automated in a computer system. However, most natural languages are rather synthetic, i. e., they have other words which contain more than one <b>semantic</b> <b>factor.</b> The English word `DOGS' for example has two factors. We may refer to these words as complex. Usually {{one of the factors}} is lexical while the rest are grammatical. A linguist may use lists of `complex words' according to their grammatical factor. For example, according to the plural indication. He or she may even be interested in derivative words that have a common constituent, such as ject in subject, project or inject, where each word has an independent lexical entry. However, in most cases {{we would like to have}} lists of words, including `complex words', which are gathered in groups according to t...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} {{highlight}} the interaction of factors that affect the word order in Slovene and Italian. The basic word order is the same in both languages; subject-verb-object (SVO). However, Slovene and Italian differ in one being an analytical {{and the other a}} synthetic language, and being Romance and Slavic, respectively. The word order in the language pair differs in the degree of freedom one has to form different sentence variations. I will try to verify the hypothesis that pragmatic and <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> have a greater impact on the Slovenian word order than the grammatical ones, while grammatical factors have more influence on the word order in Italian. The analysis examines the word order in sentences with three elements, S, V and O as well as the word order in sentences with two elements, i. e. S and V or O and V. The VS/SV or VO/OV patterns are, again, the result of an in- terplay between pragmatic and <b>semantic</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{semantic}} underpinnings {{of the distinction}} between two syntactic types of "manner of movement" verbs in Levin (1993), namely the RUN and ROLL classes. According to Levin's (1993) and Levin & Rappaport's (1995) work on unaccusativity, a <b>semantic</b> <b>factor</b> of "internal causation" should be the trigger for the classification of a movement verb as intransitive (=not-unaccusative), and hence for its belonging to the RUN class. We point out empirical problems for this characterisation, mainly coming from the different readings of the German verb fliegen (fly). From a comparison with other semantically similar verbs, we conclude that the semantic description which underlies the class distinction should be refined: instead of "internal causation", the crucial <b>semantic</b> <b>factor</b> is described here as "inherent specification for a momentum of movement". This result indicates that forces, and relations between forces, have {{to be part of the}} semantic description of the manner component in movement verbs...|$|R

40|$|It is {{traditionally}} assumed that {{temporal and spatial}} factors determine whether information provided by different sensory modalities is combined in a single percept. However, neuropsychological reports of selective damage to audio-visual integration and recent neurophysiological results suggest that <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> related {{to the content of}} the stimuli could also play a role. As a means of extending evidence provided by neuropsychological dissociations we set up a direct comparison of two kinds of audio-visual pairs with different semantic properties and used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We investigated the selective impact of TMS on two kinds of audio-visual pairings presented under identical spatio-temporal conditions (face-voice and tone-shape pairings). Our results show that TMS applied over the left posterior parietal cortex at 200 ms disrupted audio-visual integration for the tone-shape pairings but not for the face-voice ones. Our data are consistent with neuropsychological findings and indicate that besides the well-known dimensions of spatial and temporal contiguity, content is an important determinant of audio-visual integration.

40|$|The main {{difficulty}} in face image modeling is to decompose those <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> {{contributing to the}} formation of the face images, such as identity, illumination and pose. One promising way is to organize the face images in a higher-order tensor with each mode corresponding to one contributory factor. Then, a technique called Multilinear Subspace Analysis (MSA) is applied to decompose the tensor into the mode-n product of several mode matrices, each of which represents one <b>semantic</b> <b>factor.</b> In practice, however, it is usually difficult to obtain such a complete training tensor since it requires a large amount of face images with all possible combina-tions of the states of the contributory factors. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a method named M 2 SA, which can work on the training tensor with massive missing values. Thus M 2 SA can be used to model face images even when there are {{only a small number of}} face images with limited variations (which will cause missing values in the training tensor). Experiments on face recog-nition show that M 2 SA can work reasonably well with up to 70 % missing values in the training tensor...|$|R
