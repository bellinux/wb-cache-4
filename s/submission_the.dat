5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into <b>submission.</b> <b>The</b> impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between Batista and JBL (managed by Orlando Jordan) for the World Heavyweight Championship. Jordan {{interfered}} {{by attempting to}} hit Batista with a folding chair, but Batista grabbed the chair from him. Batista then used the chair to hit Jordan and JBL, and JBL was declared the winner, via disqualification. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or <b>submission</b> (<b>the</b> normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title. After the match Batista gave JBL and Jordan a Batista Bomb.|$|E

5|$|The sixth contest was a Tag Team Street Fight pitting {{the team}} of Monty Brown and The Outlaw against the 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings). A Street Fight is fought under no {{disqualification}} rules, which is won either by a pinfall or <b>submission.</b> <b>The</b> Outlaw requested to be called by a new name before the contest, Kip James. The Outlaw was busted open during the bout. Multiple referees had to be replaced for the match, due to reoccurring attacks on them by The Outlaw. Brown won the encounter after performing his signature Pounce maneuver on Killings, knocking him across the ring onto the mat, at 5 minutes and 20 seconds. After the contest, B.G. James entered the ring where The Outlaw offered James a chair to hit Konnan with, which James declined.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of <b>submission.</b> <b>The</b> manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E
5|$|As part of Lockheed's <b>submission,</b> <b>the</b> firm {{offered a}} formal {{guarantee}} of a 20 per cent workshare on all future export sales of its Orion 2000 while simultaneously lobbying for the United States Navy to also procure the type. Loral {{stated that it}} believed that its bid to refurbish stored P-3s was the most cost-effective submission; however, there was public controversy over whether Loral possessed the necessary technical information on the airframe, claims to which Loral strongly refuted. In May 1996, {{it was reported that}} bidders were considering self-funding their own early development costs in order to compensate for alleged funding shortfalls within the MoD's procurement budget; it was claimed that these funding shortfalls were due to differences between the original specification, which had envisioned as an off-the-shelf procurement without much in terms of development, and the increasingly extensive nature that the programme had progressively taken on.|$|E

5|$|On September 26, {{transports}} with artillery, siege tools, {{and some}} French infantry and shock troops from Head of Elk, {{the northern end}} of the Chesapeake Bay, arrived, giving Washington command of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continentals. Early on September 28, Washington led the army out of Williamsburg to surround Yorktown. The French took the positions on the left while the Americans took the position of honor on the right. Cornwallis had a chain of seven redoubts and batteries linked by earthworks along with batteries that covered the narrows of the York River at Gloucester Point. That day, Washington reconnoitered the British defenses and decided that they could be bombarded into <b>submission.</b> <b>The</b> Americans and the French spent the night of the 28th sleeping out in the open, while work parties built bridges over the marsh. Some of the American soldiers hunted down wild hogs to eat.|$|E
5|$|On the June 30 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, a match between six wrestlers {{for a new}} top-tier SmackDown! {{championship}} was held. JBL, one of the participants, was victorious in the match, but Theodore Long {{announced that he was}} still not the champion. Instead he had won the right to a match against the World Heavyweight champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. The following week, it was announced Batista would meet JBL at The Great American Bash with the World Heavyweight championship on the line. At the Great American Bash, Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair and JBL was declared the winner. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or <b>submission</b> (<b>the</b> normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{professional}} wrestling matches {{were scheduled}} on the event's card, which featured a supercard, a scheduling {{of more than}} one main event. The three brands, Raw, SmackDown, and ECW, were all represented by their respective Championship Scramble match â€“ a 20minute time limit bout, during which participants can become the temporary champion via pinfall or <b>submission.</b> <b>The</b> main event of the pay-per-view was the Championship Scramble from the Raw brand. It was originally scheduled to feature World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk defending his title; he was replaced by Chris Jericho after Randy Orton attacked CM Punk. Jericho won the match and became World Heavyweight Champion. The Championship Scramble from the ECW brand featured ECW Champion Mark Henry defending, losing the match and title to Matt Hardy. The SmackDown brand's Championship Scramble saw WWE Champion Triple H defeat the other competitors to retain his championship. Another featured match on the undercard was an unsanctioned match, or hardcore match, in which Shawn Michaels defeated Chris Jericho.|$|E

5|$|The event {{commenced}} with a ten-man X Division elimination rankings match, {{which involved}} Eric Young, Consequences Creed, Doug Williams, Homicide, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Petey Williams, Sonjay Dutt, Tanahashi, and Volador. The match was announced as following lucha libre tag team rules, {{in which a}} participant could be replaced if thrown from the ring to the floor, but not eliminated from the match unless by pinfall or <b>submission.</b> <b>The</b> order of elimination determined the standings in the X Division towards a future TNA X Division Championship match, in storyline. Homicide was injured during the match, thus was declared eliminated after a bad fall to the outside area. Lethal and Young were the final two men in the contest. Young was the victor in the match after slamming Lethal into the mat with a bridging back suplex at 17 minutes.|$|E
5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that LÃ©one {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into <b>submission.</b> <b>The</b> village doctor visits LÃ©one at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save LÃ©one. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to LÃ©one, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that GisÃ¨le is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues GisÃ¨le but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and LÃ©one suddenly recovers. GisÃ¨le and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|E
5|$|Having raised Â£100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the Waterways Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost Â£60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another Â£30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for <b>submission,</b> <b>the</b> HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of Â£11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional Â£2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to Â£11.9 million, and a further Â£6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E

The parliamentary procedure for this Act resulted in a conference between the King and Parliament in which the Speaker addressed the King. In 1536 Parliament was asked again to re-enact <b>the</b> <b>Submission</b> of <b>the</b> Clergy, although the reasoning behind this decision is not known since the 1534 Act did not include an expiration date.|$|R
