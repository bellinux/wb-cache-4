25|$|Confronted {{with the}} {{challenge}} of showing 3-dimensional gameplay on 2-dimensional advertisements, the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort. A $5 million campaign promoted NBC's fall lineup alongside the Virtual Boy. American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 at a local Blockbuster. This made it affordable for a large number of gamers to try the system, and produced 750,000 rentals. Upon returning the unit, renters received a coupon for $10 off the purchase of a Virtual Boy from any store. 3,000 Blockbuster locations were included in the promotion, which consisted of a sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows. The popular rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy's long-term success, allowing gamers to <b>see</b> <b>just</b> how un-immersive the console was. By mid-1996, Blockbuster was selling its Virtual Boy units at $50 each. Taken as a whole, the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure.|$|E

500|$|Olivero's quest in the {{underground}} world is written as a reversal of Plato's allegory of the cave as described in his Republic. In Plato's allegory, prisoners confined in a cave and condemned to stare at a blank wall, with only the light from a flickering fire behind them, <b>see</b> <b>just</b> the shadows of what is real; the philosopher, on the other hand, is like someone released from the cave, {{able to see the}} true form of what is casting the shadows.

Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that [...] "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama."

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics.

[...] He noted that [...] "the worst thing about 'Agua Mala' is that it comes so very, very close to working that it’s frustrating to <b>see</b> <b>just</b> how little it actually does" [...] due to its bizarre structure and convoluted antagonist. VanDerWerff criticized Darren McGavin's appearance in the episode, calling it a [...] "glorified cameo", and noted that his character function as the [...] "kind of old man who stands on his porch and yells about the good old days to the neighborhood kids." [...] He did however, call the shot of the [...] "writhing tentacle in the overhead lamp" [...] the [...] "one good thing" [...] in the episode. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that the episode's [...] "laughs aren't clever, and the scares are silly".|$|E

500|$|Ultrasonography {{is based}} on the {{principle}} that sound can pass through human body tissues and is reflected by the tissue interfaces {{in the same way that}} light can reflect back on itself, from a mirror. Tissue in the body will offer varying degrees of resistance, known as acoustic impedance, to the path of the ultrasound beam. When there is a high impedance difference between two tissues, the interface between them will strongly reflect the sound. When the ultrasound beam meets air, or solid tissue such as bone, their [...] impedance difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures. The examiner will <b>see</b> <b>just</b> a shadow, instead of the image expected. Air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used. The gel prevents air bubbles from forming between the probe, and the patient's skin and so helps the conduction of the sound waves from the transducer into the body. The watery medium also helps to conduct the sound waves. Liquids, including blood have a low impedance, which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible. One of the important exceptions is that when the blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen, in what is termed [...] "spontaneous contrast".|$|E

While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in Pal Joey—recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning.

2500|$|During the war years, Chamberlain {{was one of}} the [...] "annexationists" [...] {{who wanted}} the war to end with Germany annexing most of Europe, Africa and Asia to give the Reich the [...] "world power status" [...] he {{believed}} it deserved. As such, Chamberlain worked closely with the Pan-German League, the Conservatives and the völkishe groups to mobilise public support for the maximum war aims he sought. Chamberlain was {{a founding member of the}} Independent Commission for a German Peace, and in July 1915 he signed the Address of the Intellectuals, a petition signed by 1,347 teachers, writers, professors, and theologians asking the government to win the war in order to annex as much territory as possible. Much of this propaganda including Chamberlain's essays in support of the maximum war aims had a very strong anti-Semitic character as Chamberlain claimed that it was the entire German Jewish community who were supposedly seeking a compromise peace to end the war, and were preventing the full mobilization of Germany's power that would allow the Reich to win the war. In a letter to his friend Prince Maximilian of Baden, Chamberlain wrote: I learned today from a man who is especially well-placed to observe these things-even when they go on secretly-that the Jews are completely intoxicated by their success in Germany-first from the millions they have gained through the war, then because of the praise showered on them in all official quarters, and thirdly from the protection they and their machinations enjoy from the censor. Thus, already they are beginning to lose their heads and reach a degree of insolence which may allow us to hope for a flood-tide of reaction. May God grant it!. In October–November 1916, the so-called Judenzählung ("Jew count") was held by the German Army to examine the popular anti-Semitic claim that German Jews were [...] "shirking" [...] their duty to the Fatherland by avoiding war service. The [...] "Jew count" [...] revealed that in fact German Jews were disproportionately over-represented in the front-line units as most German Jews were anxious to prove their German patriotism and love of the Fatherland by volunteering for front-line duty. Many young German Jewish men wished to rebut the anti-Semitic canard that they were not real Germans by fighting for the Fatherland, and thus showing that they loved Germany as much as their Gentile neighbors, hence the disproportionate number of German Jews on the front-line compared to their share of the German population. As the results of the [...] "Jew count" [...] did not please the two men in charge of High Command, namely Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff, the latter a [...] "fanatical anti-Semite" [...] who had been expecting the [...] "Jew Count" [...] to reveal that German Jews were disproportionally underrepresented on the front-line, the High Command issued a facetious statement saying that for the safety of the German Jewish community the [...] "Jew count" [...] could not be made public as it would endanger the lives of German Jews. The implication that if people could <b>see</b> <b>just</b> how far German Jews were allegedly [...] "shirking" [...] their duty to the Fatherland, then pogroms would break out in Germany led to a major upsurge in anti-Semitism, which Chamberlain was quick to exploit.|$|E
