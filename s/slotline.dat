50|$|Finline {{consists}} of a sheet of metallised dielectric inserted into the E-plane of a rectangular metal waveguide. However, the design {{is not intended to}} generate waveguide modes in the rectangular waveguide as such.

Finline is thus a type of dielectric waveguide and {{can be viewed as a}} shielded <b>slotline.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transitions to {{and from}} finline can be treated {{in a similar way}} to <b>slotline.</b> However, it is more natural for finline {{transitions}} to go to waveguide; the waveguide is already there.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} amount of data to be transferred, {{we have to use}} higher and higher {{frequency}} bands, requiring more complex circuits, in particular the high frequency parts of receivers and transmitters. Modern circuits for the centimeter- and milimeter-wave bands are produced by means of monolithic technology. In connection with the development of microwave integrated technology, special attention is paid to planar circuits produced on dielectric substrates. The main reason why they are in so much use at present lies in their low production costs. A successful design of such microwave circuits depends on precise knowledge of the type and behaviour of the waves propagating on the planar transmission lines in wide frequency bands.

5000|$|Stripline was {{initially}} preferred to its rival {{because of the}} dispersion issue. However, in the 1960s, the need to incorporate miniature solid-state components in MICs swung the balance to microstrip. Miniaturisation also leads to favouring microstrip because its disadvantages are not so severe in a miniaturised circuit. However, stripline is still chosen where operation over a wide band is required. [...] The first planar slab dielectric line, imageline, is due to King in 1952. <b>Slotline,</b> the first printed planar dielectric line format, is due to Cohn in 1968.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} forms of planar transmission line. The main ones are stripline, microstrip, suspended stripline, and coplanar waveguide*. Stripline was the earliest form, conceived during World War II by Robert M. Barrett. All four of these forms consist {{of a pair of}} conductors (although in three of them, the return conductor is through the ground plane). Consequently, they have a dominant mode of transmission (the field pattern of the electromagnetic wave) that is identical, or near-identical, to the mode found in a pair of wires. Other planar formats, such as <b>slotline,</b> finline, and imageline transmit along a strip of dielectric and substrate integrated waveguide forms a dielectric waveguide within the substrate with rows of posts. These formats cannot support the same mode as a pair of wires, and consequently they have different transmission properties. Many forms have a narrower bandwidth and in general they produce more signal distortion. However, advantages include (depending on exact formats being compared) low loss and a better range of characteristic impedance.|$|E
40|$|In general, equal gain in all {{direction}} is needed {{as the system}} moves in wireless applications such as body area network. Reconfigurable radiation pattern antennas have contributed a lot in solving this problem due to the potential features offered by these types of antennas. In addition wideband operation to narrow band operation reconfigurable antenna is also needed to provide high antenna efficiency in communication systems. The aim of this project is to design an antenna which quantifies the potential gain of the pattern and frequency control in order to suit the requirement of wireless applications such as body are networks. Therefore a new concept of a pattern and frequency reconfigurable antenna is proposed. The proposed antenna uses two types of feedings (CPW and <b>slotlines)</b> for controlling the radiation pattern and the same time, ring resonators were integrated in order to switch from a wideband operation to a narrow band operation while maintaining the same polarization. The antenna ranges from 3 to 6 GHz for wideband operation and operates at 3. 5 GHz for a narrowband operation with good radiation pattern reconfigurability. The proposed antenna was designed and simulated in CST microwave studio and printed on a Taconic board and the analysis yielded a well behaved radiation pattern and a good agreement of return loss between measured and simulated results. Hence the proposed antenna is suitable for use in pattern and frequency reconfigurable for wireless applications such as body area networ...|$|R

Moreover, it is demonstrated that by using multimodal circuits, it is possible to reduce the length of of a conventional filter up to 80 %. In addition to bandpass filters, new topologies of compact band-stop filters are developed. The proposed band-stop filters make use of slow-wave resonators to decrease the total area of the filters and achieve compact topologies. This work also addresses the development of synthesis techniques for each multimodal filter. The design equations were obtained from generalized multimodal circuits available in the literature, which have been adapted for each particular case and modeled as basic filter components, such as immitance inverters or lumped elements. By using the proposed synthesis equations, it is possible to design filters with a desired response and relative bandwidth. The use of the proposed synthesis enables a fast analysis and design of multimodal filters using circuit simulators. As an added feature, several reconfigurable and tunable filter topologies were demonstrated, using active devices (PIN diodes and varactors) or RF-MEMS. These new topologies demonstrate the flexibility of multimodal circuits. For the RF-MEMS-based tunable filters, different capacitive and ohmic switches were designed, fabricated and measured.
