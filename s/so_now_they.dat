500|$|Besides Big Sugar, Douglas {{spoke about}} the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by {{diverting}} the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than [...] of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central & South Florida Project (C), run by {{former members of the}} Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable. [...] "What a liar I turned out to be!" [...] remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, [...] "Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> take it out on us by playing with cement".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} circle of Hell are those {{overcome}} by lust. These [...] "carnal malefactors" [...] are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason. These souls are buffeted {{back and forth}} by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without rest. This symbolizes the power of lust to blow one about needlessly and aimlessly: [...] "as the lovers drifted into self-indulgence and were carried sway by their passions, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> drift for ever. The bright, voluptuous sin {{is now seen as}} it is – a howling darkness of helpless discomfort." [...] Since lust involves mutual indulgence and is not, therefore, completely self-centered, Dante deems it the least heinous of the sins and its punishment is the most benign within Hell proper. The [...] "ruined slope" [...] in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of Christ.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, riders rode this {{attraction}} 2 at a time, {{in yellow}} inflatable dinghies. [...] This was later replaced with large circular 4-person rafts. [...] In the Mountain Creek era, a lift {{was put in}} place that carried rafts {{to the beginning of the}} ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill. [...] Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough. [...] It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> wear football helmets. A rider recounted to Weird NJ how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall. [...] On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck – requiring riders to have to jump out, and push the raft – or wait for the raft behind them to hit them. [...] Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out.|$|E

6000|$|... [p.71]everybody, {{and giving}} the {{greatest}} trouble. We are generally his only visitors; acquaintances {{he appears to have}} few, and no friends; he must have had them once, for he was rich, but is not <b>so</b> <b>now,</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> have fallen away from the poor old man.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I've {{given up}} lecturing the boys lately <b>they</b> are <b>so</b> big <b>now</b> <b>they</b> don't like it, and I fancy I'd {{got into a}} way that was rather tiresome." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{grove of}} 5,000 trees {{planted on the}} proving grounds in 1937, {{spelling}} out the Studebaker name, still stands and {{has proven to be}} a popular topic on such satellite photography sites as Google Earth. The proving grounds were acquired by Bendix in 1966 and Bosch in 1996. After Bosch closed its South Bend operation in 2011, a part of the proving ground was retained and, , has been restored to use under the name [...] "New Carlisle Test Facility". For many years a rumor persisted of a Studebaker graveyard. The rumor was later confirmed to be fact when the remains of many Studebaker prototype automobiles and a few trucks were discovered at a remote site within the confines of the former Studebaker proving grounds. A few of the prototypes were rescued and are in private collections. The only example of a never-produced wood-sided Champion station wagon has been restored and is on display at the Studebaker National Museum. Most of the prototypes were left to rot in direct contact with the ground and full exposure to the weather and falling trees. Attempts to remove some of these rusting bodies resulted in the bodies crumbling under their own weight as they were moved, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> exist only in photographs.|$|E
60|$|Thers. <b>So,</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> quarrel in monosyllables; a {{word and}} a blow, an't be thy will.|$|E
60|$|As their brutish hearts {{had been}} {{suddenly}} melted {{on behalf of}} Juliette, in response to Déroulède's passionate appeal, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> swiftly changed their sympathetic attitude to one of horror and execration.|$|E
6000|$|... "That the {{treasure}} {{is supposed to}} lie," [...] she answered with a smile. [...] "But, Father, what guarantee have you that <b>they</b> will do <b>so</b> <b>now?</b> Perhaps <b>they</b> will take the guns and show us the door--or rather the gate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true; {{but that}} was {{at a time when}} we were not {{positive}} the enemy were <b>so</b> near. <b>Now</b> <b>they</b> are close at our heels we shall be warranted in running many risks which, twenty-four hours ago, would have been most imprudent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say <b>so</b> <b>now,</b> and <b>they</b> {{shall be}} {{as though they}} had been never spoken. So you bearded the Duke in his den, and asked him for Lady Mary's hand,--just as though you had been a young Duke {{yourself}} and owned half a county?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas! yes," [...] {{answered}} the woman. [...] "A fugitive {{says that the}} executioners there are weary, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> tie the poor prisoners back to back and throw them into the mere to drown." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> {{set their}} own {{judgment}} against his. To them it seemed a recklessness--as, indeed, Marzak had suggested--to linger here, and his mere announcement of his purpose was far from sufficient to dispel their doubts.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> went {{on again}} and coming {{presently}} to a pond of muddy water they tied a heavy stone to {{the bundle of}} quills and sunk it {{to the bottom of}} the pond, to avoid carrying it farther.|$|E
6000|$|... "New! She's as new as a Governor, {{and they}} tell me they've got <b>so</b> <b>now</b> that <b>they</b> choose five or six of them, up at Albany, every fall. That craft is sea-going, Mr. Mulford, as any one can tell at a glance. She's none of your passenger-hoys." ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{the boys}} had been excited before, <b>they</b> were more <b>so</b> <b>now,</b> for <b>they</b> {{realized}} that the touring car at the best could be but a few miles away. Could they catch up to it before those running the machine {{had a chance to}} slip them in the darkness? ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing was <b>so</b> Ridiculous, <b>now</b> <b>they</b> {{saw what}} they had done, they began to repent, and upon {{recollection}} of Thoughts some were so asham'd of themselves, that having broken their Doctrin, and being now call'd upon to tranfpose their Allegiance, truly they stopt in the mid-way, and so became Martyrs on both sides.|$|R
6000|$|He.--Don't be afraid, {{they are}} used to it. For ten years I have [...] given it them in a very {{different}} style. They had to accustom [...] themselves to it, however they liked it, and to learn to find their [...] place on the keys and to leap over the strings. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> go [...] where they must.|$|E
60|$|But at nightfall {{they came}} into the wide mouth of the River Phasis, that flows through {{the land of the}} world's end, and they saw the lights burning in the palace of Æêtes the king. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> were come to the last stage of their journey, and there they slept, and dreamed of the Fleece of Gold.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{would be}} no {{difficulty}} {{at any other time}} in getting a boat for England, but I don't know whether you will do <b>so</b> <b>now.</b> <b>They</b> have been clearing off for some days, and I doubt if you will find an English ship in port now, though of course there may be those who have been delayed for their cargo." ...|$|E
60|$|See, {{the dawn}} was breaking. The hills were {{not more than}} eight miles or <b>so</b> away <b>now,</b> and <b>they</b> were green. There must be water there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{he would}} not care for me," [...] sighed poor Essie, wearily. [...] "He always was <b>so</b> kind, and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> are in trouble I couldn't vex him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every fall I repair my {{walls and}} roof, adding sticks and mud and turf, <b>so</b> that <b>now</b> <b>they</b> are very thick. Late {{in the fall}} I {{sometimes}} plaster the outside with mud. This freezes hard, and no enemy who may reach my house on the ice can tear it open. I guess that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are right!" [...] {{declared}} Tom. [...] "I think I can see through it," [...] he went on quickly. [...] "They found out they couldn't dynamite dad or Uncle Randolph into giving up that money, and they couldn't get at Mrs. Stanhope or Mrs. Laning to get it, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> {{are going to see}} what they can do through Dora--and maybe Nellie and Grace." ...|$|E
60|$|So they {{accompanied}} {{their new}} friend {{through a maze}} of passages--for the palace was very big--and then through a high, arched portal into the streets of the City. So rapid had been their descent when the umbrella landed them in the royal garden that they had not even {{caught a glimpse of the}} Blue City, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> gazed with wonder and interest at the splendid sights that met their eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> {{were very}} proud to {{think that one of}} their own number {{actually}} had frightened him, and they began to look on Buster Bear as a real hero. They tried in ever so many ways to show him how friendly they felt and went quite {{out of their way to}} do him favors. Whenever they met one another, all they could talk about was the smartness and the greatness of Buster Bear.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hill flounced {{off to bed}} in a pet. She was {{disgusted with}} everything, she {{declared}} to the Major. Things had been going <b>so</b> nicely, and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> were all muddled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jong-Keena, Jong-Keena," [...] she chanted on {{with her}} husband. The repetition, at first slow, had {{accelerated}} steadily, <b>so</b> that <b>now</b> <b>they</b> fairly rippled through with it, while their slapping, striking palms made a continuous patter. The exercise and excitement had added to the sun's action on her skin, so that her laughing face was all a rosy glow.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems that}} he means it. The winds are not <b>so</b> high <b>now</b> as <b>they</b> were in October, {{and the men}} {{understand}} well when the sea will be high." ...|$|R
60|$|Long {{and long}} ago, there were banished to Ohonoo all the bucaniers, flibustiers, thieves, and malefactors of the {{neighboring}} islands; who, becoming at last quite a numerous community, resolved to make a stand for their dignity, and number one among the nations of Mardi. And even as before they had been weeded out of the surrounding countries; <b>so</b> <b>now,</b> <b>they</b> went to weeding out themselves; banishing all objectionable persons to still another island.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{fear for}} me," [...] Toussaint said decidedly. [...] "Arriving in hot blood {{they might have}} {{attacked}} me, but I am sure they will not do <b>so</b> <b>now.</b> <b>They</b> know well enough that I should be terribly avenged were they to do so. It is quite necessary that you should take as many men as before, for {{it is possible that}} some of Biassou's men might steal away and follow you." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{they had}} {{answered}} to companionship with the humble picnic-parties among the dunes, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> found it amusing to dine among the semi-great and the semi-motorists at the Nassau. Ruth had a distinct pleasure when T. Wentler, horse-fancier, aviation enthusiast, {{president of the}} First State Bank of Sacramento, came up, reminded Carl of their acquaintanceship at the Oakland-Berkeley Aero Meet, and begged Ruth and Carl to join him, his wife, and Senator Leeford, for coffee.|$|E
6000|$|... "Unusual! You {{may well}} call it <b>so.</b> <b>Now</b> if <b>they</b> {{are going to}} sing duets every night, I do hope they will both sing the same tune at the same time, for in my opinion a duet that {{is made up of}} two {{different}} tunes is a mistake; especially when the tunes ain't any kin to one another, that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Men are <b>so</b> {{different}} <b>now,</b> aunt. <b>They</b> {{give themselves}} {{so much more}} latitude. A man has only {{to say that he}} has changed his mind and nothing ever comes of it." ...|$|R
40|$|The Nirano mud volcanoes are {{the most}} {{important}} and best developed pseudo-volcanic vents not only in Emilia-Romagna but in all of Italy; as such, they are protected as geosites of great scientific and educational importance. The considerable reduction of anthropogenic disturbance following the founding of the Reserve has allowed the eruptive phenomena to increase, <b>so</b> that <b>now</b> <b>they</b> can develop without constraints...|$|R
