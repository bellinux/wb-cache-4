5|$|Later in Monk's Café, Jerry {{goes back}} on the deal and decides {{not to take the}} place because George wants it. The two {{continue}} to argue about who should own it, and decided that neither of them <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear that}} Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E
25|$|During World War 1, a {{significant}} number of former pupils of the school went to fight in the war, as part of the 200,000 Irishmen who participated in the war effort. The Dún Laoghaire area suffered over 500 military fatalities during the war, with {{a significant}} number of these coming from school. Owing to this, people in Flanders sent a statue to the area to honour the dead. It was felt {{at the time that the}} school <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> as so many of the fatalities were from the school. With the changing political environment at the time however, with the Irish War of Independence underway, this was declined by the school. The statue was instead housed in the Dominican Covent in the town, where it resides still to this day in an oratory purposely designed for it.|$|E

500|$|When Paul is {{tormented by}} a group of {{homophobic}} men, Ivan steps in to rescue him. Brocklebank told Kris Green of Digital Spy that Ivan tells the men that if they have a problem they <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out on him, not his boyfriend. This is the first time Ivan [...] "actually vocalises it" [...] and he is shocked because [...] "he has ever considered anyone to be his boyfriend before". Paul then invites Ivan out for dinner with his father, but Ivan is not ready to come out. The actor said that Ivan needs more time until he feels comfortable with the situation. Ivan's ex-wife Jordan (Erin Shanagher) caught him with another man, outed him and which resulted in a [...] "horrendous" [...] reaction from those he knew. Brocklebank said that this causes his reluctance to come out again because [...] "he's become scared about opening himself up to a new community of people and is worried about the villagers' reaction." ...|$|E
500|$|Christian Williams of Billboard {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} the pop sound of [...] "Halo" [...] <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> {{to the top of}} the charts. He added that comparisons could be made to Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007), but concluded that [...] "Halo" [...] "hangs high on its own merits". Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly described [...] "Halo" [...] as [...] "an absolutely glorious and perfectly produced track", which had the potential to be as commercially successful as [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003) and [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (2007). Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle wrote that it was an immediate standout on I Am... Sasha Fierce. Praising the [...] "big and wide" [...] melodies of [...] "Halo", Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club commented that Beyoncé has [...] "a real flair for grandeur". Jennifer Cady of E! Online {{wrote that the}} song could be included on a romantic mixtape, and James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the [...] "tear-jerking power" [...] of [...] "Halo" [...] reveals [...] "sides of Beyoncé we never knew existed". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork wrote that Beyoncé's vocal delivery was [...] "strident and exposed", reminiscent of Céline Dion's style.|$|E
500|$|Middleton rarely takes {{a singer}} or songwriter's role for Powderfinger, {{generally}} delegating those tasks to Bernard Fanning. However, the song [...] "Over My Head" [...] from Internationalist had Middleton performing vocals. This came about when Middleton did {{a recording of}} himself singing the song before Fanning {{had the chance to}} do so. Previously, Middleton had written the lyrics to [...] "JC", which was sung by Fanning. However, Middleton sung JC several times throughout the 2007 Upstairs at the Downstairs tour. Despite Middleton's minimal songwriting, he has been praised for it by his band mates; Jon Coghill told a 1999 interview that [...] "Darren (Middleton) and Bernie (Fanning) are extremely good at writing songs." [...] Middleton agrees with this analysis; telling Undercovers Paul Cashmere in 2003 that [...] "We are about writing good music." [...] He commented that the band used their position {{at the top of the}} Australian industry to comment and give people ideas to think about, rather than [...] "trying to say people <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as gospel". Middleton has criticised the [...] "boy band" [...] phenomena, pointing out that [...] "A lot of them can sing well, but they have people writing all their lyrics for them." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the repeal, a {{committee}} of London merchants issued a public letter to Americans, warning them not to declare victory. Mason published a response in June 1766, satirizing the British position, [...] "We have, with infinite Difficulty & Fatigue got you excused this one Time; do what your Papa and Mamma bid, & hasten to return your most grateful Acknowledgements for condescending to let you keep what is your own." [...] The Townshend Acts of 1767 were Britain's next attempt to tax the colonies, placing duties on substances including lead and glass, and provoking calls from the northern colonies for a boycott of British goods. Virginia, more dependent on goods imported from Britain, was less enthusiastic, and, as local planters tended to receive goods at their river landings, a boycott {{would be difficult to}} enforce. In April 1769, Washington sent a copy of a Philadelphia resolution to Mason, asking his advice on what action Virginia <b>should</b> <b>take.</b> <b>It</b> is unknown who adapted that text for use in Virginia (Broadwater concluded it was Mason) but Mason sent Washington a corrected draft on April 23, 1769. Washington took it to Williamsburg, but the governor, Lord Botetourt, dissolved the legislature because of the radical resolutions it was passing. The Burgesses adjourned to a nearby tavern, and there passed a non-importation agreement based on Mason's.|$|E
2500|$|Black {{would like}} to get his king to the e3-square and {{threaten}} checkmate to force the white king away from the queening square of the pawn, e1. [...] The white rook on the third rank prevents that. If Black checks with the rook from the side, White simply keeps the king in front of the pawn by alternating between squares e1 and e2. [...] If Black offers an exchange of rooks White <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> since the resulting king and pawn endgame is drawn (see King and pawn versus king endgame).|$|E

She stated [...] "For the {{majority}} of Muslims in the world the Holocaust is not a major historical event they deny; they simply do not know because they were never informed. Worse, most of us are groomed to wish for a Holocaust of Jews." [...] She says that she never learned anything about the Holocaust while she was studying in Saudi Arabia and Kenya.

In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E

By the spring of 1828, Turner was convinced that he [...] "was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the Almighty". While working in his owner's fields on May 12, Turner [...] "heard a loud noise in the heavens, and the Spirit instantly appeared to me and said the Serpent was loosened, and Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and that I <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> on and fight against the Serpent, for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first".|$|E

2500|$|The day Burge was {{released}} from prison, Taylor, Mogul, colleagues from the Chicago Torture Justice Memorials (CTJM), and survivors of Chicago police torture, joined by 26 aldermen, urged the Chicago City Council to pass an ordinance to earmark $20 million in reparations {{to the victims of}} police torture in Area 2. The ordinance was conceived by noted Chicago civil rights attorney Standish Willis and drafted by CTJM co-founder Joey Mogul. It was the product of years of political organizing by grassroots organizations that included CTJM and Black People Against Police Torture. [...] "With a majority of the aldermen on board for this ordinance, the powers that be in this city <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> seriously," [...] Taylor told reporters.

2500|$|In {{that same}} year, Stuart left Universal and joined Twentieth Century-Fox. Her first {{assignment}} {{from the studio}} head, Darryl F. Zanuck, was in Professional Soldier supporting the child star Freddie Bartholomew and Academy Award winner Victor McLaglen (the year before, McLaglen won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role in John Ford's The Informer). Frank S. Nugent noted: [...] "There is a minor romance along the way between Gloria Stuart, the king's noble governess, and Michael Whalen, the professional soldier's part-time assistant, but no one <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> seriously." [...] In 1936, John Ford chose Stuart to co-star with Warner Baxter in The Prisoner of Shark Island. Playing {{the wife of the}} doctor who treated Lincoln's assassin, Stuart felt privileged to work again with Ford, although the New York Times Frank S. Nugent wrote of Stuart's [...] "...helpful performance..." [...] In Poor Little Rich Girl, Stuart again was asked to support a child star: this time, Shirley Temple. Frank S. Nugent: [...] "Listing [...] supporting players hastily, then, before we forget them entirely, we might mention Miss Faye [...] Gloria Stuart…as having been permitted a scene or two while Miss Temple was out freshening her costume." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Thus reunited, what a {{touching}} scene" [...] the Monks proclaim as Fiona and Blondel {{set off to}} meet the King at Dover before he embarks on his journey.

[...] Richard suggests Blondel <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up with John instead and the Crusaders leave for the Holy Land. ("Lionheart") [...] Back at the Ministry of Feudal Affairs, Blondel and Fiona present the song to John who promptly throws the song away and proclaims that all songs should from now on be dedicated to him and not Richard. ("No Rhyme for Richard") [...] John then tasks Blondel to write a song about him but Blondel refuses, saying it's an important job but that his heart's just not in it. [...] Fiona is outraged by Blondel's refusal of work {{saying that this is}} the break he's been waiting for. [...] As Blondel lists his reasons for not wanting to write a song dedicated to his Prince, both John and Fiona grow increasingly angered. [...] The scene culminates in John banishing Blondel to the Continent and declaring [...] "snub a prince but realize you've sunk a singing career". ("Trio") ...|$|E

2500|$|Discontent with Diệm and Nhu {{exploded}} into mass protest during mid-1963 when nine Buddhists {{died at the}} hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. In response, the US government {{was concerned about the}} possibility [...] "for the Dim/Nhu government to succeed and for us [...] to continue to support them." [...] The response by Ambassador Nolting was, [...] "We <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> slow and easy {{and see if we can}} live with the Diem government." [...] As a result of this potential inability to support the Diem/Nhu government, the United States government discussed a proposed coup. In a telegram to the American Embassy in Saigon, Mr. Hilsman expresses that at some point should we need [...] "political liquidation" [...] we should also [...] "urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary." [...] In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively enforced; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. Many Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power.|$|E
