After the foundation of the RSHA in September 1939, Eichmann became director of RSHA <b>sub-section</b> (Referat) <b>IV</b> D 4 (Clearing Activities, or Räumungsangelegenheiten) (1940), and, after March 1941, IV B 4 (Jewish Affairs, or Judenreferat). Both offices organized the deportation of Jews. From this position, Eichmann {{played a central role in}} the deportation of over 1.5 million Jews from all over Europe to Nazi killing centers.|$|R
5000|$|Heydrich was Müller's direct {{superior}} {{until his}} assassination in 1942. For {{the remainder of}} the war, Ernst Kaltenbrunner took over as Müller's superior. Müller occupied a position in the Nazi hierarchy close to Himmler, the overall head of the Nazi police apparatus and the chief architect of the plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe, and Eichmann, the man entrusted with arranging the deportations of Jews to the Eastern ghettoes and death camps. Eichmann headed the Gestapo's [...] "Office of Resettlement" [...] and then its [...] "Office of Jewish Affairs" [...] (the RSHA Amt <b>IV</b> <b>sub-section</b> known as Referat IV B4). He was Müller's subordinate. Müller was also involved in the regime's policy towards the Jews, although Himmler and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels drove this area of policy. On 6 October 1939 for instance, Müller instructed Eichmann to prepare for the deportation of some 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from the annexed Polish city of Kattowitz; an order which also included the deportation of the Jews from Ostrava—both [...] "expulsion campaigns" [...] had already been planned as early as September by the Gestapo or the army. Twelve days later on 18 October 1939, he told Eichmann that it would soon [...] "be necessary to organize the resettlement and removal of Poles and Jews into the area of the future Polish rump state centrally" [...] via the RSHA.|$|R
