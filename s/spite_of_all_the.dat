Confronted with a desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity.

25|$|In {{its return}} to the European {{championship}} following years under Soviet occupation, Lithuania began the tournament powerfully, with five wins in the group stage and a defeat to Yugoslavia. They overcame the quarter-finals stage successfully as well, defeating 1994 World Championship silver medalists Russia 82–71, leading the game from start to finish. With a guaranteed spot in the tournament's top four, Lithuania was granted the right {{to participate in the}} 1996 Summer Olympics, held in Atlanta. The semi-final hurdle was overcome as well with a 90–80 defeat of the powerful Croatia, led by the two mighty centers: Stojko Vranković and Dino Rađa. The Lithuanian national team advanced into its final after 56 years, demonstrating the Lithuanian basketball's vitality and strength, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> previous difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Lewis Campbell was {{the first}} to make {{exhaustive}} use of stylometry to prove objectively that the Critias, Timaeus, Laws, Philebus, Sophist, and Statesman were all clustered together as a group, while the Parmenides, Phaedrus, Republic, and Theaetetus belong to a separate group, which must be earlier (given Aristotle's statement in his Politics that the Laws was written after the Republic; cf. Diogenes Laertius Lives 3.37). What is remarkable about Campbell's conclusions is that, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stylometric studies that have been conducted since his time, perhaps the only chronological fact about Plato's works that can now be said to be proven by stylometry is the fact that Critias, Timaeus, Laws, Philebus, Sophist, and Statesman are the latest of Plato's dialogues, the others earlier.|$|E
25|$|In the {{archives}} of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on stamped paper costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many sensitive issues. Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared for their health, and demanded that they be given rest on feast days, and that they be given an annual holiday. But in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult.|$|E

25|$|A {{new group}} of Marranos was brought to Morocco through the {{definite}} establishment of the Inquisition in Portugal under Pope Paul III in 1536. But in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> suffering which Portugal had brought upon the Jews, there yet remained enough patriotism {{in the hearts of}} her rejected Jewish sons to cause them to help their former oppressors to preserve their old possessions on the Moroccan coast and to gain new ones. Through the strategy of a Jewish physician the Portuguese in 1508 succeeded in conquering the old seaport town of Safi, which had a large number of Jewish inhabitants and which, chiefly through them, had become an important commercial center. Two years later, in the same city, upon the reconquest of which the Moors had been steadily intent, was besieged by a large Moorish army. Thereupon two Portuguese Jews, Isaac Bencemero and a certain Ismail, brought assistance to the besieged with two ships manned by coreligionists and equipped at their own cost. In Safi, the Jews were allowed to live as such by Emanuel's permission; also in Asilah after 1533, which had long been a Portuguese possession. In the quarrels which afterward took place between the Moors and the governors of Azamur in 1526, Abraham ben Zamaira and Abraham Cazan, the most influential Jew in Azemmour in 1528, served the Portuguese as negotiators. The Jews Abraham and Samuel Cabeça of Morocco also had dealings with the Portuguese generals.|$|E
25|$|Prince Trubetskoy's {{hopes for}} quick {{resolution}} of the Konotop stand-off were dimmed when Hulyanytsky and his Cossacks refused to betray hetman Vyhovsky and mounted a fierce and protracted defence of Konotop with ony 4,000 Cossacks. According to a historian Markevych, on April 21, 1659, after a morning prayer, Trubetskoy ordered an all-out assault on the fortress's fortifications. The city was shelled, a few incendiary bombs were dropped inside, and the army moved on to capture the city. At one point Trubetskoy's troops broke inside the city walls, but were repelled by the fierce resistance of the Cossacks inside. After the fiasco of the initial assault, Trubetskoy abandoned his plans of a quick assault and proceeded to shell the city and to fill the moat with earth. The Cossacks stubbornly held on in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fire unleashed on the city: during the night the earth put {{to fill in the}} moat was used to strengthen the city walls, and the besieged even undertook several counterattacks on Trubetskoy's besieging army. These attacks forced Prince Trubetskoy to move his military camp 10km away from the city and thereby split his forces between the main army at his headquarters and the army besieging Konotop. Another attack on April 29 was also repelled and the Russians lost close to 400 men and suffered around 3000 wounded. Instead of a quick campaign the siege dragged on for 70 days and gave Vyhovsky the much-needed time to prepare for the battle with the Russian army.|$|E

500|$|Attempts to find {{sources for}} the work in {{literature}} from the period have not been successful.

We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key." [...] The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians [...] "explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son?
