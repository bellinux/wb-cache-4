It {{was for the}} first time theoretically possible for married women to live away from their husbands and support their own children themselves. However, widowed women with children, as femes soles, had already had the right to own property and support their children.|$|E
40|$|JEL No. H 2 This paper {{explores the}} effect of {{discretion}} in estate valuation techniques on the effective estate tax burden on different asset classes. For some assets, such as liquid securities, there is relatively little discretion in valuation. For other assets, such as partial interests in closely-held businesses, family limited partnerships, and real assets or collectibles that are traded in thin markets, estate valuations may {{be more difficult to}} establish. Estate tax filers may therefore be able to select valuations that reduce the reported value of the estate assets, and therefore the effective estate tax burden. In 1998, estates that invoked the doctrine of &quot;minority discounts &quot; in valuing non-controlling interests in limited partnerships claimed an average discount of 36 percent for these assets, relative to their estimated market value. More than half of all limited partnership assets reported on estate tax returns were valued using this doctrine. This suggests that for a given <b>statutory</b> <b>estate</b> tax rate, the effective estate tax burden may be greater on assets that are easily valued than on difficult-to-value assets. A comparison of the mix of assets reported on estate tax returns, and the mix the estate tax returns would be predicted to hold, given data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, i...|$|E

40|$|Family {{partnerships}} {{have been}} become increasingly popular {{as a means}} of avoiding estate and gift taxes. As other estate freezing techniques have been closed off by <b>statutory</b> anti-abuse rules, <b>estate</b> planners have increasingly resorted to partnerships as a vehicle for transferring assets within a family at deeply discounted values. Discounts ranging from one-third to over one-half {{of the value of the}} underlying assets are routinely claimed, and often allowed, based on lack of marketability and lack of control, even where these disabilities have no lasting or ascertainable economic effect. Nevertheless, the use of family partnerships to suppress value for transfer tax purposes rests on shaky conceptual premises which deserve closer scrutiny...|$|R
40|$|After 1689 Parliament passed {{increasing}} numbers of acts altering property rights. The acts enabled individuals to sell, mortgage, lease, and improve land previously bound by legal legacies; granted rights to organizations, such as turnpikes and canal companies, which supplied infrastructure and public services; and replaced traditional agricultural rights with enclosed fields and individual property. This note describes a database of <b>estate,</b> <b>statutory</b> authority, and enclosure acts. The depth and detail of the database enables us to document these trends and discuss their effects on English economic development and the Industrial Revolution. 1 Theories concerning governmentâ€Ÿs role in British economic development fall into two broad classes. A traditional school contends that government played little (or no) {{significant role in the}} onset of industrialization, which was directed by individual entrepreneurs, propelled by market imperatives, and financed by private capital. The government kept taxes low and regulations porous. The absence of politically imposed constraints allowed manufacturing an...|$|R
