The services provided by forensic accountants are not new to accountants. What is new is that it has become an area of specialization. It is now a multi-disciplinary profession consisting of mainly accountants, lawyers and individuals previously employed by the investigative agencies. One of the issues being debated is the ethics of forensic accountants acting for known or suspected criminals or organized crime syndicates. One view is that it should not be a problem because every person is entitled to a fair trial and it is not the forensic accountant's role to be judgmental, but just to obtain the facts. With the further globalization of organizations and cooperation of governments internationally, the demand for forensic accounting services should continue to grow...|$|R

40|$|Major {{values of}} medical librarians, as {{exemplified}} in their periodical literature 1903 - 1977, {{are identified as}} "professionalism," "cooperation," "sense of community with health sciences practitioners," and "knowledge orientation.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{our region}} (Eastern South Limburg, The Netherlands) an open access {{echocardiography}} service started in 2002. It {{was the first}} service of this kind in The Netherlands. Our study aims were: (1) to evaluate demand for the <b>service,</b> participation, <b>indications,</b> echocardiography outcomes, and management by the general practitioner (GP); (2) to analyse changes in indications and outcomes over the years. Methods (1) Data from GP request forms, echocardiography reports and a retrospective GP questionnaire on management (response rate 83 %) of 625 consecutive patients (Dec. 2002 - March 2007) were analysed cross-sectionally. (2) For the analysis of changes over the years, data from GP request forms and echocardiography reports {{of the first and}} last 250 patients that visited the service between Dec. 2002 and Feb. 2008 (n = 1001) were compared. Results The echocardiography service was used by 81 % of the regional GPs. On average, a GP referred one patient per year to the <b>service.</b> Intended <b>indications</b> for the <b>service</b> were dyspnoea (32 %), cardiac murmur (59 %), and peripheral oedema (17 %). Of the other indications (22 %), one-third was for evaluation of suspected left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Expected outcomes were left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) (43 %, predominantly diastolic) and valve disease (25 %). We also found a high proportion of LVH (50 %). Only 24 % of all echocardiograms showed no relevant disease. The GP followed the cardiologist's advice to refer the patient for further evaluation in 71 %. In recent patients, more echocardiography requests were done for 'cardiac murmur' and 'other' indications, but less for 'dyspnoea'. The proportions of patients with LVD, LVH and valve disease decreased and the proportion of patients with no relevant disease increased. The number of advices by the cardiologists increased. Conclusion Overall, GPs used the open access echocardiography service efficiently (i. e. with a high chance of finding relevant pathology), but efficiency decreased slightly over the years. To {{meet the needs of the}} GPs, indications might be widened with 'suspicion LVH'. Further specification of the indications for open access echocardiography - by defining a stepwise diagnostic approach including ECG and (NT-pro) BNP - might improve the service. </p...|$|R

40|$|CD-Rom {{databases}} {{have been}} {{hailed as a}} means of avoiding the problems inherent in budgeting for online services, and hence also the need to charge for searching.

At present, we do not charge for this <b>service.</b> Initial <b>indications</b> are that the introduction of CD-Rom databases has meant a slump in demand for online searches. Clearly, CD-Rom and online services could be complementary, and it is likely that once CD [...] ROM databases are no longer considered a novelty, online services will regain, and possibly increase, their standing with the academic library community.

The 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) is specifying an IP Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) in UMTS Release 5 / 6, which is adjunct to the UMTS Packet Switched (PS) GPRS CN. This IP-based network will allow mobile operators to provide commonly used Internet applications to wireless user.

40|$|Today the {{national}} security system effectiveness seriously depends on the professional analysis of information and timely forecasts. Thus the efficient methods of forecasting {{in the sphere of}} international relations are of current importance for the modern intelligence <b>services.</b> The <b>Indications</b> and Warning Technique that was a key element of forecasting methodology in intelligence until the end of Cold War is estimated in the present article. Is this method still relevant in the contemporary world with its new international order, new security challenges and technological revolution in the data collection and processing? The main conclusion based on the overview of current researches and known intelligence practice is that indicators technique is still relevant for the early warning of national security threats but requires some adaptation to today’s issues. The most important trends in adaptation are supposed to be a creation of broadest possible spectrum of threatens scenarios as well as research of current strategic threatens and corresponding indicators. Also the appropriate software that automates the use of indications technique by the security services is very important. The author believes that the cooperation between intelligence services and academic community can increase the efficiency of the Indications Methodology and of the strategic forecasting as well...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{understand}} why some adults with primary brain tumors {{do not use}} support <b>services</b> despite <b>indications</b> of a need for help. Methods Nineteen adults recently diagnosed with primary brain tumors participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic {{analysis was used to}} identify recurrent ways participants explained their non-use of support services. Results Some patients indicated that they did not use support services as they did not need help, in particular reporting positive experiences relative to their expectations or to others, that their needs were met, or difficulties recognising their needs. Some patients reported not wanting help, citing preferences to self-manage, other priorities, or negative perceptions of the services available. Many patients identified barriers to support service utilisation, particularly problems recognising that services could address their needs and that their needs were valid concerns. Conclusion The gap between patients’ needs and their service use may result from patients’ expectations from the medical system, shifting of standards for well-being, cognitive changes, and access issues. Practice implications Addressing knowledge barriers and perceptions relating to help-seeking, as well as recognising the challenges specific to this patient group in terms of need recognition and access issues, may assist in improving patients’ physical, psychological and social wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ubiquitous Quality of Service(QoS) -aware applications, such as {{e-business}} or multimedia delivery {{are becoming}} available anywhere anytime. In the past decade, also QoS-oriented middleware services, as-sisting QoS-aware applications with {{different aspects of}} QoS provisions, have been proposed. Assuming the availability of these middleware ser-vices, in this paper, we present the application to middleware service translation system. This system helps an application developer to develop a QoS-aware application which can be deployed flexibly and efficiently in ubiquitous environments with different available middleware services. We introduce the middleware abstraction layer (MAL) between the ap-plication view of middleware and the specific middleware implementa-tions. The translation system assists the QoS-aware application in two phases: (1) environment-independent translation, and (2) environment-dependent translation. The first phase maps the QoS-aware application to configurations of middleware <b>services</b> without <b>indication</b> of specific implementations, to satisfy the qualitative QoS requirements. Its result is the portable MAL representation. The second phase helps the appli-cation developer to customize the MAL representation within a specific deployment environment. It deals with (a) mapping of MAL representa-tion into configurations of specific middleware implementations, and (b) mapping of application quantitative QoS requirements into specific mid-dleware implementation’s expected parameters. Our translation system facilitates {{the rapid growth of}} QoS-aware applications in the ubiquitous environments. ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bleeding {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} death in trauma patients. The iTClamp is a {{temporary}} wound closure device designed to control external bleeding within seconds of injury. We describe our experience using this device on 10 patients in the prehospital environment. METHODS: We have implemented the iTClamp for prehospital use through our physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical <b>service</b> (HEMS). <b>Indications</b> were massive bleeding that could not be controlled with an ordinary compressive bandage or a haemostatic bandage. RESULTS: Ten patients were treated with the iTClamp. Seven patients had a severe head injury due to various traumas, one patient had a neck injury from a disk cutter, one patient had an open chest wound and one patient had an open femur fracture. After applying the iTClamp, bleeding was controlled in 90 % of these patients (n= 9), with complete cessation reported in 60 % (n= 6), partial cessation with adequate control reported in 30 % (n= 3); in one patient, the bleeding could not be controlled with the iTClamp alone. It took an average of 10 s to apply the iTClamp, and the average usage satisfaction score was 7. 7. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the iTClamp is a safe, fast and useful tool for stopping or controlling external blood loss in our series of prehospital patients. Further studies of the iTClamp are needed to determine which patients might benefit from this device...|$|R
