25|$|<b>Summary</b> <b>statistics</b> {{may be used}} to {{increase}} the acceptance rate of ABC for high-dimensional data. Low-dimensional sufficient statistics are optimal for this purpose, as they capture all relevant information present in the data in the simplest possible form. However, low-dimensional sufficient statistics are typically unattainable for statistical models where ABC-based inference is most relevant, and consequently, some heuristic is usually necessary to identify useful low-dimensional <b>summary</b> <b>statistics.</b> The use of a set of poorly chosen <b>summary</b> <b>statistics</b> will often lead to inflated credible intervals due to the implied loss of information, which can also bias the discrimination between models. A review of methods for choosing <b>summary</b> <b>statistics</b> is available, which may provide valuable guidance in practice.|$|E
25|$|To {{assess how}} {{severely}} the dimensionality of a data set affects the analysis {{within the context}} of ABC, analytical formulas have been derived for the error of the ABC estimators as functions of the dimension of the <b>summary</b> <b>statistics.</b> In addition, Blum and François have investigated how the dimension of the <b>summary</b> <b>statistics</b> is related to the mean squared error for different correction adjustments to the error of ABC estimators. It was also argued that dimension reduction techniques are useful to avoid the curse-of-dimensionality, due to a potentially lower-dimensional underlying structure of <b>summary</b> <b>statistics.</b> Motivated by minimizing the quadratic loss of ABC estimators, Fearnhead and Prangle have proposed a scheme to project (possibly high-dimensional) data into estimates of the parameter posterior means; these means, now having the same dimension as the parameters, are then used as <b>summary</b> <b>statistics</b> for ABC.|$|E

25|$|Methods for the {{identification}} of <b>summary</b> <b>statistics</b> that could also simultaneously assess the influence on the approximation of the posterior would be of substantial value. This is because the choice of <b>summary</b> <b>statistics</b> and the choice of tolerance constitute two sources of error in the resulting posterior distribution.

Indeed, none of the methods above assesses the choice of summaries {{for the purpose of}} model selection.|$|E

25|$|In practice, as {{discussed}} below, these measures {{can be highly}} sensitive to the choice of parameter prior distributions and <b>summary</b> <b>statistics,</b> and thus conclusions of model comparison should be drawn with caution.|$|E
25|$|The sample maximum {{and minimum}} are basic <b>summary</b> <b>statistics,</b> showing {{the most extreme}} observations, and {{are used in the}} five-number summary and a version of the seven-number summary and the {{associated}} box plot.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} methods assesses whether the {{inference}} {{was successful in}} light of the given observed data, for example, by comparing the posterior predictive distribution of <b>summary</b> <b>statistics</b> to the <b>summary</b> <b>statistics</b> observed. Beyond that, cross-validation techniques and predictive checks represent promising future strategies to evaluate the stability and out-of-sample predictive validity of ABC inferences. This is particularly important when modeling large data sets, because then the posterior support of a particular model can appear overwhelmingly conclusive, even if all proposed models in fact are poor representations of the stochastic system underlying the observation data. Out-of-sample predictive checks can reveal potential systematic biases within a model and provide clues on to how to improve its structure or parametrization.|$|E

25|$|As {{elaborated}} below, it {{is typically}} impossible, outside the exponential family of distributions, {{to identify a}} finite-dimensional set of sufficient statistics.

25|$|As {{the above}} {{discussion}} makes clear, any ABC analysis requires choices and trade-offs {{that can have}} a considerable impact on its outcomes.

25|$|One {{approach}} to capture {{most of the}} information present in data would be to use many statistics, but the accuracy and stability of ABC appears to decrease rapidly with an increasing numbers of <b>summary</b> <b>statistics.</b> Instead, a better strategy is to focus on the relevant statistics only—relevancy depending on the whole inference problem, on the model used, and on the data at hand.|$|E
25|$|An {{algorithm}} {{has been}} proposed for identifying a representative subset of <b>summary</b> <b>statistics,</b> by iteratively assessing whether an additional statistic introduces a meaningful modification of the posterior. One of the challenges here is that a large ABC approximation error may heavily influence the conclusions about the usefulness of a statistic at any stage of the procedure. Another method decomposes into two main steps. First, a reference approximation of the posterior is constructed by minimizing the entropy. Sets of candidate summaries are then evaluated by comparing the ABC-approximated posteriors with the reference posterior.|$|E
25|$|With both {{of these}} strategies, a subset of {{statistics}} is selected from a large set of candidate statistics. Instead, the partial least squares regression approach uses information from all the candidate statistics, each being weighted appropriately. Recently, a method for constructing summaries in a semi-automatic manner has attained a considerable interest. This method {{is based on the}} observation that the optimal choice of <b>summary</b> <b>statistics,</b> when minimizing the quadratic loss of the parameter point estimates, can be obtained through the posterior mean of the parameters, which is approximated by performing a linear regression based on the simulated data.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{heuristic}} {{approaches to the}} quality control of ABC have been proposed, such as the quantification of the fraction of parameter variance explained by the <b>summary</b> <b>statistics.</b> A common class of methods aims at assessing {{whether or not the}} inference yields valid results, regardless of the actually observed data. For instance, given a set of parameter values, which are typically drawn from the prior or the posterior distributions for a model, one can generate a large number of artificial datasets. In this way, the quality and robustness of ABC inference can be assessed in a controlled setting, by gauging how well the chosen ABC inference method recovers the true parameter values, and also models if multiple structurally different models are considered simultaneously.|$|E
