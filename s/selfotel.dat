50|$|<b>Selfotel</b> (CGS-19755) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a {{competitive}} NMDA antagonist, directly competing with glutamate for binding to the receptor. Initial studies showed it to have anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, analgesic and neuroprotective effects, and it was originally researched {{for the treatment of}} stroke, but subsequent animal and human studies showed phencyclidine-like effects, as well as limited efficacy and evidence for possible neurotoxicity under some conditions, and so clinical development was ultimately discontinued.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA small {{library of}} phosphonopiperidylcarboxylic acids, analogues of NMDA {{antagonist}} <b>selfotel</b> (CGS 19755), was synthesized. First, {{the series of}} aromatic esters was obtained via a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction (Hirao coupling) of dialkyl phosphites with bromopyridinecarboxylates, followed by their hydrolysis. Then, hydrogenation of the resulting phosphonopyridylcarboxylic acids over PtO 2 yielded the desired phosphonopiperidylcarboxylic acids. NMR studies indicated that the hydrogenation reaction proceeds predominantly by cis addition. Several compounds were obtained as monocrystal structures. Preliminary biological studies performed on cultures of neurons suggest that the obtained compounds possess promising activity toward NMDA receptors...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{accepted}} that high concentrations of glutamate can destroy neurons, {{and this is the}} basis of the theory of excitotoxicity during brain injury such as stroke. Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as <b>Selfotel,</b> Aptiganel, Gavestinel and others failed to show neuroprotective efficacy in human clinical trials or produced intolerable central nervous system adverse effects. The failure of these agents has been attributed to poor studies in animal models and to poorly designed clinical trials. We also speculate that NMDA receptor antagonism may have hindered endogenous mechanisms for neuronal survival and neuroregeneration. It remains to be proven in human stroke whether NMDA receptor antagonism can be neuroprotective...|$|E
40|$|Two novel N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists {{with unique}} {{chemical}} structures, EAA- 090 (2 -[8, 9 -dioxo- 2, 6 -diazabicyclo[5. 2. 0]non- 1 (7) -en 2 -yl]ethylphosphonic acid) and EAB- 318 (R [...] amino- 5 -chloro- 1 -(phosphonomethyl) - 1 H-benzimidazole- 2 -propanoic acid hydrochloride), {{were compared with}} CGS- 19755 (<b>Selfotel)</b> in ligand binding, elec-trophysiology, and neuroprotection assays. CGS- 19755, EAA- 090 and EAB- 318 inhibited [3 H] 3 -(2 -carboxypiperazin- 4 -yl) propyl- 1 -phosphonic acid binding to NMDA receptors with IC 50 values of 55, 28, and 7. 9 nM, respectively. All three compounds decreased the duration of spontaneous synaptic currents and inhibited NMDA-activated currents in rat hip-pocampal neurons. IC 50 values for inhibition of current in-duced by 10 M NMDA were 795, 477, and 69 nM fo...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of cultured {{cortical}} neurons to elevated extracellular K+ concentrations (25 [*]mM) induces membrane depolarization and {{an increase}} in action-potential firing. Long-term high K+ treatment was associated with an increased neuronal cell death. In surviving neurons, multiple changes occurred in the proportion of individual NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR 1) splice variant mRNA expression, whereas the overall expression of NR 1, NR 2 A and NR 2 B transcripts remained unaffected. The high K+-induced changes in NR 1 splice variant expression were virtually abolished upon a concurrent administration of tetrodotoxin (TTX; 3 [*]μM). In voltage-clamp recordings performed on neurons resistant to high K+ treatment, inward currents induced by NMDA (1 – 1000 [*]μM) were reduced. In K+-resistant cells, the activity of calpain but not of caspase- 3 was diminished compared with controls kept in regular medium. NR function as well as calpain activity was not affected in cultures concomitantly treated with high K+ and either TTX or a NR antagonist (CGS 19755 (<b>selfotel)</b> or memantine). In conclusion, the present data indicate adaptive changes in NR 1 splice variant expression and a decrease in NR function upon a sustained increase in neurotransmission. Accordingly, alternative splicing could be an endogenous mechanism to counteract cellular damage due to overactivation of excitatory NRs and may be associated with an impairment of necrotic mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|EAD {{injury is}} one of the leading causes of death in the industrialized world and is {{responsible}} for more than 50 % of the 100, 000 deaths from trauma in the United States each year. 18 Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of people live with long-term disabilities from head injury. The impact of secondary insults, particularly hypertension and hypoxia, on outcome after head injury has been described previously, but there has been little attention focused on deterioration following hospitaliza-tion. 4, 5, 9, 11 Stein, et al., 19 have shown that the patients who deteriorate neurologically have a far worse outcome com-pared with those who do not. In our study this subgroup of patients was selected for detailed analysis of the influence of different levels of ICP and CPP. In an attempt to im-prove outcome in patients with traumatic head injury, a re-newed emphasis has been placed on CPP. Some authors have even suggested that therapy directed at improving CPP is more important than that aimed at elevated ICP. 2, 3, 17 In the present manuscript we examine the relationship and relative importance of ICP and CPP in severely head injured patients by examining the higher risk group who manifest neurological deterioration following initial re-suscitation after admission to the hospital. Clinical Material and Methods Database for the Analysis This analysis was performed using prospectively col-lected data from the international trial of the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist <b>Selfotel</b> (CGS 19755). 14 The study was a randomized, double-blind, con-trolled trial involving more than 50 treatment centers i...|$|E
