40|$|A {{study of}} fully {{developed}} plane turbulent channel flow subject to spanwise system rotation through direct numerical simulations is presented. In order to study both {{the influence of}} the Reynolds number and spanwise rotation on channel flow, the Reynolds number Re = U_b h/ν is varied from a low 3000 to a moderate 31 600 and the rotation number Ro = 2 Ω h/U_b is varied from 0 to 2. 7, where U_b is the mean bulk velocity, h the channel half gap and Ω the system rotation rate. The mean streamwise velocity profile displays also at higher Re the characteristic linear part with a slope near to 2 Ω and a corresponding linear part in the profiles of the production and dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy appears. With increasing Ro a distinct unstable side with large spanwise and wall-normal Reynolds stresses and a <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> with much weaker turbulence develops in the channel. The flow starts to relaminarize on the <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> of the channel and persisting turbulent-laminar patterns appear at higher Re. If Ro is further increased the flow on the <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> becomes laminar-like while at yet higher Ro the whole flow relaminarizes, although the calm periods might be disrupted by repeating bursts of turbulence, as explained by Brethouwer (2016). The influence of the Reynolds number is considerable, in particular on the <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> of the channel where velocity fluctuations are stronger and the flow relaminarizes less quickly at higher Re. Visualizations and statistics show that at Ro= 0. 15 and 0. 45 large-scale structures and large counter rotating streamwise roll cells develop on the unstable side. These become less noticeable and eventually vanish when Ro raises, especially at higher Re. At high Ro, the largest energetic structures are larger at lower Re...|$|R

40|$|Summary. This Paper {{attempts}} {{to give some}} guidance on the question, of how best to approximate to an aircraft with an asymmetric elevator control {{for the purpose of}} flutter calculations. Two examples of asymmetric controls that are. common in practice are (1) the design case of a partitioned elevator each part having its own separate power unit and with one such unit having failed, and (2) the asymmetric arrangement of tabs on the elevator. Several instances of flutter involving asymmetric tab arrangements are known to have occurred in practice, but for the purpose of the calculations reported in this Paper the elevator itself is made asymmetric; this was done to reduce the work to manageable proportions. It is concluded that the more <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> of the aircraft can be replaced by a mirror image of the less <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> without serious error, at least for calculations of the type described. This appears to give a rather better approximation than taking the asymmetric aircraft and constraining it to vibrate in either symmetric or antisymmetric modes. 1. Introduction. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{deterministic}} system that operates {{in the vicinity}} of a Hopf bifurcation can be described by a single equation of a complex variable, called the normal form. Proximity to the bifurcation ensures that on the <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> of the bifurcation (i. e. on the <b>side</b> where a <b>stable</b> fixed point exists), the linear-response function of the system is peaked at the frequency that is characteristic of the oscillatory instability. Fluc-tuations, which are present in many systems, conceal the Hopf bifurcation and lead to noisy oscillations. Spontaneous hair bundle oscillations by sensory hair cells from the vertebrate ear provide an instructive example of such noisy oscillations. By starting from a simplified description of hair bundle motility based on two degrees of freedom, we discuss the interplay of nonlinearity and noise in the supercritical Hopf normal form. Specifically, we show here that the linear-response function obeys the same functional form as for the noiseless system on the <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> of the bifurcation but with effective, renormalized parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate in specific cases how to relate analytically the parameters of the normal form with added noise to effective parameters. The latter parameters can be measured experimentally in the power spectrum of spontaneous activity and linear-response function to external stimuli. In other cases, numerical solutions were used {{to determine the effects of}} noise and nonlinearities on these effective param-eters. Finally, we relate our results to experimentally observed spontaneous hair bundle oscillations and responses to periodic stimuli. PACS. 43. 64. Bt Models and theories of the auditory system – 82. 40.

50|$|The line of {{the former}} W&ER was closed to {{passengers}} on 10 September 1962, and Wrexham Central almost met a similar fate (it was listed for closure in the Beeching Report of 1963).

The lines {{continued}} through {{the back wall of}} the station and immediately crossed over Brook Street by way of a bowstring girder bridge with a 25.9-metre span. This extension eventually fell victim to Dr Beeching's Reshaping of Britain's Railways report.

40|$|A {{compressible}} {{finite volume}} formulation for large eddy simulation {{has been extended}} to solve a variety of flows by using dynamic subgrid-scale stress model and dynamic Prandtl number model. The basic features of this finite volume formulation include a dual time stepping approach with time derivative preconditioning, an implicit low-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel scheme, multiblock framework, and parallelization using message passing interface;Implementation of the dynamic model is validated by simulating a plane channel flow with constant heat flux. Good agreement between the present results and benchmark results in the literature is observed. Rotating channel flows with heat transfer are studied by adding a rotation source term. The effects of system rotation on the turbulent heat transfer are investigated. Finally, a rib-roughened channel flow is simulated both with and without heat transfer;The large eddy formulation with a dynamic model generally provided excellent agreement with direct numerical simulation results and experimental results for turbulent flows with heat transfer. For the constant heat flux channel flows, high heating tends to reduce the velocity fluctuations, while high cooling tends to enhance the fluctuations. The mean and fluctuation velocity profiles approach the incompressible results when normalized by local properties, as opposed to wall values. Spanwise system rotation is found to suppress turbulent velocity fluctuations and shear stresses near the <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> of the channel, but enhance the fluctuations and shear stresses near the unstable side. Turbulent temperature fluctuations and turbulent heat flux decreased near the <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> of the channel, but increased near the unstable side of the channel.

The curvature affected the wake growth and defect-decay rates, but in different ways for each of the two initial conditions. The effects of curvature were also apparent in the Reynolds stress results, especially in the primary shear stress distributions, which showed that the levels on the unstable side were increased significantly compared to those for a straight wake, while those on the <b>stable</b> <b>side</b> were decreased, with the effect stronger in the initially laminar wake...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the {{variation of the}} crystal structure of gold-seeded III-V nanowires with growth parameters, {{in order to gain}} a cohesive understanding of these effects. We investigate six III-V materials: GaAs, InAs, GaP, InP, GaSb and InSb, over a variation of growth conditions. All six of these materials exhibit a cubic zinc blende structure in bulk, but twin planes and stacking faults, as well as a hexagonal wurtzite structure, are commonly observed in nanowires. Parameters which may affect the crystal structure include growth temperature and pressure, precursor molar fraction and V/III ratio, nanowire diameter and surface density, and impurity atoms. We will focus on temperature, precursor molar fraction and V/III ratio. Our observations are compared to previous reports in the literature of the III-V nanowire crystal structure, and interpreted in terms of existing models.

The question is, at what threshold values of the dimensionless number do the unstable motions set in, and can these thresholds be predicted by a linear analysis of the stability of the laminar state as the threshold is approached from the <b>stable</b> <b>side.</b> In three cases linear stability analysis clearly seems to fail. These cases include Plane Poiseuille Flow, Plane Couette Flow, and Cylindrical Pipe Flow (Hagen-Poiseuille Flow).
