5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} (which suits {{a small number}} of applications better) allows for induction sealing to be used to apply a foil seal to a container without the need for a closure.

When the foil is in place, it is pressed down by the <b>seal</b> <b>head,</b> the induction cycle is activated and the seal is bonded to the container.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction Mask ventilation as an initial ventilation support is widely used for unconscious subjects either in an emergency or during induction of general anesthesia [1]. About 250, 000 cases of cardiac arrest annually occur outside of hospitals, and 370, 000 to 750, 000 cases occur in hospitals [2, 3]. The total number is close to one million emergency mask ventilations performed per year. In addition, about 21 million cases are performed under general anesthesia (GA) and the majority require mask ventilation during induction of GA [4]. Mask ventilation is nearly exclusively provided by using a full face mask [1]. Unfortunately, full face mask ventilation is difficult to master, and the skill is hard to retain without frequent re-enforcement [5, 6]. The rescuer has to ensure adequate mask <b>seal,</b> <b>head</b> placement, and lower jaw advance with one hand and perform bag ventilation with the other hand [7].

40|$|Lecturepg. 37 - 43 A {{compressor}} in {{a natural}} gas gathering service experienced multiple seal failures on the discharge end. Synthetic oil mist contained in the sealing gas {{was identified as a}} significant source of contamination that caused the seal failures. Since similar dry gas seals in other compressors at the same location were operating satisfactorily, a study of a particular compressor was undertaken. The seals were instrumented with thermocouples to monitor the temperature distribution across the seals. This paper discusses the findings of the study, resulting modifications of the dry gas seals, seal controls, and the compressor itself. This paper also outlines techniques that have been developed to mitigate the situation without having to shut the unit down. Also presented is a design approach to the sealing and seal monitoring in processes where liquid ingress into the sealing area may occur, including seal material selection, control system philosophy, <b>seal</b> <b>head,</b> and bearing cavity design...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA delayed-mode {{calibration}} procedure {{is presented to}} improve the quality of hydrographic data from CTD-Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDL) deployed on elephant seals. This procedure is applied on a dataset obtained with 10 CTD-SRDLs deployed at Kerguelen Islands in 2007. A comparison of CTD-SRDLs with a ship-based CTD system is first presented. A pressure-effect correction, linear with pressure, is deduced for both temperature and salinity measurements. An external field effect on the conductivity sensor is also detected, inducing an additional salinity offset. The salinity offset cannot be estimated directly from the ship-based CTD comparisons, because the attachment of the CTD-SRDL on the <b>seal</b> <b>head</b> modifies the magnitude of the external field effect. Two methods are proposed for estimating a posteriori the salinity offset. The first method uses the stable salinity maximum characterizing the Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW), sampled by seals foraging south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Where this approach is not possible, a statistical method of cross-comparison of CTD-SRDLs surface salinity measurements is used over the sluggish Northern Kerguelen Plateau. Accuracies are respectively estimated as +/- 0. 02 degrees C for temperature and +/- 0. 1 for derived salinity without corrections. The delayed-mode calibration significantly improves the CTD-SRDL data, improving accuracies to +/- 0. 01 degrees C and +/- 0. 03, respectively. A better salinity accuracy of +/- 0. 02 is achieved when the LCDW method can be used. For CTD-SRDLs where ship-based CTD comparisons are not available, the expected accuracy would be +/- 0. 02 degrees C for temperature and +/- 0. 04 for the derived salinity...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{temperature}} recorded during the induction sealing process within the headspace of a container. The topic for this thesis {{stemmed from a}} {{question of whether or not}} the product inside an induction sealed bottle has the potential of being adversely affected by heat generated during the induction sealing process on a packaging line during production. The thesis demonstrated the heat generated and temperature recorded utilizing irreversible chemical temperature indicating labels during the induction sealing process on a standard bottle packaging line with an aluminum foil liner/innerseal. Based on the results of this study, the following trends were observed: as the induction <b>seal</b> <b>head</b> height increased above the container/closure system, the temperature at the foil innerseal decreased and the distance from the top of the bottle finish down into the bottle headspace that a temperature could be measured decreased. As the packaging line speed increased, the temperature at the foil innerseal decreased and the distance measured from the top of the bottle finish down into the bottle headspace that a temperature could be measured decreased. As the diameter of the foil innerseal increased with the increase in closure diameter, the temperature at the foil innerseal increased and the distance measured from the top of the bottle finish down into the headspace that a temperature could be measured increased. In no case did the temperature at the product fill level of any of the tested container/closure systems exceed 100 F. Therefore it can be concluded that the induction sealing process does not introduce temperatures high enough that would adversely affect the contents of a container/closure system...|$|E

Then the lad Kjartan sprang forward, took up a large iron sledge-hammer and struck at the seal's head; it was a heavy blow, but it only shook its head, and looked round. Then Kjartan gave it stroke after stroke, and the seal went down as though he were driving in a stake.
