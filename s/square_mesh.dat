The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] present a novel strategy for minimizing the numerical dispersion error in edge discretizations of the time-domain electric vector wave equation on <b>square</b> <b>meshes</b> based on the mimetic finite difference (MFD) method. We compare this strategy, called M-adaptation, to two other discretizations, also based on <b>square</b> <b>meshes.</b> One is the lowest order Nédélec edge element discretization. The other is a modified quadrature approach (GY-adaptation) proposed by Guddati and Yue for the acoustic wave equation in two dimensions. All three discrete methods use the same edge-based degrees of freedom, while the temporal discretization is performed using the standard explicit Leapfrog scheme. To obtain efficient and explicit time stepping methods, the three schemes are further mass lumped. We perform a dispersion and stability analysis for the presented schemes and compare all three methods in terms of their stability regions and phase error. Our results indicate that the method produced by GY-adaptation and the Nédélec method are both second order accurate for numerical dispersion, but differ in the order of their numerical anisotropy (fourth order, versus second order, respectively). The result of M-adaptation is a discretization that is fourth order accurate for numerical dispersion as well as numerical anisotropy. Numerical simulations are provided that illustrate the theoretical results...|$|R

50|$|From 1913 to 1950 {{fisherman}} George Whittaker {{was employed}} at the Goldcliff Fishery, first by Mr Fennell {{and later by}} Mr Burge. Whittaker {{was to become a}} notable source of information about putcher fishing there. The Putchers at Goldcliff were traditionally open in weave, being constructed from hazel rods and withy saplings cut in the autumn from a 6 acre withy plantation at Llanwern. The baskets were made and repaired by the fishermen themselves during the closed season between August 14 and May 1. The wooden putcher was gradually superseded, from 1942, by galvanised steel wire baskets and then later by baskets of aluminium wire, both of which were more seawater resistant. After 1952 the baskets at Goldcliff and Porton were exclusively aluminium, although the traditional measurements were strictly adhered to by the modern manufacturers. The galvanised putchers with 3 in <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> were supplied flat and wired into shape by the fishermen. The aluminium putchers, with a diamond mesh, were supplied ready-formed, although at Goldcliff they were strengthened with additional wire bands. All-wire putchers were fixed to the wooden ranks by means of the two staples hammered into the wooden rails on the ranks.|$|E

Netting {{can also be used to}} make tutus for dancing costumes. Netting can also be referred to when considering the handmade craft. Using either the Lace-maker or the Net-maker method to tie the netting knot, you can create several types of netting. Diamond mesh netting goes back and forth, in rows. This technique is used for bags, hammocks, headbands and scarves. Another type is <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> netting which also goes back and forth in rows but is worked in the diagonal. This type of net is used for trawling.The first row starts at one corner and the last row finishes the corner diagonal to the first corner. This is often used as a foundation for lacis or net embroidery. Spiral netting is a type of netting that goes around and around in a similar manner to knitting or crochet. There’s no beginning or ending to specific rounds since the pattern is continuous and just keeps going.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for {{piecewise}} linear reconstruction and subsequent smoothing of a point sampled curve. The reconstruction step is based on the meshless parameterization reconstruction algorithm proposed by Floater. The information computed in the reconstruction step is used for a least squares based discrete smoothing method, with behavior comparable to a smoothing spline. We discuss smoothing under two different constraints: one based on the sum of squared deviations and the other based on a max-norm error. The smoothing algorithm is essentially a variation on the least <b>squares</b> <b>meshes</b> concept proposed by Sorkine et al. The reconstruction and smoothing steps are conceptually similar and provide a unified approach to the reconstruction of smooth curves in an arbitrary dimensional space...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a step toward {{understanding}} the algorithmic concomitants of modeling robots as mobile finite-state machines (FSMs, for short) that travel within <b>square</b> two-dimensional <b>meshes</b> (which abstract the floors of laboratories or factories or warehouses). We study the ability of FSMs to scalably perform a simple path-planning task called parking, within fixed <b>square</b> <b>meshes</b> of arbitrary sizes. This task: (1) has each FSM head for its nearest corner of the mesh and (2) has all FSMs within a corner organize into a maximally compact formation (one that minimizes a compactness-measuring potential function). The problem thus requires FSMs to know “where they are ” within a mesh, specifically which quadrant they reside in. Indeed, quadrant determination is the central technical issue in enabling FSMs to park. Many initial configurations of FSMs can park, including: (a) a single FSM situated initially along an edge of the mesh; (b) any assemblage of FSMs that begins with two designated adjacent FSMs. These configurations can park even without using (digital analogues of) pheromones, an algorithmic aid advocated by some who use FSMs to model ant-inspired robots. In contrast, a single FSM {{in the interior of}} (even a one-dimensional) mesh cannot park, even with the help of (volatile digital) pheromones...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the fish}} escape {{behaviour}} through bycatch reduction devices {{is the cornerstone}} of their application as technical conservation measures. To evaluate <b>square</b> <b>meshes</b> and sorting grids as successful size-selective bycatch reduction devices in finfish trawls, we conducted a simulated trawling experiment to assess the effects of illumination, towing speed and mesh or grid orientation on the escape behaviour of undersized fish through <b>square</b> <b>meshes</b> and rigid grids. Juvenile masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) with average body length 13 cm were used as the experimental fish. A speed-controllable motor was used to tow the framed net in a circular water tank. An infrared CCD (charge-coupled devices) camera fixed to the towed net by means of a rotary connector was used to observe fish behaviour. In contrast to the active escape seen under lighted conditions, there was no active voluntary escape under dark conditions. As a result, no fish escaped through parallel and backward-sloping meshes, and only 13 % of fish escaped through the forward-sloping meshes when the towing speed was increased. On the other hand, the encounter probability and passive escape through the longer openings in the backward-sloping grid increased under the dark condition, resulting in the highest escape ratio. This increased from 67 to 87 % on increasing the towing speed from 1 to 1. 5 knots, and shortened the swimming time before escaping from 5 to 1. 5 min (the highest escape ratio and the shortest swimming time before escaping under the dark condition). Frame-by-frame analysis of some escape events demonstrated easy, passive fish escape through the grids with no change in the normal swimming direction. The results support the backward-sloping grid as an efficient bycatch-reduction device, especially in demersal trawling when placed well ahead of the codend, working in the dark at high towing speeds...|$|R
