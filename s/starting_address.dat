25|$|Computers {{manufactured}} {{until the}} 1970s had front-panel switches for programming. The computer program {{was written on}} paper for reference. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also were manually input via paper tape or punched cards. After the medium was loaded, the <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> was set via switches and the execute button pressed.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of lower}} incomes and the {{domination}} of the Sinclair Spectrum in the UK, almost all British C64 software used cassette tapes. Few cassette C64 programs were released in the US after 1983, and in North America the diskette was the principal method of software distribution. The cartridge slot on the C64 was also mainly a feature used in the computer's first two years {{on the market and}} became rapidly obsolete once the price and reliability of 1541 drives improved. A handful of PAL region games used bank switched cartridges to get around the 16k memory limit. C64 cartridges normally map into $8000 and depending on the ROM size may extend up to $BFFF, in which case they displace the BASIC ROM. A special ID string is checked for on power-up; if found, the kernel will jump to the <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> specified in the ID string. A few early C64 cartridges released in 1982, used the so-called MAX Mode, a leftover feature of the failed MAX Machine. These cartridges map into $F000 rather than $8000 and displace the kernel ROM. If MAX Mode is used, the programmer will have to provide his own code for handling system interrupts. Disk and tape software normally load at the start of BASIC memory ($801) and use a small BASIC stub (e.g. 10 SYS(2064)) to jump {{to the start of the}} program. Although no Commodore 8-bit machine except the C128 can automatically boot from a floppy disk, some software intentionally overwrites certain BASIC vectors in the process of loading so that execution begins automatically rather than requiring the user to type RUN at the BASIC prompt following loading.|$|E

2500|$|To {{initiate}} a 64-bit transaction, the initiator drives the <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> on the AD bus and asserts REQ64# {{at the same}} time as FRAME#. [...] If the selected target can support a 64-bit transfer for this transaction, it replies by asserting ACK64# {{at the same time}} as DEVSEL#.

2500|$|Memory {{transactions}} between 64-bit devices may use all 64bits {{to double}} the data transfer rate. [...] Non-memory transactions (including configuration and I/O space accesses) may not use the 64-bit extension. [...] During a 64-bit burst, burst addressing works just as in a 32-bit transfer, but the address is incremented twice per data phase. [...] The <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> must be 64-bit aligned; i.e. AD2 must be 0. [...] The data corresponding to the intervening addresses (with AD2 = 1) is carried on {{the upper half of}} the AD bus.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{sequential}} burst mode, later {{words are}} accessed in increasing address order, wrapping {{back to the}} start of the block when the end is reached. So, for example, for a burst length of four, and a requested column address of five, the words would be accessed in the order 5-6-7-4. If the burst length were eight, the access order would be 5-6-7-0-1-2-3-4. This is done by adding a counter to the column address, and ignoring carries past the burst length. The interleaved burst mode computes the address using an exclusive or operation between the counter and the address. [...] Using the same <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> of five, a four-word burst would return words in the order 5-4-7-6. [...] An eight-word burst would be 5-4-7-6-1-0-3-2. [...] Although more confusing to humans, this can be easier to implement in hardware, and is preferred by Intel for its microprocessors.|$|E
