Third, professional identity does not only positively relate to knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>directly,</b> but also indirectly via community identification. Finally, professional identity also moderates the effect of moderatorship in that moderatorship exerts a stronger effect on knowledge sharing for those with weaker professional identity...|$|R

Notwithstanding {{the fact that a}} large part of development funding under soft loans and grants is channeled to the government, the CSOs receive a significant <b>share</b> <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> indirectly to implement development projects in communities.

What makes the civil society organisations different from the public sector organisations? Fundamentally two things; these are non-governmental and nonprofit. However, the real difference is in the way civil society organisations are managed.

The authorities wanted to deregulate the telecom sector in Norway, and sector by sector was deregulated between 1994 and 1998. An attempt to merge Telenor with its counterpart in Sweden, Telia, failed in 1999, while both still were owned by their respective governments. On December 4, 2000 the company was partially privatised and listed on Oslo Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.

Sirocco takes full advantage of SMP nodes by implementing inter-node <b>sharing</b> <b>directly</b> in hardware <b>and</b> overlapping computation with protocol execution. To maintain correct shared-memory semantics, however, SMP nodes require mechanisms to guarantee atomic coherence operations.

While SMPs typically charge higher price-premiums, for a given system size SMP nodes substantially reduce networking hardware requirement as compared to uniprocessor nodes. In this pape...|$|R
40|$|Within {{a global}} economy, export {{controls}} play {{a large role}} in the proliferation of high technology. A company operating in a country that operates under stricter export controls is at a serious disadvantage competing. This has been the case for commercial satellite manufacturers in the United States since 1999, when Congress redefined commercial satellites and all technologies associated with it from a dual-use export {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Department of Commerce to a munitions export that falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of State. Following this was a drastic drop in market share of United States commercial satellite manufacturers in comparison to European manufacturers which continued to define satellites as a dual-use technology. The hypothesis of the paper is “the major reason for this decline in market <b>share</b> is <b>directly,</b> <b>and</b> primarily, due to the fact that the U. S. sector is now operating under a stricter export regulatory environment than its competitors. ” As a secondary effect of this policy change is that U. S. companies are now losing their technical lead. To test this hypothesis, a cross tabular analysis is performed on a data set of all geosynchronous satellite contracts through September, 2006, a population of 982 contracts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{reports on}} the results of an {{empirical}} investigation of the factors that affect timely annual financial reporting practices by 95 non-financial, group companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. A descriptive analysis indicates that 92 % of the companies reported early (relative to the 161 -day regulatory deadline), 3 % reported on the 161 st day and 5 % reported late. A multivariate regression analysis suggests that large companies, service companies and companies audited by the former Big- 5 audit firms have shorter final reporting lead-time. Our tests provide strong empirical evidence to suggest, however, that companies in the construction sector, companies whose audit reports were qualified and companies that had a greater proportion of their equity <b>shares</b> <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> indirectly held by insiders do not promptly release their audited financial statements. No empirical evidence was found in support of the monitoring cost theory. Policy implications of the results for the regulatory agency of the stock market are suggested. ...|$|E

The use of evolvable fitness formulae lets us work in a dynamic fitness landscape, opposed to most work, that traditionally applies to static fitness landscapes, only.

In such systems, hosts perform access tasks (read and write) and management tasks (storage migration and {{reconstruction of data}} on failed devices.)

Concurrency control protocols that scale to large system sizes are {{required in order to}} coordinate on-line storage management and access tasks. In this paper, we identify the tasks that storage controllers must perform, and propose an approach which allows these tasks to be composed from basic operations—called base storage transactions (BSTs) —such that correctness requires only the serializability of the BSTs and not of the parent tasks. We present highly scalable distributed protocols which exploit storage technology trends and BST properties to achieve serializability while coming within a few percent of ideal performance. 1...|$|R
