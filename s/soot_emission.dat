The {{modified}} Hiroyasu soot {{model is}} widely {{used to describe the}} <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> from diesel engine, but diesel methanol dual fuel engine is different from diesel one. In order to obtain quantitative comparisons with experiments, a new <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> model was presented, which was formulated to incorporate the effects of both chemical kinetics and turbulent mixing. The model was applied to simulate <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> from diesel methanol dual fuel engine. The calculating results indicate that the predicted <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> from the new model agrees well with the measured data...|$|E

The effects of applied voltage, polarity and spacing of electrodes on <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> were investigated experimentally. The {{results showed that the}} shape of flame changed and the <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> decreased with increasing the applied voltage. The polarity of applied voltage influenced to the shape of flame and the <b>soot</b> <b>emission.</b> When positive voltage was applied to the nozzle electrode, the flame length became short and the width at the flame tip was spread. And, more than 90 % of <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> was suppressed at over 200 kV/m of the intensity of electric field. The surface temperature of flame increased with increasing the applied voltage. Thus, it was considered that the increase of flame surface temperature promoted the soot oxidation. When negative voltage was applied to the nozzle electrode, on the contrary, only the 70 % of <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> was suppressed, because the flame temperature was comparable to that for non-applied voltage...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that engine-out <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> can be reduced by using Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels, due to their lack of aromatics, compared to conventional Diesel fuels. In this investigation the engine-out emissions and fuel consumption parameters of an FT fuel derived from natural gas were compared to those of Swedish low sulfur diesel (MK 1) when used in Low Temperature Combustion mode in a single cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine. The effects of varying Needle Opening Pressure (NOP), Charge Air Pressure (CAP) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) according to an experimental design on the measured variables were also assessed. CAP and EGR {{were found to be}} the most significant factors for the combustion and emission parameters of both fuels. Increases in CAP resulted in lower <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> due to enhanced charge mixing, however NOx emissions rose as CAP increased. In contrast to the effects of CAP, as the EGR level rose from 0 % to around 50 % the <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> increased and the NOx emissions decreased. However, at approximately 50 % EGR the <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> started to decrease again because the soot formation zone was avoided since there was less available oxygen (and hence lower in-cylinder temperatures). The effects of increasing NOP were similar, but weaker, to those of increasing CAP. In contrast to previous studies, in which FT yielded lower <b>soot</b> <b>emissions,</b> it was observed in this study that FT fuel yielded higher <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> at high EGR levels (above 40 %) than MK 1. An AVL visioscope 1. 1 was installed in the test engine to measure instantaneous temperatures and soot concentrations in the cylinder during combustion. The results showed that the FT fuel yielded lower soot concentrations than MK 1 at low EGR levels...|$|R
40|$|This study {{includes}} engine {{tests with}} neat FAME fuels and blends of 7 % and 30 % of RME in European Diesel, EN 590 (non FAME added). The study was also completed with spray studies and numerical simulations for {{a deeper understanding}} of the engine results. The engine was operated at four operational points (A 25, B 50, B 75 and C 100) taken from the European Stationary Cycle, ESC cycle. The A 25 case was also extended to achieve information how the <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> varies with the operational parameters; start of injection (SOI), NOx level (regulated by EGR) and needle opening pressure (NOP). The spray studies were performed in a high temperature/high pressure spray chamber at relevant conditions. For the numerical simulations the KIVA 3 -V code was used with detailed chemical kinetics. The results shows that the neat FAME fuels lower the <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> by up to 90 % compared with Diesel fuel. Moreover, even low blend ratios lowers the <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> significantly. Among the FAME fuels, combustion with PME had the lowest amount of <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> due to its lowest amount of di-and tri-unsaturated fatty acids (i. e. less double bonds) in comparison with SME and RME. The NOx emissions were increased for the neat FAME fuels in relation the Diesel fuel. The increase in NOx emissions for the neat FAME fuels is due to the higher flame temperature for the FAME fuels which could be a result of the oxygen content which causes a lower equivalence ratio (phi), i. e. leaner local reacting mixture. The A 25 operational case showed that the most important factor to decrease <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> for Diesel fuel was NOP, while for the FAME fuels SOI had the greatest impact. Further, at constant level of NOx emissions for the included fuels it was observed that the FAME fuels still reduced the <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> significantly. The study shows that FAME fuels and Diesel blends with FAME fuels, can be a tool to meet future emission legislation, since low <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> levels can be reached for low NOx emissions and the fact that FAME fuels are renewable, the global warming impact is lower than for Diesel...|$|R

In a present paper, diesel knock intensity is defined as a sound pressure distributed over 1 - 1. 5 kHz, and the effect of EGR on the diesel knock intensity is examined. The diesel knock intensity is remarkably reduced by EGR under the same operating condition as <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> is reduced by EGR. By calculating the heat release rate based on the indicated pressure diagram, it was suggested that a reduction of knock intensity originates from the reduced reaction rate in the spontaneous ignition.

40|$|The vital {{issue of}} exhaust {{emissions}} during transient operation of diesel engines {{has been studied}} so far mainly on an experimental rather than simulation basis, owing to the very high computational times required {{for the analysis of}} each transient cycle. The study of transient emissions, however, is extremely important to manufacturers, since newly produced engines must meet the stringent regulations concerning exhaust emissions levels. In the present work, a comprehensive two-zone transient diesel combustion model is used for a preliminary evaluation of the effect of various parameters on nitric oxide (NO) and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> during transient operation after load changes. The parameters are divided into three categories according to the specific sub-system examined, i. e. engine, load and turbocharger. Demonstrative diagrams are provided for the development of NO and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> during the transient event, which depict the effect of each parameter considered. Moreover, the peculiarities of each case are discussed mainly in relation to turbocharger lag effects. For the current engine-load configuration, it is found that exhaust valve opening timing and cylinder wall insulation affect considerably NO and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions.</b> Additionally, load characteristics as well as turbocharger (T/C) mass moment of inertia play an important role on the development of transient NO and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A fivefold reduction of <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> from average levels of 5 x 10 14 - 10 15 (kgfuel) - 1 approximately halves the initial contrail visible optical depth.

Due to its amphiphilic character, this complex can be solubilized in non-polar fuels, thus generating cerium(IV) oxide particles, which efficiently catalyze the oxidation of diesel/biodiesel soot.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been major efforts to reduce engine {{emissions}} and fuel consumption. The studies described in this thesis were conducted {{with the aim of}} identifying methods for reducing harmful engine-out <b>emissions</b> of <b>soot</b> and nitrogen oxides (NOx) under high load without increasing fuel consumption. The first part of the project focused on low temperature combustion using very high levels of EGR. It was found that very low <b>soot</b> and NOx <b>emissions</b> could be achieved at low loads. Unfortunately, these conditions resulted in high fuel consumption as well as high emissions of HC and CO. The increased emissions could be mitigated by optimising the timing of the SOI and increasing the injection pressure, but the high fuel consumption remained problematic. Intermediate levels of EGR can be used to increase the ignition delay and thereby achieve partially premixed combustion. When <b>soot</b> and NOx <b>emissions</b> are plotted against the amount of EGR, there is an intersection point at which the <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> are just beginning to increase but the recirculated exhaust gas has greatly reduced the NOx emissions. At this point, the HC and CO emissions and the fuel consumption remain acceptably low. If the onset of the increased <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> could be shifted to a higher EGR level or if the peak <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> could be reduced in magnitude, the tradeoff between <b>soot</b> and NOx <b>emissions</b> at intermediate EGR levels could be improved. By increasing the charge air pressure, the size of the soot bump is reduced and the point of intersection between the soot and NOx curves is shifted to a higher EGR percentage. The soot-NOx tradeoff can also be improved by increasing the injection pressure to reduce the soot peak while using EGR levels that are high enough to suppress NOx formation. To further investigate the potential of partially premixed combustion, the effects of varying the timing of late inlet valve closure were investigated. The results show that reducing the effective compression ratio increased the ignition delay and thus increased premixing for both late and early intake valve closing (IVC). In the absence of EGR, this reduced NOx <b>emissions</b> without increasing <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> as long as the combustion phasing and equivalence ratio remained unchanged. When EGR was used, this approach reduced <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> while maintaining low NOx emissions. These emissions reductions were achieved without associated increases in unburned hydrocarbon emissions or fuel consumption...|$|R
40|$|When {{increasing}} EGR {{from low}} levels {{to a level}} that corresponds to low-temperature combustion, <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> initially increase due to lower soot oxidation before decreasing to almost zero due to very low soot formation. At the EGR level where <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> start to increase, the NOx emissions are low, but not sufficiently low to comply with future emission standards and at the EGR level where low-temperature combustion occurs CO and HC emissions are too high. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the possibilities for shifting the so-called soot bump (where soot levels are increased) to higher EGR levels, or to reduce the magnitude of the soot bump using very high injection pressures (up to 240 MPa) while reducing the NOx emissions using EGR. The possibility of reducing the CO and HC emissions at high EGR levels due to the increased mixing caused by higher injection pressure was also investigated and the flame was visualized using an endoscope at chosen EGR values. In addition, flame temperatures and soot volume fractions were determined using two-color pyrometry. A single-cylinder heavy-duty direct injection diesel engine equipped with an electronically controlled unit injector with variable needle opening pressure was used in the investigations, with geometry based on the Volvo D 12 C production engine but with the compression ratio reduced from 18. 5 to 14. The results from the studied cases showed that increasing EGR from 0 to 30 % reduces both soot formation and oxidation resulting in higher engine-out <b>soot</b> <b>emissions.</b> Also, an increase in NOP for a case without EGR was found to give both high soot formation and high soot oxidation, resulting in reduced engine-out <b>soot</b> <b>emissions.</b> When EGR was added, increased NOP resulted in increased soot oxidation and thus in lower engine-out <b>soot</b> <b>emissions.</b> An increase in NOP was also found to reduce HC and CO emissions at high EGR levels...|$|R

Biodiesel has been known as an attractive alternative fuel although biodiesel produced from edible oil is very expensive than conventional diesel. Therefore, the uses of biodiesel produced from non-edible oils are much better option. Currently Jatropha biodiesel (JBD) is receiving attention as an alternative fuel for diesel engine. Biodiesel is non-toxic, biodegradable, high lubricant ability, highly renewable, and its use therefore produces real reduction in petroleum consumption and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Although biodiesel has many advantages, but it still has several properties need to improve, such as lower calorific value, lower effective engine power, higher emission of nitrogen oxides (NOX) and greater sensitivity to low temperature. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is effective technique to reduce NOX emission from diesel engines because it enables lower flame temperature and oxygen concentration in the combustion chamber.

Pure soybean biodiesel was also run with high rates of EGR and modified injection schemes in order to achieve simultaneous reduction of NOx and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> consistent with low temperature combustion.

Starting from there, differences in heat release and soot formation can be explained, which lead to larger changes of <b>soot</b> <b>emission.</b> These observations show that a good knowledge of the interaction of gas and liquid phase is necessary to predict the occurrence of behavioral changes in the operating regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{diesel engines}} are energy efficient, but their {{particulate}} (soot) emissions are responsible of severe environmental and health problems. This review provides a survey on published information regarding diesel <b>soot</b> <b>emission,</b> its {{adverse effects on}} the human health, environment, vegetations, climate, etc. The legislations to limit diesel emissions and ways to minimize <b>soot</b> <b>emission</b> are also summarized. Soot particles are suspected {{to the development of}} cancer; cardiovascular and respiratory health effects; pollution of air, water, and soil; impact agriculture productivity, soiling of buildings; reductions in visibility; and global climate change. The review covers important recent developments on technologies for control of particulate matter (PM); diesel particulate filters (DPFs), summarizing new filter and catalyst materials and DPM measurement. DPF technology {{is in a state of}} optimization and cost reduction. New DPF regeneration strategies (active, passive and plasma-assisted regenerations) as well as the new learning on the fundamentals of soot/catalyst interaction are described. Recent developments in diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) are also summarized showing potential issues with advanced combustion strategies, important interactions on NO 2 formation, and new formulations for durability. Finally, systematic compilation of the concerned newer literature on catalytic oxidation of soot in a well conceivable tabular form is given. A total of 156 references are cited. Â© 2010 BCREC UNDIP.

40|$|The {{diesel engine}} offers good fuel economy and generates low carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, {{but it is}} also a source of undesirably high {{particulate}} matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which are subject to increasingly strict legislative limits because of their adverse effects on the environment and human health. Thus, in recent years, several combustion concepts have been developed to meet future legislation requirements, one of which is Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) using high levels of EGR (Exhaust Gas Recycling). In order to investigate the possibilities for using low temperature combustion to reduce undesirable emissions, investigations were performed using a single-cylinder research engine. The goal was to find a suitable combination of operational parameters at which both NOx and <b>soot</b> engine-out <b>emissions</b> are minimized, with a minimal fuel consumption penalty. When increasing EGR from low levels to levels corresponding to LTC, <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> first start to increase (due to reductions in soot oxidation), before decreasing to almost zero (due to very low rates of soot formation). At the EGR level where <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> start to increase, the NOx emissions are low, but not low enough to comply with future emission standards. However, <b>emissions</b> of both <b>soot</b> and NOx can be reduced to low levels with LTC obtained using high levels of EGR (approximately 60 %). Unfortunately, low temperature combustion is accompanied by increases in fuel consumption and emissions of hydrocarbons (HCs) and CO, but these drawbacks can be reduced by advancing the injection timing. The results also show that high charge air pressure, low EGR temperature and high injection pressure are important parameters for achieving low engine-out <b>emissions.</b> Very low <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> can be obtained at intermediate EGR levels without increased CO and HC emissions, but the NOx emissions remain too high and need to be further reduced in order to comply with future emission standards. Using high EGR levels, NOx and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> can meet future emission standards, but the fuel consumption penalty associated with the high CO and HC emissions needs to be reduced...|$|R
40|$|When multi-injection is {{implemented}} in diesel engine via high pressure common rail injection system, changed interval between injection pulses can induce variation of injection rate profile for sequential injection pulse, though other control parameters are the same. Variations of injection rate shape which influence the air-fuel mixing and combustion {{process will be}} important for designing injection strategy. In this research, CFD numerical simulations using KIVA- 3 V were conducted for examining the effects of injection rate shape on diesel combustion and emissions. After the model was validated by experimental results, five different shapes (including rectangle, slope, triangle, trapezoid, and wedge) of injection rate profiles were investigated. Modeling results demonstrate that injection rate shape can have obvious influence on heat release process and heat release traces which cause different combustion process and emissions. It is observed that the baseline, rectangle (flat), shape of injection rate can have better balance between NOx and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> than the other investigated shapes. As wedge shape brings about the lowest NOx emissions due to retarded heat release, it produces the highest <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> among the five shapes. Trapezoid shape has the lowest <b>soot</b> <b>emissions,</b> while its NOx is not the highest one. The highest NOx emissions were produced by triangle shape due to higher peak injection rate...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{engine is}} {{presently}} facing {{the challenge of}} controlling NOx and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> on transient cycles, to meet stricter emission norms and to control emissions during field operations. Development of a simulation tool for NOx and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> prediction on transient operating cycles {{has become the most}} important objective, which can significantly reduce the experimentation time and cost required for tuning these emissions. Hence, in this work, a 0 D comprehensive predictive model has been formulated with selection and coupling of appropriate combustion and emissions models to engine cycle models. Selected combustion and emissions models are further modified to improve their prediction accuracy in the full operating zone. Responses of the combustion and emissions models have been validated for load and âstart of injectionâ changes. Model predicted transient fuel consumption, air handling system parameters, and NOx and <b>soot</b> <b>emissions</b> are in good agreement with measured data on a turbocharged high power density common rail engine for the ânonroad transient cycleâ (NRTC). It can be concluded that 0 D models can be used for prediction of transient emissions on modern engines. How the formulated approach can also be extended to transient emissions prediction for other applications and fuels is also discussed...|$|R
