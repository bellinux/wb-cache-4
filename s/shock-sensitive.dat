5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a <b>shock-sensitive,</b> colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E

50|$|NMU is the {{traditional}} precursor in the synthesis of diazomethane. However, because it is unstable at temperatures beyond 20 °C and somewhat <b>shock-sensitive,</b> it has become obsolete for this purpose and replaced by other N-nitroso compounds: (N-methyl)nitrosamides and nitrosamines.

50|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} is explosive, {{although there}} is a lack of modern research into this behaviour. Room temperature mixtures with oxygen could not be detonated by an electric spark until they contained at least 23.5% Cl2O. which is an exceedingly high minimum explosive limit. There are conflicting reports of it exploding on exposure to strong light. Heating above 120°C, or a rapid rate of heating at lower temperatures also apparently lead to explosions.Liquid dichlorine monoxide has been reported to be <b>shock-sensitive.</b>|$|E

They were widely used for mounting <b>shock-sensitive</b> computer disk drives, particularly in equipment subject to vibration or jarring, but are not usually used with more robust modern drives.

5000|$|The {{percussion}} cap {{is a small}} cylinder of copper or brass with one closed end.

The {{percussion cap}} is placed over a hollow metal [...] "nipple" [...] at the rear end of the gun barrel.

Percussion caps were, and still are, made in small sizes for pistols and larger sizes for rifles and muskets.|$|E
5000|$|Shellite {{originated}} after World War I as {{a development}} of Lyddite (Picric acid). During the war, Lyddite-filled, armour-piercing shells {{had been found}} to be <b>shock-sensitive,</b> with a tendency to prematurely detonate upon impact rather than after penetrating the target's armour plate. Shellite was less sensitive, and also had the advantage of a low melting point, that allowed it to be easily melted and poured into shell casings during manufacture.The first trials of shellite took place in 1921, when the British monitor [...] experimentally fired different types of 15 inch shell at 500 yd, point-blank range against the surrendered German ship SMS Baden.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{explosives}} mechanics {{is based}} on the <b>shock-sensitive</b> rapid oxidation of carbon and hydrogen to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water in the form of steam. Nitrates typically provide the required oxygen to burn the carbon and hydrogen fuel. High explosives tend to have the oxygen, carbon and hydrogen contained in one organic molecule, and less sensitive explosives like ANFO are combinations of fuel (carbon and hydrogen fuel oil) and ammonium nitrate. A sensitizer such as powdered aluminum may be added to an explosive to increase the energy of the detonation. Once detonated, the nitrogen portion of the explosive formulation emerges as nitrogen gas and toxic nitric oxides.|$|E

5000|$|Fulminating gold is a {{light and}} <b>shock-sensitive</b> yellow to yellow-orange {{amorphous}} heterogeneous mixture of different polymeric compounds of predominantly gold (III), ammonia, and chlorine {{that can not be}} described by a chemical formula. It does not, contrary to the name, contain any fulminate ions. The closest answer to what fulminating gold is that it is the product of partial hydrolysis of ^3_{infinity}Au2(\mu-NH2)(\mu_3-NH)2Cl. Upon combustion, it produces a purple vapor. The complex has a square planar geometry with a low spin state. Generally, it is best to avoid accidentally creating this substance by mixing gold chloride or hydroxide salts with ammonia gas or ammonium salts, as it is prone to explosion with even the slightest touch.|$|E
50|$|Christmas crackers—also {{known as}} bon-bons—are part of Christmas {{celebrations}} {{primarily in the}} United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. A cracker consists of a segmented cardboard tube wrapped in a brightly decorated twist of paper with a prize in the central chamber, making it resemble an oversized sweet-wrapper. The cracker is pulled apart by two people, each holding an outer chamber, causing the cracker to split unevenly and leaving one person holding the central chamber and prize. The split {{is accompanied by a}} mild bang or snapping sound produced by the effect of friction on a <b>shock-sensitive,</b> chemically impregnated card strip (similar to that used in a cap gun). One chemical used for the friction strip is silver fulminate.|$|E

50|$|Cap guns {{get their}} {{name from the}} small discs of <b>shock-sensitive</b> {{explosive}} compounds (roughly 1.4 to 1.6 mm in diameter) that provide the noise and smoke, effectively {{the same as the}} Maynard tape primer and percussion caps used in real firearms of the mid to late 1800s but usually smaller and made from cheap plastic or paper. Some are arranged in plastic rings of eight or twelve. There are also single caps, roll caps (of 50 to 500), disk caps, and cap strips all of which are actually extremely small versions of percussion fireworks. Armstrong's mixture is often used today as the explosive, but previously the tiny powder charge was a simple mixture of potassium perchlorate, sulfur, and antimony sulfide sandwiched between two paper layers which hold in the gases long enough to give a sound report when the cap is struck.|$|E
50|$|The {{instability}} of NI3 and NI3 · NH3 {{can be attributed}} to the large steric strain caused by the three large iodine atoms being held in proximity to each other around the relatively tiny nitrogen atom. This results in a very low activation energy for its decomposition, a reaction made even more favorable due to the great stability of N2. Nitrogen triiodide has no practical commercial value due to its extreme shock sensitivity, making it impossible to store, transport, and utilize for controlled explosions. Whereas pure nitroglycerin is also greatly <b>shock-sensitive</b> (although not nearly as much so as nitrogen triiodide, which can be set off with the touch of a feather) and powerful, it was only due to phlegmatizers that its shock sensitivity was reduced and it became safer to handle and transport in the form of dynamite.|$|E
50|$|Soldered joints {{can fail}} {{in many ways}} like {{electromigration}} and formation of brittle intermetallic layers. Some failures show only at extreme joint temperatures, hindering troubleshooting. Thermal expansion mismatch between the printed circuit board material and its packaging strains the part-to-board bonds; while leaded parts can absorb the strain by bending, leadless parts rely on the solder to absorb stresses. Thermal cycling may lead to fatigue cracking of the solder joints, especially with elastic solders; various approaches are used to mitigate such incidents. Loose particles, like bonding wire and weld flash, can form in the device cavity and migrate inside the packaging, causing often intermittent and <b>shock-sensitive</b> shorts. Corrosion may cause buildup of oxides and other nonconductive products on the contact surfaces. When closed, these then show unacceptably high resistance; they may also migrate and cause shorts. Tin whiskers can form on tin-coated metals like the internal side of the packagings; loose whiskers then can cause intermittent short circuits inside the packaging. Cables, {{in addition to the}} methods described above, may fail by fraying and fire damage.|$|E
