500|$|Aurora {{finally left}} Hobart, Tasmania, on 24 December 1914. On 16 January 1915 the shore party landed at McMurdo Sound, where Mackintosh {{established}} a base camp at Captain Scott's old headquarters at Cape Evans. Believing that Shackleton might {{have already begun}} his march from the Weddell Sea, {{he was determined to}} begin depot-laying at once. [...] Joyce, the expedition's most seasoned Antarctic traveller—he had been with Scott's Discovery Expedition in 1901–04, and with the Nimrod Expedition—protested that the party needed time for acclimatisation and training, but was overruled. Joyce was shocked by the rebuff; he had expected that Mackintosh would defer to him on sledging matters: [...] "If I had Shacks here I would make him see my way of arguing", he wrote in his diary. The depot-laying journey which followed began with a series of mishaps. A blizzard delayed their <b>start,</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> sledge broke down after a few miles, and Mackintosh and his group lost their way on the sea ice between Cape Evans and Hut Point. Conditions on the Barrier were harsh for the untrained and inexperienced men. Many of the stores taken on to the Barrier were dumped on the ice to reduce loads and did not reach the depots. After Mackintosh insisted, over Joyce's urgent protests, on taking the dogs all the way to 80°S, all died on the journey. The men, frostbitten and exhausted, returned to the old Discovery expedition hut at Hut Point on 24 March, but were cut off from the ship and from their Cape Evans base by unsafe sea ice [...] and had to wait, idle, for nearly three months. After this experience, confidence in Mackintosh's leadership was low, and bickering rife.|$|E
6000|$|His {{generosity}} did {{not extend}} to living-quarters. Most of the students lived at the hangars and dined on Hamburg sandwiches, fried eggs, and Mexican enchiladas, served at a lunch-wagon anchored near the field. That lunch-wagon was their club. Here, squatted on high stools, treating one another to ginger-ale, they argued over torque and angles of incidence and monoplanes vs. biplanes. Except for two unpopular aristocrats who found boarding-houses in San Mateo, they slept in the hangars, in their overalls, sprawled on mattresses covered with horse-blankets. It was bed at eight-thirty. At four or five Carmeau would crawl out, scratch his beard, <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor,</b> and set every neighborhood dog howling. The students would gloomily clump over to the lunch-wagon for a ham-and-egg breakfast. The first flights began at dawn, if the day was clear. At eight, when the wind was coming up, they would {{be heard in the}} workshop, adjusting and readjusting, machining down bearings, testing wing strength, humming and laughing and busy; a life of gasoline and hammers and straining attempts to get balance exactly right; a happy life of good fellows and the achievements of machinery and preparation for daring the upper air; a life of very ordinary mechanics and of sheer romance! ...|$|E
60|$|The French, moreover, were virtual victors. Their {{team had}} {{finished}} solidly; {{they had been}} placed second and third and {{the driver of the}} winning German car was reported a Belgian. Each blue car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome as it topped {{the crest of the hill}} and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car. In one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of successful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost hilarious. They were Charles Segouin, the owner of the car; Andre Riviere, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named Villona and a neatly groomed young man named Doyle. Segouin was in good humour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he was about to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> establishment in Paris) and Riviere was in good humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment; these two young men (who were cousins) were also in good humour because of the success of the French cars. Villona was in good humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he was an optimist by nature. The fourth member of the party, however, was too excited to be genuinely happy.|$|E

2500|$|Moore machine: The FSM {{uses only}} entry actions, i.e., output depends {{only on the}} state. The {{advantage}} of the Moore model is a simplification of the behaviour. Consider an elevator door. The state machine recognizes two commands: [...] "command_open" [...] and [...] "command_close", which trigger state changes. The entry action (E:) in state [...] "Opening" [...] <b>starts</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> opening the door, the entry action in state [...] "Closing" [...] <b>starts</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> {{in the other direction}} closing the door. States [...] "Opened" [...] and [...] "Closed" [...] stop the motor when fully opened or closed. They signal to the outside world (e.g., to other state machines) the situation: [...] "door is open" [...] or [...] "door is closed".|$|R
50|$|Push starting, {{also known}} as bump starting, clutch starting, popping the clutch or crash <b>starting</b> is <b>a</b> method of <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle with <b>an</b> {{internal}} combustion engine by engaging the manual transmission whilst the vehicle is in motion. The technique is most commonly employed when other starting methods (automobile self starter, kick start, jump start etc.) are unavailable.|$|R
50|$|The {{starting}} torque must be low: The motor {{attached to the}} voltage controller is usually never started with high {{starting torque}} (or a loaded start); supplying a low voltage to a motor with a high load can heat up the motor and burn its windings (e.g. trying to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> which {{is attached to a}} stone crusher which is filled with stones).|$|E
50|$|In 1913, Royal Blue {{purchased}} {{its first}} motor charabanc, and motors rapidly replaced the horses. In 1919 the Elliott Brothers {{took advantage of}} a railway strike to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> coach service from Bournemouth to London. The service was so successful that the service was increased to twice a week during 1920 and twice daily during 1921. By 1926 Royal Blue was operating 72 coaches.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} proved troublesome {{from the}} <b>start.</b> <b>A</b> <b>motor</b> failed {{and ran away}} with a car in tow, before derailing wrecking at Pius Street near St. Michael's Church. At {{least one of the}} injured passengers suffered wounds which were initially considered possibly fatal. The line had not as yet been formally accepted from the Daft and Company firm which had been involved in its construction, and engineers from that company laid the incident at failure to lower the sprocket wheel to the rack system when the motor failed. Additionally, the route's terrain made its operation fragile: Snow was known to put it out of operation.|$|E
50|$|These {{may be an}} {{alternative}} where {{the issue at hand}} is <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor,</b> rather than polyphase power itself. The static phase converter is used to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> three-phase <b>motor.</b> The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less). Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so. (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a static converter will void any warranty.) An oversized static converter can remove the need to de-rate the <b>motor,</b> but at <b>an</b> increased cost.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982 the museum's founder, Peter Nelson, was {{approached}} {{for use of}} his MG TC in [...] "The Spoils of War" [...] television production. As a result, he formulated the idea of <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> museum with <b>a</b> focus on television and film-based vehicles. The Royal Oak Garage in central Keswick was purchased and refurbished to house the collection.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Fig. 4: A {{schematic}} {{depiction of}} rapid-chase theory. Primes and targets {{are engaged in}} a chase through the visuomotor system (from visual to motor areas). Because the prime signal has a head-start over the target signal, it is able to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> response assigned to it and to control this response {{for as long as the}} prime-target SOA allows. When the actual target signal then arrives in the motor system, it can follow through with the response already activated by the prime (in consistent trials) or has to reverse the response (in inconsistent trials). Rapid-chase theory assumes that primes and targets elicit feedforward cascades of neuronal activation traversing the visuomotor system in strict sequence, without mixture or overlap of prime and target signals. Therefore, the initial motor response to the prime must be independent of all stimulus aspects of the actual target.|$|E
50|$|Automation Master {{connects to}} the Control System/PLC and emulates the real world I/O by reading and writing the PLC's {{internal}} I/O images. The simulator can receive the Control System/PLC's outputs, and respond with the inputs in real time {{without the need for}} any hard-wired physical I/O.A simulator emulates the real time response to the Control System/PLC actions based upon a model which duplicates the operation of the automated system. For example, if the Control System/PLC sets a digital output to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> to raise a door, the model, within milliseconds, provides the Control System/PLC with an auxiliary contact closure to indicate that the motor has been started. Shortly, the door closed limit switch is turned off as the door begins to rise. As long as, the Control System/PLC keeps on the output signal which raises the door, the door in the model continues to rise. When the door is fully open, the model turns on the door open limit switch, and the PLC responds by turning off the motor which raised the door. The model sees the Control System/PLC turn off the motor and drops out the motor's auxiliary contact.|$|E

50|$|A modern {{gasoline}} engine contains an electronic ignition system which precisely times the electrical pulse to the spark plug. The advantage {{of such a}} device {{is that it can}} deliver a full power electrical pulse to the spark plugs even when the alternator is turning very slowly (as in push <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor).</b> The out-dated method of a mechanically timed ignition system is that is cannot deliver a full electrical pulse at very low engine revolutions per minute (RPM). This may affect the ease of push <b>starting</b> <b>an</b> engine to life.|$|R

5|$|In <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor,</b> <b>a</b> VFD {{initially}} applies a {{low frequency}} and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce <b>a</b> steady 150% <b>starting</b> torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|R
50|$|A {{magnetic}} starter is an electromagnetically operated switch {{which provides}} a safe method for <b>starting</b> <b>an</b> electric <b>motor</b> with <b>a</b> large load.

5000|$|Smooth Starting - [...] "ASDs provide soft <b>starting,</b> whereby <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> <b>starts</b> slowly then speeds up. This {{reduces the}} {{mechanical}} stress {{on both the}} motor and the equipment driven by the motor." [...] Variable Speed also provides an initial inrush current of 125-150%, making it the softest available starting method.|$|R
50|$|The main motive {{of using}} current {{limiting}} reactors {{is to reduce}} short-circuit currents so that circuit breakers with lower short circuit breaking capacity can be used.

40|$|Motors {{do not use}} energy when turned off. Reducing motor {{operating}} time by just 10 % usually saves more energy than replacing <b>a</b> standard efficiency <b>motor</b> with <b>a</b> premium efficiency <b>motor.</b> In fact, given that more than 97 % 1 {{of the life cycle}} cost of purchasing and operating <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> in <b>a</b> typical installation is energy related, turning <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> off 10 % of the time could reduce energy costs enough to purchase several new <b>motors.</b> However, <b>a</b> belief persists that stopping and starting motors is harmful. Many users believe that repeated motor starts will use more energy than constant operation, increase utility demand charges, and shorten motor life. While these opinions are not completely without basis, they do need to be put into proper perspective. During <b>starting,</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> accelerates and draws more power than when it is operating steadily at full load. While a typical National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Design B motor may draw from four to eight times the full-load current during starting, the power factor is low so the input power is not four to eight times the rated load power. Starting usually takes less than 2 seconds and rarely exceeds 10 seconds, even for large, high-inertia loads. Just one minute of additional running time consume...|$|R
