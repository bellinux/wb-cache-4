40|$|Rotating bending {{tests have}} been, up to now, {{typically}} {{used for the}} determination of S/N curves. In this paper, a method is proposed that allows {{the determination of the}} fatigue limit curve and the crack growth curve by means of such rotating bending tests. For this purpose, flaws of controlled shape and size are introduced on the surface of conventional round bar specimens. The rotating bending test rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement. The stress at incipient crack growth gives a point in the fatigue limit (Kitagawa-Takahashi) diagram. After the crack starts to grow, photomicrographs are taken in regular intervals in order to obtain the crack growth curve. – The fatigue limit and crack growth curves obtained from the rotating bending tests are compared with results from conventional single edge notch bending <b>specimens.</b> <b>Agreement</b> is good, with the results from the rotating bending experiments lying somewhat on the conservative side.

A total of 182 biopsy specimens, from 182 randomly selected patients undergoing gastroscopy with gastric mucosa biopsy, were analyzed. Specimens were first submitted to slide imprinting and then formalin fixed for further routine histopathology. One-hundred and fifty-five specimens proved adequate for definitive comparison of the methods used for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori was detected by histopathology in 51 specimens and by cytology in 54 <b>specimens.</b> <b>Agreement</b> between the findings obtained by the two methods was recorded in 130 of 155 (83. 1 %) specimens.

Gastric mucosa imprint cytology provides a useful method for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection. The method is advantageous for being fast, simple and inexpensive. When the sample is obtained exclusively for confirmation of the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection, cytology reduces the time and cost of the procedure, at the same time providing data on morphological changes of gastric mucosa. Every finding suspect of malignant transformation of the mucosa can also be verified by histopathology because imprint manipulation causes no damage to the sample...|$|R

As the fiber volume fraction (FVF) affects mechanical and chemical properties significantly, the spring-in angle is affected as well. Therefore, the numerical investigation accounts for the spring in angle and its thermal and chemical contributions depending on the FVF. Classical laminate theory (CLT) is utilized to homogenize layup expansion and shrinkage properties.

The current work presents a finite element (FE) analysis of the residual stress distribution in an eight-pass slot weld, conducted using a 316 L austenitic stainless steel plate with 308 L stainless steel filler metal. A thermal FE model is used to calibrate the transient thermal profile applied during the welding process. Time-resolved body heat flux data from this model is then used in a mechanical FE analysis to predict the resultant post-weld residual stress field. The mechanical analysis made use of the Lemaitre-Chaboche mixed isotropic-kinematic work-hardening model to accurately capture the constitutive response of the 316 L weldment during the simulated multi-pass weld process, which results in an applied cyclic thermo-mechanical loading.

40|$|A {{molecular}} genetic approach employing polymorphic DNA markers {{has been}} used to investigate the role of chromosomal aberrations in meningioma, {{one of the most common}} tumors of the human nervous system. Comparison of the alleles detected by DNA markers in tumor DNA versus DNA from normal tissue revealed chromosomal alterations present in primary surgical <b>specimens.</b> In <b>agreement</b> with cytogenetic studies of cultured meningiomas, the most frequent alteration detected was loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22. Forty of 51 patients were constitutionally heterozygous for at least one chromosome 22 DNA marker. Seventeen of the 40 constitutionally heterozygotic patients (43 %) displayed hemizygosity for the corresponding marker in their meningioma tumor tissues. Loss of heterozygosity was also detected at a significantly lower frequency for markers on several other autosomes. In view of the striking association between acoustic neuroma and meningioma in bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis and the discovery that acoustic neuromas display specific loss of genes on chromosome 22, we propose that a common mechanism involving chromosome 22 is operative in the development of both tumor types.

40|$|Tumors {{whose primary}} site is {{challenging}} to diagnose represent a considerable proportion of new cancer cases. We present validation study results for a gene expression-based diagnostic test (the Pathwork Tissue of Origin Test) that aids {{in determining the}} tissue of origin using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Microarray data files were generated for 462 metastatic, poorly differentiated, or undifferentiated FFPE tumor specimens, all of which had a reference diagnosis. The reference diagnoses were masked, and the microarray data files were analyzed using a 2000 -gene classification model. The algorithm quantifies the similarity between RNA expression patterns of the study specimens and the 15 tissues on the test panel. Among the 462 <b>specimens,</b> overall <b>agreement</b> with the reference diagnosis was 89 % (95 % CI, 85 % to 91 %). In addition to the positive test results (ie, rule-ins), an average of 12 tissues for each specimen could be ruled out with > 99 % probability. The large size of this study increases confidence in the test results. A multisite reproducibility study showed 89. 3 % concordance between laboratories. The Tissue of Origin Test makes the benefits of microarray-based gene expression tests for tumor diagnosis available for use with {{the most common type}} of histology specimen (ie, FFPE) ...|$|R
