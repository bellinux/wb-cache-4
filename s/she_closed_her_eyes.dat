She looked at us. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and she set sail.” Following her death, the marquee on the Apollo Theater read “A TRUE APOLLO LEGEND RUBY DEE 1922-2014".|$|E
2500|$|Case 1. A {{girl had}} 2 {{seizures}} in sleep at 6 years of age. In the first fit {{she was found}} vomiting vigorously, eyes turned to one side, pale, and unresponsive. Her condition remained unchanged for 3 hours before she developed generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. She gradually improved, and {{by the next morning}} was normal. The second seizure occurred 4 months later. She awoke and told her mother that she wanted to vomit, and then vomited. Within minutes her eyes turned to the right. Her mother, who was on her left, asked, [...] "Where am I?" [...] "There, there," [...] the child replied, indicating to the right. Ten minutes later <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and became unresponsive. Generalized convulsions occurred 1 hour from onset. Thereafter she recovered quickly. Her EEGs showed occipital paroxysms, but this normalized by the age of 10 years. [...] The patient had in childhood infrequent vasovagal syncopes and/or syncope-like epileptic seizures. [...] At last communication with her, she was 29 years of age and following a successful professional career.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in token {{that the}} brief {{audience}} was over.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> so that <b>she</b> may see {{the revelations}} more clearly. So does Ginevra.|$|R

50|$|Peter finally {{starts to}} walk, and Shari goes {{to visit her}} actual mother; when she gets tucked in, <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes...</b> forever.|$|R
60|$|It {{was of no}} use lecturing her again, for <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again, {{and went}} on talking incoherently to herself.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{ignoring}} his remark. They turned presently into a narrower thoroughfare. She leaned towards him.|$|E
50|$|Whenever <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> all Sanjana sees are {{a variety}} of ghosts staring at her in various states of blood and gore. When she awakens she can see them lying by her side.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes" [...] is {{a country}} ballad, in which the song's male narrator tells his lover {{that he wants to}} make <b>her</b> <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> in other words, feel sexual arousal to the point that <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to savor it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> faintly--she hears {{nothing but}} those words--feels nothing but his arm round her--forgets Mrs. Crayford's warning--forgets Richard Wardour himself--turns suddenly, with a loving woman's desperate {{disregard}} of everything but her love--nestles {{her head on}} his bosom, and answers him in that way, at last! ...|$|R
60|$|And {{throwing}} her neck back, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again. The sunlight streamed {{in on her}} between the half-drawn curtains.|$|E
60|$|A sudden {{illuminating}} {{flash of}} horror {{told her the}} truth. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and tried to run from the room.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as {{with the}} shudder of hearing such words. [...] "Not, surely, by any monstrous chance! Fancy dear, proud Theign------!" ...|$|E
50|$|A daydreamer, Georgie Allerton's {{imagination}} goes to {{work while}} she {{falls in love with}} her sister Miriam's husband-to-be, Jim Lucas. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and has a fantasy of what life with Ji would be like, ignoring the genuine attentions of Clark Redfield, an honest but poor newspaper reporter.|$|R
6000|$|MURRAY (concealing his doubt). Yes, {{of course}} you are. Only I'd a darn sight rather see you up and about. We could take a walk, then--through the woods. (A wince of pain shadows Eileen's face. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Murray {{continues}} softly, after a pause.) You haven't forgotten that last night--out there--Eileen? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> for a moment. When {{she looked}} at me again she was laughing.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as Billy's thumb-ends {{pressed into}} them. She {{could feel the}} fore-running ache of a dull and terrible hurt.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tightly. Gavin {{was in a}} quandary. I {{suppose he}} had looked at her eyes too long to know much about them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, stay, my {{only true}} love, stay," [...] The {{constant}} Marg'ret cry'd; Wan grew her cheeks, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] Stretched her soft limbs, and dy'd.|$|E
60|$|His arms quickly <b>closed</b> round <b>her,</b> <b>she</b> {{felt his}} hot breath against her cheek. For one moment did <b>she</b> <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> for <b>she</b> felt sick and faint, but the staunch valour {{of that same}} Dutch blood which had striven and fought and endured and conquered {{throughout}} the ages past gave her just that courage, just that presence of mind which she needed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{watching}} him keenly {{all the time}} with an interest which was certainly not diminished.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and laughed}} softly to herself, moving {{her head like}} a child, as though from sheer pleasure.|$|R
60|$|A little tremor {{seemed to}} pass through her whole frame. For a moment <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Then she sprang {{to her feet and}} stood quivering before him.|$|E
60|$|The {{twilight}} {{was falling}} slate-blue at the window. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> closed away the monotonous level of dead wonder, and opened them {{again to the}} every-day world.|$|E
60|$|Dora said no more, but {{sank down}} on the couch. Then an idea came to her mind, and lying back <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and pretended to go to sleep.|$|E
50|$|Five hours later, Twilight's {{army has}} the Slayers at gun point. Buffy wakes up {{where she was}} dropped, {{partially}} covered in snow, and sees the survivors of her defeated army being ushered into some transport vehicles. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to clear <b>her</b> mind, and when she opens them again she finds herself floating a long way above the ground. Somehow, Buffy has acquired the ability to fly.|$|R
50|$|As {{the woman}} reaches {{the bottom of}} the stairs, she looks {{straight}} into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that was displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. His coat tails are seen flying up the stairs.|$|R
60|$|Her lips trembled for a moment; <b>she</b> half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> An impulse of pain passed like a spasm {{across her}} tired features.|$|R
60|$|Having {{launched}} this dart, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{again with}} something more like content {{than she had}} yet shown: it had an aim of which she could always be sure.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and waited}} for the end. No slender shafts pierced her tender side. She raised her lids to see what stayed the hand of her executioners.|$|E
60|$|So she {{sat down}} {{in a corner of the}} coop, leaned her back against the slats, nodded at the {{friendly}} stars before <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and was asleep in half a minute.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The {{spell of}} summer {{was in the}} air, the spell of life was {{stirring}} slowly in her frozen blood.|$|R
60|$|The {{music of}} a Hungarian waltz came {{floating}} down to them. <b>She</b> half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>Her</b> head moved slowly with the melody. Tavernake looked away.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Get sentence? D'you mean this?' <b>She</b> half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{drew a deep}} breath, and shuddered. '"Notice" [...] I call it. Sir John {{thought it}} was all lies.' ...|$|R
