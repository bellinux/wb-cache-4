40|$|Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is an intraovarian {{regulator}} of follicular {{development in}} the rat, but it is uncertain how applicable this model is to other <b>species.</b> <b>Ovine</b> granulosa and luteal cells were cultured for 2 wk in defined medium to investigate the regulation of ovarian IGF-I synthesis. IGF-I was measured by RIA of concentrated media extract, and progesterone production was also assessed. In granulosa cell cultures from preovulatory follicles, IGF-I output was initially undetectable with the output rising from about Day 6, whereas midcycle luteal cells produced low concentrations of IGF-I throughout the culture period. In granulosa cells, insulin in the range 0. 1 - 10,g/ml stimulated a dose-dependent increase in output per day of IGF-I and also caused IGF-I production to start at an earlier time in culture, but a lower dosage (10 ng/ml) consistently increased progesterone synthesis. High dosages of estradiol (104 M) caused a small increase in IGF-I production whereas lower dosages had no effect. Growth hormone (GH) alone (10 ng/ml- 10 pg/ml) did not stimulate either progesterone or IGF-I output. In the presence of insulin, GH caused a marked increase in progesterone but {{had no effect on}} IGF-I. These results suggest that IGF-I is not a major product of granulosa cells in the ewe, although there is low luteal production. Furthermore they indicate that the actions of the metabolic hormones insulin and GH on ovarian progesterone synthesis are probably mediated directly through their own receptors rather than through either ovarian IGF-I synthesis or the type 1 IGF receptor...|$|E

40|$|AbstractStaphylococcus aureus is an {{important}} pathogen of many species, including sheep, and impacts on both human and animal health, animal welfare, and farm productivity. Here we present the widest global diversity study of ovine-associated S. aureus to date. We analysed 97 S. aureus isolates from sheep and sheep products from the UK, Turkey, France, Norway, Australia, Canada and the USA using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and spa typing. These were compared with 196 sheep isolates from Europe (n= 153), Africa (n= 28), South America (n= 14) and Australia (n= 1); 172 bovine, 68 caprine and 433 human S. aureus profiles. Overall there were 59 STs and 87 spa types in the 293 ovine isolates; in the 97 new ovine isolates there were 22 STs and 37 spa types, including three novel MLST alleles, four novel STs and eight novel spa types. Three main CCs (CC 133, CC 522 and CC 700) were detected in sheep and these contained 61 % of all isolates. Four spa types (t 002, t 1534, t 2678 and t 3576) contained 31 % of all isolates and were associated with CC 5, CC 522, CC 133 and CC 522 respectively. spa types were consistent with MLST CCs, only one spa type (t 1403) was present in multiple CCs. The three main ovine CCs have different but overlapping patterns of geographical dissemination that appear to match the location and timing of sheep domestication and selection for meat and wool production. CC 133, CC 522 and CC 700 remained ovine-associated following the inclusion of additional host <b>species.</b> <b>Ovine</b> isolates clustered separately from human and bovine isolates and those from sheep cheeses, but closely with caprine isolates.

Evaluation of the patterns of nucleotide variation associated with bovine PRNP exon 3 provided evidence that strong purifying selection has intensely constrained bovine exon 3 over the long-term evolutionary history of the subfamily Bovinae, as well as evidence for significant purifying selection in regions of bovine PRNP exon 3 that are considered to be of functional, structural, and pathogenic importance in other mammalian species. Evaluation of the frequencies of known indel polymorphisms within the putative bovine PRNP promoter for a panel of U. S. cattle sires revealed no significant differences in the distribution of promoter alleles and/or genotypes between U. S. cattle sires and BSEaffected German cattle. Notably, a nonsynonymous PRNP exon 3 polymorphism (T 50 C) identified in American bison (Bison bison) was tentatively associated with Brucella spp. seropositivity. Specifically, a significant overabundance (P = 0. 021) of Yellowstone National Park bison possessing the CC genotype were Brucella spp. seropositive. Furthermore, the T-allele and TT genotype were observed at significantly higher frequencies in three bison populations that were either founded from Brucella spp. seronegative stock or previously subjected to test-and-slaughter management to eradicate brucellosis...|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{catarrhal}} fever (MCF) is a lethal disease of ruminants and swine, characterized by vasculitis, necrosis, and accumulation of activated, dysregulated cytotoxic lymphocytes in various tissues. It {{is transmitted from}} so-called “reservoir” animal species to “indicator” animal <b>species.</b> <b>Ovine</b> gammaherpesvirus 2 (OvHV- 2) {{is one of several}} causative agents of MCF, circulating among all sheep breeds worldwide, which represent the “reservoir” of this virus. Natural infection of sheep proceeds without clinical symptoms. The disease is characterized by proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells, which form perivascular infiltrates of lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid organs, leading to necrosis and tissue destruction. However, {{little is known about the}} immunopathogenic pathways leading to disease. Moreover, at the time when this work was initiated, only limited data were available for the situation in sheep. Therefore, we first analyzed the cell populations targeted by the virus during natural infection of lambs, since the range of targeted cells may be important for the pathogenesis, especially if it is different in sheep and indicator animals, respectively. In most sheep we found a first peak of viral DNA in CD 4 + T-helpercells, followed by a second peak in CD 8 + cytotoxic T-cells. Both, CD 4 + as well as CD 8 + cells are also found to harbor viral DNA in lymphocytes of cattle with MCF. From this finding we suggest that rather a speciesspecific fine tuning of viral gene expression than the types of targeted cells may be accountable for the disease. The second question addressed in this work was whether production of viral particles leading to cell lysis is among the pathological factors of MCF. Diseases due to gammaherpesvirus infections are mostly associated to latent infection, during which only a limited number of viral proteins are expressed. These are important to tie the viral DNA to host chromosomes, ensuring synchronous replication of viral DNA with cellular DNA, to provide viral DNA to each daughter cell and likely render the host cell increased resistance against apoptosis. However, persistent infection with Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV- 8) as an exception is depending on a mixture of latently and lytically infected cells. To address whether this may be the case during MCF as well, we produced antisera against structural viral proteins and tested several tissue samples of experimentally infected rabbits therewith. We detected viral proteins in epithelial and M-cells of the appendix of infected animals. Interestingly, in situ hybridization revealed viral RNA in the infected epithelial cells but not in M-cells. These data suggest that active OvHV- 2 replication may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thirdly, we tested the gene expression patterns of OvHV- 2 and the relative abundances of host cell transcripts in lymphocytes of diseased cattle to identify pathways possibly involved in the pathogenesis of MCF. To this, host and virus gene expression patterns were analyzed by microarrray. Only two regions of the viral genome were found to be transcriptionally active, one encoding a latency-associated nuclear antigen, which can be found during latency of other gammaherpesviruses as well. The other with no predicted open reading frame, which may represent micro RNA (miRNA). So far miRNA was not discussed as a pathological factor of MCF and opens completely new attempts. As could be expected, a large number of host genes related to inflammation, lymphocyte activation, cell proliferation and apoptosis were found to be at different abundances compared to healthy animals. One of these transcripts with decreased expression was IL- 2. Since the phenotype of mice with IL- 2 deficiency perfectly matches the clinical signs of MCF, we assume that IL- 2 deficiency may play an important role in the development of disease...|$|E

Methodology: 4849 samples were evaluated with a methodology that combines a broad spectrum microbial test (Explorer) and a specific test for quinolones detection (Equinox). Supplementary tests were performed to achieve additional information about the nature of antimicrobials in positive samples. Results: In a first step, 355 samples (7. 3 %) showed a positive result in Explorer and/or Equinox tests. The highest incidence of positive samples was obtained in poultry (9. 7 %) while the lowest rate was found in porcine samples (3. 4 %). Half of the positive screening samples (53 %) showed also a positive result with supplementary tests indicating that tetracyclines, aminoglycosides sulphonamides and quinolones might be present in these samples.

Sarcocystis ovifelis, Sarcocystis ovicanis, and Sarcocystis arieticanis were detected as the responsible <b>species</b> for <b>ovine</b> sarcosporidiosis in Izmir province. Macrocysts of S. ovifelis were found in 24. 5 % (49 / 200) of sheep and the highest prevalence was detected in the oesophagus in all age groups. Microcysts of S. ovicanis and S. arieticanis were present in 86. 5 % (173 / 200) of sheep. The prevalence of Sarcocystis cysts increased significantly with the age. Although microcysts were detected in 46 % (23 / 50) of lambs up to 6 months of age, they were present in all muscle samples of sheep (150 / 150) over 6 months of age. Histologically, no inflammatory reaction was seen against sarcocysts within the infected muscles, unless they degenerated. There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) statistically between sensitivities of two diagnostic methods (digestion and histology) in detecting Sarcocystis species.

The virus has a triple layered protein shell consisting of a core, an inner capsid and an outer capsid. The inner capsid protein is responsible for group specificity and based on it rotaviruses are classified into seven groups. Ovine rotavirus strains have only been identified into two serogroups (A and B). The two outer capsid proteins (VP 7 and VP 4) are responsible for G and P typing of rotavirus, respectively. Although rotavirus has been frequently reported in many animal <b>species,</b> data regarding <b>ovine</b> rotavirus strains is very scanty and limited. Only a few ovine rotaviruses have been isolated and characterized so far. Recently, the G and P types circulating in ovines have been identified. The ovine rotavirus strain NT isolated from a diarrheic lamb in China is being considered as a promising vaccine candidate for human infants...|$|R
40|$|Paratuberculosis (PTBC) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammation}} of the intestines of ruminants {{but it can also}} strike other <b>species,</b> including primates. <b>Ovine</b> paratuberculosis lesions {{have been the subject of}} authoritative observations (Perez et al., 1996). The macroscopic picture shows a thickening and wrinkling of the intestinal mucous membrane, regional lymphangitis and lymphandenopathy, principally found in the terminal part of the ileum but also in the colon, jejunum and duodenum. Histomorphological pictures are characterised by chronic granulomatous enterocolitis, whose typical clinical symptom is the loss of weight due to profuse diarrhea. The etiological agent of PTBC is the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) (Marek, 1910); its presence gives rise to a persistent infection of the intestinal macrophages which appear foamy, in a small granuloma within the interfollicular-basal area of the Peyer’s plaques of the ileal tract. In some cases, even in the presence of marked lesions and clear, clinical symptomatology, coloration of the Ziehl-Nielsen (ZN) produces a negative result. DNA analysis of MAP has identified a peculiar insertion sequence, IS 900, present in 15 – 20 pairs per genome (Green et al., 1989) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Six 3 to 4 weeks old, cesarian-derived lambs were inoculated with ovine an {{adenovirus}} isolate 475 N. Inoculated lambs showed moderate {{clinical signs}} of respiratory distress, conjunctivitis, and loose feces during the 10 -day observation period. Virus was detected from nasal and conjunctival swabs starting on postinoculation day (PID) 2. Virus was {{detected in the}} feces in a inconsistent fashion. At necropsy, virus was present in the lung, tonsils, and bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes of lambs necropsied on PID 5 and 7.

Fecha de lectura: 11 - 01 - 2008 Barriers {{limiting}} prion transmission {{between two}} species are not absolutely defined. In one way, {{it is known}} that intra-species prion transmission is a highly efficient process, affecting 100 % individual with relative sort survival times, while inter-species prion transmission is a low efficient process accompanied with extended incubation periods. Moreover, it is demonstrated that inter-species transmission can give rise to the emergency of new characteristics in the generated prions. With regard to BSE, natural and experimental inter-species transmission to sheep and goat had been described, including genotypes traditionally considered as resistant, besides the subsequent intra-species transmission of the ovine BSE generated in sheep. As inter-species transmission can alter the biochemical and biological properties of prions the possibility of having circulating BSE in other species than cattle constitutes an animal and human health risk. In this work, we have deeply evaluated the changes in the BSE prion properties when transmitted to sheep. For that purpose, we performed a comparative study of the biochemical, biological and neuropathological properties of BSE before (cattle-BSE) and after propagation in sheep (sheep-BSE). For the biological characterization of these two prions we used transgenic mouse models expressing either bovine PrP (boPrP-Tg 110) or porcine PrP (poPrP-Tg 001). Results show that the BSE prion after crossing through the <b>ovine</b> <b>species</b> barriers maintains most of its biochemical and neuropathological characteristics which are different from Sheep-Scrapie prions. However, the comparative analysis of cattle-BSE and sheep-BSE prion transmission in the transgenic mice models showed an alteration in the biological characteristics of BSE after propagation in sheep. This alteration constitutes an increased virulence of the sheep-BSE prion in both transgenic models when compared to the original cattle-BSE prion. The high infectivity of sheep-BSE in the porcine transgenic model and the absence of many data about porcine species susceptibility to scrapie prions justified the study of the transmissibility of a panel of different Sheep-Scrapie strains into the poPrPTg 001 mice. Results show the inability of different classical scrapie isolates to infect the porcine model suggesting a high transmission barrier, if not total, to those ovine prion strains in pig. Meanwhile, the porcine model shows a high susceptibility to sheep- BSE prions and moderated to the atypical scrapie Sc- 152 (Nor 98 like) which reveal the risk of porcine <b>species</b> to <b>ovine</b> prion infection and its implication in animal and human health. In another hand, this results show the first inter-species transmission for an atypical scrapie prion. Finally, we try to overcome the practical handicaps of animal experimentation in this work by establishing neurosphere cultures from two lines of wild type mice (129 /ola and FVB), one line of mice over-expessing murine PrP (Tga 20) and mice knocked out for the Prnp gene (KO). Murine neurospheres inoculated during their differentiation have result susceptible to prion infection with the two murine strains tested. Independently of the line of mice origin of the neurospheres, those cells propagate the inoculated prions at detectable levels. Those results allow us to consider neurospheres inoculated during differentiation as a valuable model for prion replication and propagation...|$|R

40|$|Interest in silicon {{metabolism}} {{stems from}} the rather universal incorporation of silicon into cells, its intracellular transformations, its possible functions, {{and its role in}} siliceous urinary calculi in the bovine and <b>ovine</b> <b>species.</b> The metabolism of silicon in biological systems has been an object of intermittent investigation for some time. The possibility that silicon might even be a required element has been suggested by various workers. However, very little good evidence exists for an absolute silicon requirement in any but a few unique organisms. Lewin (1) has shown an obligate silicon requirement for the fresh water diatom, Navicula pelliculosa. Evidence in other cases is less conclusive. It was thought for a time that silicon might be required in certain enzyme systems. Crane and Glenn (2) showed that a silicomolybdate complex was very active in the reactivation of aldehyde oxidase from which the molybdenum had been removed by dialysis. However, the complex apparently was not present in the system in vivo (3). Other reports (4) implicated silicate as an agent increasing the activity of molybdate dependent enzymes. Keeler et al. (5) have, however, demonstrated no correlation between the metabolism of silicon ~...|$|R

40|$|Case Description-A {{four-year}} old Balami ram weighing 120 kg {{was presented}} to the University of Maiduguri Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UMVTH) with extensive swelling and ulceration of the nictating membrane of the left eye. Clinical Findings-A dark red hard mass on the third eyelid was covering the entire eyeball. The visible mass measured 5 cm vertically and 7 cm horizontally. Pus exudate was expressed from the nictating membrane. Full blood count revealed normal blood values. Treatment and Outcome-Treatment involved surgical removal of the hard mass by thermocautery under sedation and general anaesthesia. The ram was premedicated with Xylazine hydrochloride 0. 1 mg/kg IV. General anaesthesia was induced and maintained with Ketamine hydrochloride 5 mg/kg IV. Histopathological examination of samples showed numerous vascular spaces lined by multilayered neoplastic endothelia. Complete surgical excision was not curative due to recurrence. Clinical Relevance- Haemangiosarcoma are common tumors in dogs, cats, horses and swine and only few cases in <b>ovine</b> <b>species</b> were reported {{for the first time in}} the last decade. Eyelid tumours cause discomfort, interfere with eyelid function and may cause keratitis and Surgery remains the basic method of treatment in oncology...|$|R
