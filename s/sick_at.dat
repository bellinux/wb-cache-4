5|$|By early July, the <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> Kermanshah had {{recovered}} and rejoined the expedition. Camels and water bags were purchased, and the parties left Isfahan separately on 3 July 1915 {{for the journey}} through the desert, hoping to rendezvous at Tebbes, halfway to the Afghan border. Von Hentig's group travelled with twelve pack horses, twenty-four mules, and a camel caravan. Throughout the march, {{efforts were made to}} throw off the British and Russian patrols. False dispatches spread disinformation on the group's numbers, destination, and intention. To avoid the extreme daytime heat, they travelled by night. Food was found or bought by Persian messengers sent ahead of the party. These scouts also helped identify hostile villages and helped find water. The group crossed the Persian desert in forty nights. Dysentery and delirium plagued the party. Some Persian guides attempted to defect, and camel drivers had to be constantly vigilant for robbers. On 23 July, the group reached Tebbes– the first Europeans after Sven Hedin. They were soon followed by Niedermayer's party, which now included explorer Wilhelm Paschen and six Austrian and Hungarian soldiers who had escaped from Russian prisoner of war camps in Turkestan. The arrival was marked by a grand welcome by the town's mayor. However, the welcome meant the party had been spotted.|$|E

25|$|Casualties on {{both sides}} were heavy. The Japanese {{reported}} 25,000 overall losses, including 9,391 killed, from both the 5th Army and other units subordinate to the 1st Area Army that {{took part in the}} fighting. They also admitted the loss of 104 artillery pieces. In exchange, they claimed to have inflicted 7,000-10,000 Soviet casualties and destroyed 300-600 tanks. These claims may actually have been an underestimate: Soviet calculations place 1st Far Eastern Front's losses in the Manchurian campaign as 21,069, including 6,324 killed, captured, or missing and 14,745 wounded and <b>sick.</b> <b>At</b> least half of these were incurred during the fighting at Mutanchiang.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} a {{transfer}} pact was decided upon between Fine Gael and Labour, as both parties were normally preferred partners {{for each other}} in general elections. However the Fine Gael candidate felt shortchanged by this deal as the media {{was more interested in}} the Robinson campaign, and privately he did not like Robinson. Currie later remarked that Lenihan was his personal friend, and that he felt personally <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> being asked to endorse somebody he did not like, for the sake of beating Lenihan. The possibility of transfers increased Robinson's chances if only Lenihan could be further weakened.|$|E
25|$|Still unsupplied with {{sufficient}} arms, the 19th Arkansas was present, but not engaged, at the Battle of Pea Ridge, {{where it was}} detailed to guard the army's train.

The regiment was ravaged by disease during this period. Today, the graves {{of some of the}} soldiers of the 19th Arkansas can still be found in the Confederate Cemetery at Atoka, Oklahoma. Many other men were left behind <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> various places, and were never heard from again.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of December 29, Yigal Allon visited Nahum Sarig and the Negev Brigade staff at Bir Lahfan and ordered the forces to {{organize}} for the capture of al-Arish at midnight. He then flew to Tel Aviv to meet Yadin, who was <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> home, and tried {{to persuade him to}} authorize his plan to capture al-Arish and encircle the Egyptians in the Gaza corridor. However, he failed and ordered his troops to withhold the assault. A subsequent meeting with Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion in the morning of December 30 did not change matters. On the next day, the Israeli forces returned to Abu Ageila. The complete withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula lasted until January 2, 1949.|$|E
25|$|After a few years, Sahle Selassie {{felt his}} {{position}} secure {{enough that he}} proclaimed himself Negus, or king, of Shewa, Yifat, the Oromo and the Gurage peoples, without {{the authority of the}} Emperor of Ethiopia in Gondar, but with his apparent acquiescence. However, in 1829 Shewa suffered a famine, then for two years, starting in 1830, was stricken by a cholera epidemic, where two thirds of the <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> Sahle Selassie's palace died. Then one of Sahle Selassie's generals, Medoko, rebelled and convinced a number of the elite Shewan matchlockmen to desert with him to join the Oromos. Together these adversaries threatened the existence of Shewa, and burned Angolalla. About the time Sahle Selassie put down this rebellion in 1834 or 1835, a drought afflicted Shewa for two years, killing most of the domestic animals and bringing famine to his people. Pankhurst also documents records of a second cholera epidemic in 1834, which spread south from Welo causing a great mortality. Sahle Selassie responded to the famine by opening the royal storehouses to the needy, endearing himself to his people. The famine came to an end in time for Medoko to rise again in rebellion, and although the general was quickly crushed, Sahle Selassie was then confronted by a crisis in the local church.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{the disease}} was first {{observed}} in Haskell County, Kansas, in January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the U.S. Public Health Service's academic journal. On 4 March 1918, company cook Albert Gitchell reported <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> Fort Riley, Kansas. By noon on 11 March 1918, over 100 soldiers were in the hospital. Within days, 522 men at the camp had reported sick. By 11 March 1918, the virus had reached Queens, New York. [...] Failure to take preventative measures in March/April was later criticised.|$|E

Hoppus was <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> the time of recording. Despite this, the band carried on and the demo was complete within two days. [...] "Buddha was cut live then we added the vocals. Two days and they were done – including the mix. It's quite standard for a young punk band to do that," [...] said engineer Jeff Forrest. Despite this, the liner notes for the cassette claim it was recorded in twelve hours, while the later remaster of Buddha contend it was recorded [...] "over three rainy nights." [...] The trio were [...] "super stoked" [...] about a sound effects tape they found at the studio, and took time out to add in applause and laughter tracks because they deemed it humorous.|$|E
500|$|Brinkley began {{claiming}} his goat glands {{could also}} help male prostate problems, and expanded his business again. He also {{started a new}} radio segment called [...] "Medical Question Box", where he would read listeners' medical complaints over the air and suggest proprietary treatments. These treatments were only available at a network of pharmacies that {{were members of the}} [...] "Brinkley Pharmaceutical Association". These affiliated pharmacies sold Brinkley's over the counter medicines at highly inflated prices, sent a portion of their profit back to Brinkley and kept the rest. [...] It is estimated that this generated $14,000 in profit weekly for Brinkley, or about $ per year in current value. Reports of patients who took Brinkley's suggested treatments showing up <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> another doctor's office began to grow, and eventually Merck & Co. pharmaceuticals, whose medicines Brinkley routinely misprescribed, requested Fishbein take action; the AMA responded that they had no power over Brinkley, save to try to inform the public.|$|E
500|$|Holmes's {{academic}} {{interests and}} hobbies were divided among law, medicine, and writing. He {{was elected to}} the Hasty Pudding, where he served as Poet and Secretary, and to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. With two friends, he collaborated on a small book entitled Poetical Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Painting, which was a collection of satirical poems about the new art gallery in Boston. He was asked to provide an original work for his graduating class's commencement and wrote a [...] "light and sarcastic" [...] poem that met with great acclaim. Following graduation, Holmes intended to go into the legal profession, so he lived at home and studied at the Harvard Law School (named Dane School at the time). By January 1830, however, he was disenchanted with legal studies. [...] "I am <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> heart of this place and almost everything connected to it", he wrote. [...] "I know not what the temple of law may be to those who have entered it, but to me it seems very cold and cheerless about the threshold." ...|$|E

500|$|In Gorgona, Seacole briefly ran a woman-only hotel. In late 1852, she {{travelled}} home to Jamaica. The {{journey was}} delayed and difficult when she encountered racial discrimination {{while trying to}} book passage on an American ship. She was forced {{to wait for a}} later British boat. [...] In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of yellow fever. [...] She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe. Her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers and she saw many of them die. Although she wrote, [...] "I was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> Up-Park Camp," [...] she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went. She left her sister with some nurses at her house, went to the camp (about a mile, or 1.6km, from Kingston), [...] "and did my best, but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1st Light Horse Brigade {{was ordered}} to capture the nearest water in the Wadi el Hamman [...] north of Amman, to deny it to the {{retreating}} columns.

Aircraft guided the 1st Light Horse Brigade {{to the location of}} an Ottoman force on 27 September, which the aircraft then machine gunned. Subsequently the light horsemen captured 300 prisoners and two machine guns. By evening, they had captured the water at Wadi el Hamman, while one regiment occupied Kalaat ez Zerka. The next day the 1st Light Horse Regiment advanced to Qalat el Mafraq, [...] north north east of Amman. Here they captured several trains, one Red Crescent train full of wounded, along with 10 officers and 70 other ranks found <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> Kh es Samra. Woodward claims the Red Crescent train at Qalat el Mafraq had been looted and all the sick and wounded killed.|$|E
500|$|During the 1890s, Elgar {{gradually}} {{built up}} {{a reputation as a}} composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co. Other works of this decade included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was [...] "very <b>sick</b> <b>at</b> heart over music" [...] and hoped {{to find a way to}} succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: [...] "A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal recognition will come." ...|$|E
