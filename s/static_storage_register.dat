40|$|An on-chip bubble domain circuit organization. One or more <b>storage</b> <b>registers</b> are {{connected}} to a propagation path whereby data {{in the form of}} magnetic bubble domains (bubbles) may be transferred {{into and out of the}} <b>storage</b> <b>registers.</b> The propagation path includes a generator for producing the initial bubbles which are expanded into any desired number of new bubbles by a unique multiple output replicator. A unique input decoder is utilized to determine to which <b>storage</b> <b>register</b> the bubbles from the replicator will be directed along the propagation path. Those bubbles not selected may be annihilated. An output decoder utilizing essentially the same decoding scheme as the input decoder, selectively receives bubbles from the <b>storage</b> <b>register.</b> A transfer and replicate switch is utilized between the <b>storage</b> <b>register</b> and output decoder to selectively transfer bubbles to the output decoder. The output decoder may collapse all of the bubbles from certain <b>storage</b> <b>registers</b> so that only the information from the selected <b>storage</b> <b>register</b> reaches the detector. The detectors in turn produce the chip output signal. External control electronics are utilized to control the selective operation of the various devices utilized in the propagation path...|$|R

Additionally, objects declared with the <b>register</b> <b>storage</b> class may be given higher priority by the compiler for access to registers; although they may not actually be stored in registers, objects with this storage class may not be used with the address-of (&) unary operator. Objects with <b>static</b> <b>storage</b> persist for the program's entire duration. In this way, the same object can be accessed by a function across multiple calls. Objects with allocated storage duration are created and destroyed explicitly with malloc, free, and related functions.|$|R

Compared to baseline, livers preserved with the current <b>static</b> <b>storage</b> showed severe ultrastructural damage, glycogen depletion and an increased oxidative stress. Normobaric perfused livers showed improved hepatocyte ultrastructure and ameliorated glycogen stores, but they still suffered a significant oxidative damage. The addition of hyperbaric oxygen produces an extra benefit by improving oxidative injury and by inducing endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) gene expression. Conclusions. Preservation by means of the present innovative HHMP reduced the liver injury occurring after the current <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> by lowering glycogen depletion and oxidative damage.
