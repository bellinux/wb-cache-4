Lou Thomas from BBC Music commented that [...] "he consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine—the wonky 80s <b>shoulder-pad</b> pop of 'The Outsider' {{is nothing like}} anything else here, for example. But over 13 songs of Sparks-voice and many similar staccato piano riffs listeners may feel bludgeoned by Marina and her slightly overbearing presence", concluding that her eccentric vocals would polarise opinions. Sean O'Neal wrote on The A.V.

2500|$|Before the 2009–10 A-League season, in {{accordance}} with the name changing of the club from Queensland Roar to Brisbane Roar, the club's logo was also changed with [...] "Queensland" [...] being dropped to make way for [...] "Brisbane". On 20 May 2009, Reinaldo and Sergio van Dijk unveiled a new kit for the club, which would be worn for the next two seasons. The club stuck with the maroon and orange they had used for the last kit, but instead opted to drop the white slashes on the home kit. The orange used for the previous kit was brightened to the one used in season 1 of the A-League, with the design of both the new home and away kits changing. The slashes were dropped for a <b>shoulder-pad</b> style. The maroon shoulder pads would be displayed on an orange body, with maroon shorts. This was reversed on the away kit, with the shoulder-pads being orange on a white body with orange shorts.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Catucci of Rolling Stone {{dubbed the}} song [...] "saucy". Nicholas Fonseca of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] an [...] "angry-goth anthem". Brendan Butler of Cinema Blend called [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] the [...] "most-friendly radio [...] " [...] {{and noted that}} they could be the {{breakout}} hits from The Open Door {{due to the fact that}} they are the album's only two songs that [...] "don't excruciatingly wane after a minute". The Courier-Mails Jason Nahrung noted that the song was the album's most radio-friendly one and at the same time reminiscent of Lee's previous work with Moody, which according to him meant a use of [...] "heavy bass and drums, spotless and lavish production and Lee's unmistakable vocals". Writing for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield noted how Lee's vocals, which he described as [...] "over the top, in the mode of Eighties <b>shoulder-pad</b> belters like Pat Benatar or Heart's Ann Wilson", are fitting for a breakup song like [...] "Call Me When You're Sober". A writer for Canada.com concluded that Evanescence showed their [...] "staying power" [...] on the [...] "biting single". A Billboard journalist deemed the track's title to be [...] "wonderfully compelling" [...] and went on to describe the song as an [...] "anthemic grinder that musically tills familiar ground". The writer concluded the review, noting: [...] "Lee's vocal is other-worldly and the song's overall impact is strong; however, there's really nothing new going on".|$|E

6000|$|After {{this came}} the <b>shoulder-pad,</b> {{and then the}} thick dress itself was drawn on, and the attendants hitched it up with {{difficulty}} over his spreading shoulders, {{but they could not}} hitch up an idea along with it. The forcing of his hands through the tight india-rubber wrists of the sleeves was done with tremendous power, but it was nothing compared with the energy he put forth to force himself through his mental difficulty-- yet all in vain! The outside stockings and the canvas [...] "overalls" [...] followed, and he finally put on the red night-cap, which seemed to extinguish all capacity for thought.|$|E
60|$|Sexual Selection.--Inasmuch as peculiarities {{often appear}} under {{domestication}} in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, the same fact probably occurs under nature, and if so, natural selection {{will be able}} to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex, or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes, as is sometimes the case {88} with insects. And this leads me {{to say a few words}} on what I call Sexual Selection. This depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in many cases, victory depends not on general vigour, but on having special weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring. Sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage, length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, as well as the brutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks. How low in the scale of nature the law of battle descends, I know not; male alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons have been seen fighting all day long; male stag-beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males. The war is, perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though to them and to others, special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane to the lion, the <b>shoulder-pad</b> to the boar, and the hooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory, as the sword or spear.|$|E

6000|$|Leaving the ferry, wre {{mounted the}} [...] "tipoias," [...] which Englishmen call [...] "hammocks" [...] after the Caribs of Jamaica, and I found a strange {{contrast}} between the men of Kinsembo and of São Paulo. The former are admirable bearers, like their brethren of Ambrizette, famed as {{the cream of the}} coast: four of them carried us at the rate of at least six miles an hour; apparently they cannot go slowly, and they are untireable as black ants. Like the Bahian cadeira-men, they use <b>shoulder-pads,</b> and forked sticks to act as levers when shifting; the bamboo-pole has ivory pegs, to prevent the hammock-clews slipping, and the sensation is somewhat that of being tossed in a blanket.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} is over nine minutes long and begins where [...] "Paparazzi" [...] left off after Gaga {{was arrested for}} killing her boyfriend by {{poisoning}} his drink. Gaga is later taken to a women's prison, where she is led to her cell by two prison guards, who strip her of <b>shoulder-padded</b> dress and left lying naked, while she is mocked by the other women prison inmates. One of the guards comments: [...] "I told you she didn't have a dick", referring to the rumors that Gaga is intersex. For the video's first three minutes, it shows Gaga's activities in the prison—including kissing a lesbian prisoner (Heather Cassils) in the exercise yard, wearing sunglasses made out of half-smoked cigarettes, and watching catfights in the commissary. Gaga's sister, Natali Germanotta, makes a cameo in the commissary scene. After that, Gaga answers a call from Beyoncé, and begins to sing the song. She performs the first verse and chorus with other scantily clad inmates, followed by a bridge featuring Gaga wearing a yellow caution tape outfit designed by Brian Lichtenberg.|$|R
5000|$|Bree Hoskin {{writing for}} LGBT website Gaydar, {{included}} Morag {{on their list}} of [...] "Top Ten Soap Bitches". Describing her they stated: [...] "This statuesque woman in all her <b>shoulder-padded,</b> Amazonian-bodied, terracotta-haired glory had a lump of coal where her heart should have been." [...] They also said she has mellowed since finding love. They concluded they too would have felt bitter in her position, quipping [...] "her super-bitch demeanour was all down {{to the fact that}} her last love interest had been Donald Fisher." [...] Natalie Reilly of The Sun-Herald compiled a list of the five most [...] "twisted sisters" [...] on television and listed Morag as second. She added: [...] "Until his snivelling, villainous elder sister, Morag, turned up to wreak havoc, the genial patriarch of Summer Bay, Alf Stewart, was doing very well." [...] Reilly also included her in her list of [...] "television divas" [...] and said Frances was perfect to play [...] "Summer Bay's schemer, the judgmental Judge Bellingham". Greg Hassall of The Sydney Morning Herald said Morag's 2011 return was the latest in a trend of bringing back [...] "legacy characters" [...] such as Marilyn and Roo. Carena Crawford from All About Soap named her [...] "ballsy Bellingham" [...] the [...] "super solicitor".|$|R

5000|$|The next Ghost Rider, a {{young man}} named Daniel [...] "Danny" [...] Ketch (Johnny Blaze's long lost little brother), debuted in Ghost Rider vol. 3, #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly {{identical}} to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather biker jacket with spiked <b>shoulder-pads,</b> grey leather pants, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider and the demon with which he was bonded, Ketch and his demon—who in vol. 2, #91 (December 1997) is revealed to be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment—are cooperative with each other. At the close of the series with vol. 2, #93 (Feb. 1998), Ketch apparently died. The following year, however, Peter Parker: Spider-Man #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as Ghost Rider Finale (Jan. 2007), which reprints the last issue and the previously unpublished #94.|$|R
50|$|The {{breakthrough}} in manned space traveling {{was a special}} elastic suit, invented by the Russian Center for Aeronautical and Space Medicine in the late 1960‘s. The Soviet space scientists designed and developed a fully functional prototype of the dynamic correction clothing - called the “Penguin Suit”. By wearing this “Penguin Suit”, it provided deep compression force on the skin, muscle, and bone even in weightlessness. Thus the astronauts would not suffer {{from the effects of}} extended staying in a gravity-free environment. Also the scientists and the rehabilitation medicine team developed a set of intensive training program to restore and build up the astronauts’ physical and sensor-motor function. The construction of the Suit was rather simple - shoes, knee-pads, shorts and <b>shoulder-pads,</b> all connected between each other with elastic elements. The location of the elastic bands is similar to the position of antagonistic muscle pairs. Two main functions were achieved - an axial load of up to 40 kg and resistance for every movement made. In total, the device has quite well imitated the Earth gravitation force, not allowing the brain and body of the cosmonaut to degenerate in space. Before the Russian suit was copied by the Americans, the USSR had an advantage of its cosmonauts staying in space for months and returning to Earth in a better condition than the US astronauts.|$|R
6000|$|Such is the {{simplest}} version of {{the simplest}} story connected with the descent upon Dearsley. From the lips of the coolies I received it. Dearsley himself was in no condition to say anything, and Mulvaney preserved a massive silence, {{broken only by the}} occasional licking of the lips. He had seen a fight so gorgeous that even his power of speech was taken from him. I respected that reserve until, three days after the affair, I discovered in a disused stable in my quarters a palanquin of unchastened splendor--evidently in past days the litter of a queen. The pole whereby it swung between the shoulders of the bearers was rich with the painted papier-maché of Cashmere. The <b>shoulder-pads</b> were of yellow silk. The panels of the litter itself were ablaze with the loves of all the gods and goddesses of the Hindu Pantheon--lacquer on cedar. The cedar sliding doors were fitted with hasps of translucent Jaipur enamel and ran in grooves shod with silver. The cushions were of brocaded Delhi silk, and the curtains which once hid any glimpse of the beauty of the king's palace were stiff with gold. Closer investigation showed that the entire fabric was everywhere rubbed and discolored by time and wear; but even thus it was sufficiently gorgeous to deserve housing on the threshold of a royal zenana. I found no fault with it, except that it was in my stable. Then, trying to lift it by the silver-shod shoulder-pole, I laughed. The road from Dearsley's pay-shed to the cantonment was a narrow and uneven one, and, traversed by three very inexperienced palanquin-bearers, one of whom was sorely battered about the head, must have been a path of torment. Still I did not quite recognize the right of the three musketeers to turn me into a [...] "fence" [...] for stolen property.|$|R
