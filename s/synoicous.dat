5000|$|Monoicous {{plants are}} {{necessarily}} bisexual (or hermaphroditic), {{meaning that the}} same plant has both sexes. The exact arrangement of the antheridia and archegonia in monoicous plants varies. They may be borne on different shoots (autoicous or autoecious), on the same shoot but not together in a common structure (paroicous or paroecious), or together in a common [...] "inflorescence" [...] (<b>synoicous</b> or synoecious). Dioicous plants are unisexual, meaning that the same plant has only one sex. All four patterns (autoicous, paroicous, <b>synoicous</b> and dioicous) occur in species of the moss genus Bryum.|$|E
