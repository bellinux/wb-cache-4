40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{demonstrated}} the efficacy of <b>succimer</b> chelation in reducing blood and brain lead levels, the relative efficacy of the drug in the two tissues is less well understood. This issue is important because blood lead levels after chelation are used clinically to estimate reductions in the brain, the most critical organ in considering lead-induced neurotoxicity. The present {{study was designed to}} further investigate this issue, using multiple chelation regimens. Long-Evans rats were exposed to one of three lead exposure regimens from birth until postnatal day 40, followed by treatment with <b>succimer</b> (one or two 3 -week regimens) or vehicle. The results indicated that one <b>succimer</b> regimen was significantly superior to vehicle treatment in lowering lead levels in both blood and brain across the entire 8 -week follow-up period. Similarly, a second <b>succimer</b> regimen offered significant additional benefit relative to one regimen for both blood and brain across the 4 -week follow-up period. However, several findings revealed that succimer-induced reductions in brain lead lagged behind reductions in blood lead and were generally smaller in magnitude. Furthermore, a rebound was detected in blood, but not brain, lead levels after both <b>succimer</b> regimens. Given the results of this study, we urge caution in using blood lead as a surrogate for brain lead levels, particularly during and immediately after chelation treatment when reductions in blood lead levels overestimate reductions in brain lead levels. The present results suggest that, in clinical use, <b>succimer</b> treatment may need to extend beyond the point at which blood lead levels have dropped to an "acceptable" target value in order to effectively reduce brain lead levels and minimize neurotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Kinetic models could assist clinicians {{potentially}} {{in managing}} cases of lead poisoning. Several models exist that can simulate lead kinetics {{but none of}} them can predict the effect of chelation in lead poisoning. Our aim was to devise a model to predict the effect of <b>succimer</b> (dimercaptosuccinic acid; DMSA) chelation therapy on blood lead concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrated a two-compartment kinetic <b>succimer</b> model into an existing PBPK lead model and produced a Chelation Lead Therapy (CLT) model. The accuracy of the model's predictions was assessed by simulating clinical observations in patients poisoned by lead and treated with <b>succimer.</b> The CLT model calculates blood lead concentrations as the sum of the background exposure and the acute or chronic lead poisoning. The latter was due either to ingestion of traditional remedies or occupational exposure to lead-polluted ambient air. The exposure duration was known. The blood lead concentrations predicted by the CLT model were compared to the measured blood lead concentrations. RESULTS: Pre-chelation blood lead concentrations ranged between 99 and 150 [*]μg/dL. The model was able to simulate accurately the blood lead concentrations during and after <b>succimer</b> treatment. The pattern of urine lead excretion was successfully predicted in some patients, while poorly predicted in others. CONCLUSIONS: Our model is able to predict blood lead concentrations after <b>succimer</b> therapy, at least, in situations where the duration of lead exposure is known...|$|E

This concern is justified because the availability of Pb-safe housing during outpatient treatment with oral <b>succimer</b> is limited. We used a juvenile nonhuman primate model of moderate childhood Pb intoxication and a sensitive double stable Pb isotope tracer methodology to determine whether oral <b>succimer</b> chelation affects the GI absorption and wholebody retention of Pb.

In a randomized clinical trial of 780 children with blood lead concentrations of 20 – 44 µg/dL at 12 – 33 months of age, we compared the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the succimer-treated group and placebo group for up to 5 years of follow-up. We also analyzed the relation of blood lead to blood pressure. Children in the <b>succimer</b> group had lower blood lead concentrations for 9 – 10 months during and after treatment, but their blood pressure did not differ from those in the placebo group during this period. During 1 – 5 years of follow-up, children in the <b>succimer</b> group had systolic blood pressure 1. 09 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 27 – 1. 90) mmHg higher than did untreated children in a model with repeated measurements, but the difference in diastolic blood pressure was not statistically significant.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tactile defensiveness in {{children}} {{is associated with}} difficult social relations, emotional dysregulation, and inattention. However, there are no studies of lead exposure and tactile defensiveness {{in children}} or animals {{in spite of the}} fact that lead exposure is also associated with inattention and emotional dysregulation. OBJECTIVES: In this study we tested whether lead exposure induces tactile defensiveness in rhesus monkeys. METHODS: We tested 61 monkeys from a 3 (no lead, 1 -year lead, 2 -year lead) × 2 (<b>succimer</b> chelation or not) factorial experiment for tactile defensiveness at 4 years of age. Lead-treated monkeys had been orally administered lead in a daily milk solution from 8 days of life to either 1 or 2 years of age to produce blood lead levels of 35 – 40 mg/dL. <b>Succimer</b> chelation therapy or placebo was administered at 1 year of age. We measured tactile defensiveness using six repeated trials of each of three textures as a swipe to the cheek and neck. RESULTS: Lead-exposed monkeys showed higher negative responses to repeated tactile stimulation compared with controls. Blood lead during the first 3 months of life was positively correlated with the negative response on the tactile defensiveness test. There was an interaction of lead exposure × <b>succimer</b> chelation × trials, but it is not clear that <b>succimer</b> chelation was beneficial with respect to tactile defensiveness.

40|$|Mercury {{poisoning}} {{cases have}} been reported {{in many parts of the}} world, resulting in many deaths every year. Mercury compounds are classified in different chemical types such as elemental, inorganic and organic forms. Long term exposure to mercury compounds from different sources e. g. water, food, soil and air lead to toxic effects on cardiovascular, pulmonary, urinary, gastrointestinal, neurological systems and skin. Mercury level can be measured in plasma, urine, feces and hair samples. Urinary concentration is a good indicator of poisoning of elemental and inorganic mercury, but organic mercury (e. g. methyl mercury) can be detected easily in feces. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are a rapid, cheap and sensitive method for detection of thymine bound mercuric ions.

40|$|Meso- 2, 3 -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, or <b>succimer)</b> is an oral {{chelating}} agent for heavy-metal poisoning. While studying the urinary elimination of unaltered DMSA, altered DMSA (i. e., its mixed disulfides), and lead {{in children with}} lead poisoning, we observed a pattern of urinary drug elimination after meals suggestive of enterohepatic circulation. The excretion of lead in urine patterned the elimination of altered DMSA rather than the parent molecule. In addition, the half-life of elimination of DMSA via the kidney was positively associated with blood lead concentration. Two additional crossover studies of DMSA kinetics were conducted in normal adults to confirm the presence of enterohepatic circulation of DMSA after meals.

40|$|Abstract—The {{assumption}} of oxidative stress {{as a mechanism}} in lead toxicity suggests that antioxidants might {{play a role in}} the treatment of lead poisoning. The present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of lipoic acid (LA) in rebalancing the increased prooxidant/antioxidant ratio in lead-exposed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Fischer 344 rats. Furthermore, LA‘s ability to decrease lead levels in the blood and tissues of lead-treated rats was examined. LA administration resulted in a significant improvement in the thiol capacity of cells via increasing glutathione levels and reducing malondialdehyde levels in the lead-exposed cells and animals, indicating a strong antioxidant shift on lead-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, administration of LA after lead treatment significantly decreased catalase and red blood cell glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity. In vitro administration of LA to cultures of CHO cells significantly increased cell survival, that was inhibited by lead treatment in a concentrationdependent manner. Administration of LA was not effective in decreasing blood or tissue lead levels compared to a well-known chelator, <b>succimer,</b> that was able to reduce them to control levels. Hence, LA seems to be a good candidate for therapeutic intervention of lead poisoning, in combination with a chelator, rather than as a sole agent. © 199...|$|E
