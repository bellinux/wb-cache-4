40|$|The {{myth and}} panacea of vitamin B- 12 have {{attracted}} many {{scientists in the}} past century. Six Nobel Prizes have been awarded to the scientists who worked on vitamin B- 12 : George Hoyt Whip-ple, George Richards Minot, and William Parry Murphy were awarded the prize in 1934 for the discovery of vitamin B- 12; Robert B Woodward received it in 1965 for synthesis of vitamin B- 12; and Lord Todd and Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin were awarded in 1957 and 1964, respectively, for discovering the struc-ture of vitamin B- 12. The journey of vitamin B- 12 was started as a panacea for anemia, followed by a definite association with <b>sub-acute</b> <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration</b> and remarkable improvement with vi-tamin B- 12, and lately a controversial role of vitamin B- 12 in prevention of dementia and cardiovascular complications.

40|$|Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) {{deficiency}} associated neuropathy, originally called <b>sub-acute</b> <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration,</b> {{is particularly}} {{common in the}} elderly. The potential danger today is that with supplementation with folic acid of dietary staples such as flour, {{that the incidence of}} this disease could rise as folic acid, as opposed to natural folate (NsCH 3 HFGIu,), enters the cell and the metabolic cycle by a cobalamin independent pathway. This chapter briefly describes the clinical presentation of the disease, which unless treated will induce permanent CNS damage. The biochemical basis of the interrelationship between folate and cobalamin is the maintenance of two functions, nucleic acid synthesis and the methylation reactions. The latter is particularly important in the brain and relies especially on maintaining the concentration of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which, in turn, maintains the methylation reactions whose inhibition is con-sidered to cause cobalamin deficiency associated neuropathy. SAM mediated methylation reactions are inhibited by its product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). This occurs when cobalamin is deficient and, as a result, methionine synthase is inhibited causing a rise of both homocysteine and SAH. Other potential pathogenic processes related to the toxic effects of homocysteine are direct damage to the vascular endothelium and inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.

40|$|Background: Vitamin B 12 {{deficiency}} {{is often}} diagnosed with hematological manifestations of megaloblastic macro-cytic anemia, {{which is usually}} the initial presentation. Neurological symptoms are often considered to be late manifes-tations and usually occur after the onset of anemia. Sub acute <b>combined</b> cord <b>degeneration,</b> which is a rare cause of myelopathy is however the commonest neurological manifestation of vitamin B 12 deficiency. Case presentation: We present {{a case of a}} 66 year old Sinhalese Sri Lankan female, who is a strict vegetarian, pre-senting with one month’s history suggestive of <b>Sub-acute</b> <b>combined</b> cord <b>degeneration</b> in the absence of haema-tological manifestations of anaemia. Her Serum B 12 levels were significantly low, after which she was treated with hydroxycobalamine supplementation, showing marked clinical improvement of symptoms, with normalization of serum B 12 levels. Hence, the diagnosis of vitamin B 12 deficiency was confirmed retrospectively. Conclusion: Vitamin B 12 deficiency could rarely present with neurological manifestations in the absence of anaemia. Therefore a high index of suspicion is necessary for the early diagnosis and prompt treatment in order to reverse neurological manifestations, as the response to treatment is inversely proportionate to the severity and duration of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Subacute <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration</b> of {{the spinal}} cord is a rare cause of {{demyelination}} of the dorsal and lateral columns of {{the spinal cord}} and is a neurological complication of vitamin B 12 deficiency. Subacute <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration</b> without anemia or macrocytosis is rare. Case presentation We present a case of cobalamin deficiency in a 29 -year-old Moroccan woman who presented with subacute <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration</b> without evidence of anemia or macrocytosis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord demonstrated abnormal hyperintense signal changes on T 2 -weighted imaging of the posterior and lateral columns from the medulla oblongata to the thoracic spine. A diagnosis of subacute <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration</b> of the spinal cord was considered and confirmed by low serum cobalamin. The patient was treated with vitamin B 12 supplements and showed improvement in her clinical symptoms.

40|$|Background: Subacute <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration</b> is a {{clinical}} manifestation of vitamin B 12 deficiency, that we observe with unusual frequency. Aim. To report {{a series of}} eleven patients with subacute <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Patients and methods: Retrospective analysis of 11 patients hospitalized in a public hospital in Santiago, between March 2001 and February 2003. All bad a myelopathy of {{more than three weeks}} of evolution with serum vitamin B 12 levels of less than 200 pg/ml. Results: A risk factor was identified in 10 cases and the most common was an age over 60 years old. The main presenting symptom was the presence of paresthesias. On admission, sphincter dysfunction, posterior column and pyramidal syndromes coexisted in nine patients. A level of sensitive deficit was detected in six. Ten patients bad macrocytosis and eight were anemic. Serum vitamin B 12 was measured in ten and in nine, it was below 200 pg/ml. ne mean lapse between onset of symptoms and treatment was eight months. All received intramuscular vitamin B 12 in doses on 1, 000 to 10, 000 IU/day. Sphincter dysfunction and propioception were the first symptoms to improve.
