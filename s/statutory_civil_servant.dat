Three instruments were used to collect data: a preliminary questionnaire, an in-depth questionnaire, and an interview protocol. Findings reveal that a language and culture connection, opportunities to use the L 2, and a short-term intensive cultural and linguistic immersion experience in particular were all associated with more positive L 2 learning experiences. Negative comments regarding L 2 learning experiences revolved around the anxiety and stress surrounding the one-shot summative nature of the oral exam, and seemingly no link between instruction and evaluation. This research contributes to the growing literature on factors affecting the L 2 learning processes and outcomes. Furthermore, it may be beneficial for future candidates, language teachers, L 2 program planners and curriculum designers within the Public Service Commission (PSC) and similar contexts...|$|R
