40|$|Multiple cultivations {{lead to a}} {{repeated}} physical damage of the thistle. Each time it regrows, it uses further nutrients until it is weakened and a new crop will out-compete it. This method is also effective against other root-spreading weeds such as couch grass and bindweeds. •	After harvesting grains, perform stubble cultivation with a <b>skim</b> <b>plough</b> or a completely flat-cutting wing share cultivator {{at a depth of}} 7 - 10 cm. •	After the thistle plants have re-emerged (maximum 10 cm), repeat the cultivation 1 - 2 times while increasing the working depth. •	Sow a dense, fast-growing catch crop such as vetch or fodder radish after the stubble cultivation to further weaken the thistles. This method only works on dry soils and in dry weather; in wet conditions, it can lead to an increase in thistles...|$|E
40|$|The stubble {{cultivation}} {{cuts the}} dock roots below growth points. The vegetative plant parts are then {{cut off from}} the water and nutrient supply, and regrowth is inhibited. Practical recommendation •	Summer dock treatment is especially worthwhile in dry summers with catch crop cultivation and after early maturing crops (winter barley, whole-crop silage) or with an early tillage of grass-clover. •	After grass-clover lay or cereal harvest, undercut the dock plants at a depth of 12 - 15 cm with a <b>skim</b> <b>plough</b> (without skimmer) with a support wheel, a stubble cleaner or an overlapping flat cultivator. •	Bring the roots to the surface by passing over the field with a spring-tine harrow every 7 - 14 days. Additionally, apply a rotary harrow in heavy soils to expose the roots. •	After every round, collect roots manually or let them dry in suitable weather conditions. Only leave fully dead roots on the field. Information •	Plan deep-rooted crops and annual or perennial cover crops in the crop rotation {{in order to reduce the}} water and nutrient supply in deeper soil layers and thus impair the growth conditions for dock plants. •	After a short dock treatment sow a suitable catch crop as quickly as possible, and only leave the field fallow until autumn sowing of cereals, if you intend to perform a longer treatment. •	If the dock pressure is high, refrain from sowing 4 -year, slowly growing mixtures...|$|E
40|$|The video, {{recorded}} at a machinery demonstration in Courfaivre (JU, Switzerland) in summer 2013, presents four different <b>skim</b> <b>ploughs.</b> The event {{was organized by}} the Fondation Rurale interjurassienne (FRI, Switzerland). <b>Skim</b> <b>ploughs</b> are particularly suitable for superficial stubble cultivation. Unlike a normal plough with skimmers, the soil is not fully ploughed, but peeled or scraped with vertically positioned shares. Through a support wheel, the depth can be adjusted continuously. To protect the soil, 10 cm should not be exceeded. With a normal plough, the soil is usually turned {{at a depth of}} 15 to 30 cm and the stubbles and weeds are buried. With the stubble plough the weeds and stubbles are cut off and largely exposed to the sun...|$|R
40|$|In organic farming, {{reduced tillage}} is more {{demanding}} {{than in a}} system using herbicides. The less the soil is treated, the greater the risk of volunteering plants is; additionally, {{there are problems with}} grasses and perennial weeds. Stubble cultivation in summer {{is the only way to}} effectively regulate thistles, wild rye, bindweeds and dock plants. The prerequisite for success is to use the existing technology properly and to set up the tools correctly and use them at the appropriate time. At a machinery demonstration on the organic farm Neuhof in Birr, Switzerland, cultivators and <b>skim</b> <b>ploughs</b> were presented for stubble cultivation. If the focus was on the controlling of perennial weeds, the flat cultivator scored the best results. Fully undercutting and exposing the roots is possible in one go even with <b>skim</b> <b>ploughs.</b> However, finding the correct settings seems to be more difficult. With statements by Hansueli Dierauer, FiBL consultant, André Meier, organic farmer and Django Hegglin, organic farmer...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} we {{describe}} current {{information on the}} transfer of radiostrontium to milk, and critically evaluate available countermeasures to reduce radiostrontium contamination of milk. Levels of radiostrontium in milk respond rapidly {{to those in the}} diet. The transfer of radiostrontium to milk is determined by calcium intake and status. Under normal ranges of dietary calcium intakes the transfer of radiostrontium to milk is likely to be inversely proportional to that of the dietary calcium intake. Therefore, the usefulness of conventional transfer coefficients for radiostrontium is limited, and predictions could be misleading. A relationship was noted between calcium intake and radiostrontium transfer to milk, which might allow improved estimation of radiostrontium transfer to milk. The simplest and most effective countermeasure to reduce radiostrontium activity concentrations in milk is to provide dairy animals with uncontaminated feed, this has the added advantage of being effective for other radionuclides. If there is a limited supply of such feed preference should be given to dairy animals over animals reared for meat. If the affected area is very large or deposition occurs in late spring {{it will be difficult to}} supply uncontaminated fodder to large numbers of dairy cows and the use of alternative countermeasures needs to be considered. The most practical, simple method of producing fodder or pasture grass with sufficiently low radiostrontium levels would be to apply lime to contaminated soils. The effectiveness of liming will depend on the prevailing calcium status of the soil; since most UK agricultural soils are not deficient in calcium the effect of liming may not be high. On organic soils liming may increase plant uptake of radiostrontium, and therefore the effect for major organic soil categories would need to be checked before application. The application of organic matter may also be effective, but the concomitant effect on radiocaesium needs consideration. Removing or diluting the top layer of contaminated soil, either by surface <b>ploughing,</b> or preferably <b>skim</b> and burial <b>ploughing</b> should also be considered, although the latter would not currently be possible since such ploughs are not available in the UK. The use of additives given to ruminants to reduce radiostrontium in milk is an alternative countermeasure which should be considered, particularly if difficulties are encountered with supplying uncontaminated feedstuffs for dairy animals. Such countermeasures also have the advantage that they are rapidly effective, in contrast to many of the soil-based countermeasures. Furthermore, countermeasures based on additives are generally easy to administer to dairy animals, which are routinely handled twice daily, and potentially more cost-effective than soil-based treatments. Increasing the calcium intake by a factor of two should decrease radiostrontium levels in milk by a concomitant amount. However, relatively small increases in stable calcium intake are unlikely to achieve a substantial reduction. Other suggested additives to reduce the transfer of radiostrontium to milk are either of limited effectiveness (e. g. clay minerals) or need further investigation (e. g. calcium alginate) before they could be considered as a practically feasible alternative to calcium. The effectiveness of available countermeasures varies. Radiostrontium activity concentrations decline rapidly in milk when feeding uncontaminated feed, and the rates of loss are determined by the biological half-life of radiostrontium in ruminant milk. Soil treatment can give maximum reduction of ten fold, but a factor of two or three is more common. Feeding dairy cows enhanced levels of Ca will give maximum reduction factors of two to three. Potentially higher reduction factors could be achieved if selective, and appropriate Sr binders were available. A summary of potentially effective countermeasure options which could be adopted is given below...|$|R
40|$|Ploughing {{in winter}} field peas in spring {{provides}} 100 kg of nitrogen to the succeeding crop and increases yield. The improved {{development of the}} crop also leads to an improved weed control. Possible disadvantages are the growing costs and restrictions when cultivating peas as a main crop in the rotation. Position of green manure in the crop rotation •	After late crops like potatoes, sun flowers and field vegetables. After grains, green manure is possible after repeated stubble treatment against root weeds. •	Possible succeeding crops are maize, potatoes or field vegetables that require nitrogen (e. g. spinach). Not grain legumes. •	The earliest point for repeating the pea fertilization on the same field is after 6 years. In between this time frame, peas must not be cultivated as a main crop. Cultivation of winter field peas •	In case of soil compaction, primary soil tillage should be carried out. Seedbed preparation with a rotary harrow or a tined rotor. •	Ideal seeding period: Beginning of October to middle of November. Sowing depth: 3 - 5 cm. •	Quantity of seeds: End of September/beginning of October: about 1, 5 kg/a (100 seeds/m 2), middle to end of Octo-ber: 2 kg/a, frost seeding in winter: max. 4 kg/a Mulching •	Do not incorporate the peas too early as the N fixation of the peas does not start until April. •	Ideally, use with a mulcher mounted at the front end to ensure the shredding of all stems. •	After 1 - 3 days, mix dried-in green matter into the soil surface (10 cm deep) – on light and medium soils with a disk harrow or a flat cultivator, in heavy, smooth soils use a <b>skim</b> <b>plough.</b> •	In no-till farming of maize, compress the peas after blooming in May with a crimper- roller {{and allow them to}} dry. Precautions •	Green manuring is less suitable before sunflowers, flax and millet, as they do not require so much nitrogen and more than 60 kg N per ha from the winter peas could be lost. •	The seed quantity can vary depending to the weight of a thousand seeds of field peas. •	Before grain maize, the field peas often do not have enough time to properly develop. •	Cultivating carrots after a green manure with field peas is not recommended due to the increased risk of spread of sooty mould (Chalara) and carrots cannot fully utilise the available nitrogen...|$|E
