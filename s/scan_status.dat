40|$|Carcinoma of the {{prostate}} has historically {{been associated with the}} bleeding diathesis which accompanies disseminated intravascular coagulation. We have performed a prospective study into the prevalence of coagulopathy in patients with untreated prostate cancer using matched patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) as controls. Haemostatic activation was assessed by measuring fibrinopeptide A (FpA) by an ELISA and D-dimer by a latex agglutination assay. FpA and D-dimer levels were correlated with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and bone <b>scan</b> <b>status.</b> Of the cancer patients, 40 % had elevated FpA, levels being higher in those with bone scan positive disease (P < 0. 05). D-dimer was detectable in 24 % of those with prostate cancer but in none with BPH. Neither FpA nor D-dimer were related to serum PSA but D-dimer appeared to be a predictor of bone <b>scan</b> <b>status</b> with a positive predictive value of 91 %. It is concluded that changes compatible with subclinical DIC are common in patients presenting with prostate cancer and that measurement of FpA and D-dimer may have roles as tumour markers in this disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} (SNS) regulates energy expenditure (EE), fat utilisation and protein anabolism subsequently influencing body composition and function. In rodents, brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays {{a pivotal role in}} adaptive thermogenesis under SNS regulation. Little is known about the biology of BAT in adult humans. This thesis investigates the metabolic sequelae of pharmacological inhibition and activation of the SNS in humans, and evaluates the prevalence and cellular characteristics of human BAT. Whole body EE and substrate utilisation were assessed by indirect calorimetry and protein metabolism using the leucine turnover technique. Habitual activity was quantified by pedometry. Studies on BAT combined metabolic imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) -CT and molecular and histological techniques for gene and protein expression. Cross-sectional studies in three clinical settings revealed individuals taking beta-blocker chronically to be heavier than controls. Mechanistic evaluation revealed blunting of EE, fat utilisation and habitual activity in beta-blocker-treated individuals. In contrast, treatment with a highly beta 2 -selective agonist, formoterol, increased EE, fat utilisation and protein anabolism without inducing tachycardia in healthy adults. Systematic evaluation of PET-CT in nearly 3000 individuals revealed an estimated prevalence of BAT of 64 % in adults. BAT was most commonly located in the supraclavicular fossa. Presence of BAT was associated with lower body mass index. Direct histological and molecular analysis of supraclavicular fat biopsies revealed presence of BAT in all patients studied, regardless of PET <b>scan</b> <b>status.</b> Primary culture of brown adipocytes from the supraclavicular fossa was established successfully for the first time. In summary, chronic beta-blocker therapy blunts EE and causes weight gain while formoterol stimulates EE, fat utilisation and protein anabolism. BAT is highly prevalent in adult humans and its presence correlates with leanness. In conclusion, pharmacological inhibition and stimulation of the SNS have profound impact on energy balance. Beta-blockers cause obesity and formoterol imparts beneficial metabolic effects and may be useful in the treatment of obesity and sarcopaenia. Contrary to current belief, BAT is present in most adult humans and may regulate energy homeostasis in adulthood. The availability of a primary culture model allows BAT regulation to be studied in vitro to harness its metabolic properties for potential anti-obesity therapeutics development...|$|E

The design was a retrospective chart review. The setting was a tertiary pediatric critical care unit. Patients included 161 consecutive admissions to the critical care unit at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, with status epilepti-cus over a 3 -year period. There were no interventions. The overall mortality was 5. 6 %. A further 11 % experienced an adverse neurological outcome as determined on hospital discharge. Mean seizure duration was 1. 5 ± 2. 8 hours in those children with a normal outcome, 1. 7 ± 1. 2 hours in those survivors with an abnormal neurological outcome (P> 0. 05), and 6. 8 ± 12 hours in those who died (P < 0. 05). The CT scan was abnormal in 41 % of cases. New findings that directly affected immediate management decisions were found in 20 % of CT scans. Both the duration and eti-ology of status epilepticus affect the outcome. CT scanning should be done without delay, once the patient is stable. Antiviral therapy should be started empirically now that encephalitis is far more common than bacterial meningi-tis in this group of patients.

40|$|Background:] Neuro-endocrine tumours (NET) {{are rare}} and {{generally}} indolent tumours. For diagnostic purpose, {{the sensitivity of}} FDG-PET scan {{is known to be}} low in this setting. Though, when positive, its prognostic value is not well defined in NET. Aim: To assess the value of FDG-PET on the prognosis of patients diagnosed with neuro-endocrine tumours, treated and followed-up in one centre (Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium). [Methods:] A retrospective analysis of all NET patients that benefited of a FDG-PET scan and Octreoscan during their diagnostic work-up was made. Data regarding origin of the tumour, pathology characteristics (Ki 67 proliferation index) were analyzed according to FDG-PET positive or negative status. From 1999 until 12 / 2009, 46 patients (30 males), 55 ± 15 years, had one FDG-PET scan; 43 / 46 had also an Octreoscan. They consisted of 26 pancreatic tumours, 9 midgut tumours, 2 duodenum, 2 main biliary tract, one lung, one stomach, one liver and 3 unknown primary NET. We looked at overall survival (OS) and time-to-therapeutic failure (TTF), which we defined as radiologic progression leading to a change in therapy. Survival and TTF curves were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the Log-Rank test. A p value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: FDG-PET was positive in 26 / 46 (59 %) and Octreoscan in 33 / 43 (77 %). Rates of positive PET scans were comparable formidgut (57 %) and pancreatic tumours (64 %). After a median follow-up of 31, 5 months (3 - 108 months), median OS of patients with negative FDG-PET was not reached whereas survival of patients with positive FDG-PET scans was 72 months; the difference was not statistically different (p= 0. 13). However, we could show an important and statistically significant difference in TTF: 19 months vs 88 months for patients with positive and negative FDG-PET respectively (p= 0. 014). Patients with positive FDG-PET had tumours with significantly higher proliferation rates, assessed by Ki 67 values found at histology, compared to negative FDG-PET patients: 28 ± 6 % vs 7 ± 1 % (mean±SE, p= 0. 007). Patients with positive Octreoscan had a mean Ki 67 of 26 ± 10 % vs 17 ± 5 % for Octreoscan negative patients (NS). No association was found between presence/absence of functional symptoms, metastatic status at diagnosis or origin of the primary tumour and FDG-PET <b>scan</b> <b>status.</b> [Conclusion:] In this retrospective series, we found a significant correlation between FDG-PET scan positivity and shorter TTF of NET patients. This was independent from metastatic status or primary tumour origin. Patients with positive FDG-PET scans had significantly more aggressive tumours as assessed by Ki 67. These results suggest that FDG-PET could eventually be used to guide therapy when histology and Ki 67 value cannot be obtained, and orientate clinicians to a more close follow-up after curative treatment. These results warrant confirmation in a prospective setting to further strengthen the value of FDG-PET in NET...|$|E
40|$|Aim : To {{study the}} long term benefits, {{toxicity}} and survival rate in patients with neuroendocrine tumors receiving multiple cycles of high activity In- 111 Pentetreotide therapy. Moreover, our secondary aim was to evaluate the value of F- 18 FDG PET-CT scan as prognostic indicator in this group of patients. Background : Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of malignancies which are usually metastatic at diagnosis. Standard chemotherapy in these patients is associated with appreciable adverse events and low effectiveness. Since 1990 s, Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radio-labeled somatostatin analogues has been introduced as a new method of treatment in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors expressing high levels of Somatostatin receptors. Methods : 112 patients with progressive disseminated and unresectable neuroendocrine tumor (stage III and stage IV) were enrolled in a non-randomized trial in an out-patient setting. High activity In- 111 Pentetreotide (500 mCi (18. 5 GBq) per cycle) was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours and repeated therapy cycles every 9 - 12 weeks in eligible patients up to maximum of 4 cycles. Response to therapy was evaluated by clinical imaging using the RECIST criteria, metabolic criteria and patient's quality of life questionnaire. Dosimetry and biodistribution studies were also performed. Finally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for patients followed for greater than 12 months. The relationship between pretreatment F- 18 FDG PET-CT <b>scan</b> <b>status</b> and survival was determined by two-tailed Student's t-test in 42 patients who underwent pre-therapy PET scans. Results : For an average of 25 (median 18. 65) months following the therapy, patients were evaluated for any evidence of toxicity. No significant acute toxicity was observed in patients. Grade II or III hematological toxicity (7. 6 % of patients), liver toxicity (18. 4 %) and also grade I renal toxicity (6. 1 %) was observed in 92 evaluable patients. Radiological responses were evaluated {{for an average of}} 29 months following their last cycle of therapy and results were analyzed by the RECIST criteria. Majority (85 %) of patients had stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) rate was 7. 5 % and progressive disease (PD) was observed in 7. 5 % of patients. The average survival was 24. 67 months after 2 cycles of therapy, 30. 53 months after 3 cycles of therapy and 30. 19 months after 4 cycles of therapy. Of the 42 patients who had pretreatment PET-CT imaging, 31 patients had positive F- 18 FDG scans (SUV &# 62; 2. 5) with an average survival time of 18. 9 months (range 1. 4 - 45. 8 months) and 11 patients had negative F- 18 FDG scans (SUV &# 8804; 2. 5) with an average survival time of 31. 8 months (range 7. 4 - 42. 9 months). Survival times for FDG negative patients were significantly longer than those for FDG positive patients (p = 0. 001 with 95 % confidence). Conclusion : High activity In- 111 therapy is a safe and effective therapy for patients with progressive disseminated neuroendocrine tumors. No major hematological, renal and hepatic toxicities were observed. There was an increase in survival time particularly in patients with lower degree of liver involvement as well as patients who received three or more cycles of therapy, as compared to historical data. Pre-treatment FDG status may be a predictor of survival following In- 111 pentetreotide therapy. </p...|$|E

All the children had serum vitamin A and β-carotene measurements and nutritional evaluation. Renal scarring was assessed by technetium- 99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99 mTc DMSA) <b>scanning.</b> Nutritional <b>status</b> of all the patients was within normal limits and not different between the groups.  RESULTS—Mean (SD) serum vitamin A and β-carotene concentrations {{were not significantly different}} between the patients with and without renal scarring (vitamin A 53. 2 (22. 6) / 46. 8 (17. 0) µg/dl and β-carotene 232. 3 (201. 3) / 272. 4 (86. 0) µg/dl respectively). However, when the patients with renal scarring and with greater than 10 % difference among the DMSA uptakes of their kidneys (11 cases) were evaluated, a significant negative correlation was determined between the serum vitamin A concentrations and the magnitude of the difference in uptakes of each kidney.

To evaluate {{the impact of}} glycemic status on radiological findings of PTB in diabetic patients. Between January 2010 and December 2015, chest radiographs (CXRs) in consecutive 214 DM patients with culture-proved PTB and 123 available thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans were enrolled. An equal number of non-DM patients with similar demographics was included as the control group. Glycemic status was assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and a cutoff of 8 % was used to further investigate radiological features of diabetic PTB. Two radiologists and one pulmonologist reviewed the chest images independently. Compared with non-DM patients, primary PTB pattern and extensive disease on CXRs as well as primary PTB pattern, large non-cavitary nodule, more than one cavity in a single lesion, unusual location, and all lobe involvement of lesions on thoracic CT scans were more common in DM patients.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} requirements of twin-bearing ewes are ∼ 25 % {{greater than those}} of ewes with single fetuses during late pregnancy and nearly twice those of non-pregnant ewes. Underfeeding ewes, resulting in liveweight loss during late pregnancy, can have adverse effects on the production and survival of both the lamb and the ewe, and improving twin-lamb survival is critical to improving the overall reproductive performance of the National Merino flock. <b>Scanning</b> for pregnancy <b>status</b> and litter size allows for more precise management of the nutrition of the ewe flock according to the different nutritional needs of dry, single- and twin-bearing ewes. In the present paper, we tested the hypothesis that it is profitable to identify pregnancy status and litter size, and the optimum nutrition profiles are different for dry, single- and twin-bearing ewes. We tested this by examining a range of nutrition strategies for flocks where only the dry ewes were identified, or for flocks where the single- and twin-bearing ewes were identified. A MIDAS model {{set up for the}} Hamilton region in south-western Victoria was used for this analysis as it represents the whole flock and it includes a powerful feed-budgeting module that optimises animal and pasture management across the whole farm. The survival and production of the single- and twin-born progeny was adjusted {{on the basis of the}} liveweight profile of the single- and twin-bearing ewes. Our hypothesis was supported and profitability was increased by approximately AU$ 4630 /farm or AU$ 0. 80 /ewe, by scanning ewes for pregnancy status and litter size, and the optimum liveweight profiles were different for dry, single- and twin-bearing ewes. The majority of the increase in profit was due to identifying litter size and being able to differentially manage the single- and twin-bearing ewes. When ewes are <b>scanned</b> for pregnancy <b>status</b> and litter size, the most profitable combination of profiles involves all ewes losing 4 kg in early pregnancy and single-bearing ewes regaining the 4 kg to lamb at their standard reference weight, twin-bearing ewes gaining 8 kg to lamb above their standard reference weight and dry ewes losing a further 4 kg to be 8 kg lighter than their standard reference weight at lambing time...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dysfunctional uterine {{bleeding}} {{is a form}} {{of abnormal}} uterine bleeding when there is absence of organic disease of the genital tract. The objective {{of this study was to}} find out the clinical and pathological aspect of women presenting with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study was conducted over a period of one year from April 14 th 2010 to April 13 th 2011 in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Department of Pathology, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. A complete history, clinical examination, pelvic <b>scan,</b> hormonal <b>status</b> if required and endometrial biopsy were done to diagnose dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Results: A total of 120 cases were included. The age of the patients diagnosed dysfunctional uterine bleeding were ranging from 24 - 63 years. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding was most common in the age group 40 - 44 yrs (30 %) followed by 45 - 49 yrs (27. 5 %). Menorrhagia (41. 7 %) was the most common presenting sign. Majority histopathology of endometrium revealed anovulatory pattern (61. 7 %) followed by ovulatory (38. 3 %). Of the cases with an anovulatory pattern 48. 6 % was proliferative endometrium, 33. 8 % disordered proliferative endometrium, 6. 8 %atrophic, 5. 4 % weakly proliferative and 2. 7 % each of simple hyperplasia without atypia and complex hyperplasia with atypia. All cases with ovulatory pattern showed secretory endometrium. Conclusion: Dysfunctional uterine bleeding was the most common in the perimenopausal age group and chiefly in the form of an anovulatory endometrium..

40|$|Background: Tamoxifen {{is being}} used in {{patients}} with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer as an adjuvant or palliative hormonal therapy. w 0 estern studies have found a 30 &#x 0025; incidence of gallstones in patients who are taking Tamoxifen and they have proved a significant association between the two. Objectives : The objective {{of the study was}} to find out the association of Tamoxifen use and gallstone formation in postmenopausal breast cancer patients in a South Indian population. Methods: Ninety patients who had undergone surgery for invasive breast cancer in our institute, and were receiving adjuvant Tamoxifen, were recruited for the study. An equal number of age-matched postmenopausal women were taken as controls. All of them underwent an abdominal ultrasound screening test for gallstones. Presence or absence of gallstones was noted down from their ultrasound <b>scan</b> reports. Pretreatment <b>status</b> of the gall bladder was assessed from the preoperative scan reports. Results: An odds ratio of 1 was derived when the case group was compared with the control group. Conclusions: In our study we could not establish that an association existed between Tamoxifen use and gallstone formation in postmenopausal South Indian women...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the impacts of {{agricultural}} land-use changes on biodiversity in Taihu Lake Basin, China, and to identify possible conservation strategies. We used the mean species abundance (MSA) approach, building on simple cause–effect relationships between environmental drivers and biodiversity impacts at the global level. Our assessment estimated that 21 % of the original species in the undisturbed ecosystem were present in 2000. We also analysed and reviewed agricultural pressures at different spatial scales to enable the development of conservation strategies at regional and farm levels. This analysis showed, first, that intensive crop management is reflected {{by the amount of}} fertilisers applied. Policies and technologies aiming to reduce environmental impacts have been ineffective. Second, the abundance of semi-natural elements was found to be low and the fragmentation high. To link agricultural pressures to the MSA approach, we propose a multi-scale cause–effect approach, which can be linked to other land uses. This approach is useful to provide a quick <b>scan</b> of biodiversity <b>status</b> and identify conservation strategies. Training farmers to use site-specific nutrient management should be stimulated. Furthermore, acknowledging multiple land-use functions will help to develop biodiversity conservation strategies that are acceptable to farmers and policymakers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Allergic fungal {{sinusitis}} (AFS) {{is considered a}} different disease from other polypoid chronic rhinosinusitis diseases (CRS) with eosinophilic mucus (EM) termed eosinophilic mucus chronic rhinosinusitis (EMCRS). To substantiate this, studies on cellular responses to fungi and sinus mucosal inflammatory cell populations in AFS and other EMCRS diseases are required. This {{study was designed to}} examine polyp inflammatory cell populations and peripheral blood fungal-specific T-cell responses in AFS, other EMCRS subgroups (defined later), and polypoid CRS without EM. Methods: A prospective study was performed. Clinical characteristics, including CRS symptoms, sinus computed tomography (CT) <b>scans,</b> allergy <b>status,</b> intraoperative endoscopy, presence of EM, and fungal culture results were used to define patient groups. Polyps and peripheral blood were examined for populations of eosinophils, lymphocytes (CD 4 +, CD 8 + T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells), and neutrophils using immunohistochemistry, cytospin preparations and flow cytometry. Fungal-specific peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation was examined in AFS patients, other EMCRS patients, CRS patients, and controls. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the percentage of cell populations and fungal-specific lymphocyte proliferation between AFS and other EMCRS diseases. However, AFS and other EMCRS polyps had a higher percentage of eosinophils and CD 8 + T cells whereas CRS polyps had higher CD 4 + T cells. Fungal-specific lymphocyte proliferation was significantly greater in AFS and other EMCRS patients regardless of fungal allergy, whereas in CRS and controls, higher proliferation was observed in fungal-allergic individuals. Conclusion: These findings question the basis for differentiating AFS from other EMCRS diseases based on fungal allergy and fungi in EM. Fungal-specific cellular response was present in AFS and other EMCRS diseases, different from that associated with fungal allergy, suggesting a nonallergic fungal immune response. Increased CD 8 + T cells in EMCRS polyps signify a different type of inflammation to CRS that may be driven by CD 8 + T cells. Harshita Pant, Dimitra Beroukas, Frank E. Kette, William B.

40|$|Next, {{in chapter}} 6, we discuss our {{work on the}} tagging of muons with the Chorus detector. After {{explaining}} the various algorithms used {{we come to the}} efficiencies, understanding the found results through event kinematics. A study of non-tagged muons shows that the software efficiency is very close to maximal, and physics is the cause of nearly all the losses. The bulk of our study lies in the determination of the scanning efficiencies. Chapter 7 starts with the description of the interface emulsion sheets and the proof of a method we developed to extract the real scanning efficiency for these sheets from the data itself. We proceed to compare the found results with the results obtained by our simulation and comment on the possible causes for the observed discrepancy. Moving on, we explain how the search for the primary vertex and a possible decay kink is conducted and give the corresponding efficiencies we found using our Monte-Carlo. To close the chapter, we elaborate on the video image simulation, a tool we developed to help improve and determine the efficiency of video image analysis programs. These programs will be used intensively in the future to search for kinks. Last but not least, chapter 8 combines all these numbers with the present <b>scanning</b> <b>status</b> to put a new limit on Vµ -> Vtau oscillations. It also includes a few words on backgrounds and the results from a study of systematic uncertainties. We conclude with a new exclusion plot. While confirmations of the validity of the Standard Model at low and high energies (reached by present accelerators) continue to be produced, the high-energy physics community is turning towards the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. In chapter 2 we review the evidence for the existence of three neutrino flavors. We proceed by quickly summarizing their properties in the Standard Model and examine the present limits set by experiments on each neutrino's mass. We then move on to some theoretical considerations on neutrino masses, mainly based on cosmology and Grand Unified Theories and the chapter closes by illustrating the remarkable possibility of neutrino oscillations. Interestingly, at the end of 1997 it is in the neutrino physics domain that most inconsistencies with the Standard Model are found. Not in experiments using neutrinos to study the weak and strong interactions, as we see at the start of chapter 3, but definitely when probing the solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes. This is detailed later in that chapter, without forgetting the only neutrino oscillation appearance evidence found so far (LSND). From the results presented it seems to be clear that neutrinos have opened a window towards new physics. However, solving all the present problems (cosmology, solar, atmospheric, LSND) with our simple neutrino oscillation interpretation seems impossible or difficult and definitely not very elegant. So maybe this window we are opening is really much larger than we think and pushing more could yield some fascinating results. The existing constraints are definitely such that experiments should be built to search for appearance at specific oscillation parameter values. When Chorus was designed and started datataking, these constraints were quite a bit weaker. However, the parameter space area which is being explored is still very relevant in the light of a model solving the Hot Dark Matter and solar problems while satisfying the very elegant see-saw mechanism. We briefly describe the experiment in chapter 4, explaining the chosen tau neutrino detection strategy and the proposed sensitivity to V?? -> Vtau oscillations. In chapter 5 we start by describing the trackers: purpose, geometry and readout. This is followed by an explanation of the event reconstruction algorithm and its efficiency. Our main contribution to the reconstruction in the Target Trackers consists in their alignment: after introducing a few concepts we give the details of the alignment procedure, the trackers' degrees of freedom and the accuracy obtained for each of these. Two more paragraphs say a few more words on the problem of separation of variables for minimization and the detector stability over time. (PHYS 3) [...] UCL, 199...|$|R

40|$|Association studies, {{comparing}} {{elite athletes}} with sedentary controls, have reported {{a number of}} genes that {{may be related to}} athlete status. The present study reports the first genome wide linkage <b>scan</b> for athlete <b>status.</b> Subjects were 4488 adult female twins from the TwinsUK Adult Twin Registry (793 monozygotic [MZ] and 1000 dizygotic [DZ] complete twin pairs, and single twins). Athlete status was measured by asking the twins whether they had ever competed in sports and what was the highest level obtained. Twins who had competed at the county or national level were considered elite athletes. Using structural equation modeling in Mx, the heritability of athlete status was estimated at 66 %. Seven hundred DZ twin pairs that were successfully genotyped for 1946 markers (736 microsatellites and 1210 SNPs) were included in the linkage analysis. Identical-by-descent probabilities were estimated in Merlin for a 1 cM grid, taking into account the linkage disequilibrium of correlated SNPs. The linkage scan was carried out in Mx using the π-approach. Suggestive linkages were found on chromosomes 3 q 22 -q 24 and 4 q 31 -q 34. Both areas converge with findings from previous studies using exercise phenotypes. The peak on 3 q 22 -q 24 was found at the SLC 9 A 9 gene. The region 4 q 31 -q 34 overlaps with the region for which suggestive linkages were found in two previous linkage studies for physical fitness (FABP 2 gene; Bouchard et al., 2000) and physical activity (UCP 1 gene; Simonen et al., 2003). Future association studies should further clarify the possible role of these genes in athlete status...|$|R
40|$|Background: Time is a {{precious}} commodity, {{especially in the}} trauma setting, which requires continuous evaluation to ensure streamlined service delivery, quality patient care and employee efficiency. Objectives: The present study analyses the authors’ institution’s multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scan process {{as part of the}} imaging turnaround time of trauma patients. It is intended to serve as a baseline for the institution, to offer a comparison with institutions worldwide and to improve service delivery. Method: Relevant categorical data were collected from the trauma patient register and radiological information system (RIS) from 01 February 2013 to 31 January 2014. A population of 1107 trauma patients who received a MDCT scan was included in the study. Temporal data were analysed as a continuum with reference to triage priority, time of day, type of CT <b>scan</b> and admission <b>status.</b> Results: The median trauma arrival to MDCT scan time (TTS) and reporting turnaround time (RTAT) were 69 (39 – 126) and 86 (53 – 146) minutes respectively. TTS was subdivided into the time when the patient arrived at trauma to the radiology referral (TTRef) and submission of the radiology request, to the arrival at the MDCT (RefTS) location. TTRef was statistically significantly longer than RefTS (p < 0. 0001). RTAT was subdivided into the arrival at the MDCT {{to the start of the}} radiology report (STR) and time taken to complete the report (RT). STR was statistically significantly longer than RT (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: The time to scan (TTS) was comparable to, but unfortunately the report turnaround time (RTAT) lagged behind, the findings of some first-world institutions. </p...|$|R
40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, {{the timing}} and nature of brain injury and their {{relation}} to mortality in neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is unknown. AIM: To evaluate cranial ultrasound (cUS) scans from term Ugandan infants with NE and unaffected controls for evidence of established/evolving brain injury. METHODS: Infants were recruited to a case-control study at Mulago Hospital, Kampala. Cases had NE (score(1) > 5). Controls were randomly selected unaffected term infants. All had cUS scans < 36 h; surviving cases had day 4 / 5 scans. Minimally 11 views were reported blind to NE <b>status.</b> <b>Scan</b> injury definitions were evolving: extensive white matter (WM) and/or bilateral basal ganglia-thalamic (BGT) echogenicity and established: parenchymal cysts, atrophy, organising haemorrhage. RESULTS: Early scans showed significant abnormality in 20. 4 % (35 / 172) cases vs 1. 0 %(1 / 99) controls (p < 0. 0001, mean age 11. 2 h/ 8. 1 h, respectively). Case scans at < 18 h (120) still showed a high prevalence of abnormalities (16. 7 %). Case infants had 9. 3 % WM injury alone, 6. 4 % BGT injury alone and 4. 7 % BGT/WM injury. No established injury was seen. Fatality was significantly higher in cases with early cUS abnormalities vs those without (57. 1 %(20 / 35) vs 25. 9 %(35 / 135); OR 3. 81 (95 % CI 1. 76 - 8. 25)). Serial scans were done in 88 mostly surviving NE infants; 74 had normal early scans with 35 (47. 3 %) becoming abnormal by day 4 / 5. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of infants with early cUS abnormality plus absence of established antepartum injury implies the injury pathway often begins several hours before delivery in this population, with implications for therapeutic interventions considered effective early in the injury pathway.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{efficacy}} of emergency carotid thromboendarterectomy (CTEA) for acute {{internal carotid artery}} (ICA) thrombosis has been questioned. We evaluated the use of CTEA in patients with recent ICA occlusion. Methods: From August 1989 to December 1999 patients who underwent urgent CTEA for recent ICA thrombosis were retrospectively evaluated. Patient data analyzed included age, sex, comorbid risk factors, diagnostic evaluation, operative procedure, and long-term follow-up with clinical assessment and carotid duplex <b>scan.</b> Neurologic <b>status</b> was evaluated with the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) before the operation, immediately after the operation, and at 3 - to 6 -months' follow-up. Results: Twenty-nine patients underwent emergency ipsilateral CTEA for acute ICA thrombosis over the last 10 years. The {{average age of the}} patients was 69. 9 ± 1. 7 years, and 66 % were men. Patient risk factors included diabetes (7 [24 %]), hypertension (21 [72 %]), coronary artery disease (8 [29 %]), and history of tobacco abuse (20 [69 %]). Presenting symptoms included cerebrovascular accident (7 [24 %]), transient ischemic attack (nonamaurosis) (10 [34 %]), crescendo transient ischemic attack (7 [24 %]), stroke in evolution (2 [7 %]), and amaurosis fugax (3 [10 %]). Diagnostic evaluation included computed tomographic scan (29 [100 %]), magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (4 [14 %]), duplex scan evaluation of the carotid arteries (23 [79 %]), and cerebral angiography (18 [64 %]). Antegrade flow in the ICA was successfully established in 24 (83 %) of 29 patients and confirmed with intraoperative angiography or duplex sonography. Postoperative morbidity included 2 hematomas (7 %), 4 transient cranial nerve deficits (14 %), and 1 conversion to hemorrhagic stroke (3. 6 %), which resulted in the only death (3. 6 %). MRS scores averaged 3. 4 ± 0. 2 preoperatively. Follow-up averaging 74. 1 ± 21 months (range, 3 - 140 months) was obtained in 27 (93 %) patients. Improvement or deterioration was defined as a change in MRS ± 1. Immediately postoperatively, 14 (48 %) patients were improved, 2 (7 %) deteriorated, and 13 (45 %) had no change. At 3 to 6 months, 20 (74 %) of 27 patients were improved, seven (26 %) had no change, and none deteriorated. Of patients with successful CTEA, 23 (96 %) of 24 had a patent ICA on follow-up duplex scan evaluation, and {{there was no evidence of}} recurrent ipsilateral neurologic events at an average of 49 months. Conclusion: These data support an aggressive early surgical intervention for acute ICA thrombosis in carefully selected patients. In the previous decade we reported a 46 % success rate for establishing antegrade flow in the ICA long term. Data from this decade show a 79 % (P =. 0114) success rate for establishing antegrade flow long term in all patients undergoing emergency CTEA. New and improved imaging modalities have allowed better patient selection, resulting in improved outcomes. (J Vasc Surg 2001; 33 : 242 - 50. ...|$|R
