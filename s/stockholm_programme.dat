40|$|After the mid- 1980 s, {{it became}} {{necessary}} to harmonise asylum {{policy of the}} European Union (EU) due to {{the increasing number of}} asylum applications and the removal of internal borders between the Member States. To this end, Member States firstly approximated their asylum policies through intergovernmental initiatives and then gradually communitarised asylum policy of the EU via treaty reforms. The Amsterdam Treaty put asylum policy, for the first time, under the Community competence and subsequent treaties further increased EU’s competence. Meanwhile, the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) has been established under three multi-annual programmes, namely the Tampere, the Hague and the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programmes.</b> This thesis explores to what extent the Member States have transferred their competence in asylum policy to the EU in particular since 1999 when the Amsterdam Treaty came into force and the CEAS was introduced. It accordingly analyses both primary and secondary EU law on asylum with a critical legal approach. The development of the common European asylum policy and its gradual shift from the national to the intergovernmental and eventually to the supranational level resulting from the transfer of competence are also analysed from a neo-functionalist perspective...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the Tampere and <b>Stockholm</b> <b>programmes</b> have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the European enforcement order for uncontested claims, and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct enforcement of judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (abolition of exequatur). Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for refusal of recognition (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member State of enforcement. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and civil status documents...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the development of}} inter-sectoral participation in the three intervention municipalities of <b>Stockholm</b> Diabetes Prevention <b>Programme</b> (SDPP) case studies with a longitudinal assessment were conducted using the spidergram method, document analysis and group discussions. At three time points, {{the members of the}} local steering committees assessed the extent of participation from narrow to wide inter-sectoral participation in five key areas: planning, resources, leadership, network and implementation. Wide participation of various interest groups was recognised in planning and implementing activities whereas local resources, the representation of the leadership and the extent of the network were perceived as more restricted. Expert involvement varied during the programme period but was not regarded as exerting control over the local programmes. Participation within the local steering committees decreased, with a stronger focus on the project co-ordinator and other local partners in latter years. The extent of partner engagement increased due to focusing on activities approaching multi-sector collaboration and institutionalisation. Overall, communication and shared responsibility appeared critical in influencing both the development and perception of participation. In conclusion, to {{understand the}} dynamic process of participation at different times, areas and levels, the development and use of evaluation designs combining different methods and information sources throughout the lifespan of a project are recommended.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{sexual activity}} as a trigger of myocardial infarction {{and the potential}} effect modification of physical fitness.  DESIGN—A case-crossover study nested in the <b>Stockholm</b> Heart Epidemiology <b>Programme</b> (SHEEP).  SETTING—Stockholm County from April 1993  to December 1994.  PATIENTS—All patients with a first episode of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction admitted to coronary care units were eligible, and 699  patients participated in an interview.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals.  RESULTS—Only 1. 3 % of the patients without premonitory symptoms had sexual activity during {{two hours before the}} onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction was 2. 1  (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 7  to 6. 5) during one hour after sexual activity, and the risk among patients with a sedentary life was 4. 4  (95 % CI 1. 5  to 12. 9).  CONCLUSIONS—The increased risk of myocardial infarction after sexual activity and the further increase in risk among the less physically fit support the hypothesis of causal triggering by sexual activity. However, the absolute risk per hour is very low, and exposure is relatively infrequent. Thus having sex once a week only increases the annual risk of myocardial infarction slightly. Counselling should focus on encouraging patients to live a physically active life and not on abstaining from sexual activity.    Keywords: myocardial infarction; sexual activit...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} hypothesis would {{propose that}} the longer the duration of exposure to disadvantaged socio-economic position, the greater the risk of myocardial infarction. However {{there may be a}} danger of confounding between accumulation and possibly more complex combinations of critical periods of exposure and social mobility. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the possibility of distinguishing between these alternatives. We used a population based case-control study (<b>Stockholm</b> Heart Epidemiology <b>Programme)</b> of all incident first events of myocardial infarction among men and women, living in the Stockholm region 1992 - 94. The analyses were restricted to men 53 - 70 years, 511 cases and 716 controls. From a full occupational history each subject was categorized as manual worker or non-manual at three stages of the life course, childhood (from parent's occupation), at the ages 25 - 29 and 51 - 55, resulting in 8 possible socio-economic trajectories. We found a graded response to the accumulation of disadvantaged socio-economic positions over the life course. However, we also found evidence for effects of critical periods and of social mobility. A conceptual analysis showed that there are, for theoretical reasons, only a limited number of trajectories available, too small to form distinct empirical categories of each hypothesis. The empirical task of disentangling the life course hypotheses of critical period, social mobility and accumulation is therefore comparable to the problem of separating age, period, and cohort effects. Accordingly, the interpretation must depend on prior knowledge of more specific causal mechanisms. Socioeconomic position Myocardial infarction Life course Social mobility Sweden...|$|R

40|$|Programmes and {{policies}} to support ecological sustainable {{development and the}} practice of implementation is a question of innovation rather than known and taken for granted procedure. This thesis argues a priori models concerning stability in the social sciences, and human geography especially, are less able to help us understand this practice and planning in such unstable situations. Problematic in common understandings of planning and policy implementation concerning sustainability are the dualisms between physical-social spaces and between rationality-contingency. The first dualism makes it hard to grasp the interaction between humans and nonhumans. The second dualism concerns {{the problem of how to}} capture change without resorting to reductionism and explanaining the evolving projects as either technically, economically, or culturally rational. The scope of the thesis is to test resources from actor-network theory as a means of resolving these dualisms. The case is the <b>Stockholm</b> Local Investment <b>Programme</b> and the new district of Hammarby Sjöstad. The programme’s objective was to support the implemention of new technologies and systems, energy efficiency and reduced resource-use as well as eco-cycling measures. The case-study follows how the work with the programme unfolded and how administrators’ efforts to reach satisfactory results was approached. In doing this, the actors had to be far more creative than models of implementation and traditional technology diffusion seem to suggest. The recommendation is to take the instrumentalisation framing the plasticity of a project in planning seriously – as innovativeness is not a special but the general case. Hence, to broaden our tools and understanding of planning a human geography of planning projects is pertinent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Schools can be {{effective}} settings for improving eating habits and physical activity, whereas {{it is more difficult}} to prevent obesity. A key challenge is the “implementation gap”. Trade-off must be made between expert-driven programmes {{on the one hand and}} contextual relevance, flexibility, participation and capacity building on the other. The aim of the <b>Stockholm</b> County Implementation <b>Programme</b> was to improve eating habits, physical activity, self-esteem, and promote a healthy body weight in children aged 6 – 16 years. We describe the programme, intervention fidelity, impacts and outcomes after two years of intervention. Methods Nine out of 18 schools in a middle-class municipality in Sweden agreed to participate whereas the other nine schools served as the comparison group (quasi-experimental study). Tailored action plans were developed by school health teams on the basis of a self-assessment questionnaire called KEY assessing strengths and weaknesses of each school’s health practices and environments. Process evaluation was carried out by the research staff. Impacts at school level were assessed yearly by the KEY. Outcome measures at student level were anthropometry (measured), and health behaviours assessed by a questionnaire, at baseline and after 2 years. All children in grade 2, 4 and 7 were invited to participate (n= 1359) of which 59. 8 % consented. The effect of the intervention on health behaviours, self-esteem, weight status and BMIsds was evaluated by unilevel and multilevel regression analysis adjusted for gender and baseline values. Results Programme fidelity was high demonstrating feasibility, but fidelity to school action plans was only 48 % after two years. Positive and significant (p Conclusions School staff has the capacity to create their own solutions and make changes at school level on the basis of self-assessment and facilitation by external agents. However these changes were challenging to sustain over time and had little impact on student behaviours or weight status. Better student outcomes could probably be attained by a more focused and evidence-based approach with stepwise implementation of action plans. </p...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{the second}} most common form of cancer in Europe, and {{population}} based screening for colorectal cancer is recommended by the European Union. Screening enables detection of precursor lesions, i. e. adenomas, and cancer at an early stage, and randomised trials have demonstrated that screening reduces mortality in colorectal cancer. In rectal cancer, oncological results after abdominal resection surgery have improved over many years, but the morbidity, mortality and negative functional side effects following surgery and oncological treatment are considerable. Local excision techniques, on the other hand, demonstrate excellent functional results and a low morbidity and mortality but have high local recurrence rates, mainly since the technique does not allow for excision of mesorectal lymph nodes, which could be exposed to metastatic disease not detectable in the preoperative radiological staging. Since further expansion of population based screening programs for CRC will increase the detection of early cancer, local excision techniques are of great interest, provided that an adequate oncological out-come can be ensured. In paper I all patients in Sweden undergoing surgery for stage I rectal cancer 1995 - 2006 were assessed regarding survival, local recurrence rates and risk factors for death. Patients undergoing local excision had a higher local recurrence rate and a poor survival, especially in the age group ≥ 80 years, compared to patients undergoing abdominal resection surgery. Paper II analysed risk factors for lymph node metastases in patients with rectal cancer. All patients in Sweden 2007 - 2010 with histopathologically confirmed radical resections of pT 1 - 2 rectal cancer follow-ing abdominal resection surgery without (neo) adjuvant treatment were included. T 2 stage, poor differen-tiation and vascular infiltration were identified as risk factors for lymph node metastases. A model calcu-lating the total risk depending on the number of risk factors included, displayed a risk range of 6 - 65 % and 11 - 78 % in T 1 and T 2 tumours respectively. In paper III all Swedish patients aged 60 - 69 years with screening detected colorectal cancer were com-pared to those with non-screening detected cancer diagnosed 2008 - 2012. Pre- and postoperative staging, MDT-assessment, surgical and oncological treatment were compared between the groups. Patients with screening detected cancer were staged and MDT-assessed to a higher extent compared to those with non-screening detected cancer and tumours were found at an earlier stage in the screening group. Surgical and oncological treatment did not differ between the groups. Patients with endoscopically resected can-cer did not undergo staging and MDT-assessment to the same extent as did patients with surgically re-sected cancer. Paper IV included all individuals with a positive FOBT in the <b>Stockholm</b> screening <b>programme,</b> January 2008 - June 2012. Complications and mortality within 30 days after interventions, i. e. colonoscopies or surgery for adenomas or cancer, subsequent to a positive screening test were assessed.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} {{research}} objectives of computer science {{is the development of}} formal methods for the design and implementation of concurrent programming languages. A most prominent feature of this research area is the proliferation of programming concepts arising from imperative programming, logic programming, functional programming, object-oriented programming, constraint programming, and the various formalizations thereof. The Human Capital and Mobility project EXPRESS has aimed at a general understanding of the interconnections and relations between formal systems for concurrency, ranging from programming languages to axiom systems and rewrite systems. More specifically, we have compared programming concepts and formalisms {{on the basis of their}} relative expressive power. The results obtained in our project are steps towards classifying the variety of concurrent programming languages, and may provide a formal basis for their design and implementation. The partners of EXPRESS have been the CWI (Amsterdam), the University of Utrecht, the University of Florence, the University of Aalborg, the University of Nijmegen, the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, the University of Genoa, the University of Rome “La Sapienza”, the University of Hildesheim, the University of Amsterdam, INRIA Sophia Antipolis, INRIA Rennes, and the University of Sussex. External partners associated to the project were the State University of New York at Stony Brook, the University at Cornell (USA), the Weizmann Institute (Israel) and the McGill University (Canada). The project ran for four years 1993 - 1997. Each year the project partners met at a workshop, disseminating the latest results. The last of these, EXPRESS' 97 at Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy, 8 - 12 September 1997, was also open to the scientific community. Apart from the ordinary EXPRESS presentations we had a general call for papers from outside the project. Among the submissions we selected 13 papers from presentation, which are collected in these proceedings. Additionally we had 7 invited speakers: Ralph Back, Jean-Jacques Levy, Eugenio Moggi, Ugo Montanari, Amir Pnueli, Vaughan Pratt, and Colin Stirling. Some of the invited speakers also offered a contribution to the proceedings. We would like to thank the EXPRESS members, the invited speakers, the authors of the submitted papers, and the members of the program committee for their contribution to both the meeting and this volume.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis focused on how to capture the complexity {{in the implementation of}} a community health promotion programme. The thesis is based on experiences of <b>Stockholm</b> diabetes prevention <b>programme</b> (SDPP), which was implemented in 1995 - 2004 in three municipalities, and include documentation within the programme, annual local governmental reports, local news cuttings, questionnaires and group discussions with the local steering committees members. The material have been analysed by qualitative and quantitative content analysis. In study I, the planning model developed for SDPP was applied to study the programme development. It identified that the programme had been implemented mainly as planned. Physical activity was the risk factor that had become the major focus of intervention. Tobacco consumptions had been added as a fourth risk factor. In study II, the participatory spidergram methodology was applied to assess the extent and development of local intersectoral participation. Wide local intersectoral participation was achieved in planning and implementing activities whereas participation in allocating local resources, leadership and network were more restricted. Communication and shared responsibility appeared critical in influencing the development and perception of participation. In study III, a matrix with WHO s Health For All-targets was developed to identify health promotion activities within the local governments. Each target area was valued in relation to whether intersectoral collaboration and policy or monitoring systems had been established. It was found that almost all the target areas had been addressed, although main focus was given to environmental issues, unemployment, social care and welfare. Health promotion activities were often presented as environmental strategies. The social welfare administration and board for environment and health protection were most frequently involved in health promotion efforts. Policies or monitoring systems were developed within equality, alcohol and drugs, welfare, disability, and environmental and local Agenda 21 plans. In study IV, media monitoring and media analysis was applied to analyse the frequency, characteristics and content of newspaper coverage related to physical activity. Physical activity was reported both as a positive feature in the municipalities and an issue that created debate about priorities and resources. The public, local organisations and the authorities were involved in the debates. Health aspects were used as an argument when discussing the availability of activities, facilities and recreation areas. With the applied study design {{it was not possible to}} evaluate if the programme had had any impact on the health related content in the articles except for articles directly linked to the programme. In conclusion, the applied analytical tools enabled to study the implementation processes and analyse various actors roles or potentials in the implementation. A thorough documentation and monitoring of programme operations was found essential to capture the many activities and actors involved during such a long-term programme. The contributions of the analytical tools are that they have included several dimensions and data sources in the analysis. These methods would probably be more useful in formative evaluations to enable to adjust program operations during the implementation and to seize an important learning opportunity...|$|R
40|$|The {{still to}} be adopted <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme,</b> setting out the policy for justice and home affairs {{for the next five}} years, {{includes}} a chapter on data protection that calls for a comprehensive legal framework on data protection covering all areas of EU competence. With Directive 95 / 46 and a newly enacted Framework Decision on data protection in criminal matters there is still a need for such a comprehensive EU protection scheme. Both existing instruments are not consistent with each other and cannot thus form a comprehensive framework of data protection. The inconsistencies have equally penetrated the transatlantic cooperation in criminal matters. When assessing the agreements concluded between Europol, Eurojust and the EU, on the one hand, and the US, on the other (including the PNR Agreements), the same issues can be detected. Still, the communication on the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme</b> refers to the data protection provisions in these agreements as an example for future bilateral and multilateral agreements...|$|E
40|$|Three {{layers of}} changes are afoot in {{transnational}} policing cooperation within the EU. In addition to reform of Europol and Eurojust, the Lisbon Treaty came into force on 1 Decem-ber 2009, and the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme,</b> {{for the next}} five years, was published at the end of December 2009. Each of these developments will {{have a major impact on}} the legal and policy framework for transnational EU policing. This article critically analyses these changes from an EU law perspective...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} {{raised in}} the article is how the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty and the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>programme</b> concerning the EU’s asylum and migration policy might consolidate existing trends within the European border control regime. The regime is defined {{by a combination of}} three features: (i) a harmonisation of categories among the EU/Schengen member states, (ii) a growing use of new technology in networked databases and (iii) an increasing sorting of individuals based on security concerns. Although none of these features is new, the combination gives a new impetus to the European border control regime. The article concludes that the Lisbon Treaty and the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>programme</b> consolidate and strengthen existing trends. This implies that policies on border control, asylum, immigration, judicial cooperation and police cooperation are consolidated in a broader approach to border control, {{and that there is a}} strengthening of EU foreign policy within the European border control regime. The boundaries between previously dispersed policy areas are blurred. The combination of different aspects of security and various levels of authority requires coordination of policies with substantially different goals, and goes beyond mere border control...|$|E
40|$|Undocumented {{migrants}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} vulnerable groups in the EU. This report assesses the main findings and synergies of a selection of EU-funded research projects on irregular immigration and the status of undocumented migrants. It reveals that the results emanating from social science research contrast with the EU policy documents adopted in light of the forthcoming <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme</b> – the third multi-annual programme on an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. The authors argue that acknowledgement of the findings of independent research is lacking in EU policy, which continues promote a control-based approach to migration that has profound ethical and human rights implications. The report concludes with a set of policy recommendations aimed at overcoming the current inconsistencies in EU and national policies as well as in practices on irregular migration under the mandate of the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme.</b> The CEPS ‘Liberty and Security in Europe ’ publication series offers the views and critical reflections of CEPS researchers and external collaborators with key policy discussions surrounding the construction of the EU’s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. The series encompasses policy-oriented and interdisciplinary academic studies and commentary about the internal and external implications of Justice and Home Affairs policies inside Europe and elsewhere throughout the world...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this study was to {{illustrate}} different policy preferences and approaches to temporary and circular migration, and to provide evidence of their characteristics, as well as to identify lessons learned, best practices and possible policy options, which could be further explored at national and EU political levels. By doing so the EMN study also serves to respond to the request from the Council, through its Council Conclusions and the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme,</b> regarding further exploration and development of circular migration as an integral part of EU migration policy...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) ’s current {{provisions}} on the {{trafficking in}} human beings (THB) are provided for, inter alia, in Council Framework Decision 2002 / 629 /JHA. The Council of Europe have more recent provisions in this area, which are not yet widely in force. The EU has some major proposals for reform of its legal framework in the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme,</b> to include the appointment of an EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. In addition, the focus of EU Justice and Home Affairs is shifting to the external relations of the EU under the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme.</b> A critical examination of the EU legal framework in the area of THB from a law enforcement perspective is therefore timely. THB is a highly contentious and complicated area for regulation, with issues such as the support of the victims of trafficking, the particular needs of under-aged trafficked individuals, and the issues of due process when a witness may not be considered to be reliable during court proceedings, complicating operations and prosecutions. In addition the issue of illegal immigration adds a further layer of complication, with the UK maintaining its opt out from the EU’s illegal immigration provisions. This article will, focus on the illegal trafficking of adults against their will, and the consequences of this crime, in particular, for the UK law enforcement authorities. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{highlights}} the inherent limitations and injustices of the Dublin system, which transfers asylum seekers between EU Member States, and outlines alternative proposals for a fairer {{and more efficient}} system. ECRE strongly believes that the Dublin Regulation does not promote harmonisation of EU asylum systems, seriously impedes integration, and sows dissension among Member States. Instead of pretending {{it can be made}} to work, the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Programme</b> should repeal the Dublin Regulation and devise an efficient responsibility-sharing regime that improves solidarity among Member States, and promotes the integration of people who seek, and deserve, international protection...|$|E
