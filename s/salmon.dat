5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye <b>salmon</b> {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye <b>salmon,</b> collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby <b>salmon</b> then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye <b>salmon</b> with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby <b>salmon</b> down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the <b>salmon</b> recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, <b>salmon</b> populations noticeably recovered.|$|E

The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on <b>salmon</b> spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for <b>salmon</b> recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver <b>salmon</b> runs to Idaho's <b>Salmon</b> and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook <b>salmon,</b> a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile <b>salmon</b> downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or <b>salmon</b> to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White <b>Salmon</b> River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, <b>salmon</b> was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. <b>Salmon</b> migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed {{they could hear}} the fish moving upstream.

The fishing industry fed demands for <b>salmon</b> in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned <b>salmon</b> in England.|$|E
