50|$|On 1 January 1987, TV3 {{television}} audio stereo transmissions {{began in}} the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. It was the first channel in Thailand to adopt stereo broadcasting. It transmits using the Zweikanalton <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> system over TV3's UHF broadcast in Bangkok. Later in the 1990s, the <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> was introduced into their VHF broadcast. TV3 was also experimenting with bilingual transmission over Zweikanalton {{for a short period}} of time in the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|WFOB {{was also}} one of the first {{stations}} in the country to invest in AM stereo technology. The FCC didn't adopt a standard for AM Stereo until 1993. Following the lead of other stations who had given up on it, WFOB dropped its AM <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Very few [...] AM radio {{stations}} that broadcast with IBOC HD Radio {{during the day}} switch to C-QUAM AM Stereo during nighttime operation to reduce sideband digital (hash) interference and to provide long-range stereo reception. Many HD radio tuners have a limited ability to decode C-Quam <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions,</b> (typically with lower bandwidth), and as a result, reduced audio quality than what could be expected from a specifically designed AMAX/C-QUAM only tuner. C-QUAM AM <b>Stereo</b> <b>transmissions</b> have the same range as AM Monural transmission, a key benefit.|$|R
50|$|KUSA started AM stereo {{broadcasts}} in 1983 after rebuilding most {{of their}} transmitter to accommodate <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions.</b> <b>Stereo</b> broadcasts continued {{throughout most of the}} 1990s, using the C-QUAM standard. In 1997, KTRS stopped sending stereo programming to the transmitter but continued broadcasting the stereo pilot signal. In 2001, the stereo pilot was silenced.|$|R
50|$|For many years, KMOX {{broadcast}} using C-QUAM AM <b>stereo,</b> but <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{ended in}} the spring of 2000. The station now broadcasts an HD Radio signal. The Federal Communications Commission requires a digital (hybrid) license for HD broadcasting.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of FM <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission,</b> or color television, allowed forward compatibility, since monophonic FM radio receivers and black-and-white TV sets still could receive {{a signal from}} a new transmitter. It also allowed backward compatibility since new receivers could receive monophonic or black-and-white signals generated by old transmitters.|$|E
5000|$|Long before FM <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> was considered, FM {{multiplexing}} {{of other}} types of audio level information was experimented with. [...] Edwin Armstrong who invented FM was the first to experiment with multiplexing, at his experimental 41 MHz station W2XDG located on the 85th floor of the Empire State Building in New York City.|$|E
50|$|Multichannel {{television}} sound, {{better known}} as MTS (often still as BTSC, for the Broadcast Television Systems Committee that created it), is the method of encoding three additional channels of audio into an NTSC-format audio carrier. It {{was adopted by the}} FCC as the United States standard for stereo television transmission in 1984.Sporadic network transmission of stereo audio began on NBC on July 26, 1984, with The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson—although at the time, only the network's New York City flagship station, WNBC, had stereo broadcast capability. Regular <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> of programs began in 1985.|$|E
50|$|FM <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions</b> use a double-sideband {{suppressed}} carrier (DSBSC) signal from a stereo generator, {{together with a}} pilot tone of exactly half the original carrier frequency. This allows reconstitution of the original stereo carrier, and hence the stereo signal.|$|R
50|$|At one time, when WTVN still aired music programming, {{the station}} {{broadcast}} using C-QUAM AM Stereo. The stereo equipment {{was installed in}} 1988 {{but it was not}} until 1992 that the station operated in full <b>stereo.</b> Analog <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions</b> ended several years later.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stereo</b> audio <b>transmissions,</b> {{using the}} NICAM digital stereo sound format began on BBC1 {{at some point}} in autumn 1987, to {{coincide}} with the sale of the first consumer NICAM-enabled equipment, a year after BBC2, and were gradually phased in across BBC TV output, although it took until 31 August 1991 for the service to begin officially on both channels. During this time, both commercial analogue broadcasters, ITV and Channel 4 had officially begun <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions</b> using the BBC-developed NICAM system. Widescreen programming was introduced on digital platforms in 1998.|$|R
50|$|MTS {{signals are}} {{indicated}} {{to the television}} receiver by adding a 15.734 kHz pilot tone to the signal.The MTS pilot is locked or derived from the horizontal sync signal used to lock the video display. Variations in phase or frequency of the horizontal sync are therefore transferred to the audio. UHF transmitters in use in 1984 generally had significant phase errors introduced in this signal making the transmission of stereo audio on UHF stations of that time nearly impossible. Later refinements in UHF transmitters minimized these effects and allowed <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> for those stations.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequencies}} {{are chosen}} {{such that they}} cause minimal interference to the picture. The {{difference between the two}} sound carriers is 15.5 times the line frequency (15.5 x 15625 Hz = 242187.5 Hz) which, being an odd multiple of half line frequency, reduces the visibility of intermodulation products between the two carriers. The pilot tone frequency is 3.5 times line frequency (54687.5 Hz). The modulated tone frequency is 117.50 Hz for <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> and 274.1 Hz for bilingual transmission. Absence of this tone is interpreted as a monaural transmission.|$|E
50|$|Early {{efforts to}} {{transmit}} discrete four-channel quadraphonic music required {{the use of}} two FM stations; one transmitting the front audio channels, the other the rear channels. A breakthrough came in 1970 when KIOI (K-101) in San Francisco successfully transmitted true quadraphonic sound from a single FM station using the Quadraplex system under Special Temporary Authority from the FCC. Following this experiment, a long term test period was proposed that would permit one FM station {{in each of the}} top 25 U.S. radio markets to transmit in Quadraplex. The test results hopefully would prove to the FCC that the system was compatible with existing two-channel <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> and reception and that it did not interfere with adjacent stations.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{pre-emphasis}} and de-emphasis used {{is defined by}} the time constant of a simple RC filter circuit. In most of the world a 50 µs time constant is used. In the Americas and South Korea, 75 µs is used. This applies to both mono and <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions.</b> For <b>stereo,</b> pre-emphasis is applied to the left and right channels before multiplexing.|$|R
50|$|In December 1925, the BBC's {{experimental}} transmitting station, 5XX, in Daventry, Northamptonshire, made radio's first stereo broadcast—a concert from Manchester, {{conducted by}} Sir Hamilton Harty—with 5XX broadcasting the right channel nationally by long wave and local BBC stations broadcasting the left channel by medium wave. The BBC repeated the experiment in 1926, using 2LO in London and 5XX at Daventry. Following experimental FM <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the London area in 1958 and regular Saturday morning demonstration transmissions using TV sound and medium wave (AM) radio {{to provide the}} two channels, the first regular BBC transmissions using an FM stereo signal began on the BBC's Third Programme network on August 28, 1962.|$|R
50|$|New {{technology}} {{was added to}} FM radio in the early 1960s to allow FM <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions,</b> where the frequency modulated radio signal is used to carry stereophonic sound, using the pilot-tone multiplex system. WFMV was the first radio station in Virginia to broadcast in multiplex stereo. At 103.7 MHz, it was licensed for 74,000 watts. The transmitter site, which was favorably located on high ground (200 ft above sea level) west of Richmond in the woods off Old Bon Air Road in Chesterfield County near Bon Air, had a tower extending another 125' and signals could be heard in Charlottesville, about 70 miles away.|$|R
5000|$|Ader was an {{innovator}} in {{a number}} of electrical and mechanical engineering fields. He originally studied electrical engineering, and in 1878 improved on the telephone invented by Alexander Graham Bell. After this he established the telephone network in Paris in 1880. In 1881, he invented the théâtrophone, a system of telephonic transmission where listeners received a separate channel for each ear, enabling stereophonic perception of the actors on a set; it was this invention which gave the first <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> of opera performances, over a distance of 2 miles (3 km) in 1881. [...] In 1903, he devised a V8 engine for the Paris-Madrid race, but although three or four were produced, none were sold.|$|E
50|$|Sporadic network {{transmission}} of stereo audio began on NBC on July 26, 1984, with The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, although {{at the time}} only the network's New York City flagship station, WNBC, had stereo broadcast capability; regular <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> of NBC programs began during early 1985. ABC and CBS followed suit in 1986 and 1987, respectively. FOX was the last network to join around 1990, with the four networks having their entire prime-time schedules in stereo by late 1994 (The WB and UPN, launched the following season with their entire line-ups in stereo). One of the first television receiving systems to include BTSC capability was the RCA Dimensia, released in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> is {{possible}} and offered by some stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Australia, The Philippines, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Italy and France. However, there have been multiple standards for AM stereo. C-QUAM is the official standard in the United States {{as well as other}} countries, but receivers that implement the technology are no longer readily available to consumers. Used receivers with AM Stereo can be found. Names such as [...] "FM/AM Stereo" [...] or [...] "AM & FM Stereo" [...] can be misleading and usually do not signify that the radio will decode C-QUAM AM stereo, whereas a set labeled [...] "FM Stereo/AM Stereo" [...] or [...] "AMAX Stereo" [...] will support AM stereo.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 {{the radio}} {{channels}} started <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In 1983 the Federal Council relaxed the Swiss media legislation to permit local private and commercial radio channels. SRG SSR countered this threat by launching its third set of channels, {{aimed at a}} younger audience. In 1991 SRG SSR underwent a wide-ranging restructuring. The enterprise organised itself as a private industry association, structured as a holding company under Swiss company law. The name, SRG SSR idée suisse, was introduced. In 1992 Radio Rumantsch was separated from the German-language radio broadcaster, that had housed the Romansh broadcasting activities since 1938, and in 1994 the Romansh TV activities were moved over as well and the Romansh company renamed itself Radio e Televisiun Rumantscha.|$|R
50|$|The {{lattice filter}} has an {{important}} application on lines used by broadcasters for stereo audio feeds. Phase distortion on a monophonic line {{does not have a}} serious effect {{on the quality of the}} sound unless it is very large. The same is true of the absolute phase distortion on each leg (left and right channels) of a stereo pair of lines. However, the differential phase between legs has a very dramatic effect on the stereo image. This is because the formation of the stereo image in the brain relies on the phase difference information from the two ears. A phase difference translates to a delay, which in turn can be interpreted as a direction the sound came from. Consequently, landlines used by broadcasters for <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions</b> are equalised to very tight differential phase specifications.|$|R
50|$|Zweikanalton {{can carry}} either a {{completely}} separate audio program, {{or can be}} used for <b>stereo</b> sound <b>transmission.</b> In the latter case, the first FM carrier carries (L+R)/2 for compatibility, while the second carrier carries R (not L-R.) After combining the two channels, this method improves the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing the correlated noise between the channels.|$|R
5000|$|In 1980 the FCC {{selected}} the Magnavox PMX system as the U.S. standard, but this choice was immediately contested by the losing applicants in the courts. In 1982, the FCC reversed its decision and {{decided not to}} enforce a common standard, but instead allow multiple systems to be installed, in order to [...] "let the marketplace decide". Other nations adopted AM stereo, most commonly choosing Motorola's C-QUAM. The choice of a single standard, rather than allowing competing standards as the U.S., resulted in greater acceptance of AM stereo in these markets. In 1993, the FCC again updated its policy, now making the C-QUAM system the U.S. standard, however, it has been subsequently installed by very few stations. There was a limited adoption of AM stereo worldwide, and interest declined after 1990. With the continued migration of AM stations away from music to news, sports, and talk formats, receiver manufacturers saw little reason to adopt the more expensive stereo tuners, and thus radio stations {{have little incentive to}} upgrade to <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract⎯A {{practical}} and multifunctional use of Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) in wireless applications is presented by demonstrating {{a system that}} realizes commercial band FM <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> and meets specifications set by the FCC. This system contains the ability to synthesize passband signals that are modulated completely in the discrete time domain by performing baseband modulation in a custom CMOS VLSI core and interfacing to an off-chip Direct Digital Synthesizer in order to generate the high frequency carrier. Using off-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), baseband modulation is achieved by band limiting two audio frequency inputs to 15 kHz, sampling each at 106 kHz, and then taking their sum and difference. The sum, or monaural signal, is added together with the difference signal that has been amplitude modulated on a 38 kHz subcarrier. Lastly, a 19 kHz pilot tone is added in phase with the subcarrier {{in order for the}} subcarrier to be regenerated coherently at the receiver. The pilot tone and the subcarrier are discrete time local oscillators that are synthesized on-chip. Once the baseband sample has been processed, it is converted to a phase deviation, added to the carrier phase, and written to the DDS in order for the passband frequency to be updated. The core architecture is based upon a 16 -bit RISC microprocessor with application specific modules to achieve the design objectives. These modules include a multiplyaccumulate (MAC) unit, on-chip memory, and an on-chip lookup table. The passband, or carrier, frequencies are fully programmable, as is the core so that many different modulation schemes can be achieved. I. SYSTEM OVERVIEW A...|$|E
40|$|The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has {{standardized}} the subband coding (SBC) {{audio codec}} to connect headphones via wireless Bluetooth links. SBC compresses audio at high fidelity while having an ultra-low algorithm delay. To make SBC {{suitable for the}} Internet, we extend it by using a time and packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithm {{that is based on}} ITU's G. 711 Appendix I. The design is novel in the aspect of the interface between codec and speech receiver. We developed a new approach on how to distribute the functionality of a speech receiver between codec and application. Our approach leads to easier implementations of high quality VoIP applications. We conducted subjective and objective listening tests of the audio quality of SBC and PLC in order to determine an optimal coding mode and the trade-off between coding mode and packet loss rate. More precisely, we conducted MUSHRA listening tests for selected sample items. These tests results are then compared with the results of multiple objective assessment algorithms (ITU P. 862 PESQ, ITU BS. 1387 - 1 PEAQ, Creusere's algorithm). We found out that a combination of the PEAQ basic and advanced values best matches [...] -after third order linear regression [...] -the subjective MUSHRA results. The linear regression has coefficient of determination of R²= 0. 907 ². By comparison, our individual human ratings show a correlation of about R= 0. 9 compared to our averaged human rating results. Using the combination of both PEAQ algorithms, we calculate hundred thousands of objective audio quality ratings varying audio content and algorithmic parameters of SBC and PLC. The results show which set of parameters value are best suitable for a bandwidth and delay constrained link. The transmission quality of SBC is enhanced significantly by selecting optimal encoding parameters as compared to the default parameter sets given in the standard. Finally, we present preliminary objective tests results on the comparison of the audio codecs SBC, CELT, APT-X and ULD coding speech and audio transmission. They all allow a mono and <b>stereo</b> <b>transmission</b> of music at ultra-low coding delays (< 10 ms), which is especially useful for distributed ensemble performances over the Internet...|$|E
5000|$|A {{radar station}} was {{opened on the}} high ground of Whitehawk Hill, {{to the east of}} central Brighton, during World War II. Meanwhile, {{television}} broadcasts first reached the town in 1953 when a relay transmitter was erected on Truleigh Hill, several miles to the west on the South Downs. [...] On 5 April 1959, after the wartime facility was demolished, a 148 ft transmitter was opened at Whitehawk. It took a feed from the Crystal Palace transmitting station until 14 April 1962; after that, signals were relayed from the Rowridge transmitting station. The original VHF signal was accompanied by colour UHF transmissions from 21 September 1970 (BBC1 and BBC2 only) until the VHF 405-line TV transmissions from this site ceased in 1983. UHF signals for ITV and Channel 4 followed from 28 April 1972 and 17 May 1983 respectively. [...] Radio broadcasts started on 13 March 1967, in mono only; <b>stereo</b> <b>transmissions</b> commenced on 4 November 1972. From the beginning, signals were relayed from the Wrotham transmitting station; this arrangement continues as of [...]|$|R
5000|$|On November 1, 1957, WRPI {{obtained}} an FM {{license and}} began broadcasting on its current frequency of 91.5 MHz with 750 watts, an early adopter of <b>stereo</b> FM <b>transmission.</b> In April 1969, WRPI boosted {{its power to}} 10,000 watts, while simultaneously moving to a new transmitter site. The format was also changed to [...] "free-form progressive rock" [...] during this period. Now with a powerful signal, WRPI functioned as the Progressive Rock/Album Rock station of the Albany area throughout {{the first half of}} the 1970s until WQBK-FM entered the format in 1975, followed by WPYX in 1980.|$|R
5000|$|... dbx-TV is {{included}} in multichannel television sound (MTS), the U.S. standard for <b>stereo</b> analog television <b>transmission.</b> Every TV device that decoded MTS originally required the payment of royalties, first to dbx, Inc., then to THAT Corporation which was spun off from dbx in 1989 and acquired its MTS patents in 1994; however, those patents expired worldwide in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The two TV {{sets that}} were {{the center of this}} system (FKC2600E and FKC2601T) were {{physically}} identical to the Colortrak 2000 chassis. These monitors were where the systems 32 kilobyte microprocessors were located. They sat in a dedicated entertainment center that suited all the components of this fully integrated system. The system was available in two color schemes; a woodgrain veneer and a black exterior from 1984 to 1986. These monitors featured BTSC system three-channel audio which had just been adopted by the Federal Communications Commission as the U.S. standard for <b>stereo</b> television <b>transmission</b> in 1984, the same year as the release of Dimensia.|$|R
50|$|Radio Mercur {{made all}} of its {{recordings}} in studios in Copenhagen, Denmark and the tapes were then sailed to a transmitting vessel in international water in Øresund between Denmark and Sweden. Transmissions {{took place on the}} FM-band, first on 88,00 MHz, later on different frequencies to be able to meet complaints from the Danish authorities and also to transmit in <b>stereo</b> with dual <b>transmissions</b> on two frequencies simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|FDM {{can also}} be used to combine signals before final {{modulation}} onto a carrier wave. In this case the carrier signals are referred to as subcarriers: an example is <b>stereo</b> FM <b>transmission,</b> where a 38 kHz subcarrier is used to separate the left-right difference signal from the central left-right sum channel, prior to the frequency modulation of the composite signal.An analog NTSC television channel is divided into subcarrier frequencies for video, color, and audio.DSL uses different frequencies for voice and for upstream and downstream data transmission on the same conductors, which is also an example of frequency duplex. Where frequency-division multiplexing is used as to allow multiple users to share a physical communications channel, it is called frequency-division multiple access (FDMA).|$|R
5000|$|Fletcher's {{contributions}} {{to the theory of}} speech perception are among his best-known work. He showed that speech features are usually spread over a wide frequency range, and developed the articulation index to approximately quantify the quality of a speech channel. [...] He also developed the concepts of equal-loudness contours (commonly known as Fletcher-Munson curves), loudness scaling and summation, and the critical band. At Bell Labs, he oversaw research in electrical sound recording, including the first successful stereophonic recordings, the first live <b>stereo</b> sound <b>transmission,</b> and the production of the first vinyl recording. All of this was done {{with the help of the}} conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Leopold Stokowski between 1931-32. Some of his other accomplishments include the production of the first functional hearing aid, the 2-A audiometer, and the artificial larynx.|$|R
50|$|The 5.1 {{surround}} sound is encoded in the <b>stereo</b> wave for <b>transmission</b> {{and is thus}} compatible with any mono/stereo/matrix-style receiver. If played on a 5.1 audio set equipped with Neural Surround decoder, the watermarks (i.e. spatial cues) in the waveforms are detected and the signal is recovered to its original 5.1 form. The technology is similar to parametric stereo, in which a mono signal is recovered to stereo. The bitrate for XMHD surround broadcasts is ~70 kbit/s using aacPlus from Coding Technologies.|$|R
5000|$|Before <b>stereo</b> TV sound <b>transmission</b> was possible, {{simulcasting}} on TV and Radio was {{a method}} of effectively transmitting [...] "stereo" [...] sound to music TV broadcasts. In the 1970s WPXI in Pittsburgh broadcast a live Boz Scaggs performance which had the audio simultaneously broadcast on two FM radio stations to create a quadrophonic sound, {{the first of its}} kind. The first such transmission was in 1975, when the BBC broadcast a recording of Van Morrison's London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2 (see It's Too Late to Stop Now).|$|R
