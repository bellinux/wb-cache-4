ZrC {{has also been}} observed as a product from the reaction, but if the reaction is carried out with 20-25% excess B4C, the ZrC phase disappears, and only ZrB2 remains.

A very interesting and important field of study of impurity segregation processes involves AES of grain boundaries of materials. This technique includes tensile fracturing of special specimens directly inside the UHV chamber of the Auger Electron Spectrometer that was developed by Ilyin.Segregation to grain boundaries can also affect their respective migration rates, and so affects <b>sinterability,</b> as well as the grain boundary diffusivity (although sometimes these effects can be used advantageously).|$|E
50|$|Pressureless {{sintering}} {{is another}} method for processing and densifying UHTCs. Pressureless sintering involves heating powdered materials in a mold {{in order to}} promote atomic diffusion and create a solid material. Compacts are prepared by uniaxial die compaction, and then the compacts are fired at chosen temperatures in a controlled atmosphere. Exaggerated grain growth that hinders densification occurs during sintering due to the low-intrinsic <b>sinterability</b> and the strong covalent bonds of Ti, Zr, and Hf diborides. Full densification of ZrB2 by pressureless sintering is very difficult to obtain; Chamberlain et al. have only been able to obtain ~98% densification by heating at 2150 °C for 9 h (Figure 3). Efforts to control grain size and improve densification have focused on adding third phases to the UHTCs, some examples of these phases include the addition of boron and iridium. Addition of Ir in particular has shown an increase in the toughness of HfB2/20vol.% SiC by 25%. Sintered density has also been shown to increase with the addition of Fe (up to 10% w/w) and Ni (up to 50% w/w) to achieve densifications of up to 88% at 1600 °C. More advances in pressureless sintering must be made before it can be considered a viable method for UHTC processing.|$|E
50|$|UHTCs possess simple {{empirical}} formulas {{and thus}} can be prepared by {{a wide variety of}} synthetic methods. UHTCs such as ZrB2 can be synthesized by stoichiometric reaction between constituent elements, in this case Zr and B. This reaction provides for precise stoichiometric control of the materials. At 2000 K, the formation of ZrB2 via stoichiometric reaction is thermodynamically favorable (ΔG=−279.6 kJ mol−1) and therefore, this route can be used to produce ZrB2 by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS). This technique takes advantage of the high exothermic energy of the reaction to cause high temperature, fast combustion reactions. Advantages of SHS include higher purity of ceramic products, increased <b>sinterability,</b> and shorter processing times. However, the extremely rapid heating rates can result in incomplete reactions between Zr and B, the formation of stable oxides of Zr, and the retention of porosity. Stoichiometric reactions have also been carried out by reaction of attrition milled (wearing materials by grinding) Zr and B powder (and then hot pressing at 600 °C for 6 h), and nanoscale particles have been obtained by reacting attrition milled Zr and B precursor crystallites (10 nm in size). Unfortunately, all of the stoichiometric reaction methods for synthesizing UHTCs employ expensive charge materials, and therefore these methods are not useful for large-scale or industrial applications.|$|E

Of the six tungsten and molybdenum based systems studied, Fe- 14 Mo-C + 4 Cr- 8 Co systems were potentially the most promising. Appropriate compositions were water atomised and additional alloys prepared by blending annealed powders with graphite powders. Powders were compacted to green densities of about 70 % theoretical and then vacuum sintered. <b>Sinterability</b> was assessed in terms of sintered densities and microstructures. Alloys containing Fe- 13 Mo- 1. 3 C, Fe- 14 Mo- 4 Cr- 1. 3 C, and Fe- 14 Mo 8 Co- 4 Cr- 1. 4 C were sintered to full density at temperatures as low as 1170 degrees C, 70 - 150 K lower than for existing HSSs. Sintering windows were 20 - 30 K, a significant improvement on existing HSSs. As sintered microstructures consisted of angular M 6 C carbides dispersed in martensitic matrixes, which is typical for correctly sintered HSS. Heat treatment response and cutting performance for the sinterable grades were assessed and found to be comparable to existing HSS. The cutting performance of Fe- 14 Mo- 8 Co- 4 Cr- 1. 4 C tools at 45 and 52. 5 m min(- 1) was superior to both cast wrought M 2 and T 1 tools of identical geometry.

40|$|Vanadium carbonitrides (VCxN 1 −x) were {{prepared}} via mechanosynthesis from mixtures of elemental vanadium and carbon with different V/C atomic ratios under a nitrogen atmosphere using a high-energy ball mill. We obtained the full composition range of carbonitrides at room temperature. The products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and electron energy loss spectroscopy. The results showed particle-sized products with high <b>sinterability</b> and very high microhardness. Peer reviewe...|$|E
