40|$|We {{encountered}} a rare case of <b>suffocation</b> <b>by</b> an advertising balloon filled with pure helium gas. <b>Suffocation</b> caused <b>by</b> inhalation of atmosphere lacking in oxygen is not exceptional, but reports of death <b>by</b> <b>suffocation</b> {{due to a}} pure inert gas such as helium are very rare. In this case, the balloon mooring on the ground was enclosed, warning signs were displayed, {{and it was clear}} that entering the balloon filled with an atmosphere lacking in oxygen was extremely dangerous and should not be done; the accident did, however, occur. Accidents of this kind may occur in the future unless appropriate education and countermeasures are taken. </p...|$|R

40|$|Unintentional {{deaths from}} {{suffocation}} and strangulation {{account for about}} 20 percent of all nontransport-related infant and child fatalities in the United States. In the late 1950 s, some preventive countermeasures were introduced {{to reduce the number}} of deaths resulting from refrigerator or freezer entrapment. A few years later, countermeasures were introduced to prevent deaths resulting from <b>suffocation</b> <b>by</b> plastic bags, inhumation, and mechanical strangulation from wedging in infant cribs. For three of these major causes of suffocation and strangulation deaths among infants and children (refrigerator or freezer entrapment, <b>suffocation</b> <b>by</b> plastic bag, and inhumation at construction sites), there appears to have been a significant decline in incidence; however, there is no evidence of a significant reduction in deaths from mechanical strangulation in cribs. The impact of current countermeasures is discussed, and some suggestions for new or modified approaches are made...|$|R

5000|$|Earlier, on April 21, 2011, the Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre also {{condemned}} Iran's {{increase in}} public executions.
