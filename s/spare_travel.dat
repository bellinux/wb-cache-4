5000|$|Spare {{would later}} {{claim that the}} German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler took an {{interest}} in his work after one of his portraits was purchased by the German embassy in London. According to this story, (the accuracy of which has never been verified), in 1936 Hitler requested that <b>Spare</b> <b>travel</b> to Berlin to produce a portrait of the Nazi leader, but that Spare refused, remarking that [...] "If you are a superman, let me be forever animal." [...] In the late 1930s, Spare would again tell this story, but changed several components of it, claiming that he had actually traveled to Berlin and produced the portrait, but that he had returned to London with it, where he had actually made use of it in the production of an anti-Nazi artwork. When the Second World War broke out against Nazi Germany in 1939, Spare, an ardent anti-Nazi, tried to enlist into the army, but was deemed too old. In the ensuing Blitz of London by the German Luftwaffe, Spare's flat and all the artwork in it was destroyed by a bomb on 10 May 1941, leaving him homeless. His arms were also injured in the blast. At first taking up residence at the working men's hostel in Walworth Road, he then moved into a sculptor's studio in Spitalfields and finally the Brixton basement of his friend Ada Pain at 5 Wynne Road. In these cramped confines, Spare had to sleep on two chairs in lieu of a bed, and was regularly surrounded by stray cats, whom he fed. Despite his personal problems, with this period marking a growing poverty for Spare, he continued working, and proposed {{the creation of a new}} art journal with his friend, the poet Vera Wainwright, although this never materialised.|$|E
40|$|An {{optimization}} model for contour path in laser processing is established, {{in which the}} minimal <b>spare</b> <b>travel</b> time is taken as objective function and not the shortest path, because the <b>spare</b> <b>travel</b> time decided the processing time. In the problem, two kinds of subpromlems that are the scanning sequence of contours and {{the starting point of}} each contour should be optimized simultaneously. Based on the features, the improved dual coding genetic algorithm is designed to optimize the problem. For the contour shape, the polygon and circle are all taken into account and the coding method that adapted to the problem is designed. In the algorithm operational process, many crossover and mutation methods are designed and also adapted to the problem, so the infeasible solutions are avoided. In order to improve the performance of the algorithm, the computing method of fitness function value is adjusted. The computation result shows that the algorithm is efficiency...|$|E

5000|$|William Harwood came {{onto the}} scene {{too late for the}} [...] "Golden Age" [...] of postcards, but from 1926 to 1958 he {{produced}} probably the finest quality postcards of Criccieth and the surrounding area in North Wales in terms of composition that have ever been produced.Born on 6 April 1883 in Stalybridge, Cheshire, the fifth child of a cotton mule spinner, he initially became an assistant librarian but studied photography and {{spent a great deal of}} his <b>spare</b> time <b>travelling</b> about the Stalybridge area taking photographs.|$|R
50|$|An unconvincing 1-0 {{victory over}} Austria {{did nothing to}} relieve the pressure. However, despite these criticisms, England {{qualified}} for the World Cup finals with one match to <b>spare,</b> and <b>travelled</b> to Germany as group winners, following a 2-1 victory, and a much improved performance against Poland. In January 2006, following revelations made in the News of the World, the FA decided {{to come to an}} agreement with Eriksson over his future. On 23 January 2006, it was announced that Eriksson was to stand down after the 2006 World Cup finals.|$|R

5|$|Argyle {{salvaged}} a late point against Preston North End at {{the start}} of March, but remained in serious trouble at the bottom end of the table, seven points adrift of safety with 13 matches remaining. A 2–0 defeat followed at Queens Park Rangers, with Adel Taarabt playing a part in both of the home sides goals. Draws at Home Park were proving to be an Achilles' heel for Argyle, but they secured a creditable 1–1 draw at play-off chasing Coventry City, having taken the lead through a glancing header from Árnason. Three days later, a 20-yard strike from captain Fletcher earned Argyle their fifth home win of the season in a 3–2 thriller against Bristol City. They had taken a 2–0 lead through Chris Clark and an overhead kick from Bradley Wright-Phillips, his first for the club. However, the visitors responded in the second-half with two goals from Nicky Maynard before former Welsh international Fletcher scored with seconds to <b>spare.</b> Argyle <b>travelled</b> to play Scunthorpe United looking to keep up the momentum, but threw away a lead to be defeated by a deflected effort from Martyn Woolford.|$|R
5000|$|Cory started {{tracking}} down and questioning old Bantu chiefs and any {{survivors of the}} 1820 Settlers. During his <b>spare</b> time he <b>travelled</b> on foot and covered {{large areas of the}} Eastern Cape, amassing an enormous amount of historical data. The magistrate's office in Grahamstown had preserved a large number of letters, bound in volumes, and pertaining to public matters - material giving useful insight into life in the 1800s. The perusal, copying and summarising of these records was tackled by Cory over a number of years. At that time Leander Starr Jameson was prime minister of the Cape Colony and with a bequest made by Alfred Beit, arranged to assist Cory in his investigations, provided that some publication would result. Thus the first volume of The Rise of South Africa appeared in 1910. The success of this volume was such that the Rhodes Trustees sponsored further work and accordingly volumes 2 and 3 were published in 1913 and 1919, volume 4 in 1926 and volume 5 in 1930. Cambridge honoured Cory with a Doctor of Letters in 1921, and the following year he received a knighthood. Volume 6 of his work appeared posthumously in the Archives Year Book for 1939. Some time in 1915 Cory wrote and published, in a small print run, a paper entitled [...] "A short history of slavery at the Cape.” ...|$|R
25|$|In 1782, John Macarthur was {{commissioned}} as an ensign in Fish's Corps, a regiment of the British Army formed {{to serve in}} the American War of Independence. The war ended before the regiment was ready to sail and was disbanded in 1783. On half-pay, Macarthur went to live on a farm near Holsworthy in Devon, where he evidently pursued a program of self-education and became interested in 'rural occupations'. During the next five years Macarthur used his <b>spare</b> time to <b>travel,</b> read, and perhaps contemplate a future at the bar. Instead, in April 1788, Macarthur returned to full-pay army duties, securing a commission as an ensign in the 68th Regiment of Foot (later Durham Light Infantry), a regiment which had been stationed at Gibraltar since 1785. Ensuing negotiations with the War Office resulted in an alternative posting to far-away Sydney, with the New South Wales Corps in 1789. He sailed on the Neptune in the Second Fleet, the 'worst ship in the worst of Australian fleets'. Before the Neptune had even departed the British Isles, Macarthur became involved in disputations with various personnel, including fighting a duel with Captain Gilbert, the Master of the Neptune. The cramped and squalid accommodation provided for his wife and infant son on board the Neptune provoked further disputes. This eventually resulted in his family being transferred mid-voyage and on the high seas, to the Scarborough, another Second Fleet ship.|$|R
5000|$|Xu Jingzong {{himself was}} said to be {{knowledgeable}} of literature in his youth, and, after passing the imperial examination, was made a scribe at Huaiyang Commandery (淮陽, roughly modern Zhoukou, Henan). He was soon made a low level official in the imperial administration of Emperor Wen's son, Emperor Yang. In 618, with virtually the entire Sui state engulfed by agrarian rebellions against Emperor Yang's rule, Xu Shanxin and Xu Jingzong were at Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) with Emperor Yang and his other officials, when Emperor Yang was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. Yuwen was initially planning to spare Xu Shanxin, but after Xu Shanxin publicly refused to submit to him by dancing in his presence (then considered a sign of thanksgiving and submission), Yuwen executed him. Xu Jingzong submitted to Yuwen (by dancing) and was <b>spared.</b> His exact <b>travels</b> after Emperor Yang's death were not clear, although it is known that he later served the rebel ruler Li Mi, the Duke of Wei, as a secretary (along with the future Tang chancellor Wei Zheng), before eventually becoming a subject of the Tang dynasty, which emerged victorious from the civil wars near and after the end of Sui. (Sui's last emperor, Emperor Yang's grandson, Yang Tong, posthumously honored Xu Shanxin by posthumously making him the Duke of Gaoyang — a title that Xu Jingzong would eventually receive from Tang.) ...|$|R
