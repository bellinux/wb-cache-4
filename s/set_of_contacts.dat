25|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} Enigma rotors, each rotor drum of the bombe had two complete sets of contacts, one for input towards the reflector {{and the other}} for output from the reflector, so that the reflected signal could pass back through a separate <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts.</b> Each drum had 104 wire brushes, which made contact with the plate onto which they were loaded. The brushes and the corresponding <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> on the plate were arranged in four concentric circles of 26. The outer pair of circles (input and output) were equivalent to the current in an Enigma passing in one direction through the scrambler, and the inner pair equivalent to the current flowing in the opposite direction.|$|E
2500|$|Post First World War German {{fighters were}} fitted with {{electrical}} synchronizers. [...] In such a gear, a contact or <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts,</b> {{either on the}} propeller shaft itself, or some {{other part of the}} drive train revolving at the same number of revolutions per minute, generates a series of electrical pulses, which are transmitted to a solenoid driven trigger motor at the gun. Experiments with these were underway {{before the end of the}} war, and again the LVG company seems to have been involved: a British intelligence report from 25 June 1918 mentions an LVG two-seater fitted with such a gear that was brought down in the British lines. It is known that LVG built 40 C.IV two-seaters fitted with a Siemens electrical synchronizing system.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{electromagnetic}} relay {{consists of a}} coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core (a solenoid), an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux, a movable iron armature, and one or more <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> (there are two contacts in the relay pictured). The armature is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked {{to one or more}} <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>contacts.</b> The armature is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one <b>of</b> the two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open. Other relays may have more or fewer <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> depending on their function. The relay in the picture also has a wire connecting the armature to the yoke. This ensures continuity of the circuit between the moving contacts on the armature, and the circuit track on the printed circuit board (PCB) via the yoke, which is soldered to the PCB.|$|R
50|$|In a uniselector, the {{stepping}} switch steps only on one axis, {{although there are}} often several <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> in parallel. In other types, such as the Strowger switch, mechanical switching occurs on two directions, across a grid <b>of</b> <b>contacts.</b> The Strowger switch was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888.|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{switches}} {{have one}} or more sets of electrical contacts in a sealed glass envelope that contains a small quantity of mercury. The envelope may also contain air, an inert gas, or a vacuum. Gravity constantly pulls the drop of mercury to the lowest point in the envelope. When the switch is tilted in the appropriate direction, the mercury touches a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts,</b> thus completing an electrical circuit. Tilting the switch {{in the opposite direction}} moves the mercury away from that <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts,</b> breaking that circuit. The switch may contain multiple sets of contacts, closing different sets at different angles, allowing, for example, single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) operation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{solution}} to the problem of grasp analysis and synthesis of 2 D articulated objects with 2 and 3 links considering frictionless <b>contacts.</b> The boundary <b>of</b> each link of the object is represented with a finite <b>set</b> <b>of</b> points.

2500|$|The {{interconnections}} {{within the}} drums {{between the two}} <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> input and output contacts were both identical {{to those of the}} relevant Enigma rotor. There was permanent wiring between the inner two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>of</b> the three input/output plates. From there, the circuit continued to a plugboard located on the left-hand end panel, which was wired to imitate an Enigma reflector and then back through the outer pair <b>of</b> <b>contacts.</b> At each end of the [...] "double-ended Enigma", there were sockets {{on the back of the}} machine, into which 26-way cables could be plugged.|$|R
5000|$|Zero speed {{switches}} (ZSS) {{also known}} as Speed Actuating Sensing Switches are used to detect whether a rotating shaft is turning (even at very slow speeds) [...] in various machines, conveyors, power plants, and in industries involving the production of cement, sugar, textiles, paper, etc. Zero speed switches mainly use electromechanical, electronic, or magnetic proximity technologies. Electromechanical speed switches are direct coupled, speed-indicating devices which open or close a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> mechanically, {{as a function of}} the rotational speed of the switch shaft. Electronic zero speed switches are direct-coupled, speed-indicating devices that open or close a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> through a relay and electronic circuit. User-defined settings and the rotational input speed of the shaft determine the speed at which an electronic zero-speed switch trips.|$|E

40|$|A system {{includes}} a controller and a serial robot having links that are interconnected by a joint, wherein the robot can grasp a three-dimensional (3 D) object {{in response to}} a commanded grasp pose. The controller receives input information, including the commanded grasp pose, a first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> information describing the kinematics of the robot, and a second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> information describing the position of the object to be grasped.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} find contact points on an object surface that are reachable by a given hand and such that the resulting grasp satisfies the force-closure condition. This is a very common problem that still requires a practical solution. The proposed method {{is based on the}} computation <b>of</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> independent <b>contact</b> regions on the object boundary such that a finger contact on each region produces a force-closure grasp, and then this <b>set</b> <b>of</b> regions is iteratively recomputed while looking for a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> points that are reachable by a given hand.

25|$|A relay is an {{electrical}} switch that opens and closes {{under the control}} of another electrical circuit.

50|$|The {{simplest}} type of {{burglar alarm}} control {{consists of a}} single relay. In this type, the sensor circuit (called the loop in industrial terminology) holds the relay energized. Since the path for the loop goes through a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> which are normally open (when the relay is restored they are open, when the relay is energized they are closed), when the loop opens, even momentarily, the relay will drop out and stay that way. A second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> on the relay, normally closed (when the relay is restored they are closed, when the relay is energized they are open) is used to operate the annunciator, usually a bell. The system is disarmed by a key-operated shunt which forces the relay to energize, and is armed by closing all traps and then by opening the shunt. While burglar alarm controls are now very elaborate, the single-relay control incorporates all the functionality of any control. These controls and a closely related dual-relay design are still widely used in stand-alone applications, powered by lead-acid batteries.|$|E
50|$|Each {{current level}} could close a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts,</b> or operate {{solid-state}} logic, {{at the other}} end of the circuit. That contact closure caused a change of state on the controlled device. Some remote control equipment could have options set to allow compatibility between manufacturers. That is, a base station that was configured to transmit with a +18 mA current could have options changed to (instead) make it transmit when +6 mA was present.|$|E

50|$|The Fialka rotor {{assembly}} has 10 rotors mounted on an axle and a 30 by 30 commutator (Kc 30x30).

A punched card is placed between the two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> via a door on the left hand side of the unit. Each punched card has 30 holes, with exactly one hole per row and column pair, and thereby specifies a permutation of the 30 rotor contact lines. This feature is comparable to the plug board on the Enigma machine. A triangular plate was used to enter the null permutation for testing purposes.|$|R
