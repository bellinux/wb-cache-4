5|$|Mrs Rix Nicholas is very {{gifted and}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> own {{individuality}} as an artist; but her personal outlook {{is not so}} much that of an artist with startling things to say... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility.|$|E

5|$|Though Madonna {{is often}} overshadowed by her producers, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> moments, {{and she is}} never more {{inspired}} than on the so-silly-it's-great 'Impressive Instant', yet another homage to the music that leaves her and legions of followers 'spinning, baby, out of control'. She deserves credit for allowing her latest interpretation of that music to be bent, folded and so lovingly mutilated by her collaborators, and when she chirps, 'I like to singy singy singy/Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy', I can envision discos from Stockholm to Sacramento going bonkers with her.|$|E

5|$|The First Lady of the United States is {{the hostess}} of the White House. The {{position}} is traditionally filled by {{the wife of}} the President of the United States, but, on occasion, the title has been applied to women who were not presidents’ wives, such as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when {{the wife of the}} president was unable to fulfill the duties of the First Lady herself. The First Lady is not an elected position; it carries no official duties and receives no salary. Nonetheless, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place of the president. Traditionally, the First Lady does not hold outside employment while occupying the office. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> own staff, including the White House Social Secretary, the Chief of Staff, the Press Secretary, the Chief Floral Designer, and the Executive Chef. The Office of the First Lady is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the two consorts is said to denote the dual nature of Murugan, as the god of heaven and earth. Devasena, the celestial wife, is married in a traditional arranged marriage while the earthy Valli is won by Murugan, resulting in a love marriage. The consorts also represent a syncretism between Shaiva and Vaishnava sects, dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu respectively. The son of Shiva, Kartikeya, becomes the son-in-law of Vishnu, due to the marriages. Both the consorts are identified with the soul (Atman), while their husband (pati, Lord) represents God. The marriage of Devasena conveys Vaishnava ideals, where the soul (Devasena) remains detached from God; <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> own relative autonomy and earns {{the love of the}} god by her own merit. In contrast, the Shaiva philosophy says that God is attached to the soul (Valli) and hence he woos her. The Paripatal contains a Tamil panegyric dedicated to Murugan. It praises him as the god who is allowed to have two wives, Devasena – the daughter of Indra and Valli, a hunter princess. Murugan is described to equally spend his time on earth and in heaven. This is also conveyed by his wives, Devasena is a daughter of the heavens, while Valli is an earthly maiden.|$|E

25|$|The {{two other}} siblings, Molly and Rover, {{appeared}} in the 1991 TV special Snoopy's Reunion; however, Schulz never depicted or named these characters in the comic strip, so these names are {{not considered to be}} canonical.

25|$|Mrs Wilfer – Bella's mother, a {{woman who}} is never {{satisfied}} with what <b>she</b> <b>has.</b> <b>Her</b> haughtiness is apparent in the way she acts at the Boffins's home and when Bella and Rokesmith return after their wedding. Her animosity towards her husband, her greed and discontent contrast with her husband's good nature and provide an image of what Bella could become, should she not change.|$|E

25|$|At her lair, Ingrid {{proceeds}} {{to the next}} part of her plan where she restores the good memories of Emma and Elsa to them while stating {{that they do not}} have it in them to kill her. Anna then arrives with the letter (written by her mother) that revealed the truth of Ingrid and Helga being Elsa and Anna's maternal aunts, while stating that Arendelle deserved to know all about Ingrid and Helga. Ingrid then begins to attack Anna by choking her to death and manages to knock her down. Upon reading the note, a tearful and repentant Ingrid sees that Anna is right as she touches the memory stone which shows her memories of her sisters and begins to regret her actions. Ingrid then undoes the Spell of Shattered Sight by sacrificing her own life. Before she dies, Ingrid states that Emma has found her family and returns the lost memories of Emma and Elsa to them now that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> own younger sisters' love. Ingrid then disappears to the afterlife where she is happy to join her beloved little sisters, Helga and Gerda, there.|$|E
25|$|Ethel {{had never}} had children, a fact that she regretted in her old-age and so Willy became her {{surrogate}} child, and she loves him dearly. Willy goes everywhere that Ethel goes and so she is devastated when he is kidnapped in 1986. She searches for him everywhere and even holds a seance {{to see if she}} can contact him, but Willy is nowhere to be found. Detective Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding) works on the case and eventually finds Willy in the possession of an old Latvian refugee, who has renamed him Rasputin. Willy is returned to an overjoyed Ethel, although she has to pay the man in order to get him to relinquish ownership. Ethel has been a lifelong friend of Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) and the trio remain close in their old-age. They can often be found reminiscing or gossiping in The Queen Victoria public house, where Ethel also regularly thrills the punters with her repartee, her version of the cancan, or her plain sense of fun. Out of the three Ethel is the most light-hearted and she is never frightened {{to stand up to the}} over-bearing Lou and interfering Dot. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> run-ins with both over the years, and yet their friendship endures right to the last.|$|E

25|$|Although Angie {{tries to}} stop drinking, her {{attempts}} always fail dismally {{and by the}} end of the year she is arrested for drink-driving when she crashes Den's car on the way home from a darts match. In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of booze and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as he has more pressing things on his mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Gerard was commemorated by an {{elaborate}} memorial in Ashley parish church, which grew and was modified over several generations. The main structure, built {{under the supervision}} of Gilbert's son, Thomas, portrays him and Anne, lying in splendour. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> Talbot dog at her side, while he is in full armour, an uncharacteristic garb for him, with a finely modelled gauntlet at his side. Beneath the Gerards is a cadaver, but, unlike the case of a normal cadaver tomb, it appears to date from an earlier period. The kneeling figure of Thomas Gerard looms over his parents at the head end, vigilant but not in prayer. A smaller kneeling and praying figure, said to be the younger son Ratcliffe, is placed {{at the feet of the}} couple. Both kneeling figures are completely free-standing and detached from the main structure, clearly added later and at the sacrifice of part of its moulded edge. The four daughters of Gilbert and Anne, all of whom survived their parents, are portrayed on a separate rear panel. Two more smaller kneeling and praying female figures, free-standing and detached, are placed to the front of the main structure - possibly daughters who predeceased their parents, but more likely of a later generation. The monument is surmounted by a vast, densely decorated alabaster canopy, displaying the armorial bearings of the Gerards and Radcliffes.|$|E

Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, [...] " [...] does her thing. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>her</b> own way of doing it. She has an ill [...] vocal delivery.
