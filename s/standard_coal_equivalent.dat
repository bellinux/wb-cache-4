In response to this problem, the first demonstration project of an energy and resource efficient campus was established at Tongji University in 2007. It later successfully drove other Chinese universities to build energy and resource efficient campuses.

About 738. 8 Â tons of crop residues are produced in this village each year. In 2005, only two cattle were fed in this village and 1. 1 % of the crop residues were used as forage. About 38. 5 % crop residues were used for livelihood energy, 24. 5 % were discarded and 29. 7 % were directly burned in the field. Not more than three biogas digesters were built and merely 2250 Â m 3 biogas was produced a year relative to saving 1. 6 Â tons <b>standard</b> <b>coal</b> and <b>equivalent</b> to reducing 4. 3 Â tons CO 2 emission. A total of US$ 4491 profits were obtained from cattle benefit, reducing fossil energies/chemical fertilizer application and increasing crop yield. After 5 years experiment, cattle capita had raised gradually up to 146 and some 62. 3 % crop residues were used as forage. The percentages used as livelihood energy, discarded and burned in the field decreased to 16. 3 %, 9. 2 % and 9. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} in China has attracted considerable research interest {{since the middle}} 1990 s. This is largely prompted by the environmental ramifications of the extensive use of fossil fuels {{in the country to}} propel two decades of high economic growth. Since the late 1980 s, there has been an increasing awareness {{on the part of the}} Chinese government of the imperative for the balance of economic growth and environmental protection. The government has since taken various measures ranging from encouraging energy-saving practice, controlling waste discharges to financing R & D programs on improving energy efficiency. Against this backdrop has seen a constant decline of the energy intensity of the economy, measured as the ratio of total energy consumed in <b>standard</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the real GDP since 1989. Using the 1987 and 1997 input-output tables for China, the present study examines the impact of technical and structural changes in the economy on industry fuel consumption over the 10 -year period. Technical changes are reflected in changes in direct input-output coefficients, which capture the technical evolvement of intermediate production processes. Structural changes refer to shifts in the pattern of final demand for energy, including the import and export composition of various fuels. Six fuels are included in the study, namely, coal, oil, natural gas, electricity, petroleum and coke and gas, which cover all of the energy types available in the input-output tables.

This study was performed to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation in residue quantities of field crops in five provinces of North China (NC) and three provinces of Northeast China (NEC). The availability of biomass resources was derived from statistical data on crop yields for all crops on the provincial and even county level. We found that cereals – wheat, maize, and rice – were the biggest resource of crop residue feedstock. The ranking of these crops {{as a source of}} biomass for bioenergy is determined by the acreage in each region and the crop-specific yield. Annually, the average amount of total residue of 83. 0 Mt (Mt = Mega tonnes) in NC (16. 9 Million ha) comprised 76. 6 Mt field residues and 6. 4 Mt process residues on an air-dried basis. The average amount of total biomass residue of 105. 7 Mt in NEC (19. 8 Million ha) comprised 92. 8 Mt field residues and 12. 9 Mt process residues.

Excessive energy inputs not only inflict damage on the environment, but also hinder the restructuring of the energy industry.

Yet there is limited data on {{energy consumption}} patterns and their evolution in forest rural areas of China. In order to bridge this gap, we report the findings of field surveys in forest vilages in Weichang County as a case study of rural energy consumption in northern China. We found that the residential energy consumption per household is 3313 kgce yr- 1 (kilogram <b>standard</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> per year), with energy content of 9. 7 × 107 kJ yr- 1, including 1783 kgce yr- 1 from coal, 1386 kgce yr- 1 from fuel wood, 96 kgce yr- 1 from electricity, and 49 kgce yr- 1 from LPG. Per capita consumption is 909 kgce yr- 1 and its energy content is 2. 7 × 107 kJ yr- 1. Due to a total energy utilization eficiency of 24. 6 %, al the consumed energy can only supply about 2. 4 × 107 kJ yr- 1 of eficient energy content. Secondly, household energy consumption is partitioned into 2614 kgce yr- 1 for heating, 616 kgce yr- 1 for cooking, and 117 kgce yr- 1 for home appliances. Thirdly, the associated carbon emissions per household are 2556 kgC yr- 1, including 1022 kgC yr- 1 from unutilized fuel wood (90 % of the total fuel wood). The rest of emissions come from the use of electricity (212 kgC yr- 1), coal (1301 kgC yr- 1) and LPG (21 kgC yr- 1). Fourthly, local climate, family size and household income have strong influences on rural residential energy consumption. Changes in storage and utilization practices of fuel can lead to the 10 %- 30 % increase in the eficiency of fuel wood use, leading to reduced energy consumption by 924 kgce yr- 1 per household (27. 9 % reduction) and 901 kgC yr- 1 of carbon emissions (35. 3 % reduction) ...|$|E

This study is {{an assessment of the}} availability of field crop residues for bioenergy feedstocks in northwest China (NWC) and southwest China (SWC). The amount of field crop residues was calculated by analyzing statistical data on crop acreages and yields at the provincial and county levels in the NWC and SWC regions. Total residue mass varied from 58. 1 to 62. 0 million tons (Mt) in NWC and from 92. 8 to 97. 2 Mt in SWC from 2008 to 2010. Field residues accounted for 86 % in NWC and 94 % in SWC of the total residue mass; the process residue mass accounted for 14 and 6 % of the total residue mass in the NWC and SWC, respectively. In the NWC region, wheat, maize, and cotton were the main crops, providing 17. 0, 14. 0, and 8. 1 Mt of the field residue mass, respectively. In the SWCregion, rice, maize, and canola provided 30. 6, 15. 2, and 9. 7 Mt of the total residue mass, respectively. In NWC, maize cob (1. 98 Mt) and cotton seed hull (1. 93 Mt) formed the majority of the process residues. In SWC, rice hull (5. 9 Mt), maize cob (3. 7 Mt), and sugarcane bagasse (3. 2 Mt) were the main contributors. Most crop residues became available from August to September in the NWC region, whereas harvesting was spread over the whole year in the SWC region.
