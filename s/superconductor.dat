In superconducting rings, the electrical current responds to a magnetic flux by having a periodicity of h/ 2 e, where the ratio of Plancks constant and the elementary charge defines the magnetic flux quantum h/e.

Since the appearance of heavy fermion <b>superconductors,</b> organic <b>superconductors,</b> high Tc cuprate <b>superconductors,</b> Sr 2 RuO 4, the gap symmetry has been the central issue for these new <b>superconductors.</b> In the last few years, Izawa et al. have succeeded in identifying the energy gap in Sr 2 RuO 4, CeCoIn 5, κ-(ET) 2 Cu(NCS) 2, YNi 2 B 2 C and PrOs 4 Sb 12 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In these works the angular dependent thermal conductivity in the vortex state of nodal <b>superconductors</b> has played the crucial role [6, 7].
