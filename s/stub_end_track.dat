25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the {{southbound}} express track was extended from south of Dyre Avenue {{and connected to}} the <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> <b>track</b> at Pelham Parkway. The southbound track at Dyre Avenue is {{in the position of}} the southbound express track, as the southbound local track is no longer present. The current platform is built over the northbound express track. Small portions of the original side platforms remain on both sides of Dyre Avenue station. South of Dyre Avenue station, the southbound track moves over to the local position and the southbound express track begins.|$|E
50|$|Today's {{infrastructure}} of the station consists of the station building, two low-lying through passenger platforms and one cargo platform, walking bridge over south yard neck. Station layout consists of 8 <b>tracks</b> including 2 <b>stub</b> <b>ended</b> <b>tracks</b> (the first six tracks are electrified 25 kV AC system).|$|R
50|$|December 15, 1977: {{extended}} to the North Station Canal St. terminal which was reconfigured with three <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> <b>tracks</b> replacing the turning loop. The Riverside line terminated here {{most of the time}} {{over the next few years}} as it was the only line scheduled with all double ended equipment (Boeing LRVs). Any PCC cars on the line looped at Government Center.|$|R
50|$|Drumburgh {{remained}} open as {{a station}} and passing {{point on the}} Silloth branch until it closed on 4 July 1955, some years before Silloth railway station. A <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of <b>track</b> was left in place running towards Glasson.|$|R
5000|$|This {{station has}} two tracks and two side platforms. South of this station, {{there are two}} center <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>ending</b> at bumper blocks used for {{laying-up}} and relaying trains. Further south, the two tracks of the BMT Nassau Street Line merge with the BMT Broadway Line via a flying junction as it enters the Montague Street Tunnel into Downtown Brooklyn. No regular service has used this connection since the [...] train was re-routed from the Nassau Street Line to the IND Sixth Avenue Line in June 2010.|$|R
5000|$|A lap-joint flange {{is similar}} to a slip-on, with room at the {{intersection}} of the bore and the flange face for a lap <b>stub</b> <b>end.</b> The face of the <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> conforms to the gasket face of the flange. It is used where sections of piping need to be dismantled quickly and easily for inspection or replacement.|$|R
50|$|While Michigan Central was an {{independent}} {{subsidiary of the}} New York Central System, passenger trains were staged from Illinois Central's Central Station as a tenant. When MC operations were completely integrated into NYC in the 1950s, trains were re-deployed to NYC's LaSalle Street Station home, where other NYC trains such as the 20th Century Limited were staged. IC sued for breach of contract and won because the MC had a lease that ran {{for a few more}} years. The MC route from Chicago to Porter, Indiana, is now mostly gone. The Kensington Interchange, shared with the South Shore Line, was cut out. These tracks now belong to Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, and are overgrown <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>ending</b> short of the interchange. Amtrak trains serving the Michigan Central Detroit line now use the former NYC to Porter, where they turn north on Michigan Central. Passenger equipment was mostly similar to that of parent New York Central System. Typically this meant an EMD E-series locomotive and Pullman-Standard lightweight rolling stock. Because General Motors was a large customer of Michigan Central, use of Alco or General Electric locomotives was less common.|$|R
5000|$|... 1979 - line {{abandoned}} between <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> at Shrewsbury {{road and}} Fort Dix. Conrail {{would continue to}} only service Fort Dix, until 1981, using the old PRR trackage rights.|$|R
5000|$|Westwood Circle {{was located}} at the five-pointed {{junction}} of north <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of [...] "the Boulevard", and the through streets of Hermitage Road and Westwood Avenue. Although also heavily congested, this circle {{did not have the}} through truck traffic of McGuire Circle and was less notorious for serious collisions.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} at the {{southeast}} corner of a 1 acre lot with a noncontributing swimming pool and outbuilding. Although it fronts on the <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of Division Street (which once continued west to a dock) and is parallel with the other houses on that street, its address is Water Street.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1975, Milwaukee County Executive John Doyne {{proposed}} connecting this freeway {{with the}} Stadium North <b>stub</b> <b>end,</b> existing 4 mi to the south. While this [...] "Gap Closure" [...] {{has not been}} built to date due to public opposition, the current state trunk highway map shows a freeway planned for this corridor.|$|R
6000|$|Thursday Smith {{took off}} his jacket--a cheap khaki affair--and rolled up his sleeves. Then he {{carefully}} looked over the press and found the damaged nippers. Without a word {{he picked up a}} wrench, released the <b>stub</b> <b>ends</b> of the broken fingers, gathered the pieces in his hand and asked: [...] "Where is there a carpenter shop?" ...|$|R
50|$|The Route 128/I-93/I-95 {{interchange}} {{was nearly}} completed, leaving unused ramps {{north of the}} interchange and two unused bridges which were later removed. In 1973, the state planned to build a 300-space parking garage - to be served by express buses to Boston, Providence, and Logan Airport - on the <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of I-95 just inside Route 128. However, the project was unpopular with residents in Milton.|$|R
50|$|RM 1826 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with RM 150 {{just north of}} Driftwood. The route proceeds northeast 8.4 mi, entering Travis County to intersect the <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of the southern segment of SH 45. It continues northeast 3.7 mi along the Austin city limits to its northern terminus, along US 290 west of its intersection with SH 71 in the Oak Hill neighborhood of Austin.|$|R
2500|$|On October 29, 1989, the IND 63rd Street Line was opened. It was {{nicknamed the}} [...] "tunnel to nowhere" [...] {{due to its}} <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> at 21st Street–Queensbridge, and also {{due to the fact}} that the three-station {{extension}} lay dormant for over a decade after completion. The 3.2 mile line included three new stations and cost a total of $868 million. The line was viewed as an enormous waste of money.|$|R
25|$|In the {{workshop}} itself are two through-running lines (numbered 8 and 9) and line 10, a <b>stub</b> <b>end.</b> All lines have inspection pits and line 8 possesses a Hegenscheidt wheel lathe. This machine allows wheel turning whilst {{both sets of}} doors are closed. The wheelsets are turned in situ. High level access is provided on lines 9 and 10 for servicing of equipment boxes and pantographs. An automated washing machine is located on line 7.|$|R

50|$|FM 1954 {{was first}} {{designated}} in 1952. Its western terminus {{has always been}} at FM 368 at Holliday, and its original east end was at SH 79. The route was lengthened to US 281 in 1962. The extension into Clay county and to Lake Arrowhead State Park occurred in 1968, and the roadway ended within the park. This <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> became part of PR 63 in 1973, when FM 1954 was extended northward to its current terminus at its second intersection with FM 2393.|$|R
50|$|After a {{disastrous}} 1903 {{accident in the}} Park Avenue Tunnel the New York legislature passed a law banning steam locomotives within the city limits effective in 1908. Seeing an opportunity, the railroad decided this could mean a chance to completely rebuild its congested Midtown Manhattan <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> terminal and yard facilities. The electrification project would see not only {{the construction of the}} Grand Central Terminal itself, but miles of completely underground platforms and yard tracks which {{would not have been possible}} with exhaust producing steam locomotives.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{improved}} {{version of}} unit-cell {{for the design}} of composite right left transmission line (CRLH TL) is reported in this paper. Comparative results of both conventional design of unit-cell and proposed design of unitcell for CRLH TLs are presented in this article. The conventional unit-cell is designed based on inter digitalcapacitor (IDC) in series and vias to the ground plane at the <b>stub</b> <b>ends</b> in shunt, whereas proposed unit-cell is designed based on wire bonded interdigital capacitor (WBIDC) in series and vias to the ground plane at the <b>stub</b> <b>ends</b> in shunt. Use of WBIDC in the proposed unit-cell improves high frequency performance by reducing undesired self resonances generated in IDC at lower frequency end. A simple technique is also used in both designs to miniaturize the unit-cell profiles. Dispersion diagrams of the unit-cells show the presence of self resonances in the conventional IDC based unit-cell and absence of such self resonances in the proposed WBIDC based unit-cell, which causes the wider operational frequency band of WBIDC based unit-cell. The performances of both unit-cells are compared from dispersion curve and S - parameters characteristics. The frequency parameter and performance of the both unit-cells are evaluated by full-wave electromagnetic simulator using Ansoft Designer, based on method of moment...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} [...] wide and [...] long, and contained four tracks and was approached through {{a pair of}} iron gates. It consisted of three tracks leading into two platforms as a <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of a viaduct. The station was originally entirely exposed to the weather, though the platforms were later covered with a wooden trussed pitched roof, , shortly after opening. Sixteen columns and fourteen beams from this structure were retrieved in 2013 and given to the Vale of Rheidol Railway in Aberystwyth, Wales {{for use in a}} planned railway museum.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Loop {{elevated}} in 1897, the Lake Street Elevated's eastern terminus was the Market Terminal at Madison Street and Market Street. After the opening of the Loop in 1897, service continued to the Market Street stub, which had a stop at Randolph & Market in addition to the terminal at Madison & Market. Service to the Market Street <b>stub</b> <b>ended</b> on April 4, 1948, as the CTA implemented its new A/B skip-stop service. The Market Street stub was demolished soon after to make way for construction of Wacker Drive.|$|R
50|$|Opposition to the Embarcadero Freeway continued, and in 1985, the Board of Supervisors {{voted to}} {{demolish}} it. It was closed after sustaining heavy damage in 1989's Loma Prieta earthquake and torn down shortly thereafter. The entire {{portion of the}} Central Freeway north of Market Street was demolished over the next decade: the top deck in 1996, and the lower deck in 2003. Two other short freeway segments were demolished {{in the same time}} period: the Terminal Separator Structure near Rincon Hill and the Embarcadero Freeway, and the <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of Interstate 280 near Mission Bay.|$|R
5000|$|The Center City Commuter Connection, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "the commuter tunnel", is a passenger railroad tunnel in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, built to connect the <b>stub</b> <b>ends</b> of the two separate regional commuter rail systems, originally operated by two rival railroad companies: the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. All of the SEPTA Regional Rail lines except for the Cynwyd Line pass completely through the four-track tunnel, which contains two underground stations, Suburban Station and Jefferson Station, and the above-ground upper-level concourse for the east-west commuter lines serving 30th Street Station.|$|R
50|$|Jamaica Center-Parsons/Archer was not {{intended}} to be the lines' northern terminal, as there are spurs on both levels for possible future extensions. On the lower level, they continue one train length and end with at bumper blocks. This was a planned extension toward 190th Street-Hollis Avenue. Where the lower level <b>tracks</b> <b>end,</b> there is a provision for a diamond crossover switch {{at the end of the}} tunnel (under 160th Street). On the upper level, the tracks curve south to run under 160th Street and stop at about South Road, also ending at bumper blocks. The plan was for this line to use the LIRR Atlantic Branch ROW and run to Springfield Boulevard or Rosedale. Where the upper level <b>tracks</b> <b>stub</b> <b>end,</b> there is a provision for a portal to go outside if the line going to Southeastern Queens is ever built. The tail tracks on both levels are currently used for storage.|$|R

50|$|Formal {{open space}} in the {{district}} {{is limited to the}} small Hudson-Jay Park between those two streets near South Swan and the loop at the aborted <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of the South Mall Arterial, and the very small Dana Park on Delaware Square where Delaware Avenue and Lark merge at Madison. However, many of the houses in the district have large backyards. Vacant lots, not all of which have been converted into parking lots, also provide breaks in development. Many streets have been lined with mature trees to further provide shade and calm traffic. Some retain their original cobblestone or brick pavement, and crosswalks have been paved that way in other areas.|$|R
50|$|Myrtle-Wyckoff Avenues on the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line (originally named Wyckoff Avenue) is an {{elevated}} station located entirely in Brooklyn (unlike the Canarsie Line station, {{which is located}} partially in Brooklyn and partially in Queens). At {{the time of its}} opening on December 19, 1889, it had a single island platform with two tracks. Originally, the line <b>stub</b> <b>ended</b> at the original Wyckoff station which was past the present curve that is just east of this station. It was subsequently extended in 1906 to the street level right-of-way to Metropolitan Avenue, and again in the 1910s during the Dual Contracts era onto the present elevated structure.|$|R

25|$|On {{its eastern}} end, NY5S was {{gradually}} truncated {{to its current}} terminus in Rotterdam as portions of I-890 was built over the former routing of NY5S between Rotterdam and Schenectady. The first cutback occurred in the early 1970s following the completion of I-890 between downtown Schenectady and exit4. The freeway was completed between the New York State Thruway (I-90) and Schenectady in the mid-1970s, resulting in the truncation of NY5S to I-890 exit2. It was truncated to its current eastern terminus at I-890 (now NY890) in the late 1980s after a reconfiguration of the interchange between the Thruway and I-890 resulted in the removal of River Road between I-890 and the current <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of Rice Road.|$|R
