In addition to unpolarized atoms, laser-oriented and laser-aligned Cr atoms, prepared by optical pumping, were studied. The comparison of the Cr 2 p photoelectron spectrum of the unpolarized atoms with different theoretical approaches allowed for a characterization of the final ionic states. The strong influence of <b>satellite</b> <b>emission</b> is shown. The LMDAD (linear magnetic dichroism in the angular distribution) of the oriented and the LD (linear dichroism) of the aligned Cr atoms display the characteristic dichroism patterns. These patterns can be explained within a model developped for innershell ionization. The influence of <b>satellite</b> <b>emission</b> can be described {{with the aid of}} Hartree-Fock calculations. From the comparison of the normalized dichroism to theoretical results, information on the Cr 2 p photoionization dynamics could be extracted. The close similarity of LMDAD in free and bound Cr atoms of a thin magnetized surface layer emphasizes the importance of intraatomic effects in the magnetic 2 p dichroism.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} electroluminescence (EL) spectral intensity has been investigated in detail between T= 20 and 300 K at various injection current levels {{for a set of}} two blue InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with and without an additional n-doped In 0. 18 Ga 0. 82 N electron reservoir layer (ERL). The radiative recombination efficiency of the main blue emission band (~ 480 nm) is found to be significantly improved at all temperature regions and current levels when the additional ERL is introduced. For high injection currents If, i. e., large forward bias voltages Vf, a quenching of the EL intensity is observed for T< 100 K for both LED structures, accompanying appearance of short-wavelength <b>satellite</b> <b>emissions</b> around 380 – 430 nm. Furthermore, the low-temperature intensity reduction of the main EL band is stronger for the LED without the ERL than with the ERL. For low If, i. e., small Vf, however, no quenching of the EL intensity is observed for both LEDs even below 100 K and the short-wavelength <b>satellite</b> <b>emissions</b> are significantly reduced. These results of the main blue emission and the short-wavelength satellite bands imply that the unusual evolution of the EL intensity with temperature and current is caused by variations of the actual potential field distribution due to both internal and external fields. They significantly influence the carrier capture efficiency by radiative recombination centers within the active MQW layer and the carrier escape out of the active regions into high-energy recombination centers responsible for the short-wavelength <b>satellite</b> <b>emissions...</b>|$|R

In 5 sources, <b>satellite</b> line <b>emission</b> is detected, with 3 of the 5 sources re-detections of previously published sources. The 2 sources with new detections of <b>satellite</b> line <b>emission</b> are IRAS F 10173 + 0829, which was detected at 1720 MHz, and IRAS F 15107 + 0724, for which both the 1612 MHz and 1720 MHz lines were detected. In IRAS F 15107 + 0724, the satellite lines are partially conjugate, as 1720 MHz absorption and 1612 MHz emission have the same structure at some velocities within the source, along with additional broader 1612 MHz emission.

This orbital period range between approximately 3 and 4 hours is the preferred land for the elusive SW Sextantis stars, which are believed to be about to enter the gap when their donor stars become fully convective. Despite their main role in our understanding of the whole picture of cataclysmic variable evolution, the study of their component stars is almost impossible due to the extreme veiling brightness of the accretion disc during the high state.

40|$|Abstract: We {{calculate}} the fluorescence of electron spins {{confined to a}} plane and driven into resonance by a magnetic field gradient and a constant magnetic field applied {{at right angles to}} each other. We solve the equation of motion of two-dimensional electrons in the magnetic field gradient to derive the dispersion curve of spin oscillators, the amplitude of electron oscillations, the effective magnetic field sensed by the electron spin, and the rate at which electrons are injected from an electrode into spin oscillators. We then switch on the interaction between the spin magnetic dipole and the electromagnetic field to find the fluorescence power radiated by the individual spin oscillators. The rate of radiative decay is first derived, followed by the probability of sequential photon emission whereby a series of spontaneous decays occurs at random times separated by intervals during which the spin performs Rabi oscillations. The quantum correlations between random radiative decays manifest as bursts of emission at regular intervals along the wire. We integrate all multiphoton processes to obtain an exact analytical expression for the radiated electromagnetic power. The present theory obtains all parameters of the problem including magnetodipole coupling, the particle dwell time in the magnetic field gradient, and the spin polarization of the incoming current. The output power contains a fine structure arising from the anharmonicity of electron oscillations and from nonlinear optical effects which both give <b>satellite</b> <b>emission</b> peaks at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency...|$|E
