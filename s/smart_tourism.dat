Smart industry {{is one of}} the important forces to escape the dilemma. On the other hand, with the rapid growth of Chinese citizens’ consumption level, their demands for travelling experience is also increasing strongly and becoming more accurate. What’s more, in recent years, the acceleration of Chinese tourism industry development has slowed down, meaning while, research shows that the growth of middle class will grow in the future.

40|$|International audienceAmong {{multiple}} services delivered over future mobile networks, {{the most}} demanding (from the required bandwidth point of view) are related to media streaming, which is a key component in <b>smart</b> applications (entertainment, <b>tourism,</b> surveillance, etc.). Such applications have to exploit {{a considerable amount of}} data, which is difficult to achieve especially in dense urban environments. In this context, the article presents a new solution for HTTP-compliant adaptive media streaming applicable to future 5 G mobile networks, aimed at increasing bandwidth availability through the use of multiple radio access technologies and direct connections between devices if they are in proximity of each other. The proposed solution considers a scenario in which a high-quality media stream is received by multipath transmission through the radio access network. Collaboration of neighboring devices is exploited by using direct device-to-device links. Thus, proxy nodes can be inserted between a given media receiver and an access network. Toward ensuring optimized resource allocation at both levels, base station-to-device and device-to-device, this article introduces the architectural modules required for collaboration streaming inside the radio access network and end user's device, and proposes enhancements in HTTP-compliant adaptive streaming protocols in order to become suitable for a multipath collaborative scenario...|$|R
40|$|PosterSince 2009, an Interreg IVA project (123 Chablais), {{dealing with}} the {{promotion}} of natural and cultural heritage in the Chablais area, has been developed. It {{is linked to the}} creation of the Chablais Geopark. In a context of development of <b>smart</b> forms of <b>tourism,</b> the objective was to develop a strategy promoting the glacial heritage to a wide public in an area where the glaciers have almost disappeared. The recognition of specific places as geoheritage is the result of a double process: a scientific one, based on more or less sophisticated methods, and a social one, that is the acknowledgment by the society. One of the first scientific tasks is to produce a list of "potential geosites" that will be assessed in more details. However, this selection is often a weak point of inventories. It often seems like a "black box" without any transparency. In this project (123 Chablais) we carried out an inventory of glacial geosites, using the method developed by Reynard et al. (2007, 2012). However, a method has been created to enlighten the selection process, and to enhance choices in geoheritage management. As it was not possible to consider all sites in the Chablais area, a mixed selection approach was developed, halfway between completeness and specificity (Martin, 2012). The first step was the creation of a list of "points of interest", established using different sources: literature review, fieldwork and use of GIS to cross information. A selection was then performed according to two criteria: correspondence with a glacial stage (time axis) and belonging to a type of forms (spatial axis). Finally, selected sites aimed at providing a representative overview of the regional glacial witnesses. Therefore, representative sites of the regional geology were selected as well as sites presenting regional peculiarities Temporal and spatial attributes were given to the 101 points of interest identified. From a temporal point of view, this inventory aimed at presenting the main stages of the glacial retreat since the Last Glacial Maximum. From a spatial point of view, the objective was to show the different types of glacial remnants, but also some landforms related to deglaciation processes. Finally, 32 glacial and associated geosites were selected. Each geosite was submitted to a full evaluation process, including basis information, description, explanation of morphogenesis and an evaluation of values assigned to geosites. This assessment, first qualitative, provided valuable information concerning their intrinsic interest and their management. A numerical evaluation was also assessed to classify geosites and define an order of priority for their touristic promotion. It is worth to be noted that each selected points of interest can in fact be qualified as a geosite, using a clear method of selection. In this study, the numerical evaluation is not a mean to select geosites but a way to rank one geosite to another. Some geosites can be abandoned if intrinsic values are too low. Despite a well-defined protocol, the subjectivity and authors' choices are part of the selection process and inventory. This fact is certainly not a weakness. It must be considered whenever such inventory is made. Reference : Martin, S. (2012).

40|$|Considering {{that the}} core {{concerns}} in sustainability are threats {{to the survival of}} humankind and the ecosystems that humans depend on, changing the consumption and production behaviors of individuals and society is inevitable. However, people are reluctant to change their own behavior in support of sustainability goals. This tendency seems to be especially strong in tourism because the main value of tourism is hedonic utility. Thus, the tourism industry is now introducing gamification and <b>smart</b> <b>tourism</b> to shift tourist behavior toward sustainability, but most of studies and practices only focus on the performance and application of gamification without considering customer adoption patterns and perceptions during the process. This study empirically investigated what factors affect the adoption of <b>smart</b> <b>tourism</b> applications that incorporate game elements, using the Google Maps tourist guide program. As an initial approach, we incorporated diverse theoretical approaches: perceived usefulness; perceived ease of use; perceived enjoyment from technology acceptance model; information and interaction motivations from the uses and gratifications theory; the network effect; distributive justice; flow as responses to the game characteristics of <b>smart</b> <b>tourism</b> applications; and information privacy concerns as a negative factor for diffusion. The result showed that hedonic characteristics of the gamified <b>smart</b> <b>tourism</b> application (GSTA) are strong in adoption. Perceived enjoyment had a significant influence on the intention to use, but information quality, related to cognitive experience, did not. The flow and perceived distributive justice associated with the game content were not significant, but the interaction motivation was significant in the research model. The results of this study show that individuals regard a GSTA as a low-level game tool. Also, it is important to preoccupy the <b>smart</b> <b>tourism</b> application market in terms of marketing strategy because the network effect is relevant to both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. We also found that the need to provide personal information would negatively affect the adoption of a gamified <b>smart</b> <b>tourism</b> application...|$|E
