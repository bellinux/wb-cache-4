5|$|The writers {{considered}} introducing {{about six}} personality cores stored in portable spheres, whose main function would be story advancement. They planned cores based on Morgan Freeman's character Red from The Shawshank Redemption and Quint from Jaws, among others. Ultimately {{they decided to}} concentrate on a <b>single</b> <b>core,</b> Wheatley, recycling two of the rejected cores in the final boss fight. Karen Prell led the animation team for Wheatley and the other personality cores.|$|E
5|$|Other {{issues with}} regards to crashes, {{temporary}} freezes and long load times were found on <b>single</b> <b>core</b> computers, but these were ultimately addressed in a patch. A second patch, which reduced the amount mining time required to acquire upgrades, fixed some saved game loading issues, and addressed other minor bugs, was also released. On PlayStation 3, a concerning number of players reported that their save files can become corrupted if the game crashes unexpectedly. After community chief Chris Priestly of BioWare asked affected players to provide details about the issue, BioWare released a PlayStation 3 patch designed to combat save bugs and crashes experienced.|$|E

25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a <b>single</b> <b>core,</b> similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a <b>single</b> <b>core</b> scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E

30|$|The mean {{coefficient}} of variation of 7.5 % can be considered to slightly overstate the true variation among trees as {{it is based on}} a <b>single</b> small <b>core</b> sample per tree, and therefore includes an element of within-tree variation. A variance component analysis was applied to the 20 stands where two cores were taken per tree (from opposite sides of the stem) to estimate the between- and within-tree variance components which were 997 and 177 respectively. These results show that inter-tree variation is large relative to within-tree variation in a typical stand. However, they also show that the true inter-tree variation expressed as a standard deviation would be 8 % lower than the variation measured using <b>single</b> <b>cores.</b> This indicates that for modelling purposes, an inter-tree {{coefficient of}} variation of 6.9 % (rather than 7.5 %) is appropriate. This value is, therefore, used in the Forecaster simulation system which stochastically varies wood density among stems within a simulation, thus providing a realistic level of variation in wood density among logs at harvest.|$|R

Unlike the other A5 variants, this version of the A5 is not a package-on-package (PoP), having no stacked RAM. The chip is very small, just 37.8 mm2, but as the decrease in size is not due to a decrease in feature size (it is still on a 32 nm fabrication process), this indicates that this A5 revision is of a new design.
