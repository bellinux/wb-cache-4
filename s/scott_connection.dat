50|$|A Scott-T {{transformer}} (also {{called a}} <b>Scott</b> <b>connection)</b> {{is a type}} of circuit used to derive two-phase electric power (2-φ, 90-degree phase rotation) from a three-phase (3-φ, 120-degree phase rotation) source, or vice versa. The <b>Scott</b> <b>connection</b> evenly distributes a balanced load between the phases of the source. The Scott three-phase transformer was invented by a Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott in the late 1890s to bypass Thomas Edison's more expensive rotary converter and thereby permit two-phase generator plants to drive three-phase motors.|$|E

50|$|At {{this time}} {{two-phase}} motor loads also existed and the <b>Scott</b> <b>connection</b> allowed connecting them to newer three-phase supplies with the currents equal {{on the three}} phases. This was valuable for getting equal voltage drop and thus feasible regulation of the voltage from the electric generator (the phases cannot be varied separately in a three-phase machine). Nikola Tesla's original polyphase power system was based on simple-to-build two-phase four-wire components. However, as transmission distances increased, the more transmission-line efficient three-phase system became more common. (Three phase power can be transmitted with only three wires, where the two-phase power systems required four wires, two per phase.) Both 2-φ and 3-φ components coexisted {{for a number of}} years and the Scott-T transformer connection allowed them to be interconnected.|$|E

50|$|Two-phase motors draw {{constant}} power {{the same as}} three-phase motors, so a balanced two-phase load is converted to a balanced three-phase load. However if the two-phase load is not balanced (more power on one phase than the other), the Scott-T transformer (or any connection of transformers) cannot fix this. Unbalanced current on the two-phase side causes unbalanced current on the three-phase side. As the typical 2 phase load was a motor, equality of the current in the 2 phases was inherently presumed during the Scott development. In modern times people have tried to revive the <b>Scott</b> <b>connection</b> {{as a way to}} power single-phase electric railways from 3 phase Utility supplies. This will not result in balanced current on the 3 phase side as it is unlikely that 2 different railway sections connected as the 2 phases will at all times conform to the Scott presumption of being equal. The instantaneous difference in loading on the 2 sections will be seen as an imbalance in the 3 phase supply; there is no ability to smooth it out.|$|E
40|$|Four-phase {{transmission}} systems, {{which have}} been deeply investigated in several recent papers, are recognized as a possible alternative to traditional three-phase transmission lines. However, {{the problem of the}} phase transformation between the three-phase and the four-phase section, which is not a new theme in the relevant literature, exhibits some troubles especially in the choice of the most convenient typology of the needed special transformers. First of all the paper examines the underlying principles of the old Parton’s theory of phase transformation. Second, according to this theory new potential solutions are derived and investigated. Hence the (double) <b>Scott</b> <b>connection</b> which, in any case, continues to be familiar to most electrical engineers, is examined and framed in the theory of phase transformation.

40|$|Four-phase {{transmission}} {{lines have been}} recently proposed and studied {{as an alternative to}} the traditional threephase lines. The identification of the best transformer typology to link the three-phase and four-phase system sections is still an open problem, despite some specific solutions were proposed. However, these solutions were not included in a general framework yet. Resorting to the classic Parton’s theory of phase transformation and to a rigorous mathematical approach, this study provides a general framework for the specific problem in study. After having recalled the underlying principles of the Parton’s theory of phase transformation, by formulating proper optimisation problems and solving them using a rigorous mathematical procedure, this study derives several solutions for three-tofour phase transformation, some of which were never proposed yet. This way, both traditional solutions (T-connection, Leblanc connection, <b>Scott</b> <b>connection)</b> and more recent proposals are described together with the new solutions within one common framework...|$|E

30|$|The {{combined}} co-phase supply {{traction substation}} {{consists of a}} TT and a CPD which includes a high-voltage matching transformer (HMT), a ADA, a traction matching transformer (TMT), and an inductor (L). The TT has the single-phase connection. If the single-phase and three-phase combined co-phase power supply scheme is considered, the HMT will have YNd 11 connection and will constitute a balanced connection together with the single-phase TT. In this case, the phase difference between the port of ADA and the port of TT is 90 °. If a single-phase and single-phase combined co-phase power supply scheme is considered, the single-phase HMT together with the TT will constitute a balanced connection, forming the <b>Scott</b> <b>connection</b> with different winding turns, and the phase difference between ports is also 90 °. In the latter scheme, the output port of the ADA will {{be connected to the}} primary side of the TMT and subsequently produce a voltage of the same frequency and phase as those of the TTs. Moreover, the output voltage at the secondary side of the TT will have the same frequency and phase as those at the secondary side of the TMT, and both sides are connected with the traction bus in the substation.|$|E
40|$|Multiphase {{machines}} {{have become}} challenging candidates for safety-critical applications that require wide fault tolerant capabilities and higher system reliability. However, this adds more complexity to the adopted power converters. In {{applications such as}} electrical submersible pump (ESP) systems, motor electric power is commonly fed using a three-phase low voltage variable frequency drive system (VFD) followed by a step-up transformer and a medium voltage long feeder. Application of multiphase machines in such applications was recently shown to provide possible benefits, however, this necessitates a more complex multiphase power converter and a multiphase transformer. Alternatively, a passive transformation is a viable and more economical solution to step up the three-phase output of a standard off-the-shelf three-phase inverter and convert it into n-phase secondary voltages. This paper investigates the existing connections of passive transformation and proposes a transformation, based on the well-known <b>Scott</b> <b>connection,</b> to convert the three-phase grid voltages to an n-phase supply. In comparison with other connections in the literature, the proposed connection uses only two magnetic cores and less number of total coils, hence less transformer volume. The paper also introduces the general per-phase equivalent circuit for three-phase to n-phase transformer, and the required modifications to conventional open-circuit and short-circuit tests to estimate the transformer parameters. A case study is carried out for a three-to-five-phase transformer to validate the proposed connection. Simulations as well as experimental investigations are presented.

For example, balanced two-phase power can be obtained from a three-phase network by using two specially constructed transformers, with taps at 50% and 86.6% of the primary voltage. This <b>Scott</b> T <b>connection</b> produces a true two-phase system with 90° time difference between the phases.

30|$|The moisture-content and moisture-supplying-power of soils as {{influenced}} by firing require {{to be worked}} under varying conditions of climate, soil and vegetation. In evergreen vegetation—South African Macchia and Forest—I have found that firing, through destruction of much transpiring vegetation, actually tends to conserve the moisture values below about 6 inches, but the losses from the upper six inches are considerable. In Tree-and-Grass Savanna, however, firing {{during the dry season}} seems scarcely to alter the water-values at depths below 6 inches, as the grass stems and foliage are dry and non-transpiring. At depths above 6 inches the increased exposure of the soils to insolation and the evaporating power of the air, results in increased loss of moisture. E.P. Phillips (1920 A) working in Climax Grassland at Pretoria, considers that firing actually increases the degree of absorption of moisture by the soil, but that this increased water-content is soon dissipated by the increased evaporation to which the naked soil is subjected. In Tree-and-Grass Savanna I have found the degree of “run-off” to be considerably greater upon fired sites than upon adjacent vegetation-clad ones. Where there has been an accumulation of fired debris, however, the fired soils certainly have absorbed more water than the non-fired. Determination of the water-supplying-power of fired and plant-clad soils of the same type is being conducted in Tree-and-Grass Savanna in East Africa by my colleague Mr. <b>Scott</b> and myself—in <b>connection</b> with the Tsetse-fly problem—the porous-porcelain soil points of Livingston being used.|$|R
