50|$|Located a short {{distance}} from the settlement is the Barkip Biogas power plant, the largest anaerobic digestion power plant in Scotland when completed in June 2011. It uses anaerobic digestion to produce electricity from leftover food and other organic materials. The only by-product is a high <b>nutrient</b> <b>fertiliser</b> that can be returned to the land to help produce more food. The Barkip Biogas facility was built for the utility provider Scottish & Southern Energy Generation Ltd. It is operated by Zebec Energy, a West of Scotland company. The facility has the capacity to process up to 75,000 tonnes-a-year of residual waste and has been designed to produce up to 2.5 megawatts (MW) of renewable electricity. The plant was officially opened by the Duke of Rothesay (Prince Charles) in May 2012.|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous {{limitation}} of plant growth {{by two or}} more nutrients is increasingly acknowledged as a common phenomenon in nature, but its cellular mechanisms are far from understood. We investigated the uptake kinetics of CO(2) and phosphorus of the algae Chlamydomonas acidophila in response to growth at limiting conditions of CO(2) and phosphorus. In addition, we fitted the data to four different Monod-type models: one assuming Liebigs Law of the minimum, one assuming that the affinity for the uptake of one nutrient is not influenced by the supply of the other (independent colimitation) and two where the uptake affinity for one nutrient depends on the supply of the other (dependent colimitation). In addition we asked whether the physiological response under colimitation differs from that under <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> limitation. We found no negative correlation between the affinities for uptake of the two nutrients, thereby rejecting a dependent colimitation. Kinetic data were supported by {{a better model fit}} assuming independent uptake of colimiting nutrients than when assuming Liebigs Law of the minimum or a dependent colimitation. Results show that cell nutrient homeostasis regulated nutrient acquisition which resulted in a trade-off in the maximum uptake rates of CO(2) and phosphorus, possibly driven by space limitation on the cell membrane for porters for the different nutrients. Hence, the response to colimitation deviated from that to a <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> limitation. In conclusion, responses to <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> limitation cannot be extrapolated to situations where multiple nutrients are limiting, which calls for colimitation experiments and models to properly predict growth responses to a changing natural environment. These deviations from <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> limitation response under colimiting conditions and independent colimitation may also hold for other nutrients in algae and in higher plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{discusses}} targeted and non-targeted approaches to monitor <b>single</b> <b>nutrients</b> and global metabolite profiles in nutritional research. Non- targeted approaches such as metabolomics {{allow for the}} global description of metabolites in a biological sample and combine an analytical platform with multivariate data analysis to visualise patterns between sample groups. In nutritional research metabolomics has generated much interest as {{it has the potential}} to identify changes to metabolic pathways induced by diet or <b>single</b> <b>nutrients,</b> to explore relationships between diet and disease and to discover biomarkers of diet and disease. Although still in its infancy, a number of studies applying this technology have been performed; for example, the first study in 2003 investigated isoflavone metabolism in females, while the most recent study has demonstrated changes to various metabolic pathways during a glucose tolerance test. As a relatively new technology metabolomics is faced with a number of limitations and challenges including the standardisation of study design and methodology and the need for careful consideration of data analysis, interpretation and identification. Targeted approaches are used to monitor <b>single</b> or multiple <b>nutrient</b> and/or metabolite status to obtain information on concentration, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Such applications are currently widespread in nutritional research and one example, using stable isotopes to monitor nutrient status, is discussed in more detail.

However, there is limited {{evidence to support the}} efficacy of <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> strategies, and compliance remains a challenge for clinicians to overcome. Many factors contribute to poor compliance with dietary prescriptions, including conflicting priorities for <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> restriction, the arduous self-monitoring required, and the health-related knock-on effects resulting from targeting these nutrients in isolation. This paper reviews the evidence base for the overall pattern of eating as a potential tool to deliver a diet intervention in which all the nutrients and foods work cumulatively and synergistically to improve clinical outcomes. These interventions may assist in kidney disease management and overcome these innate challenges that <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> interventions possess. Healthy dietary patterns are typically plant-based and lower in sodium and animal proteins. These patterns may have numerous mechanistic benefits for cardiovascular health in kidney disease, most notably through the increase in fruit, vegetables, and plant-based protein, as well as improved gut health through the increase in dietary fiber. The evidence to date on optimal dietary patterns points toward use of a predominantly plant-based diet, and suggests its adoption may improve clinical outcomes in dialysis patients. However, clinical trials are needed to determine whether these diet interventions are feasible, safe, and effective in this patient population...|$|R

40|$|Nutrition has a {{key role}} in the {{modulation}} of the developing intestine in early infancy, and nutrients are able to modulate several intestinal functions including nutrient absorption, ion transport, cell growth and differentiation, motility and immunomodulation. Such modulation is exerted in part through a direct interaction between a <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> and the enterocyte. Two functions [...] ion transport and cell growth [...] are closely connected and appear to be modulated by nutrients. This is supported by the finding that a <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> (e. g. zinc) stimulates ion absorption and also promotes enterocyte growth. Interestingly, intracellular signalling for either effect is similar and involves mitogen-activated protein kinase. Other nutrients also modulate enterocyte function and there is evidence that their effect may depend on their side of action (apical or basolateral) and concentration.

40|$|The halotolerant chlorophyte Dunaliella salina can {{accumulate}} up to 10 % of its {{dry weight}} as β-carotene in chloroplasts when subjected to adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation. However, {{the mechanisms of}} carotenoid biosynthesis are poorly understood. Here, the physiological and molecular responses to the deprivation of nitrogen (-N), sulfur (-S), phosphorus (-P) and different combinations of those nutrients (-N-P, -N-S, -P-S and -N-P-S) were compared to gain insights into the underlying regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid biosynthesis. The results showed that both the growth and photosynthetic rates of cells were decreased during nutrient deprivation, accompanied by lipid globule accumulation and reduced chlorophyll levels. The SOD and CAT activities of the cells were altered during nutrient deprivation, but their responses were different. The total carotenoid contents of cells subjected to multiple nutrient deprivation were {{higher than those of}} cells subjected to <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> deprivation and non-stressed cells. The β-carotene contents of cells subjected to -N-P, -N-S and -N-P-S were higher than those of cells subjected to <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> deprivation. Cells subjected to sulfur deprivation accumulated more lutein than cells subjected to nitrogen and phosphorous deprivation. In contrast, no cumulative effects of nutrient deprivation on the transcription of genes in the carotenogenic pathway were observed because MEP and carotenogenic pathway genes were up-regulated during <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> deprivation but were downregulated during multiple nutrient deprivation. Therefore, we proposed that the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway of D. salina is regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and that a complex crosstalk occurs at the physiological and molecular levels in response to the deprivation of different nutrients...|$|R

40|$|Appropriate use of {{fertilizer}} in crop production {{to limit the}} environmental impact is essential for sustainable agriculture. While much {{is known about the}} environmental impact {{of fertilizer}} production only a limited amount of data is available covering the whole fertilizer supply chain. Up to now no comparison was done on the environmental impact of different fertilizer types (i. e., complex fertilizer, bulk blend fertilizer and <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> fertilizer). A cradle-to-field life cycle assessment (LCA) for the fertilizer supply chain in Germany, from extraction of raw materials, via fertilizer production, transportation and storage until final application in the field was carried out. Two different complex fertilizers were compared with <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> fertilizers (containing only one nutrient) and bulk blend fertilizers (containing more than one nutrient as a dry mixture). The five most relevant impact categories (i. e., climate change, acidification, eutrophication, fossil fuel depletion and resource depletion) were selected to cover different environmental impacts. Additionally, a scenario analysis was carried out focusing on nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, as new catalytic reduction techniques for the manufacturing of nitrogen (N) containing fertilizers are available that can lead to drastic reductions of N 2 O emissions. Production of fertilizers causes high values in the impact categories climate change, fossil fuel depletion and acidification, whereas resource depletion is dominant for production and transportation. For the impact category eutrophication, the application of fertilizer is the most important factor. For a fertilizer strategy with low phosphorus application rate, a bulk blend or <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> fertilizer with calcium ammonium nitrate is the most sustainable choice, while for a fertilizer strategy with a balanced nutrient formula, a bulk blend or <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> fertilizer with calcium ammonium nitrate or a standard complex fertilizer are sustainable options. Scenario calculations with reduced N 2 O emission during the production process reveals that this reduction technique is not relevant for urea based fertilizers leading to the conclusion that products containing urea need different emission reduction techniques {{to keep up with the}} environmental improvements of other nitrogen fertilizers. With an optimized fertilization strategy the environmental burden can be reduced up to 15 %. As nitrogen application rates strongly affect the LCA results it is essential that the right amounts of N are used and that for N fertilizer production the best available technique should be installed. Furthermore, a careful consideration concerning the fertilizer product type should be part of every LCA of food and agricultural products, as this has a great impact on LCA results...|$|R
40|$|Neuroinflammation {{has shown}} {{to play an}} {{important}} role in AD. Nowadays an increasing number of researchers are naming chronic neuroinflammation, manifesting in activated glial cells, as the main component exacerbating AD. Various investigations have shown the effect of nutritional components on certain elements of the pro-inflammatory cascade of AD. For example, nutritional components are able to alter nuclear-factor κB (NF-κB) expression and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines. Prospective studies investigating the influence of whole food groups and dietary patterns on the onset of AD and/or its cognitive breakdown notably showed more promising results than epidemiological studies focussing on <b>single</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Previous pre-clinical trials have placed too much emphasis on a <b>single</b> <b>nutrient</b> approach, ignoring the importance of a whole diet wherein combined nutrients are able to enhance or catalyze each other. In conclusion, a combination of nutritional components is able to decrease neuroinflammation in AD thereby inhibiting its development. Therefore nutrition can be a ‘new’ focal point in the treatment of AD. However, it must be taken into account that nutrients may have additive or synergistic effects within and across a range of foods that build up a diet. A full-diet approach is most likely to benefit AD treatment and therefore should be further investigated. ...|$|R
