40|$|Image {{matching}} is {{an essential}} and difficult task in digital photogrammetry and computer vision. This paper presents a triangulationbased hierarchical image matching algorithm for <b>stereo</b> satellite <b>imagery.</b> It uses a coarse-to-fine hierarchical strategy and combines feature points and grid points to provide a dense, precise and reliable matching result. First, some seed points are extracted at the top level of image pyramid using the SIFT algorithm with RANSAC approach to remove mismatches and enhance robustness. These points are used to construct an initial triangulation. Then, feature point and grid point matching are conducted based on the triangle constraint. In the process of hierarchical image matching, the parallaxes from upper levels are transferred to levels beneath with triangle constraint and epipolar geometrical constraint. At last, outliers are detected and removed based on local smooth constraint of parallax. Also, bidirectional image matching method is adopted to verify the matching results and {{increase the number of}} matched points.

Remote sensing LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) {{technology has been}} evaluated in recent years for acceptable topographic accuracy standards, and used to expedite highway alignment design and construction projects. Recent research efforts of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NOAA in the US prove that airborne LIDAR topographic data can be used effectively and accurately for mapping obstructions including treetops, cell towers, and poles. This significant improvement saves time and costs, compared to traditional field topographic surveying and aerial photogrammetric surveys. The objective and scope of an on-going national study on LIDAR obstruction survey technology in the US is presented. The overall goal is to enhance the accuracy and current practice of airport obstruction surveys while reducing costs. The research study investigates the data needs, formats, hardware, and software used to ensure the compatibility of airborne LIDAR data with geographic information systems (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD), visualization, and other applications, which airports may use in preparation of obstruction surveys and aeronautical maps.

40|$|High-resolution <b>stereo</b> {{satellite}} <b>imagery</b> {{is widely}} used in environmental monitoring, topographic mapping, and urban three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction. However, a critical issue in these applications using high-resolution <b>stereo</b> satellite <b>imagery</b> {{is to improve the}} accuracy of point geo-positioning. This paper presents a framework for comparison of the performance of the three-dimensional (3 D) geo-positioning of the bias-corrected Rigorous Sensor Models (RSMs) and rational function models (RFMs) with respect to the high-resolution QuickBird stereo images in three spaces (i. e., orbital space, image space and object space). The compared models include a bias-corrected RSM in the orbital space, a bias-corrected RSM and RFM in the image space, and a bias-corrected RSM and RFM in the object space. In the comparison, the RSMs and RFMs use the vendor-provided orbit data and Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs), respectively. The experimental results indicated that, (1) these five bias-corrected models can provide a sub-pixel geo-positioning accuracy. With the zero-order polynomial correction model in the orbital space and a minimum of three Ground Control Points (GCPs), the accuracy based on RPCs better than 0. 8 m in horizontal direction and 1. 3 m in vertical direction. With {{an increase in the number}} of GCPs, or in the order of correction models, the regenerated orbital parameters achieve a slight improved positioning accuracy of 0. 5 m in horizontal direction and 0. 8 m in vertical direction with 25 GCPs, which indicates that the low-order correction model in the orbital space can accurately model the effects of ephemeris and attitude errors; (2) the performances of bias-corrected RSM and RFM in image space are rather similar. However, the bias-corrected RSM and RFM in image space achieve a better accuracy than the bias-corrected RSM and RFM in object space, with the same configuration of GCPs...|$|R

40|$|Digital Surface Models (DSMs) {{can assist}} {{building}} change detection {{in a variety}} of approaches. Limited to the quality of DSMs from satellite <b>stereo</b> <b>imagery,</b> it is hard to reach precise change detection results using only DSMs. Therefore, DSMs should be used in combination with the spectral information from original <b>stereo</b> <b>imagery.</b> For that purpose, two fusion based methods, one using feature level fusion and the other using decision level fusion are proposed in our previous research.

40|$|The {{generation}} of digital surface models (DSM) of urban areas from very high resolution (VHR) <b>stereo</b> satellite <b>imagery</b> requires advanced methods. In the classical approach of DSM generation from <b>stereo</b> satellite <b>imagery,</b> interest points are extracted and correlated between the stereo mates using an area based matching {{followed by a}} least-squares sub-pixel refinement step. After a region growing the 3 D point list is triangulated to the resulting DSM. In urban areas this approach fails due {{to the size of}} the correlation window, which smoothes out the usual steep edges of buildings. Also missing correlations as for partly – in one or both of the images – occluded areas will simply be interpolated in the triangulation step. So an urban DSM generated with the classical approach results in a very smooth DSM with missing steep walls, narrow streets and courtyards. To overcome these problems algorithms from computer vision are introduced and adopted to satellite imagery. These algorithms do not work using local optimisation like the area-based matching but try to optimize a (semi-) global cost function. Analysis shows that dynamic programming approaches based on epipolar images like dynamic line warping or semiglobal matching yield the best results according to accuracy and processing time. These algorithms can also detect occlusions – areas not visible in one or both of the stereo images. Beside these also the time and memory consuming step of handling and triangulating large point lists can be omitted due to the direct operation on epipolar images and direct {{generation of}} a so called disparity image fitting exactly on the first of the stereo images. This disparity image – representing already a sort of a dense DSM – contains the distances measured in pixels in the epipolar direction (or a no-data value for a detected occlusion) for each pixel in the image. Despite the global optimization of the cost function many outliers, mismatches and erroneously detected occlusions remain, especially if only on...|$|R
