Haarbauer-Krupa The {{purpose of}} this {{longitudinal}} {{study was to examine}} the relationship between language and reading in children diagnosed with developmental language disorder (DLD) during preschool. An archival data set was available for analysis. Preschool children with DLD who were assessed between 35 and 74 months for preschool language and speech abilities (Rapin, 1996) returned for language, speech and reading testing at age seven years. Children who enrolled in the study were a clinically referred sample, met criteria for average nonverbal intellectual functioning, and demonstrated below average performance on a composite language measure. To evaluate a hypothesis about the contribution of vocabulary, grammar, and speech articulation to reading outcome measures, a series of regression analyses tested models to identify predictors of reading achievement at age seven. Results indicated a strong, positive relationship between language skills assessed at both ages and reading comprehension. School-age language and <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> explained 25 % of the variance in reading comprehension after controlling for word identification skills. Grammar at school age was a significant unique predictor of reading comprehension. Preschool language and <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> explained 22 % of the variance after controlling for word identification <b>skills.</b> <b>Speech</b> articulation was not related to reading outcomes. In contrast, regression analyses suggested that language and <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> did not predict word reading abilities. Children who had reading comprehension difficulties had weaker vocabulary, grammar and <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> compared to children who had average and above comprehension skills. Findings support previous research describing a relationship between language skills and reading comprehension. Language skills measured at preschool can predict reading comprehension difficulties in elementary school for children with DLD. Results highlight the importance of early identification and intervention of language impairment in children to improve areas of vocabulary and grammar critical to reading success...|$|R

40|$|This study set out {{to explore}} the nature of deaf children’s lexical {{representations}} and how these may be updated as new <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> are acquired, through an investigation of <b>speech</b> processing <b>skills</b> and responses to intervention in three deaf children. A computer-based psycholinguistic profiling procedure was developed to examine the relationships between input skills, lexical representations and output skills {{for a range of}} consonant contrasts, with the expectation that input skills were important in determining output skills. Using this procedure, consonants or consonant clusters that were not accurately realised by the participants were classified according to responses to real word and nonword input testing in audio-visual and audio-alone conditions. By comparing how the differently classified consonants responded to intervention, the role of input skills in the updating of lexical representations was discovered to be less important than other sources of information, including phonological awareness and knowledge of orthography and grapheme-phoneme links. There was some evidence that articulatory knowledge, acquired through phonetic instruction and tactile feedback, was enriching segments of input representations so that the corresponding segments became easier to detect in input tasks. This questions the assumption that output representations depend on input representations for their specification. Further intervention involving repeated practice of new motor patterns and use of feedback from the therapist to encourage motor planning facilitated generalisation of the acquired <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> {{to a wide range of}} speaking tasks. There was evidence that one of the participants was accessing the orthography of what he was about to say in order to generalise his <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> and that he could eventually do this, even when conversing at an acceptable rate of speech. The implications for combining the teaching of phonics with speech production training for deaf children are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

[...] Dept. of Learning, Assessment and Special Education, University of Melbourne, 1998 This study {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Auditory Skills Program (Romanik, 1990) in developing the auditory skills of a group of severe to profound hearing impaired school aged children. It also measured speech perception and <b>speech</b> production <b>skills</b> during and following participation in the program. The Auditory Skills Program is a comprehensive graded program which aims to develop the hearing impaired child's <b>speech</b> and linguistic <b>skills</b> through audition. In this study 18 severe to profound hearing impaired children ranging in age from 6 to 12 years received twice weekly sessions based on the Auditory Skills Program for a period of three months. Auditory skill development was measured at monthly intervals using the assessment tool within the program, the Placement test. The PLOTT test (Plant and Westcott, 1983) was used to measure <b>speech</b> perception <b>skills.</b> <b>Speech</b> production <b>skills</b> were measured using the 108 single word articulation test (Paatsch, 1992) and conversational speech samples using phonological process analysis. The subjects were tested at the commencement of during, and following the cessation of, participation in the Auditory Skills Program. They were also tested 5 months post participation in the program. The Auditory Skills Program was effective in developing auditory skills in this group of severe to profoundly hearing impaired subjects. There was a significant improvement in auditory skills in the group of subjects during participation in the program. A deterioration in these skills occurred following cessation of participation in the Auditory <b>Skills</b> Program. <b>Speech</b> perception <b>skills</b> also improved significantly during participation in the Auditory <b>Skills</b> Program. <b>Speech</b> production <b>skills</b> significantly improved when measured using the 108 single word articulation test.

40|$|Central {{auditory}} pathway maturation {{in children}} depends on auditory sensory stimulation. The {{objective of the}} present study was to monitor the cortical maturation of children with cochlear implants using electrophysiological and auditory skills measurements. The study was longitudinal and consisted of 30 subjects, 15 (8 girls and 7 boys) of whom had a cochlear implant, with a mean age at activation time of 36. 4 months (minimum, 17 months; maximum, 66 months), and 15 of whom were normal-hearing children who were matched based on gender and chronological age. The auditory and <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> of the children with cochlear implants were evaluated using GASP, IT-MAIS and MUSS measures. Both groups underwent electrophysiological evaluation using long-latency auditory evoked potentials. Each child was evaluated at three and nine months after cochlear implant activation, with the same time interval adopted for the hearing children. The results showed improvements in auditory and <b>speech</b> <b>skills</b> as measured by IT-MAIS and MUSS. Similarly, the long-latency auditory evoked potential evaluation revealed a decrease in P 1 component latency; however, the latency remained significantly longer than that of the hearing children, even after nine months of cochlear implant use. It was observed that a shorter P 1 latency corresponded to more evident development of auditory skills. Regarding auditory behavior, it was observed that children who could master the auditory skill of discrimination showed better results in other evaluations, both behavioral and electrophysiological, than those who had mastered only the speech-detection skill. Therefore, cochlear implant auditory stimulation facilitated auditory pathway maturation, which decreased the latency of the P 1 component and advanced the development of auditory and <b>speech</b> <b>skills.</b> The analysis of the long-latency auditory evoked potentials revealed that the P 1 component was an important biomarker of auditory development during the rehabilitation process...|$|R
