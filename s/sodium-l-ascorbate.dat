30|$|Initially, {{a mobile}} phase system, MeCN: 0.1 [*]M AF without <b>sodium-l-ascorbate,</b> {{was used for}} the preparative HPLC {{purification}} and the solvent of the collected fraction was removed by evaporation at high temperature. The radiochemical purity of radioligand, [11 C]AZ 12204657, was less than 85 % after EOS suggesting radiolysis. Decomposition of PET radiopharmaceuticals is very common via radiolysis, in particular when producing radioligands in high levels of radioactivity and with high molar activity [14] which was the case for [11 C]AZ 12204657. Improved labeling technology and in particular for carbon- 11 methylation reactions the development of 11 C-methyl triflate ([11 C]CH 3 OTf), a more reactive methylating agent than [11 C]CH 3 I, has greatly improved the production of 11 C-labeled radiopharmaceuticals by producing large amount of radioactivity [15, 16]. In the present work, radiolabeling of [11 C]AZ 12204657 was not possible using [11 C]CH 3 OTf. In initial experiments using [11 C]CH 3 OTf, a radiolabeled product was formed which did not co-elute with the reference standard, AZ 12204657 in radio-HPLC. Though the formed radiolabeled product was not identified, HSAB principle suggests formation of O-alkylated sulfonate ester. Methyl carbonium (CH 3 +) would act as a strong acid when attached to the triflate compared to in the case for iodine and hence prefer to coordinate with the stronger base oxygen with the potential to form the sulfonate ester. The stability of radiopharmaceuticals depends on several other factors such as the structure of the radiolabeled compound, position of radiolabeling as well as the formulated aqueous solution where radicals are generated by interaction between radiation and water. Previous study has shown that addition of appropriate radical scavengers such as ethanol and <b>sodium-l-ascorbate</b> during HPLC purification and the formulation process can improve stability of carbon- 11 radiopharmaceuticals [17]. In our case, radiochemical purity of [11 C]AZ 12204657 was improved to >[*] 98 % when <b>sodium-l-ascorbate</b> was used in the mobile phase during HPLC purification followed by evaporation of the collected fraction. Impurity of the radioligand was probably due to the concentrated radioactive solution during the evaporation of HPLC solvent. On the other hand, the strong UV absorption of <b>sodium-l-ascorbate</b> sometimes disturbs the quality control of the final product by HPLC. In order to avoid the UV peak of the <b>sodium-l-ascorbate</b> and evaporation of the mobile phase, a method to isolate the product [11 C]AZ 12204657 on a SPE cartridge after HPLC purification was developed allowing removal of <b>sodium-l-ascorbate</b> in the mobile phase. The final product was eluted using ethanol and formulated into PBS which yielded >[*] 98 % radiochemical pure compound containing less than 10 % ethanol.|$|E
30|$|The same radiosynthesis was {{explored}} using {{solid phase}} extraction (SPE) cartridge after semi-prep HPLC purification of the crude reaction mixture to skip evaporation of the mobile phase at high temperature (70 – 80 [*]°C) to avoid radiolysis. The HPLC collected product fraction was diluted with 50 [*]mL {{of water and}} loaded on a SEP-PAK-C 18 cartridge (Waters). The SEP-PAK-C 18 cartridge was pre-conditioned with 10 [*]mL of EtOH (99.9 %) and 10 [*]mL of water prior to use. The trapped product, ([11 C]AZ 12204657), in the SEP-PAK-C 18 cartridge was washed with water (10 [*]mL) and eluted with EtOH (1 [*]mL) in to PBS (9 [*]mL). When using this method, no <b>sodium-l-ascorbate</b> needed to be added in the HPLC mobile phase, since no radiolysis was observed during SPE isolation.|$|E
40|$|Background/objective: Oxidative stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in osteoarthritis (OA), causing inflammation and matrix degradation in joints. Previous studies have shown that antioxidants such as quercetin and vitamin C are potential candidates for treating OA. We aimed to determine whether a formulation of quercetin and vitamin C, together with an iron chelator, could retard OA progression in a post-traumatic OA rat model. Methods: Twelve rats received anterior cruciate ligament transection for OA induction. At 20 weeks postoperation, weekly intra-articular injection of 50  μL of either saline or a formulation of quercetin dehydrate, <b>sodium-L-ascorbate,</b> and deferoxamine mesylate was given consecutively for 4 weeks (n= 5). Gait analysis was performed at pretreatment, and at 1 week and 5 weeks post-treatment. Microcomputed tomography scanning and histological scoring were performed at 5 weeks post-treatment. Results: Gait analysis showed that intra-articular injections of antioxidant formulation did not improve pain-associated Limb Idleness Index over time (p= 0. 449, Friedman test). However, at 5 weeks post-treatment, the treatment group exhibited a significantly lower Limb Idleness Index than the control group (p= 0. 047, Mann–Whitney U test). At 5 weeks post-treatment, microcomputed tomography analysis revealed that there was no difference in any parameter between the treatment and control groups (p> 0. 05, Student t test). Severe OA histopathological changes were found in both groups. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International scores of the treatment and control groups were 20 (range, 20 – 26) and 20 (range, 9 – 26), respectively (p= 0. 382, Mann–Whitney U test). Conclusion: Intra-articular injection of an antioxidant formulation containing quercetin, vitamin C, and deferoxamine did not retard OA progression in advanced-stage OA. Future studies should aim to determine whether giving antioxidants in early OA, with prolonged drug retention, would be effective in retarding OA progression...|$|E
