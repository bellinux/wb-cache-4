The Algoma Central Corporation Marine <b>Emergency</b> <b>Duties</b> (MED) Centre, which opened in October 2016 is a $7.5 million, 13,600-square-foot facility is {{a key part of}} the college’s renowned Marine Studies and is used extensively by students enrolled in Georgian’s postsecondary marine programs as well as by working mariners who require certification or refresher training.MED training is mandatory for anyone who works on a ship in Canada. After several years without a marine <b>emergency</b> <b>duties</b> training facility in Ontario, mariners will no longer need to travel to Canada’s east or west coasts to obtain this certification. Life-saving training includes firefighting, survival craft, life raft and immersion suit training, as well as first aid.|$|R

30|$|Training in minimal access {{surgery is}} the source of much {{discussion}} in European endoscopy circles. The apprenticeship model of training, long a hallmark of the British medical system, is being replaced by modular training. The European working time directive, reduction in junior doctors’ hours, and the need to cover <b>emergency</b> <b>duties</b> are largely driving this change.|$|R

By that time, coach Riley had relegated Harbaugh to <b>emergency</b> <b>duty</b> due to injuries including a mild hernia. Riley had planned to start Harbaugh for the next game on Week 12 (November 19), but decided to start Leaf instead.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the perceptions of}} physiotherapists with different levels of context related experience undertaking <b>emergency</b> on-call <b>duties</b> in New Zealand (NZ). A purpose-designed questionnaire was developed to investigate whether differences existed between novice and expert physiotherapists in their perceptions of <b>emergency</b> on-call <b>duties</b> and in their responses to an emergency on-call vignette. A questionnaire was administered to 71 participants with varying levels of on-call experience, in all centres providing emergency on-call services within NZ. Years of active emergency on-call experience were used to classify novices (less than 5 years) and experts (more than 5 years). A response rate of 79 % (n = 56) was obtained. Significant differences between novices and experts were seen in self-rated confidence scores, self-rated stress levels and perceived support required whilst undertaking <b>emergency</b> oncall <b>duties</b> (all p <. 001). There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between novices and experts in response to any questions in the vignette. The results of this study provide useful information for service providers regarding the perceptions and concerns of emergency on-call physiotherapists. It is recommended that novice physiotherapists be provided with better opportunities to gain specific context related experience prior to undertaking <b>emergency</b> on-call <b>duties</b> in order to improve confidence levels and reduce stress associated with undertaking on-call duties. In addition, specific continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities and support mechanisms should be provided for all staff undertaking emergency on-call work...|$|R
50|$|To {{work as an}} oiler in the Canadian Coast Guard, it is {{required}} that the individual holds an engine room rating certificate. In order to obtain this certificate the applicant must first have no {{less than six months}} of documented sea time working under the supervision of a watch keeping engineer. The applicant must then go to a Transport Canada Office and have a written and oral exam before the certificate is issued. It is also required for all sea going personnel to have MED (marine <b>emergency</b> <b>duty)</b> certificates which can be obtained by taking courses through a college approved for training.|$|R

40|$|Safety {{training}} can significantly reduce injury and death among workers. A survey of fish harvesters in Newfoundland {{in the early}} 1990 s (post-moratorium) found that all participants had incurred some form of injury. There is, however, no published literature evaluating the impact of safety training programs in the Newfoundland fishery. This thesis examined {{the impact of a}} basic and augmented safety-training program on fish harvesters and other seafarers. The Marine and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Duties</b> A 1 programme is a basic 3 -day safety-training course created by Transport Canada that all marine workers must complete. A sample of 40 fish harvesters and marine workers were allocated to either the basic or an augmented course (referred to as standard group and enhanced group respectively). All participants were surveyed before and after the training to assess their attitudes, perceptions and knowledge of safety issues. Results indicated an overall increase in knowledge in both groups with the enhanced group scoring significantly higher than the standard group. Discussion with the participants also revealed changes in attitudes toward the Marine <b>Emergency</b> <b>Duties</b> A 1 programme mandate: from a general aversion (pre-training) to support for the continuation of the program (post-training). Whilst there was no significant overall difference in attitudes between the two groups, the enhanced group indicated a significant difference in more of the individual attitude items and the subscales as compared to the standard group. Further evaluation of the programme is necessary to understand its specific strengths and weaknesses as these relate to fishing and the industry...|$|R
50|$|Between late {{at night}} on September 3 and September 5, troops of the 13th Cavalry Regiment on <b>emergency</b> <b>duty</b> in Kameido shot and decapitated Hirasawa and nine others. They {{disposed}} of the bodies, together with those of Korean and Chinese massacre victims, {{along the banks of}} the Arakawa drainage canal. The police issued an official notice on October 14, claiming that troops had shot the men because they were agitating prisoners. The following year, the Liberal Lawyers' Association and union leaders worked to bring the facts to light and establish responsibility, with partial success. Police claimed to have cremated the remains of the victims. With no remains to bury, a memorial service was held in February 1924.|$|R
