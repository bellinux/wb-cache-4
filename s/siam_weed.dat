40|$|This study aims to (1) {{determine}} {{the concentration of}} leaf extract weeds siam against {{the brightness of the}} color, texture and freshness on red pepper, (2) {{determine the}} length of immersion extract of leaves of weeds siam against the brightness of the color, texture and freshness on red pepper, (3) know the <b>siam</b> <b>weed</b> leaf extract concentration and soaking time on levels of vitamin C in red Chili. The method used is an experimental method by using a randomized block design pattern (RAK) factorial consisting of 25 treatment combinations each with four replications. There are two factors studied were the first factor leaf extract concentration weed siam consists of 5 levels: P 0 (control), P 1 (125, 000 ppm extract), P 2 (250, 000 ppm extract), P 3 (375, 000 ppm extract), P 4 (500, 000 ppm extract) and the second factor soaking period consists of 5 levels: L 0 (0 min), L 1 (15 min), L 2 (30 minutes), L 3 (45 minutes) L 4 (60 minutes). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Least Significant Difference test (BNT 0, 05). The results showed that the concentration of water extract of <b>siam</b> <b>weed</b> leaves no significant effect (P < 0. 05) to the brightness and freshness of red chilli to 24 HSP, but otherwise significantly affect the texture of red Chili with extract concentrations of 125, 000 ppm, 250, 000 ppm and 375, 000 up to 16 ppm HSP. 0 minutes soaking time was highly significant (P < 0. 05) to the brightness and freshness of red chilli to 16 HSP and the texture of red Chili with a soaking time 45 minutes to 20 HSP. The highest concentration of vitamin C contained in the extract concentration of 375, 000 ppm with a soaking time of 60 minutes.

The HO- 1 promoter analyzed with luciferase assay was also increased by treatment of SWE in a dose-dependent manner. This induction may be mediated by several kinase pathways including MEK, p 38 MAPK, AKT, and JNK. Quantitative real-time PCR using undifferentiated promonocytic cell lines revealed that thromboxane synthase (TXS), a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator, was increased and MMP- 9, an anti platelet aggregator, was decreased in the presence of SWE.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} during 2014 cropping season at Omuo-Ekiti and Kabba. Omuo falls within the forest zone while Kabba is in the southern guinea savanna zone of Nigeria. The experiment at the two sites was to study the effect of tillage and mulch combinations on soil {{physical and chemical properties}} and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) performance. The trial consisted of 2 x 5 factorial combinations of two tillage methods: no-tillage (NT) and manual tillage (MT) and five levels of mulch, <b>siam</b> <b>weed</b> (Chromolaena odorata), { 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 t/ha}. These were laid out using split plots design arranged in a randomized complete block with each treatment replicated four times. There {{were no significant differences in}} the values of soil moisture content, soil temperature, porosity and bulk density between Omuo and Kabba sites. Omuo site has significant values of soil organic matter (SOM), total N, K and sweet potato tuber yield compared with Kabba site. Omuo has 1. 8 t/ha (10 %) higher sweet potato yield compared with Kabba. No-tillage treatment has higher soil moisture content, SOM, N, P, K, Ca, Mg and higher tuber yield compared with manual tillage, The yield difference between NT and MT was 2. 9 t/ha (16. 7 %). Application of mulch increases the yield components of sweet potato compared with no mulch application. The increase in yield as mulch rates increases was adduced to increase in soil organic matter from the mulch. There were however no significant differences between 15 and 20 t/ha mulch levels. Mulch applied at 15 t/ha was found to be suitable for sweet potato in tropical Alfisol. Therefore for soil fertility conservation and performance of sweet potato, no-tillage and 15 t/ha <b>siam</b> <b>weed</b> mulch is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Chromolaena, or <b>Siam</b> <b>weed,</b> is {{a serious}} problem in several {{tropical}} and sub-tropical areas around the world. In our own region, it {{is a serious}} weed in New Guinea, East Timor and Indonesia and is also under an eradication regime in North Queensland. The chapter summarises current knowledge about the taxonomy, biology, distribution, ecology, impacts and control of the weed. Biological control has been a major multinational initiative against this weed in recent years and these efforts are described in some detail. Interestingly agents have not been universally effective because of weed biotype differences and climate. Considerable success has been achieved in New Guinea, principally with the tephritid fly Cecidocares connex and by the efforts of Michael Day, Rachel McFadyen and Graham Donnelly from Alan Fletcher Research Station...|$|E
40|$|Cocoa husk, cow dung, poultry droppings, <b>siam</b> <b>weed</b> - Chromolaena odorata and tea fluff {{are common}} farm wastes in Nigeria. They {{were used as}} manures as sole and in {{combination}} with inorganic fertilizer as organominerals (OMF), compared to NPK (5 :l: 1) a reference fertilizer, to supply 150 kg N ha-l to potted tea seedlings in the open nursery space at Ibadan (lowland ecology) and Kusuku (highland ecology) of Nigeria. The manure based fertilizer treatments resulted in significantly (Pc 0. 05) higher tea dry matter yield than the reference fertilizer - NPK (5 :l:l) and between 44. 5 - 146 % at Ibadan (lowland ecology) and 29. 9 - 233 % at Kusuku (highland ecology) than the control (without fertilizer). Tea plant nutrient uptake, residual soil nutrient and organic matter build-up were more in the organic based fertilizers treatments compared to NPK.

40|$|Nine plants namely greater galangale (Alpinia galanga), fingerroot (Boesenbergia pandurata), {{turmeric}} (Curcuma longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), neem (Azadirachta indica), Siamese cassia (Cassia siamea), citronella grass (Cymbopogon nardus), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) and <b>Siam</b> <b>weed</b> (Eupatorium odoratum) were {{studies for}} their efficacy in reducing human-mosquito contact {{when used in}} mosquito coils. Each plant material was prepared as 25 % in each mosquito coil formulation. Repellency of the 9 mosquito coil formulations and the blank coil against night biting mosquitoes were determined under field conditions in an urban area of Nonthaburi Province, Thailand. Evaluations were carried out by capturing landing-biting mosquitoes on human volunteers and were conducted from 1830 h to 2130 h. Results showed that mosquito coils provided protection against mosquitoes with a ranging from 50 % to 71 % reduction in biting activity while the blank coil consisting of inert materials only reduced mosquito attacks by about 43 %. Mosquito coil containing leaves of citronella grass showed highest efficacy whereas that containing rhizomes of turmeric was least effective. Mosquitoes caught in this study included 12 species belonging to 5 genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex and Mansonia), but Cx. vishnui, Culex gelidus and Cx. quinquefasciatus were most predominant species...|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} and haematological {{indices of}} birds fed with varying dietary inclusions of <b>siam</b> <b>weed</b> (Chromolaena odorata) leaf meal (SWLM) were determined using 24 laying hens in their eighth month of lay in an eight week trial. Four diets were formulated {{for the purpose}} of this study. Diet 1 served as the control diet and had no SWLM inclusion. SWLM was introduced at 2. 5 %, 5. 0 % and 7. 5 % in diets 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The haematological and biochemical investigations revealed no statistical differences (P= 0. 05) among the mean values of treatments 1, 2 and 3. However the mean value of treatment 4 (7. 5 % SWLM inclusion level) was statistically different (P< 0. 05) from the others. The numerical values of most haematological indices showed an initial increase up to treatment 3 followed by a decrease in treatment 4. Almost all haematological indices studied (PCV, RBC count, Hbc, MCHC, MCH, MCV and ESR) progressively increased up to diet 3 (5 % SWLM inclusion) after which there was a decline indicating a probable acceptance limit of 5 % SWLM dietary inclusion in layers diets without any serious health implication...|$|E
