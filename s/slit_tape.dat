The panels were tested in notched and un-notched tension, notched and un-notched compression and compression after impact (CAI) at room temperature and under hot/wet conditions (notched and un-notched compression and CAI only). The properties were compared with AS 4 /PEEK tape laminate properties found in the literature. The tow placed AS 4 /PEEK material was stronger in tension but weaker in compression than the AS 4 /PEEK tape laminates. The tow placed AS 4 /PEEK was stronger but less stiff than the tow placed IM 7 /Radel 8320 in all compression tests. The IM 7 /Radel performed better in all other mechanical tests. The IM 7 /Radel outperformed the AS 4 /PEEK in all CAI tests...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} local {{buckling}} of <b>slit</b> <b>tape</b> in the Automated Fibre Placement process for a circular fibre path using an analytical approach {{that accounts for}} prepreg tack and stress distribution. Curing effects are not considered in this study. The main objective is to define the critical buckling load and therefore the minimal steering radius for which no tow wrinkling occurs. Simulations are performed for the buckling of the first ply, using a tack parameter governing the interaction between tool and material. A sensitivity analysis of the most relevant parameters of the model is performed. Numerical results show that lower values of the steering radius are obtained for lower tow width values and higher prepreg tack values. Experimental investigations show that the estimation of wrinkling occurrence in steered fibres could be improved by taking into account certain additional parameters, such as lay-down rate, temperature and the dynamic behaviour of the resin...|$|E
40|$|In-situ fiber placement, in {{combination}} with automated tape laying and filament winding, {{is the key to}} high-volume production of large-scale composite aerostructures ranging from simple flat plates, to panels with mild curvatures, to complex three-dimensional surfaces, promising reliable, consistent and cost-effective fabrication. However, manufacturing cost, <b>slit</b> <b>tape</b> quality, lack of knowledge and experience of the in-situ consolidation fiber placement process are major barriers preventing aircraft manufacturer from implementing this unique processing technique. This dissertation aims to gain knowledge and experience of in-situ consolidation fiber placement by identifying and resolving four technical issues associated with the manufacturing of thermoplastic composite tailbooms. The first study demonstrates that the percentage of gap/lap and the angular deviation of fiber orientation can be controlled by dividing a single tool surface to multiple and equal sections. The second study shows that the interlaminar defects have minimal effects on the mechanical properties of autoclave molded thermoplastic composite laminates. The third study predicates a set of optimum processing parameters for manufacturing tailboom demonstration articles using automated fiber placement. The last study suggests that the in-situ consolidation fiber placement process needs to be improved to lower the micro-size void content and minimize the process induced warpage. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{research}} project “High-performance Production of CFRP Structures” (HP CFK) a new automated fiber placement (AFP) system for laying thermoset CFRP (carbon fiber-reinforced plastic) <b>slit</b> <b>tapes</b> was developed. Its novel, modular designed laying head faces current industrial needs {{and challenges of}} prospective carbon light weight applications, e. g. future aerospace stiffening structures. Thus, its compaction unit is optimized for producing complex-curved structures. To allow approximating slopes on curved geometries, it consists of several height-adjustable rollers which, in addition, are each pressure controlled to enable an individual compacting pressure for the lay-up on materials with different compression strength (e. g. foams, metals). Furthermore, {{the design of the}} laying heads cutting unit aided the manufacturing of complex structures while being located as near as possible to the nip point to allow very short minimum placement paths. This paper introduces into the general design of the modular laying head as well as preliminary results of validation studies regarding several process limits...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVariable-stiffness shells {{are thin}} {{composite}} structures {{in which the}} reinforcement direction {{is a function of}} its surface co-ordinates. This paper presents a numerical investigation into the buckling and post-buckling of two variable-stiffness cylinders under axial compression. Both shell walls are made from unidirectional carbon fiber <b>slit</b> <b>tapes</b> that are steered to give them a piecewise-continuous fiber-angle variation around the circumference. Dynamic analyses of the complete loading and unloading cycles are computed using a time-integrated finite element model (Abaqus). The numerical results generated herein are compared with test data and are found to be in good agreement, in terms of axial force versus end-shortening and global displacement fields. The analyses provide significant new insight into the mechanisms underpinning collapse behavior of the shells. For example, the development of the initial nonlinear buckle, its dynamic snap-through, and the formation of a post-buckled configuration are clearly visible. One effect elucidated by this investigation is the symmetry-breaking mechanism of the circumferential stiffness variation. In contrast to a constant-stiffness cylinder, in which the total strain energy is invariant to the translation of a dimple of fixed dimensions, the present structures exhibit a single dominant post-buckling mode that are associated with the formation of ‘trapped’ surface dimples. In one case, this dominant mode is found to be stable over a significant amount of further end shortening...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{composite}} shells that may offer {{the potential to}} improve the structural performance of future aircraft fuselage structures were developed under this joint NASA-industry collaborative effort. Two cylindrical shells with tailored, tow-steered layups and continuously varying fiber angle orientations were designed and built at the National Center for Advanced Manufacturing - Louisiana Partnership. The shells were fabricated from unidirectional IM 7 / 8552 graphite-epoxy pre-preg <b>slit</b> <b>tape</b> material fiber-placed on a constant-diameter mandrel. Each shell had the same nominal 8 -ply [plus or minus 45 /plus or minus Theta]s layup, where the nominal fiber angle in the tow-steered plies varied continuously from 10 degrees along the crown to 45 degrees on each side, then back to 10 degrees on the keel. One shell was fabricated with all 24 tows placed during each pass of the fiber placement machine, resulting in many tow overlaps on the shell surface. The fiber placement machine's individual tow cut/restart capability was also used to manufacture a second shell with tow drops and a more uniform laminate thickness. This paper presents {{an overview of the}} detailed design and manufacturing processes for these shells, and discusses issues encountered during their fabrication and post-cure evaluation. Future plans for structural testing and analyses of the shells are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|For {{decreasing}} {{both the}} tendency to segregation and the drying time of typical ceramic slips in the doctor-blade-process high-solid aqueous alumina slips were moulded in a lab scale to thin layers and tapes, resp., {{by means of a}} slit extruder. The homogeneous deaerated bodies with a solid content up to 70 % w (37 % vol) using hydroxyethylcellulose as binder were mixed in a vacuum dissolver to a reproducible viscosity. The shaping of the wet layers was made by means of a plunger extruder by variation of the volume flow, the gap height, and the mode of applying the formed layer onto the support belt. Only in a drawing mode the thickness of wet layers corresponded with the width of the <b>slit</b> forming <b>tapes</b> from 0, 13 to 0, 60 mm thickness. In the bead mode almost the thickness of the layers was independent of the conditions of extrusion, but seemed to depend on the wetting and rheological properties of the casting bodies. The workability of the pseudoplastic bodies was limited by the pressure characteristic of the extruder and by the homogenization process. Due to the expensive facilities relating to the doctor-blade-process the application of slip extrusion for making thin ceramic tapes should be restricted to the moduling of complicated bodies or of multilayer tapes by a simultaneous wet-in-wet-deposition of the extruded single layers.

40|$|A 35 -year-old {{male with}} pan-anterior {{urethral}} stricture {{was scheduled to}} undergo perineal urethrostomy. He was a known case of Kindler′s syndrome since infancy. He was having a history of blister formation, extensive poikiloderma and progressive cutaneous atrophy since childhood. He had a tendency of trauma-induced blisters with clear or hemorrhagic contents that healed with scarring. The fingers were sclerodermiform with dystrophic nails and inability to completely clench the fist. Airway examination revealed thyromental distance of 7 cm with limited neck extension, limited mouth opening and mallampatti class III with a fixed large tongue. He was reported as grade IV Cormack and Lehane laryngoscopic on previous anesthesia exposure. We described the anesthetic management of such case on guidelines for epidermolysis bullosa.

40|$|The {{performances}} of second generation (2 G) YBCO coated conductors for screening DC magnetic fields at 77 K are investigated experimentally. An uninterrupted superconducting path {{is achieved by}} splitting two sections of a <b>slit</b> 2 G <b>tape</b> {{in order to obtain}} a loop without joint. Several loops are stacked together to obtain a coil acting as a magnetic screen. Persistent currents in this coil are shown to shield efficiently magnetic fields that are applied at very low sweep rates (500 @T/s). The shielding properties are characterized by measuring the shielding factor of the screen, i. e. the ratio between the magnetic field with and without screen. In a coil made of a single layer of coated conductors, the shielding factor {{at the center of the}} coil is shown to exceed 10 for an applied DC magnetic flux density of 5 mT. The uniformity of the shielding factor along the axis of the screen is also investigated; results show the magnetic field is attenuated by a factor larger than 3 near the open ends. Both the maximum field amplitude that can be shielded and the shielding factor of the coil can be enhanced by increasing the number of concentric coils. The key advantages of this shielding technique are (i) the moderate weight compared to magnetic screens made of bulk materials and (ii) the possibility of shielding larger volumes by using longer sections of YBCO coated conductors...|$|R
40|$|The damage {{tolerance}} behavior of internally pressurized, axially <b>slit,</b> graphite/epoxy <b>tape</b> cylinders was investigated. Specifically, {{the effects of}} axial stress, structural anisotropy, and subcritical damage were considered. In addition, the limitations of a methodology which uses coupon fracture data to predict cylinder failure were explored. This predictive methodology was previously shown to be valid for quasi-isotropic fabric and tape cylinders but invalid for structurally anisotropic (+/- 45 / 90) (sub s) and (+/- 45 / 0) (sub s) cylinders. The effects of axial stress and structural anisotropy were assessed by testing tape cylinders with (90 / 0 /+/- 45) (sub s), (+/- 45 / 90) (sub s), and (+/- 45 / 0) (sub s) layups in a uniaxial test apparatus, specially designed and built for this work, and comparing the results to previous tests conducted in biaxial loading. Structural anisotropy effects were also investigated by testing cylinders with the quasi-isotropic (0 /+/- 45 / 90) (sub s) layup which is a stacking sequence variation of the previously tested (90 / 0 /+/- 45) (sub s) layup with higher D(sub 16) and D(sub 26) terms but comparable D(sub 16) and D(sub 26) to D(sub 11) ratios. All cylinders tested and used for comparison are made from AS 4 / 3501 - 6 graphite/epoxy tape and have a diameter of 305 mm. Cylinder slit lengths range from 12. 7 to 50. 8 mm. Failure pressures are lower for the uniaxially loaded cylinders in all cases. The smallest percent failure pressure decreases are observed for the (+/- 45 / 90) (sub s) cylinders, while the greatest such decreases are observed for the (+/- 45 / 0) (sub s) cylinders. The relative effects of the axial stress on the cylinder failure pressures do not correlate with the degree of structural coupling. The predictive methodology is not applicable for uniaxially loaded (+/- 45 / 90) (sub s) and (+/- 45 / 0) (sub s) cylinders, may be applicable for uniaxially loaded (90 / 0 /+/- 45) (sub s) cylinders, and is applicable for the biaxially loaded (90 / 0 /+/- 45) (sub s) and (0 /+/- 45 / 90) (sub s) cylinders. This indicates that the ratios of D(sub 16) and D(sub 26) to D(sub 11), {{as opposed to the}} absolute magnitudes of D(sub 16) and D(sub 26), may be important in the failure of these cylinders and in the applicability of the methodology. Discontinuities observed in the slit tip hoop strains for all the cylinders tested indicate that subcritical damage can {{play an important role in}} the failure of tape cylinders. This role varies with layup and loading condition and is likely coupled to the effects of structural anisotropy. Biaxial failure pressures may exceed the uniaxial values because the axial stress contributes to the formation of 0 deg ply splitting (accompanied by delamination) or similar stress-mitigating subcritical damage. The failure behavior of similar cylinders can also vary as a result of differences in the role of subcritical damage as observed for the case of a biaxially loaded (90 / 0 /+/- 45) (sub s) cylinder with a 12. 7 mm slit. For this case, the methodology is valid when the initial coupon and cylinder fracture modes agree. However, the methodology underpredicts the failure pressure of the cylinder when a circumferential fracture path, suggestive of a 0 deg ply split, occurs at one slit tip. Thus, the failure behavior of some tape cylinders may be highly sensitive to the initial subcritical damage mechanism. Finite element analyses are recommended to determine how structural anisotropy and axial stress modify the slit tip stress states in cylinders from those found in flat plates since similarity of these stress states is a fundamental assumption of the current predictive methodology...|$|R
