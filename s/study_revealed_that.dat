5|$|In 2006, {{researchers}} of Oman's Sultan Qaboos University published {{their findings}} from a chemical {{investigation into the}} leaves in which they found it contained semiglabrin, semigalbrinol, and a new flavanone named apollineanin. One 2014 <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> pseudosemiglabrin extracted from the aerial parts of Tephrosia apollinea had an antiproliferative effect on cancer cell lines.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{representatives of}} the genus were {{assigned}} to the family Azotobacteraceae Pribram, 1933, but then were transferred to the family Pseudomonadaceae based on the studies of nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA. In 2004, a phylogenetic <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> A. vinelandii belongs to the same clade as the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and in 2007 it was suggested that the genera Azotobacter, Azomonas and Pseudomonas are related and might be synonyms.|$|E
5|$|His job was {{to prepare}} staff studies on {{upcoming}} potential operations. While he did do naval planning, his team prepared plans that coordinated land, air and sea operations. A staff study might be put into effect and become an operation, or MacArthur might shelve it {{in favor of an}} alternative operation, especially if the staff <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> it would be too time-consuming, difficult or costly. The three teams would work simultaneously on three different objectives in leapfrog fashion. Tarbuck routinely attended staff conferences that involved naval matters.|$|E

5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, SDSU {{was deemed}} {{the number one}} small {{research}} university in the nation. The ranking was determined based on faculty productivity, honorary awards, publications in journals, and number of research grants received. At any point, the campus usually has around 800 studies in progress in various fields. A 2007 <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> the campus has an economic impact of $2.4 billion on the San Diego region. Due to projections of current and future growth, the study indicated that the school's economic impact {{is expected to increase}} to $4.5 billion by 2025.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 4–7 by 2–3µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and {{embedded}} in the gleba. A 1982 <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> spores of species in the Phallaceae family, including Mutinus elegans, have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3µm diameter) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar scar is a circular indentation {{at one end of}} the spore, and it most likely results during the separation of the attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium.|$|E

5|$|According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the British Beekeepers Association {{reported}} the bee {{population in the}} United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> in Italy the mortality rate was 40–50%. However, EFSA officials point out the figures are not very reliable because before the bees started dying, no harmonisation {{was used in the}} way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the varroa mite, two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides.|$|E
5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> 11.5% of the {{population}} of these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} developed in mice may provide insight into providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein. In 2013, a <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the National Cancer Institute {{undertook}} a large study, using cancer case {{information from the}} Institute's SEER database. The published findings from the <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> there was no increased incidence of cancer in persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40. Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 {{and those who did}} not. The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the <b>study,</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E

5|$|While the subspecific {{status of}} the Asiatic lion (P. l. persica) is {{generally}} accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies; therefore, all sub-Saharan lions have sometimes been considered a single subspecies. However, a recent <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, West-Central African lions are {{more closely related to}} North African and Asian lions than to Southern or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa, and a subsequent recolonisation of these parts from Asia.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the Sheffield economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning <b>study</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that,</b> in 2003, the Sheffield {{district}} of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E
