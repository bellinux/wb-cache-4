5000|$|Set screws are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the <b>screw</b> push the <b>flat</b> into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large set <b>screws</b> holding against <b>flats</b> to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set <b>screws</b> without <b>flats</b> are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} vehicles use {{far less}} welded sections than at first intended.

50|$|A G-clamp is used {{by means}} of turning the screw through {{the bottom of the}} frame until the desired state of {{pressure}} or release is reached. In the case that the clamp is being tightened, this is when the objects being secured are satisfactorily secured between the flat end of the <b>screw</b> and the <b>flat</b> end of the frame. If the clamp is being loosened, this is when a sufficient amount of force is released to allow the secured objects to be moved.|$|R
5000|$|The tool used {{to drive}} a slotted screw head is called a standard, common blade, flat-blade, slot-head, straight, flat, flat-tip, or [...] "{{flat-head}}" [...] screwdriver. This last usage can be confusing, because the term flat-head also describes a <b>screw</b> with a <b>flat</b> top, designed to install in a countersunk hole. Furthermore, the term implies that a screwdriver has a [...] "head"; it does not. Such a flat-headed screw may have a slotted, cross, square recessed, or combination head.

One end of this <b>screw</b> contains a <b>flat</b> edge of similar size to the one {{at the top of the}} frame, and the other end usually a small metal bar, perpendicular to the screw itself, which is used to gain leverage when tightening the clamp. When the clamp is completely closed, the flat end of the screw is in contact with the flat end on the frame. [...] When the clamp is actually used, it is very rare that this occurs. Generally some other object or objects will be contained between the top and bottom flat edges.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} an {{overview}} of various designs developed for joints of rod elements of space structures. Designs under consideration include those developed by domestic and foreign researchers and structural engineers. Space joints are clustered {{on the basis of}} their characteristic features, and their principal strengths and weaknesses are specified by the authors. The authors’ overview serves as the basis for an advanced structural solution developed for modular joints of space elements. A space joint consists of four space details having holes that are fastened to the central element by two bolts (<b>screws).</b> A <b>flat</b> plate with holes is attached to the edge of the central element. Space details and the core element are to have a gap between them. Rod ends are inserted into gaps and fastened to joints with bolts. The proposed solution may be used to reduce the material consumption rate (steel and plastic) and to simplify the assembly of structures. The solution proposed by the authors also improves the reliability of joints due to the integrity of elements, their rigid fastening to the central element, and the use of two cross-section bolts.

50|$|The Jurassic age {{limestone}} {{is about}} 150 {{million years old}} and was laid down in a marine corridor that extended from the Gulf of Cádiz to Alicante between the present Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. These seabeds were uplifted to an elevation of over 1300 meters during the Tertiary era, resulting in a modest mountain range of flat-lying limestone, which is rare in Andalucia. Later, a series of fractures, cracks and faults at right-angles (generally NW-SE and NE-SW) were exploited by erosion and produced the alleys between large blocks of limestone visible today. The blocks themselves {{have been subjected to}} both dissolution by water (karstification) and freeze-thaw splitting action which, working on the limestone’s horizontal beds, resulted in the various shapes visible today, many of which resemble, and have been named after, everyday objects such as the Sphinx, the Jug, the Camel, the <b>Screw,</b> etc. Other <b>flat</b> surfaces have been karstified into rugged, rocky lands where travel on foot is difficult.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTwo fiber-optic accelerometer designs are presented. The first accelerometer was constructed using two flexural disks between {{which is a}} center spindle. Six uniformly spaced screws fasten the disk assembly to a circular, hollow base housing fiber-optic couplers and splices and providing fiber access. The disk edge is elastically restrained. A flat spirally wound coil of optical fiber is bonded to on surface of each disk. Disk surface strains, caused by acceleration, are detected in a push-pull fashion by fiber coils comprising the legs of a Mach-Zender optical interferometer. This sensor demonstrated an acceleration sensitivity og 2. 3 +/- 0. 1. rad g over a bandwidth of 150 - 475 Hz. The resonance frequency was q. 22 +/- 0. 05 kHz. The second accelerometer design described exploits the benefits of using a disk material having a significantly slower sound speed that aluminum, in general, a slower sound speed increases the acceleration sensitivity and decrease the resonance frequency. One polycarbonate disk with a simply supported edge condition is fastened between an aluminum cap and an aluminum housing base secured with six uniformly spaced <b>screws.</b> On <b>flat</b> fiber coil in each Mach-Zender interferometer leg was bonded to each disk surface. This sensor demonstrated an accelerometer sensitivity of 56. 0 +/- 4. 0 rad/g over a bandwidth of 30 - 950 Hz. The resonance frequency was 1. 7 +/- 0. 05 kHz. Both sensors are compatible with the symmetric #x# demodulator developed at the Naval Postgraduate School.

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a <b>flat</b> head <b>screw</b> uses a <b>flat</b> die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R

O propósito do presente relato é descrever a técnica de fixação occípito-cervical tipo "inside-outside" proposta por Pait et al., e os resultados em dois pacientes operados pela via transoral para remoção da apófise odontóide. A técnica utiliza uma haste de titânio moldada para adaptar-se à curvatura occipital e colocada lateralmente até a coluna cervical; a haste é fixada no osso occipital por meio de parafuso cuja parte achatada é colocada no espaço epidural. Na coluna cervical, a haste é fixada por parafusos que são introduzidos no quadrante súpero-lateral das massas articulares. No axis, o parafuso é introduzido na "pars interarticulares" podendo terminar no próprio corpo desta vértebra ou na massa articular do atlas. Esta técnica revelou-se segura e de fácil aplicabilidade.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} animal models of chronic {{mechanical}} compression of {{the spinal cord}} have mainly focused on cervical and thoracic lesions, but few studies have investigated thoracolumbar injury.

Following insertion of the screw, there was a significant decline in motor function of the hind limbs, and severe stenosis of micro-computed tomography parameters in the spinal cord. Cortical somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes were reduced remarkably, and latencies were prolonged at 30 minutes after surgery. The loss of motor neurons in the gray matter was marked. Demyelination and cavitation were observed in the white matter. An appropriate rat model of chronic thoracolumbar cord compression was successfully created using the progressive screw compression method, which simulated spinal cord compression injury...|$|R
50|$|A {{historic}} missing {{piece of}} the Flyer III, {{thought to be a}} piece of Flyer I, turned up in 2010 in the hands of Palmer Wood, whose uncle, Thomas, had given him the piece in the 1960s. Wood took the piece to Brian Coughlin, an aircraft collector, who, not knowing what the piece was, took it to Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian Institution. The missing piece is the actuator, which connects the moment chain or arm (the Wrights still used chain link in 1905) to the front elevator. In the 1940s Orville gathered all of the stray pieces of the Flyer that were not in Massachusetts from Kitty Hawk locals who, as children, raided the Wrights' 1908 hangar for souvenirs. The actuator piece, which more than likely broke away in Wilbur's sand dune crash of May 14, 1908, somehow missed Orville's gathering efforts and was replaced with a solid or flanged piece which the Wrights did not start using until 1908. According to Peter Jakab the flanged piece is not accurate to the 1905 configuration of the Flyer III. The Wrights in 1905 used a wood assembly joined together by small <b>flat</b> plates and <b>screws.</b> The solid <b>flat</b> piece now on the Flyer was substituted in the 1947-50 restoration for the missing actuator.|$|R
5000|$|Broadway or stage flats are {{generally}} constructed of 1 × 3 in nominal (3/4 × 2+1/2 in actual) pine boards. The boards {{are laid out}} flat on the shop floor, squared, and joined with the keystones and corner blocks. The keystones and corner blocks are inset 1 in from the outside edge, which allows for flats to be hinged or butted together. They are then glued in place, and stapled or <b>screwed</b> down. The <b>flat</b> can then be flipped over and covered with muslin or decorative plywood. Toggles in a Broadway flat are placed on 4 ft centers. Broadway flats can also be constructed using half-lap joints {{at the end of}} the boards, known as dados (these would be termed a rabbets by a woodworker). Dados forgo the use of keystones and corner blocks, and joins stiles, rails, and toggles, by sawing a 3/8 in deep half-lap at the ends of the pieces, which are then glued and stapled to form a half-lap joint. Dados can be made using a radial arm saw or table saw, and a dado stack cutter (two outer circular saw blades and one or more [...] "chippers" [...] between them, giving a much wider cut). Setting up for a dado stack is approximately the same as for preparing keystones and cornerblocks, but requires less layout, as the length of stiles, rails and, toggles are equal to the face of your flat.|$|R
5000|$|To {{illustrate}} that a wheelset trajectory follows a curved path, one may place a nail or <b>screw</b> on a <b>flat</b> table top {{and give it}} a push.

This results in the wheelset moving in a curve in the opposite direction. Again it overshoots the centerline and this phenomenon continues indefinitely with the wheelset oscillating from side to side. Note that the wheel flange never makes contact with the rail. In this model, the rails are assumed to always contact the wheel tread along the same line on the rail head which assumes that the rails are knife-edge and only make contact with the wheel tread along a line (of zero width).|$|R

40|$|A proposta deste estudo foi avaliar o comportamento mecânico de dois designs de conexão implante/abutment; hexágono externo e triângulo interno, utilizando parafusos convencionais e parafusos experimentais cone morse. O estudo foi dividido em duas fases: na primeira, foi avaliado o efeito do carregamento mecânico na perda de torque dos parafusos. 40 implantes foram utilizados. Os implantes e {{abutments}} foram divididos em 4 grupos: Grupo 1 : hexágono externo/parafuso convencional (HE); Grupo 2 : triângulo interno/parafuso convencional (TI); Grupo 3 : hexágono externo/parafuso cone morse (HECM); Grupo 4 : triângulo interno/parafuso cone morse (TICM). Os abutments foram instalados em seus respectivos implantes com torque de aperto de 32 Ncm; após intervalo de 10 minutos, foram medidos os valores dos torques de desaperto. Os abutments foram instalados novamente com torque de 32 Ncm, e após 10 minutos foram carregados mecanicamente, simulando 1 ano de função oral normal; após o carregamento, os torques de desaperto dos parafusos foram medidos novamente. Os dados foram analisados com o teste one-way ANOVA, com nível de significância de p≤ 0, 05 %. Análises por microscopia óptica foram realizadas antes e após os ensaios. Na segunda fase, foi avaliada a resistência à flexão dos conjuntos implante/abutment. Os mesmos 40 conjuntos foram utilizados. Os testes foram realizados em máquina universal de ensaios, com célula de carga de 500 kgf, deslocamento de 1 mm/min, e inclinação de 45 °. A força máxima de flexão (FMF) e a força de ruptura (FR) foram determinadas. As informações coletadas foram analisadas com o teste one-way ANOVA, para p≤ 0, 05. Análises por microscopia óptica foram realizadas para estudo dos componentes após os ensaios de resistência flexural. Os resultados sugeriram que houve diferença significante (p= 0, 000) na pré-carga residual antes e após carregamento mecânico entre os dois tipos de parafuso: os parafusos cone morse apresentaram torques de desaperto significativamente superiores aos apresentados pelos parafusos planos convencionais. Houve diferença significante nos resultados da FMF obtidos pelos parafusos planos convencionais e pelos parafusos cone morse (p= 0, 011), sendo que os conjuntos implante/abutment com parafusos cone morse apresentaram maior resistência à flexão. Para os resultados da FR houve influência significante do tipo de conexão (p= 0, 019), com melhores resultados para a conexão triângulo interno. Considerando as limitações deste estudo, concluiu-se que os parafusos cone morse apresentaram maiores torques de desaperto em comparação aos parafusos planos convencionais; que o design da conexão protética não teve influência significante sobre o torque de desaperto dos parafusos; que os parafusos cone morse obtiveram maiores valores de resistência à flexão, e que a conexão em triângulo interno obteve maiores valores para a força de ruptura. The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of two implant/abutment connection designs; external hex and internal tri-channel, using conventional screws and experimental conical screws. The study was divided in two parts; the first evaluated the effect of mechanical loading in the torque loss of the screws. 40 implants were used. The implants and abutments were divided in 4 groups: Group 1 : external hex/conventional screw (HE); Group 2 : tri-channel/conventional screw (TI); Group 3 : external hex/conical screw (HECM); Group 4 : tri-channel/conical screw (TICM). The abutments were installed in their respective implants with a tightening torque of 32 Ncm, after a 10 minute interval, loosening torque were measured. The abutments were installed again with a 32 Ncm torque, and after 10 minutes, they were mechanically loaded, simulating 1 year of normal oral function; after loading, loosening torques of the screws were measured again. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test, with significance level of p≤ 0, 05. Optical microscopy analysis were performed before and after the tests. The second part evaluated the flexural resistance of the implant/abutment assemblies. The same 40 assemblies were used. The tests were performed in an universal testing machine, with a 500 kgf load cell, 1 mm/min displacement, and 45 ° angulation. Maximum bending moment (FMF) and rupture force (FR) were determined. Collected information were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test, for p≤ 0, 05. Optical microscopy analysis were performed for study of the components after the flexural resistance tests. The results suggested that there were significant differences (p= 0, 000) in the residual preload before and after mechanical loading between the two types of screws: conical screws showed significantly higher loosening torques than conventional <b>flat</b> <b>screws.</b> There were significant differences in the FMF obtained by the conventional <b>flat</b> <b>screws</b> and by the conical screws (p= 0, 000); the implant/abutment assemblies with conical screws presented higher flexural resistance. For the FR results, there was significant influence of the type of connection (p= 0, 019); the tri-channel connection presented better results. Considering the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the conical screws presented higher loosening torques compared to conventional flat screws; the design of the implant/abutment connection presented no significant influence on the loosening torques of the screws; conical screws showed higher bending moment values; and the tri-channel connection obtained higher rupture force values...|$|R
60|$|A {{thousand}} unuttered thoughts hummed {{for him in}} the air {{of these}} observations; not the least frequent of which was that Sarah might well of a truth not quite know whither she was drifting. She was in no position not to appear to expect that Chad should treat her handsomely; yet she struck our friend as privately stiffening a little each time she missed the chance of marking the great nuance. The great nuance was in brief that of course her brother must treat her handsomely--she should like to see him not; but that treating her handsomely, none the less, wasn't all in all--treating her handsomely buttered no parsnips; and that in fine there were moments when she felt the fixed eyes of their admirable absent mother fairly <b>screw</b> into the <b>flat</b> of her back. Strether, watching, after his habit, and overscoring with thought, positively had moments of his own in which he found himself sorry for her--occasions on which she affected him as a person seated in a runaway vehicle and turning over the question of a possible jump. WOULD she jump, could she, would THAT be a safe placed--this question, at such instants, sat for him in her lapse into pallor, her tight lips, her conscious eyes. It came back to the main point at issue: would she be, after all, to be squared? He believed on the whole she would jump; yet his alternations on this subject were the more especial stuff of his suspense. One thing remained well before him--a conviction that was in fact to gain sharpness from the impressions of this evening: that if she SHOULD gather in her skirts, close her eyes and quit the carriage while in motion, he would promptly enough become aware. She would alight from her headlong course more or less directly upon him; it would be appointed to him, unquestionably, to receive her entire weight. Signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him had as it happened, multiplied even through the dazzle of Chad's party. It was partly under the nervous consciousness of such a prospect that, leaving almost every one in the two other rooms, leaving those of the guests already known to him as well as a mass of brilliant strangers of both sexes and of several varieties of speech, he had desired five quiet minutes with little Bilham, whom he always found soothing and even a little inspiring, and to whom he had actually moreover something distinct and important to say.|$|R
