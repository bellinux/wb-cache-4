Compared with the previous season Eldana over three seasons from 1975176 to 1977178 there was an improvement during 1977178 for some mills and a deterioration for others. Results indicate an increase in Eldana incidence in cane south of the Tugela River, and that Eldana is now a severe problem in the Amatikulu area.

40|$|Measurements of {{apparent}} specific volume (ASV) {{for a series}} of alternative sweeteners (cyclamates, sulfamates, <b>saccharins,</b> acesulfames and anilinomethanesulfonates) have been made. Taste data have been obtained for many of the new compounds unless the toxicity of the associated metals precluded this. Apparent molar volume (AMV), isentropic specific (IASC) and isentropic molar (IAMC) compressibilities were also measured. Sixteen metallic cyclamates cyc-C 6 H 11 NHSO 3 M and two phenylsulfamates ArNHSO 3 Na, namely 3. 5 -dimethyl- and 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenylsulfamates have been examined. When the ASVs for these are combined with those for 15 aliphatic, aromatic and alicyclic sulfamates from a previous study, many of the values are seen to fall into the region that was previously identified as being the "sweet area", i. e. the ASVs lay between similar to 0. 5 and similar to 0. 7 (a few sweet compounds fall below this range and it is suggested that it could be extended slightly to accommodate these). Interestingly, the anilinomethanesulfonates, ArNHCH 2 SO 3 Na (Ar = C 6 H 5 -, 3 -MeC 6 H 4 - and 3 -ClC 6 H 4 -) lie clearly in the sweet region but only one of them shows slight sweetness showing that the molecular structural change made (compared with the 'parent' sulfamate-NHSO 3 -) cannot be accommodated at the receptor site.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the concurrent presentation of <b>saccharin</b> on the maintenance of alcohol-drinking behavior in selectively bred Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats. Rats were initially given access to alcohol [10 % (volume/volume) in water] and water under the home cage, two-bottle, free-choice regimen, with unlimited access for 24 h/day for eight consecutive weeks. Next, a third bottle, containing <b>saccharin</b> [0 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, 1 %, or 3 % (weight/volume) in water], was concomitantly offered for an additional 10 consecutive days. Intake of <b>saccharin</b> solution resulted as an inverted-U function of <b>saccharin</b> concentration, with the 0. 1 % <b>saccharin</b> solution being the highest accepted. Alcohol intake was a U function of <b>saccharin</b> concentration, being reduced by 65 %- 95 % in the group of rats exposed to the 0. 1 % <b>saccharin</b> solution. These results indicate that (1) the concurrent presentation of highly palatable solutions of <b>saccharin</b> markedly reduced alcohol intake in alcohol-experienced sP rats and (2) the reducing effect of <b>saccharin</b> solutions on the alcohol intake in sP rats was positively related to their degree of acceptability.

40|$|<b>Saccharin</b> is a {{commonly}} used artificial sweetener in foodstuffs. However, for its carcinogenic dispute, it has beenregulated by government bodies. In this study, isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS) was introduced for the accuratequantification of <b>saccharin.</b> To employ ID-LC/MS, we obtained its isotope analogue, 13 C 1 −sodium <b>saccharin,</b> by customized synthesis. Samples were spiked with 13 C 1 -sodium <b>saccharin</b> and analyzed with LC/MS in negative mode.

40|$|Rats {{that are}} expecting {{a high value}} reward (e. g., 1. 0 M sucrose) show an exaggerated underresponding when they are instead given a low value reward (e. g., 0. 15 % <b>saccharin),</b> an effect termed {{successive}} negative contrast (SNC). In the present experiment, insular cortex-lesioned (ICX) rats showed normal responsivity to sucrose and <b>saccharin</b> prior to the reward downshift. However, when switched from sucrose to <b>saccharin</b> during the postshift trials these rats displayed no evidence of SNC. Indeed, over the downshift trials these ICX rats consistently drank more <b>saccharin</b> than the ICX rats maintained on <b>saccharin</b> throughout the experiment.

40|$|Six monkeys self-administered orally {{delivered}} phencyclidine ("angel dust") and <b>saccharin</b> under concurrent fixed-ratio 16 schedules during daily three-hour sessions. Liquid deliveries were {{contingent upon}} lip-contact responses on solenoid-operated drinking spouts. Three <b>saccharin</b> concentrations (0. 003 %, 0. 03 % and 0. 3 %, wt/vol) {{were tested in}} a nonsystematic order. For each <b>saccharin</b> concentration, the following series of phencyclidine concentrations (mg/ml) was presented: 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 0. 25 (retest), 0. 125, 0. 0625, 0. 0312, 0. 25 (retest) and 0 (water with stimuli signaling phencyclidine). As the <b>saccharin</b> concentration increased, the number of drug deliveries decreased, and the peaks of the concentration-response functions were shifted to the right. The lowest <b>saccharin</b> concentration (0. 003 %, wt/vol) maintained responding in excess of phencyclidine levels in only one monkey. The two higher <b>saccharin</b> concentrations maintained behavior far in excess of phencyclidine, but <b>saccharin</b> deliveries decreased in some monkeys as phencyclidine concentration and intake (mg/kg) increased. The time course and patterns of phencyclidine-reinforced responding were also altered when <b>saccharin</b> was concurrently available.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the concurrent presentation of <b>saccharin</b> on the acquisition of alcohol-drinking behavior in selectively bred Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats. Alcohol-naive rats were given access to <b>saccharin</b> [0 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, 1 %, or 3 % (weight/volume) in water], alcohol [10 % (volume/volume) in water], and water under the home cage, three-bottle, free-choice regimen, with unlimited access for 24 h/day for 10 consecutive days. Intake of <b>saccharin</b> solution resulted as an inverted-U function of <b>saccharin</b> concentration, reaching polydipsic-like values at the 0. 1 % concentration. In contrast, alcohol intake was a U function of <b>saccharin</b> concentration, being virtually suppressed in the groups of rats exposed to the highly accepted 0. 1 % and 1 % concentrations of <b>saccharin.</b> These results indicate that (1) the concurrent presentation of highly palatable solutions of <b>saccharin</b> suppresses acquisition of alcohol-drinking behavior in sP rats and (2) the suppressive effect of <b>saccharin</b> solutions on the acquisition of alcohol-drinking behavior in sP rats was positively related to their degree of acceptability.

40|$|While feeding is rewarding, {{the feeling}} of {{satiation}} has been theorized to be aversive under certain conditions. Using a food-restriction model of overeating developed in our laboratory the results presented here suggest that overeating, and the resulting experience of satiation, is capable of supporting a conditioned taste avoidance. Rats had either ad lib (n= 8) or restricted (n= 24) food access (receiving 50 % of the food eaten by ad lib fed rats) for 8 days. All rats were then given 24 hr access to a 0. 1 % <b>saccharin</b> solution, and two groups of food-restricted rats were given access to either 100 % of the food eaten by the ad lib rats, or ad lib food access. This cycle was given once in Experiment 1 and three times (with 4 days between cycles) in Experiment 2. Rats were then returned to their previous feeding schedules for 1 day before being placed on ad lib food access until feeding was approximately equal for all groups. Rats were then tested for <b>saccharin</b> consumption in a two-bottle choice test of <b>saccharin</b> and water. Rats that were overeating {{at the time of}} the one-bottle <b>saccharin</b> acquisition trial(s) were expected to experience a change in internal state as a result of the influx in calories and associate this with the novel <b>saccharin</b> solution. This change in state should result in an avoidance of the <b>saccharin</b> at the two-bottle test. In Experiment 1, at the two-bottle test, the restricted-ad lib feeding rats (those that overate) showed reduced <b>saccharin</b> consumption compared to the ad lib control rats, although these results were not significant. In Experiment 2, after three acquisition trials, the restricted-ad lib feeding group showed significantly reduced <b>saccharin</b> consumption compared to all other groups. Experiment 3 sought to understand the learning component of the taste avoidance by making the <b>saccharin</b> familiar. Half of the rats were given 8 days of pre-exposure to the <b>saccharin</b> solution, after which they underwent the experimental procedure used in Experiment 2, with half the rats on food restriction. Because they had previously shown the largest difference in <b>saccharin</b> consumption, only the rest-adlib (n= 32) and adlib-adlib (n= 32) groups were used in this experiment. After 8 days, all rats received 24 hr access to the <b>saccharin</b> solution, and the food restricted rats received access to ad lib food. Non-restricted rats received the <b>saccharin</b> without a change in feeding. <b>Saccharin</b> consumption was measured and it was found that {{at the time of the}} two-bottle test, prior <b>saccharin</b> exposure attenuated the decreased <b>saccharin</b> consumption seen in the rest-adlib group in Experiments 1 and 2. Overall, the results of these studies showed that the experimental design was successful in inducing overeating in previously restricted rats. When this bout of overeating was paired with a novel <b>saccharin</b> solution, rats later showed reduced consumption of the solution even after feeding levels returned to baseline. This reduced consumption was attenuated by pre-exposure to the <b>saccharin</b> solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>saccharin</b> (1, 2 -benzisothiazol- 3 -one- 1, 1 -dioxide) derivatives substituted on the benzene ring has seen limited development despite {{the longevity of}} this compound’s use as an artificial sweetener.

Here we report the derivatisation of the benzene ring of <b>saccharin</b> using Cu(I) -catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) to synthesise a diverse library of novel saccharin- 1, 2, 3 -triazole conjugates. All library compounds retain the capability for interactions with biomolecules via the unmodified sulfonamide and lactam groups of the parent <b>saccharin</b> core heterocycle. The compounds also encompass alternate orientations of the 1, 2, 3 -triazole heterocycle, thus further adding diversity to the potential hydrogen bonding interactions of these compounds with biomolecules of therapeutic interest.

40|$|Six rhesus monkeys {{were trained}} to self-administer orally {{delivered}} phencyclidine (0. 25 mg/mL) and <b>saccharin</b> (0. 03 % wt/vol) under concurrent fixed-ratio 16 schedules. In Condition 1 the fixed-ratio requirement for phencyclidine was changed from 16 to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 16 while the fixed-ratio requirement for <b>saccharin</b> deliveries remained constant at 16. In Condition 2 the fixed-ratio value for <b>saccharin</b> was systematically altered while the fixed-ratio requirement for phencyclidine remained at 16, and in Condition 3 the fixed-ratio requirements for both phencyclidine and <b>saccharin</b> were altered simultaneously. Water was then substituted for <b>saccharin,</b> and the series of fixed-ratio manipulations was replicated. The phencyclidine concentration was reduced to 0. 125 mg/mL and Conditions 1 and 3 were repeated. When the fixed-ratio requirement for phencyclidine was increased and the fixed-ratio requirement for <b>saccharin</b> or water remained fixed at 16, phencyclidine deliveries decreased when <b>saccharin</b> (vs. water) was concurrently available. The magnitude of the decrease ranged from 20 % to 90 % (of the concurrent water condition) as the fixed-ratio requirement for phencyclidine increased from 4 to 128. When the fixed-ratio requirement for phencyclidine remained at 16 and the fixed-ratio requirements for concurrent <b>saccharin</b> or water varied between 4 and 128, phencyclidine deliveries decreased by 30 % to 40 % due to the concurrent availability of <b>saccharin</b> (vs. water). This decrease occurred only at the three lowest fixed-ratio values when <b>saccharin</b> intake was relatively high. When the fixed-ratio requirements for both phencyclidine and concurrent <b>saccharin</b> or water were varied simultaneously, phencyclidine deliveries were reduced from 20 % to 45 % when <b>saccharin</b> (vs. water) was concurrently present. There was little effect of reducing the phencyclidine concentration when the data were analyzed in terms of unit price (responses per milligram). Thus, changes in the fixed-ratio requirement or drug concentration were functionally similar, and unit price of phencyclidine was the variable that {{was influenced by the}} presence of concurrent <b>saccharin.</b> These data indicate that drug-reinforced behavior is substantially reduced when the environment is enriched with an alternative nondrug reinforcer.

40|$|<b>Saccharin</b> is {{carcinogenic}} for the {{urinary bladder}} in rats and mice, {{and most likely}} is carcinogenic in human beings. The neoplasms of the urinary bladder are malignant and invade and metastasize. Male rats {{are more susceptible to}} urinary bladder carcinogenesis than female rats. Rats exposed as fetuses develop neoplasms more readily than rats exposed as weanlings. The lesions in the urinary bladder go through the stages of hyperplasia, hyperplastic nodules, and later carcinomas. The male of the human species ingesting <b>saccharin,</b> as for rats, is more susceptible to carcinogenesis of the urinary bladder than the female. Neoplasms of the urinary bladder in rats were not caused by stones, parasites, sodium, or impurities. Carcinomas developed at the same time or prior to the development of stones in rats with both. There is a cocarcinogenic effect between <b>saccharin</b> and methyinitrosurea for the urinary bladder. Even though carcinomas of the urinary bladder are present in rats given the higher doses of <b>saccharin,</b> one was observed in a female rat given 0. 5 %. Chronic renal disease develops in rats ingesting <b>saccharin.</b> The disease is more advanced at the lower doses than at the higher doses, suggesting that <b>saccharin</b> at the lower doses does not reach the urinary bladder. Early neoplasms are seen in the renal pelvis of rats given the higher doses of <b>saccharin.</b> The risk ratios for urinary bladder carcinomas in human beings increase with both frequency and duration of <b>saccharin</b> usage. Benign and malignant neoplasms at all sites are significantly increased in mice and rats ingesting the higher doses of <b>saccharin.</b> These neoplasms are present in the reproductive and hematopoietic systems, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the lungs, vascular system and squamous epithelium.

40|$|Summary. -The {{importance}} of the contaminant OTS in the promoting activity of commercial <b>saccharin</b> on rat bladder neoplasia was investigated. OTS, OTS-free and OTS-contaminated <b>saccharin</b> were administered in the drinking water or diet for 2 years to groups of rats pretreated with an intravesical instillation of MNU; OTS alone and OTS-free <b>saccharin</b> were also given to groups of rats not pretreated with MNU. Administration of OTS {{was not associated with}} changes in urinary pH, crystalluria or calculus formation, had no effect on the histology of normal rat bladder, and did not increase the incidence of bladder hyperplasia or neoplasia elicited by pretreatment with MNU. No differences could be found between the effect of OTS-free or OTS-contaminated <b>saccharin</b> on bladders of rats pretreated with MNU. These results indicate that OTS contamination played no part in the reported promoting activity of <b>saccharin</b> on the rat bladder.

40|$|Although {{chlorhexidine}} is {{the most}} effective agent against dental plaque it is extremely bitter. To prepare formulations, it is necessary to use flavoring and sweetening, which can inhibit the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine. <b>Saccharin</b> has been considered a compatible substance to use in chlorhexidine rinse or gel preparations; however, the effect of a range of concentrations has not been studied. To evaluate the effect of different concentrations of <b>saccharin</b> on the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine gel, hydroxy-ethyl-cellulose gels containing 1. 0 % chlorhexidine digluconate and 0. 0 to 1. 0 % sodium <b>saccharin</b> were prepared. Activity against Streptococcus mutans was evaluated using the agar diffusion method and determination of MIC values. The inhibitory zones of growth were 7. 83 +/- 0. 54 mm when no <b>saccharin</b> was added to the chlorhexidine gel and 7. 75 +/- 0. 50, 7. 63 +/- 0. 48, 6. 21 +/- 0. 40, 4. 13 +/- 0. 38, when the concentrations of <b>saccharin</b> in the gels were 0. 02, 0. 10, 0. 5, and 1. 0 %, respectively. The range of MIC values was 1 - 2 micrograms/ml, with <b>saccharin</b> concentrations of 0 %, 0. 02, and 0. 1 %. In contrast, the MIC values were 4 - 8 and 8 - 16 micrograms/ml with <b>saccharin</b> concentrations of 0. 5 % and 1. 0 %, respectively. The paired "t" test showed that 0. 5 and 1. 0 % sodium <b>saccharin</b> inhibit the antibacterial activity of 1 % digluconate chlorhexidine gel. These in vitro results suggest that <b>saccharin</b> may inhibit the efficacy of chlorhexidine against mutans streptococci, depending on the concentration...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{occurrence}} of the preneoplastic lesion, papillary or nodular hyperplasia (PN hyperplasia) in rat urinary bladder induced by carcinogens is correlated with that of cancer. Therefore, the promoting effects of chemicals in two-stage bladder carcinogenesis were judged by measuring their ability to induce PN hyperplasia in rats. Male rats were given N-butyl-N 44 -hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) for 4 weeks and then one of 16 test chemicals for 32 to 34 weeks. <b>Saccharin,</b> ascorbate, DL-tryptophan, allopurinol, and diphenyl promoted development of PN hyperplasia. The dose-response of the promoters were examined in both sexes of rats by administration of <b>saccharin</b> at doses of 0. 04, 0. 2, 1. 0 and 5. 0 % for 32 weeks after BBN treatment. The occurrence of PN hyperplasia was significantly increased in the group given 5 % <b>saccharin.</b> Dose-response curves showed enhanced hyperplastic responses in both sexes given 0. 2 to 5 % <b>saccharin.</b> The organ specificities of promoters were studied in rats initiated with BBN or 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 -AAF) followed by phenobarbital or <b>saccharin</b> for 32 weeks. Phenobarbital greatly enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis. <b>Saccharin</b> significantly enhanced the occurrence of both BBN-induced and 2 -AAF-induced PN hyperplasia. However, there was no effect of phenobarbital on the urinary bladder or of <b>saccharin</b> on the liver. The rats showed a strain difference in susceptibility of the urinary bladder to saccharin; ACI rats were most susceptible and Sprague Dawley rats were most resistant to <b>saccharin.</b> The membrane potential of superficial epithelial cells in the urinary bladder of rats treated with <b>saccharin</b> was measured with an intracellular microelectrode and found to be higher than that of controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics and material properties such as stress, microstructure, {{and composition of}} nickel coatings and electroformed components can be controlled {{over a wide range}} by the addition of small amounts of surface-active compounds to the electroplating bath. <b>Saccharin</b> is one compound that is widely utilized for its ability to reduce tensile stress and refine grain size in electrodeposited nickel. While the effects of <b>saccharin</b> on nickel electrodeposition have been studied by many authors in the past, there is still uncertainty over saccharin's mechanisms of incorporation, stress reduction, and grain refinement. In-situ scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a tool {{that can be used to}} directly image the nucleation and growth of thin nickel films at nanometer length scales to help elucidate saccharin's role in the development and evolution of grain structure. In this study, in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) techniques are used to investigate the effects of <b>saccharin</b> on the morphological evolution of thin nickel films. By observing mono-atomic height nickel island growth with and without <b>saccharin</b> present we conclude that <b>saccharin</b> has little effect on the nickel surface mobility during deposition at low overpotentials where the growth occurs in a layer-by-layer mode. <b>Saccharin</b> was imaged on Au(l 11) terraces as condensed patches without resolved packing structure. AFM measurements of the roughness evolution of nickel films up to 1200 nm thick on polycrystalline gold indicate that <b>saccharin</b> initially increases the roughness and surface skewness of the deposit that at greater thickness becomes smoother than films deposited without <b>saccharin.</b> Faceting of the deposit morphology decreases as <b>saccharin</b> concentration increases even for the thinnest films that have 3 -D growth...|$|R
