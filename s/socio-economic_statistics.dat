25|$|The {{decennial census}} {{has been the}} method of {{collecting}} United Kingdom-wide population-based statistics since 1801. Currently the UK census is governed by the Census Act 1920. However, prior to 1841 it {{was no more than}} a headcount. Since 1841, except in 1941 when no census took place due to the Second World War, detail was gathered about the household. Until the 1901 the enumerators were responsible for completing census enumerator sheets, transcribing the details included in household schedules completed by the head of the household. From the 1911 census onwards an individual census form, provided by and returned to an enumerator, was completed by the head of the household and became the primary source of demographic data. In 2001 census returns were for the first time sent out by post, but were collected by enumerators. The 2011 UK Census was the first time, individual census forms were issued through the Royal Mail and could also be returned by post, except in Scotland where instead they were collected by enumerators. Census forms could also be completed and submitted through the internet by the householder.

40|$|The {{database}} {{structure for}} agro-ecological land resources assessment for development planning in Kenya comprises two broad categories of data: the Land Resources Inventory (LRI) and <b>socio-economic</b> data or <b>statistics.</b> <b>Socio-economic</b> data, compiled primarily from Kenyan sources, are records of actual population, land use, crop production, livestock population, farming inputs, food, demand, etc. The agro-ecological zones (AEZ) methodology utilizes the LRI to assess, {{for a given}} level of input, all feasible agricultural land use options as well as expected production of relevant and agro-ecologically feasible cropping activities. With the benefit of socio-economic parameters which are used to define constraints, targets, production and consumption levels for planning objectives, optimal resource allocation schemes corresponding to the desired objectives can be derived.

Death registrations were used to provide counts of deaths by the NS-SEC classification, using the National Statistics definition of alcohol-related mortality for working age adults. Population estimates by age, sex and NS-SEC were obtained from previously published estimates based on the 2001 Census. The resultant mortality rates were used to analyse variations in alcohol-related mortality by socio-economic status. Alcohol-related mortality rates were substantially greater for the less advantaged NS-SEC classes, especially among the younger of the age groups studie...|$|R

40|$|Users of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>statistics</b> {{typically}} {{want more}} and better information. Often, these needs can be met simply by more extensive data collections, subject to usual concerns over financial costs and survey respondent burdens. Users, particularly for public policy purposes, have also expressed a continuing, and as yet unfilled, demand for an integrated and coherent system of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>statistics.</b> In this case, additional data will not be sufficient; the more important constraint {{is the absence of}} an agreed conceptual approach. In this paper, we briefly review the state of frameworks for social and economic statistics, including the kinds of socio-economic indicators users may want. These indicators are motivated first in general terms from basic principles and intuitive concepts, leaving aside for the moment the practicalities of their construction. We then show how a coherent structure of such indicators might be assembled. A key implication is that this structure requires a coordinated network of surveys and data collection processes, and higher data quality standards. This in turn implies a breaking down of the "stovepipe" systems that typify much of the survey work in national statistical agencies (i. e. parallel but generally unrelated data "production lines"). Moreover, the data flowing from the network of surveys must be integrated. Since the data of interest are dynamic, the proposed method goes beyond statistical matching to microsimulation modeling. Finally, these ideas are illustrated with preliminary results from the LifePaths model currently under development in Statistics Canada.

50|$|The National <b>Statistics</b> <b>Socio-economic</b> Classification (often {{abbreviated}} to NS-SEC) {{is the official}} socio-economic classification in the United Kingdom. It is an adaptation of the Goldthorpe schema which was first known as the Nuffield Class Schema developed in the 1970s. It was developed using the Standard Occupational Classification 1990 (SOC90) and rebased on the Standard Occupational Classification 2000 (SOC2000) before its first major use on the 2001 UK census. The NS-SEC replaced two previous social classifications: Socio-economic Groups (SEG) and Social Class based on Occupation (SC, formerly known as Registrar General's Social Class, RGSC).

40|$|In {{search of}} social and {{economic}} success, Tongans started to migrate to New Zealand more than 40 years ago. Government studies and other research show that Tongans and other Pacific ethnic minorities are on the lowest rung of the <b>socio-economic</b> ladder (<b>Statistics</b> New Zealand, 2002 a; Pacific Directions Report, 1999). In the midst of these negative statistics, there are pockets of success, but no detailed research has been conducted in this area (Pacific Directions Report, 1999). This thesis explores the diverse perspectives on and attitudes to, social and economic success in four generations of a migrant Tongan kainga (extended family). It examines the insights and understanding of this particular kainga of the concept of success, and analyses the values and motives that drive them to achieve it. It investigates the strategies they employ to achieve goals, the challenges they face, and why they are successful. An exploratory study, this thesis argues that more research should be conducted on the socio-economic success of Tongans. Findings from such research can inform policies and strategies for socio-economic development for Tongan families and community groups in Aotearoa New Zealand. This research will contribute to the construction of a larger and more representative study of successful Tongan kainga that can inform the development {{of social and}} economic policies for Tongans in New Zealand...|$|R
