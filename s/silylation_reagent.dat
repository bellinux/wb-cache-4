The high polarity of such compounds precludes direct GC-MS analysis. In addition, many such compounds often {{exist in a}} single sample at trace levels. An analytical method has been developed to identify compounds containing one or more functional groups of carbonyl, carboxy, and hydroxy in atmospheric samples. In the method, -C=O groups are derivatized using 0 -(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxy amine (PFBHA), and -COOH and -OH groups are derivatized using a <b>silylation</b> <b>reagent</b> N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoro-acetamide (BSTFA). The derivatives are easily resolved by a GC column. The chemical ionization mass spectra of these derivatives exhibit several pseudomolecular ions, allowing unambiguous determination of molecular weights. Functional group identification is accomplished by monitoring the ions in the electron ionization mass spectra that are characteristic of each functional group derivative: m/z 181 for carbonyl and m/z 73 and 75 for carboxyl and hydroxy groups. The method is used to identify products in laboratory studies of ozone oxidation of alpha-pinene and Delta(3) -carene.

40|$|Traces of {{prebiotic}} amino acids, i. e., {{the building}} blocks of proteins, are excellent biomarkers that could pro-vide evidence of extinct or extant life in extra-terrestrial environments. In particular, characterization of the enantio-meric excess of amino acids gives relevant information about the biotic or abiotic origin of molecules, because it is generally assumed that life elsewhere could be based on eitherLorDamino acids, but not both. The analytical pro-cedures used in in-situ space missions for chiral discrimina-tion of amino acids must meet severe requirements imposed by flight conditions: short analysis time, low energy con-sumption, robustness, storage for long periods under extreme conditions, high efficiency and sensitivity, automation, and remote-control operation. Such methods are based on gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis, usually coupled with mass spec-trometry; of these, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) is the only such combination yet used in space missions. Preliminary in-situ sample derivatization is required before GC–MS analysis to convert amino acids into volatile and thermally stable compounds. The <b>silylation</b> <b>reagent</b> most commonly used,N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl) -N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, isunsuitable for detection of homochirality, and alternative derivatization techniques have been developed that preserve the stereochemical configuration of the original compounds and are com-patible with spaceflight conditions.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{increasing}} interest in water-soluble organic compounds (WSOCs) in the atmosphere is fuelled by their potential role in affecting the global climate, since they alter the hygroscopic properties of atmospheric particle, affecting their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei and can also contribute to higher atmospheric absorption of solar radiation and atmospheric heating. In addition, some WSOCs – such as dicarboxylic acids and saccharides – are potentially useful molecular tracers, since they can have several different sources including primary emissions from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion, as well as photochemical oxidation of organic precursors of both biogenic (e. g. pinonic acid) and anthropogenic precursors (e. g. phthalic and benzoic acids). GC–MS is the most widely applied technique for the characterization of organic aerosols since it yields excellent separation efficiency, sensitivity and high number of species analyzed. Due to their high polarity, hydrophilicity and low volatility, carboxylic acids and saccharides have to be converted into volatilizable and stable derivatives — i. e., trimethylsilyl derivatives using BSTFA(N,Obis(trimethylsilyl) -trifluoroacetamide) as <b>silylation</b> <b>reagent.</b> Indeed, multi-residue analytical methodologies, that achieve simultaneous analysis of several compounds, are useful for reducing the complexity and time required for sample preparation and analysis {{in order to provide}} a large amount of reliable data.

40|$|Sulphur dioxide {{reacts with}} 1 -oxydienes {{generating}} zwitterions which are quenched by enoxysilanes to form substituted silyl alkenylsulfinates. These intermediates are desilylated with Bu 4 NF {{and the resulting}} sulfinates react with MeI giving the corresponding methyl sulfones. This new SO 2 reaction cascade, hetero-Diels-Alder addition of SO 2 /oxyallylation/alkylation, was expanded {{to a variety of}} electrophiles successfully. Several functional sulfones have been synthesized in modest to high yields. A number of chiral Lewis acids have been prepared and applied into this reaction cascade. Two common techniques were employed to analyze the enantiomeric excess in the resulted sulfones: chiral HPLC and chemical shift reagents. No interesting result was obtained. The removal of water in the reaction system indeed made the reaction better but did not lead to any increase in the enantioselectivity. Silyl sulfinate itself was found {{not to be able to}} catalyze the reaction. The formation of (E) -product was discovered in some cases. The introduction of another coordinating oxy-substitution into the dienes did not change the reaction. So the asymmetric catalytic version could not be realized. Silyl sulfinates were found to undergo the silicon/palladium transmetallation. This process could be realized by catalysis with either Pd(PPh 3) 4 or Pd(OAc) 2. The driving force is the formation of silyl acetate. When the sulfinyl palladium complex forms, it can undergo either reductive elimination to give allyl sulfones, or elimination of SO 2 in the presence of proton source, such as isopropanol or methanol, giving retro-ene products in good yields. The success of the reactions depended on the amount of the ligand, the solvent and the temperature. More ligand, such as triphenylphosphine, and THF as solvent favor the reductive elimination, while less ligand and CH 3 CN as solvent favor the retro-ene reaction. The reaction mechanism was studied by NMR experiments which afforded the direct proofs for transmetallation reactions. Kinetic studies on the decomposition of simple silyl alkenylsulfinate into retro-ene products indicated that the cleavage of silicon-oxygen bond could be simply realized by isopropanol. CD 3 CN was found to have an enormous solvent effect. The presence of Pd(II) species made the reaction somehow faster and cleaner. Related with the studies above it was discovered that trialkylsilyl 2 -methylprop- 2 -enesulfinates are good <b>silylation</b> <b>reagents.</b> For TMS and TES sulfinates, the reactivities were the same and led to 100 % conversion in a few minutes for all kinds of alcohols. But for TBS sulfinate, the reactivity decreased significantly due to steric hindrance. Silyl sulfinates were also found to undergo silyl exchange with carboxylic anhydride and acetal/ ketal. The synthetic potential of the sequence hetero-Diels-Alder of SO 2, quenching of zwitterions intermediate with an enoxysilane, desilylation and retro-ene elimination of SO 2 was demonstrated by the synthesis of (βR, 4 R, 5 S, 6 R) -β, 2, 2, 5 -tetramethyl- 6 -{(1 R) - 1 -[(4 S, 5 S) - 2, 2, 5 -trimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 4 -yl]ethyl}- 1, 3 -dioxane- 4 -ethanol, a known synthetic intermediate in the total, asymmetric synthesis of Rifamycin S...|$|R
40|$|The {{ionisation}} {{of atoms}} and molecules via stepwise excitation of long-lived intermediate electronic states is called resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionisation (REMPI). At comparably low power densities, {{on the order}} of 10 6 W cm - 2, REMPI becomes an ionisation method which is selective and sensitive towards aromatic hydrocarbons. On the one hand, the method presents an advantage because aromatic compounds can be ionised directly from a complex matrix without the resonant excitation of matrix elements or commonly used solvents. On the other hand, this method limits the analyte spectrum. In order to extend the method's selectivity and sensitivity to non-aromatic compounds, ionisation labels have been adopted. These consist of an aromatic group (ionophore) which is primarily excited, a spacer, and an anchor group that is covalently coupled to the analyte. This work is concerned with the development of ionisation labels for GC applications. Here, the vaporisation of the analyte-label derivative is the property of capital importance. First, the spectroscopic characteristics of the potential labels and the derivatives were investigated by examination of their respective (1 + 1) REMPI spectra with an optical resolution of about 0. 1 nm. For this propose, a time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a medium pressure laser ionisation (MPLI) source was available. The system was refurbished, equipped with a new data-acquisition unit and coupled with an Nd:Yag laser pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO), which generates laser light of variable frequencies in a range of 200 nm to 3100 nm. As part of this project, special software was written for the control and synchronisation of OPO, mass spectrometer and data acquisition. Another important detail, which was required for recording REMPI spectra, was the design of the sample inlet. A means of transporting the analytes continuously into the ion source was created. The challenge here is to vaporise the liquid samples without diluting them too much. High dilution, as is used for pneumatically assisted vaporisation, would lead either to overtaxing the pumping system or to a decrease of the method's sensitivity. In addition to the optimisation of the sample-inlet arrangement, the configuration of the ion-source had to be revised. To this end, an auxiliary repeller was established to optimise the ions' trajectories on their way through the differential pumping stage to the detector. The result of this development was a pressure-controlled sample inlet, which also enabled the vaporisation of compounds of low volatility without pressure fluctuations in the source. The first step {{in the development of the}} ionisation labels was the recording of REMPI spectra of benzene derivatives. These compounds are suitable labels because they undergo ionisation during the REMPI process and have only little effect on the vaporisation of the label-analyte derivative. Another factor that had to be considered in the selection of labels was the ionisation yield at fixed-frequency laser wavelengths in the UV-range. Fixed-frequency lasers offer the advantages of low costs and a high repetition rate, which benefits the performance when coupling with chromatographic systems. From the beginning, the potential labels p-fluorotoluene and p-xylene were selected because of their good ionisation yield at the fourth harmonic of Nd:YAG lasers (l : 266 nm). Furthermore, aromatic <b>silylation</b> <b>reagents</b> were employed because of their rapid reactions. For detailed studies, the archetypical analytes palmitic acid and palmityl alcohol were derivatised with the potential labels, and their REMPI spectra were recorded. The measurements showed a shift of the derivatives' absorption bands, which could be explained by reduction of electron density at the aromatic ring as well as intramolecular interactions between ionophore and the coupled analyte. By variation of ionophore, spacer, and anchor group, derivatives with an ionisation maximum at the fixed-frequency laser wavelength of 266 nm could be created. It was shown that the influence of the coupled analyte on the absorption bands of the derivative could be minimised. These results lead to the conclusion that the mass-spectrometric response factors for analytes tagged with the same REMPI label are virtually identical. Provided that the presently investigated analytes have the same derivatisation yield and similar vaporisation, this method leads to a significantly simplified analysis of the data. It was shown that mixtures of fatty alcohols in both standards and real samples could be quantified without chromatographic separation, solely on the basis of the mass spectra. Similarly, the appropriateness of labels in GC analyses was demonstrated. A temperature- controlled line was constructed to transfer the sample into the ion source of the mass spectrometer. The analyses of a PAH mixture and labelled fat chemicals proved the functional efficiency of the GC-MPLI-MS coupling...|$|R
40|$|The {{vanadium}} nitride complex [Na][NV(N['Bu]Ar) 3] reacts with CO {{to produce the}} vanadium tris-anilide complex V(N['Bu]Ar) 3 and NaNCO. This is the first example of complete denitrogenation of a termainal nitride complex with generation of a lower coordinate metal complex. This reactivity contrasts sharply with the reactivity of the niobium analogue, where the nitride anion complex [Na][NNb(N['Bu]Ar) 3] is synthesized from the reductive decarbonylation of the niobium(IV) isocyanate complex (OCN) Nb(N['Bu]Ar) 3. Electrochemical studies of the niobium(IV) and vanadium(IV) isocyanate (OCN) V(N['Bu]Ar) 3 complexes are presented. The reactivity of the vanadium carbamate complex [(THF) 2 Na][O 2 CNV(N['Bu]Ar) 3] with electrophilic reagents is presented. The carbamate complex reacts readily with <b>silylation</b> and alkylation <b>reagents</b> to form the carbamate ester complexes of the type ROC(O) NV(N['Bu]Ar) 3. The vanadium carbamate complex reacts with SO 2 via a decarboxylation pathway to produce the sulforyl imido complex [Na][O 2 SNV(N['Bu]Ar) 3], the solid-state structure of which is presented. The reactivity of the vanadium carbamate complex with typical dehydrating reagents, e. g organic acid anhydrides, is shown to proceed cleanly when cobaltocene, acting as an in situ reductant, is present to form the vanadium(IV) isocyanate complex (OCN) V(N['Bu]Ar) 3. The synthesis {{and structure of the}} bimetallic complex (TPP) MnOC(O) NV(N['Bu]Ar) 3 (TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin) is presented. Although thermally stable, the complex undergoes a photochemical transformation that forms the vanadium isocyanate complex and putative OMn(TPP), which reacts with triphenylphosphine in the reaction mixture to produce triphenylphosphine oxide. The synthesis the niobium carbamate complex [Na][O 2 CNNb(N['Bu]Ar) 3] from the reaction of [Na][NNb(N[Bu]Ar) 3] with CO 2 is presented. Its solid-state structure {{in the form of the}} ionpair [(12 -crown- 4) 2 Na][O 2 CNNb(N['Bu]Ar) 3] has been determined. Reaction of the niobium carbamate complex with organic acid anhydrides results in the production of five-coordinate carboxylate, acetate complexes (RC(O) O) (OCN) Nb(N['Bu]Ar) 3. The reduction of these complexes by two electrons results in the regeneration of the niobium nitride complex (60 - 80 % yield) with concomitant release of CO (30 - 60 % yield). This three-step process represents a highly controlled conversion of CO 2 to CO via a ligand-based strategy. The reactivity of CO 2 with anionic complexes featuring terminal multiply bonded ligands is extended to the oxo anion complex [(Et 2 O) 2 Li][OTi(N['Bu]Ar) 3] resulting in the formation of the carbonate complex ([Li][O 2 COTi(N['Bu]Ar) 3]) 6. The binding of CO 2 to the oxo complex is reversible when 12 -crown- 4 is bound to the lithium countercation or if the complex is dissolved in THF. The thermodynamic parameters for the CO 2 binding equilibrium have been measured. Exchanging the lithium countercation for sodium or potassium results in a significant weakening of the CO 2 binding ability of the oxo complex. by Jared S. Silvia. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In {{recent years}} there is {{increasing}} interest in atmospheric emissions from biomass burning, {{one of the largest}} sources of accumulation mode particles globally. Specific molecular markers have been identified for tracing biomass combustion, in particular carbohydrates (predominately levoglucosan and other anydrosugars) produced by thermolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose and alkoxyphenols, as the thermally decomposition products of lignin, one of the main components in wood. As the the basic structure of lignin derives from p-coumaril, coniferyl and synapil alcohols, its burning releases in atmosphere molecules similar to their precursor, such as p-coumaric acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, acetovanillone ferulic acid, syringol, syringaldehyde, syringic acid and acetosyringone. Different kinds of woods contain the three monomers in different percentage, so that the combustion of different plant tissues releases different amounts of alkoxyphenols: diagnostic ratios of syringic/vanillic acids (S/V) and cinnamic/vanillic acids (C/V) have been proposed to identify specific emission sources, i. e., hard woods (oak, beech and walnut) or soft woods (conifers) and grass and soft plant tissues (Kuo et al, 2011). GC–MS is the most widely applied technique for the characterization of organic aerosols since it provides multi-residue analytical methodologies for the simultaneous analysis of several compounds with excellent separation efficiency, sensitivity and high number of species analyzed. Due to their high polarity, lignin phenols have to be converted into volatilizable and stable derivatives, i. e., trimethylsilyl derivatives using BSTFA(N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) -trifluoroacetamide) as <b>silylation</b> <b>reagent</b> (Pietrogrande et al, 2011). Due to small concentration of alkoxyphenols in environmental samples, very sensitive analytical methods like GC/MS/MS are needed. The present paper describes a gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method using an ion trap system, as a further development of the pervious GC/MS method (Pietrogrande et al, 2013), providing the low detection limits and the high reproducibility required by environmental monitoring. All the compounds were monitored in multiple reaction mode (MRM). For each target analyte the precursor ion and collision-induced dissociation (CID) voltage were carefully selected to optimize CID efficiency to produce daughter ion(s) and minimize interference during the analysis. Five-point calibration curves were prepared to quantify the target analytes in the concentration range of 0. 2 ngm- 3 to 5 ngm- 3 using standard solutions. As expected, compared to MS detection operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, the MS/MS method is characterized by higher specificity and sensitivity due to the effective exclusion of interfering matrix compounds. The applicability of the developed method to air quality monitoring was verified by application to PM 2. 5 filters collected under different seasons (summer vs. winter) in different sampling sites (urban vs. rural) in the Emilia Romagna region (Northen Italy) ...|$|E
40|$|Palladium-catalyzed {{cross-coupling}} {{reactions are}} versatile methods for {{the synthesis of}} carbon-carbon bonds. The Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling protocols have achieved prominence in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals {{because of the high}} yields, tolerance for functional groups, and excellent stereoselectivities. However, there are features associated with each of these processes that limit the generality: the Stille tin reagents and byproducts are toxic; and the Suzuki boron reagents can be difficult to synthesize and purify. Environmentally benign arylsilane derivatives have emerged as powerful alternatives to conventional arylmetalloids for the Pd(0) -catalyzed aryl-aryl coupling reaction with organohalides and organo(pseudo) halides because they avoid the inherent limitations associated with traditional methodologies. It was previously reported that aryl(trialkoxy) silanes (also called siloxanes) are substrates for fluoride-promoted, Pd(0) -catalyzed coupling reactions with allylic ester and aryl derivatives providing cross-coupling products in high yields under mild conditions. However, few detailed studies of the synthesis of these useful cross-coupling reagents {{have been reported in the}} literature. In chapter one of this thesis, two methods for the synthesis of aryl siloxanes are studied and the optimal reaction conditions and the scope determined: (1) general reaction conditions for the synthesis of aryl(trialkoxy) silanes from aryl Grignard and lithium reagents and functional silanes have been developed; and (2) the scope of the palladium-catalyzed silylation of aryl halides with triethoxysilane to generate aryl(trialkoxy) silane derivatives has been expanded. In tandem, these two methods provide ready access to a wide range of aryl siloxane reagents for use in Pd(0) -mediated cross-coupling reactions, including highly functionalized siloxane intermediates in the synthesis of useful biologically active compounds. In the first part of chapter one, the synthesis of aryl siloxanes from the corresponding aryl organometallic reagent and tetraalkoxysilanes is described. Although examples in the literature have reported the use of a range of silicon electrophiles (including SiCl 4 and ClSi(OR) 3), tetraalkyl orthosilicates (Si(OR) 4) allow for the most direct and convenient synthesis of arylsiloxanes, in that they are commercially available, inexpensive, and air and moisture stable. Using the reaction conditions developed herein, o-, m- and p-substituted bromoarenes underwent equally efficient metallation and silylation. Mixed results were obtained with heteroaromatic substrates: 3 -bromothiophene, 3 -bromo- 4 -methoxypyridine, 5 -bromoindole, and N-methyl- 5 -bromoindole all underwent silylation in good yield, whereas a low yield of siloxane was obtained from 2 -bromofuran, and 2 -bromopyridine failed to be silylated. The synthesis of siloxanes via organo lithium and magnesium reagents is limited by the formation of di- and triarylated silanes (Ar 2 Si(OR) 2, and Ar 3 SiOR, respectively), and dehalogenated (Ar-H) by-products. Lower temperatures allowed for the formation of predominantly monoaryl siloxanes, without requiring a large excess of the electrophile. Optimal reaction conditions for the synthesis of siloxanes from aryl Grignard reagents entailed addition of aryl magnesium reagents to 3 equiv of tetraethoxy- or tetramethoxysilane at 30 degrees C in THF. Aryl lithium species were silylated using 1. 5 equiv of tetraethoxy- or tetramethoxysilane at 78 degress C in ether. The proposed mechanism of silylation involves formation of the anionic pentacoordinate monoaryl(tetraalkoxy) silicate (ArSi(OR) 4 -), which unexpectedly is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by a second equivalent of the aryl metalloid to form diaryl(dialkoxy) siloxane by-products. The reductive dehalogenation of the aryl halide starting material presumably occurs during the metallation step, and is an inherent limitation of the use of organometallic reagents. The second part of chapter one discusses an alternative to the preparation of arylsilanes from organomagnesium or lithium intermediates: the silylation of aryl halide derivatives by triethoxysilane (HSi(OEt) 3) in the presence of a Pd catalyst. As initially reported in the literature, the silylation reaction was limited to p-substituted, electron-rich aryl iodide substrates. As described in this thesis, a more general Pd(0) -catalyst/ligand system has been developed which activates bromides and iodides: palladium (0) dibenzylideneacetone (Pd(dba) 2) is activated with 2 -(di-tert-butylphosphino) biphenyl (Buchwald's ligand) (1 : 2 mole ratio of Pd : phosphine). Electron-rich, para- and meta-substituted aryl halides (including unprotected anilines and phenols) underwent silylation to form the corresponding aryl(triethoxy) silane in fair to excellent yield; however, ortho-substituted aryl halides failed to be silylated. Aryl chlorides were inert under the reaction conditions, and triflates were poor substrates for silylation, instead undergoing highly efficient reductive deoxygenation. The optimum <b>silylation</b> <b>reagent</b> is triethoxysilane; hexamethoxydisilane failed to be activated under a range of conditions. The major by-product of this reaction is reductive dehalogenation of the aryl halide starting material. Probable mechanisms for the silylation reaction and the reduction side-reaction are presented and discussed. The Pd-catalyzed silylation method is an excellent companion to the more traditional organometallic approach to the formation of the Ar-Si bond. Case in point, ortho-substituted aryl siloxanes are readily synthesized from the Grignard or lithium reagent. Unlike the metallation approach, the Pd-catalyzed silylation technique can be performed in the presence of a wide range of functional groups, including carbonyl-containing electrophiles, and protic moieties such as phenols or primary amines. In addition to the fluoride-promoted transfer of aryl moieties presented in chapter one, silanes have also been shown to transfer nucleophiles such as azide and cyanide anion. Chapter two presents the development of a high yielding silicon-based method for the preparation of alkyl nitriles, which serve as precursors to a variety of useful functional groups. Hypercoordinate cyanosilicate, prepared in situ by the reaction of cyanotrimethylsilane (Me 3 SiCN) with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF), is an effective source of nucleophilic cyanide. Primary and secondary alkyl halides and sulfonates underwent rapid and efficient cyanide displacement in the absence of phase transfer catalysts with the silicate derivative; inversion of configuration was observed for optically active alkyl halide substrates. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride was the optimum activating agent, and a full equivalent of fluoride ion was required for reaction completion. A nearly 1 : 1 stoichiometry of substrate to cyanosilicate affected formation of alkyl nitriles in acetonitrile or dioxane; in contrast, traditional methodologies typically employ a large excess of reagents, toxic phase transfer catalysts or solvents such as DMSO, or heavy-metal cyanide salts. Relative to other cyanide sources, the hypercoordinate cyanosilicate was much less basic, thereby mitigating the formation of elimination (alkene) by-products. The Me 3 SiCN/TBAF system is significantly less reactive and less basic than tetrabutylammonium cyanide (TBA-CN), therefore the mechanism of reaction most like involves the in situ generation of a hypercoordinate cyanosilicate, rather than disproportionation of Me 3 SiCN and TBAF to form TBA-CN in situ...|$|E

Here we describe a simple protocol for lipophilic compounds extraction and analysis from tomato fruits and leaves which is an important crop {{in terms of its}} economic and nutritional value. This is a rapid, reliable and reproducible method to detect and quantify lipophilic metabolites including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, sterols, alkanes, alkenes, and triterpenoids by GC-MS. In addition, this is a simple and convenient method for efficient comparative lipid profiling of wild type and transgenic or mutant tomato fruits. ### Introduction Metabolomics {{is one of the most}} rapidly advancing analytical approaches that aim at the comprehensive analysis of a large numbers of metabolites. It is most extensively utilized method in the field of plant sciences, since plants possess the unique feature of synthesizing a large number of natural products that do not exist in any other life form. Gas chromatography–{{mass spectrometry}} (GC–MS) is one of the most important and robust tools of metabolomics (1). This technology has high separation efficiency that can not only resolve complex volatile mixtures (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes etc.) but also non-volatile metabolites through the chemical derivatization. Common derivatization procedures include trimethylsilylation and the reaction with diazomethane (2, 3, 4). It can be applied for global biochemical profiling for better understanding of metabolic events in biological systems (5, 6, 7). Tomato is a highly interesting system to study maturation and ripening processes because of the dramatic metabolic changes that occur during development. These metabolic events have been studied in detail in the past (8, 9). Tomato fruit at different developmental stages can be distinguished on the basis of their metabolic complement (10). GC-MS has been used to characterize tomato pericarp composition in transgenic plants (11), to assess metabolic diversity of tomato species (12) and to measure metabolic changes associated with tomato fruit development (10) and to characterize biochemical changes during the development, ripening and post-harvest shelf-life of tomato fruit, covering both the pre- and post-harvest phases (13). Cuticular wax composition of wild type and lecer 6 mutant tomato was also compared using this approach (14). We describe herein a detailed protocol for extraction, derivatization, identification and quantification of lipohilic metabolites from leaves and fruit tissue of tomato. ### Reagents 1. Chloroform (CHCl 3) - CHCl 3 : Methanol (1 : 2) - 6 % methanolic KOH (w/v) - n-heptance - BFSTA (N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide <b>silylation</b> <b>reagent.</b> It reacts with a range of polar organic compounds,replacing active hydrogens with a –Si(CH 3) 3 (trimethylsilyl) group. - TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane). It is a silylation catalyst that increases the reactivity of other silylation reagents. ### Equipment 1. Freeze dryer suitable for lyophilisation - Freezer (- 80 °C) for sample storage - Vortexer - Silanol free glass vials - GC-MS instrument - Rtx 5 MS- 30 m column (0. 25 -mm ID and 0. 25 µmdf) ### Procedure **Harvesting of plant tissue (leaves or fruits) ** 1. Harvest the tissue (500 mg- 1. 0 g) from plant under the desired experimental condition. - Immediately freeze the tissue by immersing in liquid nitrogen. - Frozen tissues can be freeze dried. Lyophilized tissue can be stored at - 80 °C for several weeks or processed immediately. **Organic extraction** 1. Transfer a known amount of lyophilized tissue, typically 300 - 500 mg in a glass vial with cap. - Add 10 µl of internal standard 5 α -cholest 7 en- 3 β-ol (1 mg/ml stock) to the vial. - Add 3. 75 ml of CHCl 3 : methanol (1 : 2) and vortex vigorously. - Add 1. 25 ml of CHCl 3 and vortex well. - Add 1. 25 ml of dH 2 O and vortex once again. - Transfer bottom organic phase to a fresh vial with the help of a pipette. The solvent should be allowed to evaporate completely at 35 ⁰C. - **Critical step**: Weighing of the tissue should be done immediately to avoid thawing. **Alkaline hydrolysis** 1. Add 500 µl of 6 % methanolic KOH (w/v) to the dried residue and incubate at 85 ⁰C for ½ - 1 hrs. - To it, add half the volume i. e. 250 µl of dH 2 O and then equal volume i. e. 750 µl of n-heptane and vortex well. - Allow it to stand for sometimes till the layers get separated. Transfer upper phase to a fresh vial. Repeat the above step twice. - Allow heptane to evaporate completely (16 - 24 hrs). **Derivatization** To the dried residue, add 100 µl of derivatization reagent (80 µl BFSTA+ 20 µl TMCS) and incubate at 65 ⁰C for 1 hrs and inject in to GC-MS. **Critical step**: The most critical point is to avoid any water or moisture during derivatization especially the silylating step is highly vulnerable. **GC-MS analysis** For GC-MS analysis 1 µl of the sample is injected in split mode in the instrument. Use a Rtx 5 MS- 30 m column with 0. 25 -mm ID and 0. 25 µm df. Following are the parameters standardized for GC-MS run: - Injection temperature: 300 °C, - Interface temperature: 300 °C, - Ion source should be adjusted to 250 °C. - Carrier gas: Helium (flow rate of 1 ml min- 1). - Perform the analysis using the following temperature program: 1 min. of isothermal heating at 100 ⁰C followed by heating at 300 ⁰C for 20 mins. - Mass spectra were recorded at 2 scan sec- 1 with a scanning range of 40 to 850 m/z. Quantify each component based on peak areas and normalization based on the internal standard. ### Timing The protocol consists of two phases: First is sample extraction and second is GC-MS analysis. Extraction procedure from lyophilized tissues takes a day and few hours (2 - 21 / 2 hrs per sample) are required for GC-MS run. ### Troubleshooting Troubleshooting advice can be found in Table 1. ### Anticipated Results The GC-MS spectra of extracts (from tomato fruit and leave tissue) isolated from this protocol show peaks of lipohilic metabolites including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, alkanes, alkenes, sterols, tocopherols and triterpenoids. The spectra are frequently dominated by signals from fatty acids and alkanes. The major metabolites detected and quantified by this protocol are listed in Table 2. ### References 1. Fernie, A.
