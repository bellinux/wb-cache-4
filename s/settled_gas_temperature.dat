The actual operating conditions of aircraft <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors significantly differ from those at airflow equipment. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop methods of recalculation of a test results of a limited number of <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors that were received at certified airflow equipment and to get nominal dynamic characteristics of a particular type of <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors in the anticipated operating conditions. This study offers the algorithm for the identification of the nominal dynamic characteristics of <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors that are used to measure the <b>temperature</b> of <b>gases</b> in aircraft gas turbine engines. The algorithm makes it possible to 1) register the transient characteristics of <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors of a particular type at a predetermined rate of air flow, 2) calculate the heat transfer coefficient between the <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors and the air flow at each airflow rate, 3) measure the average transient characteristics of the <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors at each airflow rate, 4) set the parameters of the hyperbolic function of the nominal variables of the time constants of selected <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors from the heat transfer coefficient.

However, effects of very low <b>gas</b> <b>temperatures</b> (below 0 °C) on the dust formation are still little-known. In the present study, we grow silicon nanocrystals [3] from room temperature down to - 40 °C. We first show that low <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> increases dust formation kinetics. These {{results are consistent with}} the ones previously obtained at higher <b>gas</b> <b>temperature,</b> underlining an exponential behavior of the formation kinetics versus <b>gas</b> <b>temperature.</b> Moreover, as the plasma behaves like a supersaturated medium, silicon nanoparticle radius is expected to evolve as 1 /T(K). At room temperature, single-crystal nanoparticles have a typical size of 1. 5 nm in radius. First results at low <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> are very promising: spherical nanoparticles up to 40 nm in radius have been obtained for T= - 40 °C. These first insights into low <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> effects tend to confirm the hypothesis of a fast increasing radius for <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> below 0 °C. Presently, TEM analyses are underway to determine a possible influence of the <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> on the nanoparticle crystalline phase and/or density in the plasma. This new method for silicon nanocrystal tailoring allows obtaining silicon nanoparticles in a size range of 1 to 40 nm with a quite monodispersed size distribution and a well-known density.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> in non-equilibrium plasmas {{is often}} {{obtained}} from the plasma-induced emission by measuring the rotational temperature of a diatomic molecule in its excited state. This is motivated by both tradition {{and the availability of}} low budget spectrometers. However, non-thermal plasmas do not automatically guarantee that the rotational distribution in the monitored vibrational level of the diatomic molecule is in equilibrium with the translational (<b>gas)</b> <b>temperature.</b> Often non-Boltzmann rotational molecular spectra are found in non-equilibrium plasmas. The deduction of a <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> from these non-thermal distributions must be done with care as clearly the equilibrium between translational and rotational degrees of freedom cannot be achieved.

The results are explained in the context of quenching processes of the excited states. Spatially resolved <b>gas</b> <b>temperatures</b> in both longitudinal and radial directions are presented. The observed strong temperature gradients near the electrodes are checked to be consistent with the power dissipation and the heat transfer in the discharge. The effect of the polarity of the water electrode and filamentation on the measured temperatures is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report focuses on estimating maximum <b>gas</b> <b>temperatures</b> at ceiling level during large tunnel fires. Gas temperature is an important parameter to consider when designing the fire resistance of a tunnel structure. Earlier work by the authors has established correlations between excess ceiling <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> and effective tunnel height, ventilation rate, and heat release rate. The maximum possible excess <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> was set as 1350 °C, independent of the tunnel structure and local combustion conditions. As {{a result of this}} research, two models have been developed to better estimate possible excess maximum <b>gas</b> <b>temperatures</b> for large tunnel fires in tunnels with differing lining materials and structure types (e. g. rock, concrete). These have been validated using both model- and full-scale tests. Comparisons of predicted and measured temperatures show that both models correlate well with the test data. However, Model I is better and more optimal, {{due to the fact that}} it is more conservative and easier to use. The fire duration and flame volume are found to be related to <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> development. In reality, the models could also be used to estimate temperatures in a fully developed compartment fire...|$|R
40|$|There exist a {{temperature}} difference inside the burned gas {{region of the}} internal combustion engines due to the recompression effect inside the burned gas region. Zero-dimensional multizone model developed at Oxford Engine Research Group is implemented to investigate the generation of the temperature difference inside the burned gas region and qualitatively model the combustion characteristics within compression ignition (CI) engines. Oxygenated fuels: methanol and dimethyl ether (DME), are studied and compared with diesel. Optimum number of zones is identified for the simulation. Results for the variation in the burned <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> and NOx formation within the different zones of the ten-zones model and compared with the single zone. Single zone model is found to give under-prediction in burned <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> as well as NOx for all the three fuels. Diesel has the highest burned <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> and DME has burned <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> similar to the diesel but methanol has lower burned <b>gas</b> <b>temperature.</b> The ten-zones model shows the generation of the temperature difference within the burned gas region. Diesel is found to have the highest NOx formation than DME and methanol. Effect of heat transfer and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the combustion characteristics are simulated...|$|R
