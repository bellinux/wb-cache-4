40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Supervision is an {{essential}} component of the development of pre-professional school counselors. Oftentimes, school counseling <b>site</b> <b>supervisors</b> are called upon to supervise graduate school counseling students without any requisite supervision training. The lack of supervision training is of significant professional concern, and there is an established need to translate recommended supervision guidelines into explicit instructions for the training of school counseling <b>site</b> <b>supervisors.</b> The research utilized a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline single-subject research design to study the impact of online school counseling-specific supervision training on school counseling site supervisors' self-efficacy. The assessment instrument utilized in the study was the Counselor Supervisor Self-Efficacy Scale Outcomes of the research indicated that school counseling site supervisors' self-efficacy did trend upward as a result of online supervision training. Calculations indicate that there was a consistent relative level change between the two conditions (self-efficacy prior to supervision training and during supervision training) across all research participants. Though nonconcurrent multiple-baseline across subjects single-subject research designs are considered to have acceptable internal validity, a single study limits the external validity of the study and, therefore, further research with additional samples regarding school counseling supervision training is recommended...|$|R

40|$|This study explores {{educational}} leadership {{within and across}} two of NZ’s eLearning clusters. Two complementary perspectives of {{educational leadership}} are used to frame the investigation: instructional leadership and distributed leadership. The research was conducted approximately nine months after the cessation of a two-year Ministry subsidy for the employment of 12 ePrincipals {{and at a time}} when Ultrafast Broadband was imminent for nearly all NZ schools. The literature review explores aspects of two areas related to eLearning leadership: conventional educational leadership in ‘bricks-and-mortar’ schooling contexts and eLearning/eTeaching in virtual schooling contexts. Data was gathered from semistructured interviews with twelve school-based research participants (ePrincipals, eTeachers, <b>Site</b> <b>Supervisors</b> and Principals) across two of NZ’s eLearning clusters and four National Officials with responsibilities for wider forms of eLearning. The findings are presented in a manner that attempts to capture directly the research participants’ voices, while still maintaining confidentiality and anonymity. The findings are discussed using an ecological perspective of eLearning as the unifying framework to explore the leadership across nested and interacting layers, from the micro-level of an eLearning class to the macro-level of NZ’s system for secondary education. The major findings from the study indicate that educational leadership in eLearning clusters is complex, relies heavily on goodwill and collaboration, and occurs in a challenging environment. Within an eLearning cluster the leadership of eLearning/eTeaching is distributed primarily across the ePrincipal, eTeachers and <b>Site</b> <b>Supervisors</b> who each assume complementary leadership roles. A raft of recommendations, across all ecosystem levels of eLearning, is proposed for leaders to consider when initiating change to strengthen their practices and policies with respect to enhancing eLearning and eTeaching...|$|R

To achieve this aim, the sound power level of construction machineries, workers noise exposure level and the prevalence of hearing loss symptoms and hearing ability among them were measured. Sound power level of machineries were measured according to ISO 112000. The workers consist of operator of machineries, <b>site</b> <b>supervisors</b> and premix workers were measured according to Peraturan-Peraturan di bawah Akta Kilang dan Jentera 1967 (Akta 139) P. U. (A) 1 / 89 Factories and Machinery (Noise Exposure) Regulations 198. A total of seventy three workers who worked in road work, drainage and pavement stage were measured their noise exposure level. These workers also were evaluated their hearing loss symptoms and hearing ability using questionaire survey and interview. Machineries consisting of roller compacter, back-pusher, vibratory roller and paver have high sound power level. There are 44 % of workers including operators, <b>site</b> <b>supervisors</b> and premix workers had experienced noise level above hazardous level (= 85 dBA). Vibratory roller operator obtaining high exposure level with the highest exposure appeared in pavement stage. Highest prevalence symptoms of hearing loss was recorded in road work stage with 39 % of workers positive hearing loss due to factors of workers’ age, racing and karaoke activity. Poor hearing ability were observed for workers with age of 60 years old and greater. It is suggested that workers exposed to noise greater than 85 dBA should wear hearing protection device (HPDs) with suitable NRR values. In conclusion, road construction workers also exposed to hazard which require them to wear hearing protection...|$|R
