5|$|Many of the North American {{species are}} in the genus Neotibicen: the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (<b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> they emerge in late July and August). The best-known North American genus, however, is Magicicada. These {{periodical}} cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 or 17 years, suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found {{at the center of}} the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E
5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese name sakura ebi (...) {{translates}} as [...] "cherry blossom shrimp"; it is <b>so</b> <b>name</b> <b>because</b> of the pink colour of the dried shrimp.|$|R
5000|$|This town is <b>named</b> <b>so</b> <b>because</b> {{it was the}} {{direction}} that the Kings of old, standing in their palace, would face in the morning.

5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the iron cage {{was thought to}} resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} highly flammable mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|Between Moab and Castle Valley, the Colorado River, and indirectly, SR-128, {{form the}} {{southern}} boundary of Arches National Park. Arches National Park is <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of over 2000 natural arches inside park boundaries. While the highway does offer views of several {{features in the}} park, there is no park access along the highway. Popular attractions along this portion include Negro Bill Canyon, with hiking trails to Morning Glory Arch, campgrounds and boat docks at a curve in the river called Big Bend.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago race riot of 1919 {{was a major}} racial {{conflict}} that began in Chicago, Illinois, on July 27, 1919, and ended on August 3. During the riot, thirty-eight people died (23 black and 15 white) and over five hundred were injured. It is considered {{the worst of the}} approximately 25 riots during the Red Summer, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of the violence and fatalities across the nation. The combination of prolonged arson, looting, and murder made it the worst race riot in the history of Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{were then}} punished for {{supporting}} the British invasion, and the fortress city of Intramuros, initially populated by 1200 Spanish families and garrisoned by 400 Spanish troops, kept its cannons pointed at Binondo, the world's oldest Chinatown. The Mexican population was concentrated at the south part of Manila, and also at Cavite, where ships from Spain's American colonies docked, and at Ermita, an area <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of a Mexican hermit that lived there.|$|E
5|$|The Laguna del Maule lake is not {{the only}} lake in the field. The other lakes are Laguna Cari Launa on the Chilean side in the northeastern sector of the field, and Laguna Fea in the south and Laguna Negra lake both on the Argentine side. The Laguna Sin Salida (<b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> it lacks a river running out of it) is in the northeastern sector of the {{volcanic}} field and it formed within a glacial cirque.|$|E
5000|$|The Flatiron [...] is a rocky, triangular-shaped {{headland}} which {{overlooks the}} southwest part of Granite Harbour, in Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was charted by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13, under Robert Falcon Scott, who <b>so</b> <b>named</b> it <b>because</b> of its distinctive shape.|$|R
5000|$|Little Flower Academy was <b>so</b> <b>named</b> {{apparently}} <b>because</b> {{the prayers}} {{of one of the}} Sisters had been answered in acquiring the property. The prayers had been made to Saint Thérèse de Lisieux, who had the nickname [...] "The Little Flower of Jesus." ...|$|R
5000|$|Young Fathers were christened in 2008, <b>named</b> <b>so</b> <b>because</b> {{all three}} members have their fathers' names.|$|R
5|$|The Peter Parker House {{located at}} 700 Jackson Place and an {{adjacent}} home at 704 Jackson Place were constructed in 1860. Peter Parker House is <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> {{it was originally}} the home of physician Peter Parker. The U.S. government acquired both properties between 1969 and 1970, after having rented them for office space. Peter Parker House previously served as {{the headquarters of the}} Civil War Centennial Commission and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and is like Blair House a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|The hardnose shark (Carcharhinus macloti) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of the heavily calcified cartilages in its snout.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, {{but it was also a}} measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E
5000|$|Store Point (...) is a northernmost {{point of}} Neny Island, lying in Marguerite Bay off {{the west coast}} of Graham Land. Surveyed in 1947 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), who <b>so</b> <b>named</b> it <b>because</b> FIDS {{maintained}} an emergency food store on this point.|$|R

5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
5|$|In Negaunee, the routing uses {{a street}} named County Road east {{from the city}} line. County Road passes Jackson Park, {{location}} of the first iron ore discovery in the area. The iron mined from the region supplied half of the nation's supply between 1850 and 1900. South of downtown Negaunee, Bus. M-28 turns north along the west fork of Silver Street. The street runs north under an overpass that carries Rail Street, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> it was once a rail line into downtown Negaunee. The trunkline turns east on Jackson Street, running next to the Negaunee City Hall, which was built in 1914–15 {{at a time when}} the city's population was increasing and iron production was peaking. The building still houses the city's offices, police station and library.|$|E
5|$|In New York Bond meets up {{with his}} {{counterpart}} in the CIA, Felix Leiter. The two visit some of Mr Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (<b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E
5000|$|A konnyaku bridge (konnyaku-bashi) is a {{low water}} {{crossing}} bridge in Japan, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> locally <b>because</b> {{of the way it}} seems to tremble underfoot like konnyaku (konjac) jelly.

5|$|Lactarius blennius (commonly {{known as}} the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European Beech (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It {{has been the subject}} of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L.blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Geastraceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single species Myriostoma coliforme. It is an earthstar, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the spore-bearing sack's outer wall splits open {{into the shape of}} a star. The inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Europe, where it grows in humus-rich forests or in woodlands, especially on well-drained and sandy soils. A somewhat rare fungus, it appears on the Red Lists of 12 European countries, and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi.|$|E
5|$|NY83 {{begins a}} more erratic routing, passing between West Mud Lake and Black Pond as {{it enters the}} town of Arkwright. For a short {{distance}} it is concurrent with CR85, and takes on the name Black Corner Street, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> <b>because</b> it is located within the hamlet of Black Corners. Although this portion of NY83 is cosigned with CR85, it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. An intersection with CR79 is not far off, as it passes {{just north of the}} town of Arkwright. NY83 proceeds west-northwest until it reaches its ending terminus at NY60 in the community of Laona, located just west of the Arkwright town line in Pomfret.|$|E
5000|$|Castle Rock (...) is a bold rock crag, 415 m high, {{standing}} 3 mi {{northeast of}} Hut Point {{on the central}} ridge of Hut Point Peninsula, Ross Island.
