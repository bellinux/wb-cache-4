40|$|A web-based {{digital image}} {{analysis}} tool (IMAGING Crop Response Analyser) has been developed, tested and made public (www. imaging-crops. dk). This new technology makes possible objective estimations of crop-soil cover (i. e. how much crop is buried with soil) associated with post-emergence weed control with <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> <b>harrows,</b> rotary hoes and other weeders. Objective estimation of crop-soil cover offers new possibilities to improve decision support of physical weed control practises with low selectivity because trade-offs between weed control and resulting injury to the associated crop now may be quantified, communicated and incorporated into models. The objective of this resentation is to suggest key parameters and research priorities for future research and to suggest standards for estimation and statistical test of the analytical parameters. The overall aim is to help researchers deliver reliable parameter estimates that may help to predict the optimal intensity and timing of physical weed control with low selectivity and, thereby, contribute to the theoretical and methodological framework of physical weed control. Selectivity and crop recovery are suggested as key parameters because they are crucial in predictive models and are less influenced by site-specific soil conditions and implement settings than other parameters. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} ratio between weed control and crop-soil cover and crop recovery is defined as the ability of the crop to recover from soil coverage. Both parameters depend on the intensity of tillage. To facilitate comparisons between different studies, it is suggested that the crop soil cover associated with 80 % weed control and the relative crop yield loss associated with 25 % crop-soil cover are calculated with 95 %-confidence intervals. Experimental protocols needed to make such calculations are outlined and factors that influence - or may influence - selectivity and recovery are listed and research priorities are given. Crop tolerance has previously been used to express the susceptibility of the crop to physical weed control, but crop recovery is shown to be more useful in decision support models than crop tolerance. Recent studies using the new {{digital image analysis}} tool and the above suggested parameter estimation procedure show that timing of weed harrowing is of lesser importance if the intensity of tillage is correctly adjusted to the growth stage compared with prediction of the optimal intensity in sitespecific conditions. This latter issue remains the major challenge for future development...|$|R

Effects of three different tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage on penetration resistance, emergence time, shooting degree and yield were investigated. Conventional tillage used a moldboard plough for primary tilling and a combined <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator-spike tooth <b>harrow</b> for consecutive secondary tilling. Reduced tillage included only a cultivator-tooth harrow combination. No-tillage was accomplished by a direct (stubble) drill. Although the earliest emergence time (17 day) and the highest emergence degree (66. 5 %) were obtained, yield was the lowest in no-tillage system. The highest penetration resistance (53. 71 kg cm - 2) was measured in no-tillage system. Reduced and no tillage systems could be proposed for Gökhöyük region if alternative solutions is found to prevent soil compaction and reduce mechanical impedance in root growth zone.

40|$|Within organic farming, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} is prohibited and is generally being replaced by different tillage practices. At {{the same time the}} supply of sufficient amounts of nitrogen is often a problem within organic fanning. In cereal crops, harrowing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important mechanical weeding techniques. The loosening and aerating of the soil produced by harrowing should potentially enhance nitrogen mineralization. Furthermore, harrowing could enhance the soil structure and water content, since tillage is generally known to positively affect these soil factors through mechanisms such as crust breaking and enhanced tillering in cereals. This study investigated the effects of mechanical weed control in the spring on weeds, nitrogen mineralization and yield of winter wheat. Weed control was carried out when the crop had 2 - 3 leaves. Three different implements were tested on two soils differing in clay content for three consecutive years: A Väderstad Crosskill roller, an s-tine harrow and a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> and compared with untreated controls. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers and total nitrogen content of the crop were determined on several occasions for calculations of net nitrogen mineralization in the soi 1. The numbers and weight of weeds were recorded one month after harrowing and at the time of harvesting. Grain yield was measured at harvest. The amount of dicotyledonous weeds was reduced by harrowing. On the soils with the lower clay content, weed numbers were reduced to between 50 and 82 % of those in the control, while on the soil with the higher clay content they were reduced to between 42 and 82 % of those in the control. On average, the best effect on the lighter clay soils was achieved by use of the s-tine harrow, while on the heavier clay soils the Väderstad Crosskill roller and the spring-tine harrow had the best weed control effect. In the harrowed treatments, the average mineral N content in the 0 - 30 cm layer was enhanced by only 0. 4 kg ha⁻¹. At the same time the N uptake in the crop was reduced by approximately the same amount due to the crop suffering mechanical damage, and calculations of net nitrogen mineralization showed no increase in N mineralization after harrowing. Despite annual variations, harrowing in general had a positive effect on grain yield. Comparing the different implements, the best yields on the lighter clay soil were achieved by use of the <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> which increased the yield compared with the control by an average of 5 % in two years out of three (2002 - 2005). The best results on the heavier clay soils were achieved by use of Väderstad Crosskill roller, which gave a 5 % yield increase compared with the control, while the use of <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> and s-tine harrow caused a yield reduction of about the same magnitude. On both soil types, the use of an s-tine harrow had a negative effect on wheat yield, probably due to a high degree of mechanical damage to the crop...|$|E
40|$|A {{two years}} field {{experiment}} (2004 - 2005) {{was carried out}} in the Fucino Valley. The aim was to compare different strategies for physical weed control in organic chicory. Chicory is the second most important vegetable crop of the area after carrot. The physical weed control strategy included the stale seed-bed technique before crop transplanting and one or more mechanical and manual interventions after transplanting. Three different operative machines two meters wide were adopted for false seed-bed technique: a rolling harrow, a flame weeder and a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> <b>harrow.</b> A conventional hoe or a specific innovative precision hoe with six units (45 cm of inter-row) were used to perform both inter-row and intra-row (by means of torsion weeders) weed control. During the testing period weed flora (density and biomass) was monitored and chicory yield was recorded. In addition, work chains characteristics and manpower use were determined. The results were quite interesting and stressed the chicory high quality yield, under the different physical weed control strategies. ...|$|E

The experiments were carried out on light soils, rich in fine sand and silt. In one of the experiments, however, the soil had a clay content as high as 23 per cent. Among the harrows, the disc harrow gave the best mean yield result. Four runs gave the highest yield. The differenees were, however small. Ploughing in the spring did not increase the crop yield.

Firstly, the strategy of physical weed control of carrot in the Fucino Valley was defined and included the realization of the false seed-bed technique, a flame treatment before crop emergence and one or more mechanical (precision hoeing) and manual interventions in post-emergence. False seed-bed technique was performed by means of a specific <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> two meters wide, while flaming was performed by means of an operative machine equipped with four “open flame” rod burners 50 cm wide.

During the testing period the evolution of weed flora (both presence and biomass) was monitored and carrot root yield was recorded. Moreover work chains characteristics, manpower use and physical weed control cost were determined. The results were quite good and put in evidence that physical weed control in organic carrot cultivated in the Fucino Valley can be performed, obtaining relevant and high quality yields, without the need of too many hours of manual labour and with fully acceptable costs, taking also into account that in Italy the market price of “biological” carrot is quite high...|$|E

Yield levels on the Saïs Plateau between Meknès and Fez in the semi-arid zone, however, remain low possibly because of sub-optimum water use due to inefficient tillage systems. A study was carried out to investigate the effect of soil tillage operations on water infiltration. Two systems of seedbed preparation on a silty clay soil were compared: traditional disc harrow (‘cover crop’) versus reduced tillage using a <b>spring</b> <b>tined</b> cultivator (‘vibrocultor’). Infiltration processes were studied using a rainfall simulator applying rainfall typical for aggressive events in the region. The effect of tillage and rainfall on the structure of the soil was assessed by both quantitative and descriptive methods.

We ask: i) {{whether there are}} traits or combinations of traits that allow weed species to persist in sown grass strips; and, ii) how does duration of sown grass strips affect weed community composition? We hypothesized that therophyte annual and small weed species will dominate the community in newly sown grass strips (5 years old). Floral surveys were performed in 75 sown grass-margin strips in France and each strip was surveyed twice. Weed species were summarized with trait databases into functional groups using Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Hierarchical Ascendant Classification. Functional group trajectories were investigated in sown grass-margin strips that differed in age using a space-for-time substitution. We found that geophyte, competitor and monocotyledon species were more frequent and abundant than therophyte, ruderal and dicotyledon species. Trait combinations found in most functional groups appeared to be tolerant of strip management; however, one functional group consisting of therophyte, ruderals with a continuous reproduction period declined in importance with age of sown grass-margin strips. Our findings have implications for non-crop vegetation management for optimizing diversity and ecosystem services in land enrolled in conservation programs.

Over {{the last several years}} many farmers have adopted low-disturbance tillage and soil conservation practices that improve profitability and protect the environment. A modified no-till system with a rolling <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> suitable for use on dairy {{and livestock}} farms reduced machinery costs 25 %, fuel costs 45 %, and labor costs 50 %, compared with a conventional tillage and planting system (Harrigan et al., 1996). Cropping systems that reduce tillage intensity and increase the use of cover crops improve soil quality and protect the environment in many ways. Even small amounts of crop residue reduce soil erosion, and no-till systems are associated with the least runoff. However, manure use is a challenge in no-till crop-ping systems. There is a need for cropping and manure management options that stabilize soil and prevent overland flow of sedi-ment, nutrients, and contaminants. Such options will retain manure in the root zone for nutrient use in the following crop and remediation of pathogens. Cover crops have not been used widely in livestock-based cropping systems because establishment costs, competition for labor and added manage-ment needs have discouraged their use. Because cover crops are an effective barrier to overland flow, sedimentation, and manure contamination of waterways, interest in the use of cover crops is increasing.

In this study, the main {{objective was to}} evaluate the effect of different tillage systems on soil physical properties by using geophysical methods, namely, ground-penetrating radar (far-field and near-field GPR), capacitance probes (ThetaProbe and 5 TE), electromagnetic induction (EMI) (Profiler and EM 38), soil sampling, and by soil penetrometer. Since 2005, three contrasting tillage systems were applied on different plots of an agricultural field: i) conventional tillage (CT) with mouldboard ploughing to 27 cm depth, ii) deep loosening tillage (DL) with a heavy tine cultivator to 30 cm depth, and iii) reduced tillage (RT) with a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator to 10 cm depth. The geophysical and soil strength measurements were performed in April 2010. We observed that tillage influences the soil resistance (deeper tillage decreases soil resistance), which could be partly seen in the radar data. Soil water content reference measurements (capacitance probes and soil sampling) were in a relatively good agreement with the water content estimates from far-field GPR. We also observed that the tillage influences surface water content. Mean surface water content was significantly lower for CT than for DL and RT, which was partly explained by lower macropore connectivity between the topsoil and the deeper layers after conventional tillage.

40|$|Controlling weeds {{in spring}} cereals grown under organic {{conditions}} is mostly done by post emergence weed harrowing, where <b>spring</b> <b>tines</b> of the weed harrow control weeds by uprooting and/or covering small weeds plants with soil. In situations with relatively large weed plants and relatively small crop plants, there are increased risks for crop damages by soil coverage or other mechanical damages {{of the crop}} leaves. These damages are increasing with increasing weed control intensity, and are resulting in reduced crop growth immediately after weed harrowing. There are risks that the reduced growth reduces final crop yield too. However, {{there is some evidence}} that there are varietal differences in the tolerance to weed harrowing. The aim of this study was to estimate the damages by weed harrowing in four pure genotypes and three two- or one three-component mixtures of spring barley, and to analyze if there were differences in tolerance to weed harrowing between the genotypes and mixtures. Results from a two-year field study showed that there were varietal differences in the tolerance to mechanical weed control in the immediate effect as well as the short term effect, however there were marked differences in the immediate and short term effect between the two years. Regarding the long term effect of weed harrowing on yield, there were no significant differences in 2003 but in 2004, Brazil and the three component mixture suffered significantly from weed harrowing while Modena, Otira and Modena+Orthega mixture, seems to benefit from weed harrowing. The reason for these differences is probably due to differences in growth habit at the time for weed harrowing. ...|$|R

The measurements included bulk density (BD) and precompression stress (Pc) chosen as indicators of mechanical strength, and the pore size distribution (PSD) measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The tillage systems, the depth and their interaction {{had a significant effect}} on BD, Pc and PSD. In CT, in the topsoil, the soil strength was low and the total porosity n was about 50 %. In the subsoil, n decreased to 43 %. The PSD of CT was uni-modal in topsoil and subsoil in the MIP measurement range. The mean value of the mode rmax diminished from the topsoil toward the subsoil (from 2. 5 microns to 1. 9 microns). In RT, in the topsoil, the soil strength was higher than CT. BD did not vary much according to the depth. The total porosity n of RT was comprised between 40 - 45 % in the soil profile. The PSD was uni-modal and rmax increased from topsoil (around 2 microns) to subsoil (> 3 microns). This suggested the agglomeration of fine particles under the long-term action of mechanical loads, climatic agents, biological organisms or clay minerals acting as cementing agents. These phenomena could be at the origin of the increase of Pc with the depth without significant modification of BD. Such high values of Pc could be responsible of negative effects on root-growth leading to a more superficial root lateral development...|$|R

This study investigates (i) an expected advantage of an intelligent rotor tine cultivator (the cycloid hoe) in terms of crop-weed selectivity and (ii) an expected synergistic effect between punch planting and post-emergence weed harrowing in terms of improved crop-weed selectivity. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} relationship between weed control and associated crop density decline one week after cultivation, and punch planting is a sowing technique where holes are created in the ground with a minimum of soil disturbance and seeds are inserted into them, without soil disturbance outside the holes. Two experiments were carried out with the cycloid hoe in organic sugar beets. The rotation tines were guided by RTK-GPS relative to geo-referenced sugar beets, and tines were moved into the row when there was enough space between crop plants to cultivate, and kept outside, when they were predicted to strike a crop plant. The selectivity of the cycloid hoe was tested against two machine variants without intelligent guidance: the rotor tine cultivator in a locked mode, where tines rotate within the crop row without taking crop plants into consideration, and an ordinary flex <b>tine</b> weed <b>harrow.</b> The experiments showed no differences between the three machine variants in terms of selectivity. Five experiments with punch planting in sugar beets and carrots showed no synergistic effects between plant establishment procedures and selectivity of post-emergence weed harrowing. Even if punch planting and automated intelligent rotor tine cultivation were not combined, the results indicate that {{there is no reason to}} believe that a combination contributes significantly to the solution of the main problem in mechanical intra-row weed control in direct sown crops, low selectivity, which still remains a major challenge. Future studies on precision intra-row cultivation should focus on cutting implements instead of tine implements which manly works through soil burial...|$|R
40|$|Uprooting by weed {{harrowing}} and {{the potential}} of the uprooting process for selective weed control at early crop growth stages was studied. Effects of working depth, seed depth, soil moisture content and working speed on uprooting of Lolium perenne L., Lepidium sativum L. and Chenopodium quinoa Willd. were investigated in laboratory harrowing experiments on a sandy soil. Harrowing uprooted on average 51 % of the emerging plants and 21 % of the plants in the seedling stage. Seventy per cent of all uprooted plants were completely covered by soil. An increase in working depth from 10 mm to 30 mm doubled the average fraction of uprooted plants. Uprooting was also promoted by higher soil moisture contents and higher working speeds. Average uprooting selectivity (=fraction of uprooted emerging plants/fraction of uprooted seedlings of the same species) varied between 2. 0 (deep tillage and high speed) and 5. 6 (dry soil). If tines could keep a distance of more than 3 mm from the crop and weed plants, the average selectivity of all treatments would improve from 2. 4 to 5. 5 and the average fraction of uprooted seedlings would decrease from 21 % to 8 %. This study indicates that uprooting may be a more important weed control mechanism than commonly believed. If working depth and the path of the <b>harrow</b> <b>tines</b> in relation to crop rows could be accurately controlled, uprooting could be a relatively selective weed control mechanism at early crop growth stages...|$|R
40|$|Weed {{control is}} one of the most serious {{problems}} in vegetable crops limiting yields. Therefore, the aim of this work was to set up and improve innovative strategies and machines for physical weed control in organic or “integrated” vegetable crops cultivated in five important areas of Central and Southern Italy. Experimental on-farm trials were carried out on fresh marketable spinach, processing and fresh market tomato, cauliflower, savoy cabbage, potato, greenhouse cultivated leaf beet, garlic, chicory, fennel and carrot. The traditional farm weed management system was always compared to an innovative system. The innovative strategy was the combination among preventive methods (false or stale seed-bed technique), cultural methods (crop spatial arrangement adjusted in order to improve machinery effectiveness) and direct control methods (flaming, hoeing, etc.). Different kinds of flex <b>tine</b> and rolling <b>harrows</b> (patented by the University of Pisa) and flamers were used for false or stale seed-bed technique. Precision hoes and hoe-conformed rolling harrows, equipped with elastic tines for selective in-row weed control, were used for post emergence interventions. The innovative weed management systems always resulted in significant weed abundance reductions (from 70 to 100 %), relevant yield increases (from 10 to 100 %) and high contractions of manpower requirement (from 20 to 80 %) compared to the standard systems. The results of these on-farm experimental trials emphasise that physical weed control can be effectively performed using the innovative machines built at the University of Pisa. These machines can also be easily adjusted for use in other crops and agricultural contexts...|$|R
40|$|Weed {{control is}} one of the most serious {{problems}} in vegetable crops, limiting cultivated plants correct development, yields, product quality and farmers income. Therefore, the aim of this work was to set up and improve innovative strategies and machines for physical (mechanical and thermal) weed control in organic or “integrated” vegetables production in many important areas of Northern, Central and Southern Italy. Therefore, on-farm experiments were carried out since 1999 on fresh marketable spinach, processing and fresh market tomato, cauliflower, savoy cabbage, greenhouse cultivated leaf beet, garlic, chicory, fennel and carrot. These research activities started are still ongoing. The traditional farm weed management system was always compared to one or more innovative strategies that were defined according to the characteristics of the environment (i. e. soil type and conditions, water availability, etc.), typology of cultivation, crop rotation, expected technical and economical results. The innovative strategies were the combination among preventive methods (false or stale seed-bed technique), cultural methods (i. e. crop spatial arrangement that was often adjusted in order to improve operative machines effectiveness) and direct control methods (flaming, precision hoeing, etc.). Different kinds of specific implement such as flex <b>tine</b> and rolling <b>harrows</b> (patented by the University of Pisa, patent n. PI/ 2004 /A/ 000071), and flamers (designed and realized by the University of Pisa) were used to perform false or stale seed-bed technique.

5000|$|In 1930, {{automobile}} manufacturer Cadwallader Washburn [...] "Carl" [...] Kelsey {{was introduced}} to the rototiller by H.B. Hiller, a German immigrant who once worked for Siemens' [...] "boden frasen" [...] division. Kelsey opened a sales office using the name Rototiller Co. on Broadway in New York City. He then started importing Siemens boden frasen from Germany. In 1932, Kelsey incorporated using the new company name Rototiller, Inc. and the [...] "Rototiller" [...] trademark (Kelsey didn't coin the name 'Rototiller' it was already being used in Europe). The operation was moved to Long Island City, NY. and SIMAR from Switzerland was added to the line. Carl Kelsey designed, patented and made several improvements to the SIMAR and Siemens machines because of the different American soils versus the European soil that had been farmed for many more centuries. One major improvement was a shock absorber to reduce <b>tine</b> <b>spring</b> return bounce. In 1934 Kelsey and Rototiller, Inc. introduced its first rotary tiller of its own design, the Model AA All-American. And in 1937 Rototiller, Inc. moved from its Long Island City facility to 102nd Street and 9th Avenue in Troy, New York. In 1945 after selling the larger B-series Rototillers and trademark to Graham-Paige Motors, Rototiller, Inc. converted to full-time production of various models of small horsepower home garden size rototillers.|$|R
