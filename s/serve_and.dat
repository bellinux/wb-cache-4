5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a <b>serve</b> <b>and</b> volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} President, Washington was {{responsible}} for appointing the entire Supreme Court; he appointed a record ten justices, including two Chief Justices who were confirmed from outside the Court and one former Justice named as Chief Justice by a recess appointment, but not ultimately confirmed to the position. Additionally, Washington nominated Robert H. Harrison, who declined to <b>serve,</b> <b>and</b> nominated William Cushing for elevation to Chief Justice, who likewise declined.|$|E

5|$|Del Potro is an {{offensive}} baseliner {{with a very}} powerful <b>serve</b> <b>and</b> deep, flat, topspin groundstroke, where he pushes his opponents deeper with his heavy groundstroke and trying to blast past them with a winner. His forehand {{is one of his}} main strengths and possibly the most powerful in the game, capable of frequently generating speeds of 160km/h.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they <b>serve,</b> <b>and</b> that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E

40|$|Food {{insecure}} individuals often consume nutritionally inadequate diets. Using {{a weighted}} plate waste analysis, we examined whether adult guests of 2 independently operated meal centers were <b>served</b> <b>and</b> consumed Food <b>and</b> Drug Administrationâ€“recommended <b>serving</b> sizes (reference amount customarily consumed; RACC) of protein, starch, fruit, vegetables, and bread for the dinner meal. In both centers, guests were <b>served</b> <b>and</b> consumed more than 100 % of RACC for protein. Regardless of amount <b>served</b> <b>and</b> independent of whether guests took seconds, consumption {{of fruit and}} vegetables was less than RACC. Larger servings of vegetables, but not of protein or starch, resulted in more plate waste. Guest surveys and informal interviews indicated that amounts <b>served</b> <b>and</b> preparation methods influenced food consumption and waste patterns. In order to provide adequate nutrition and to reduce food waste, meal centers may need to further examine food preparation <b>and</b> <b>serving</b> practices...|$|R
5|$|Elliott entered Ormond College, the Presbyterian hall of {{residence}} at the University of Melbourne in 1898 to study law. Between 1883 and 1896, law students had been required to first obtain a bachelor of arts degree before going on to study law. This had been changed, but Elliott, who was under no financial pressure to complete his degree quickly, elected to follow the old route and complete an arts degree first. He also represented Ormond College in football and athletics, and joined the University Officers' Training Corps. In March 1900, the Imperial authorities asked the Australian colonial governments to raise a force of 2,500 Imperial Bushmen for service in the South African War. Elliott decided to interrupt his studies to <b>serve,</b> <b>and</b> was one of 4,000 applicants for the 626 positions allotted to Victoria. He was accepted for the Victorian Imperial Bushmen, and trained at Langwarrin, Victoria, before embarking for South Africa on 1 May 1900.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary. A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, <b>serve,</b> <b>and</b> work in national parks. Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at <b>serve</b> <b>and</b> volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} announced the aviation deregulation policy, {{which makes it}} easier to acquire a permit to establish a new airline company. The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air-travel business in the country, as well as to <b>serve</b> <b>and</b> stimulate tourism industry in the region. As a result, many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia, among them Lion Air (est. 1999), Sriwijaya Air (est. 2003), Adam Air (operating from 2002 to 2008), and Batavia Air (operating from 2002 to 2013). The deregulation also spurred the low-cost carrier service in Indonesia. Previously, air travel service was dominated by well-established airlines such as Garuda Indonesia and Merpati.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic National Convention {{opened in}} San Francisco on June 28, 1920, under a shadow cast by Woodrow Wilson, {{who wished to}} be {{nominated}} for a third term. Delegates were convinced Wilson's health would not permit him to <b>serve,</b> <b>and</b> looked elsewhere for a candidate. Former Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo was a major contender, but he was Wilson's son-in-law, and refused to consider a nomination {{so long as the}} president wanted it. Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway, and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. On the 44thballot, the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president, with his running mate Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. As Cox was, when not in politics, a newspaper owner and editor, this placed two Ohio editors against each other for the presidency, and some complained there was no real political choice. Both Cox and Harding were economic conservatives, and were reluctant progressives at best.|$|E
