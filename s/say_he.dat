Lewis later learns Flavin bragged about shooting a cop the day Thormann was shot. Crosetti confronts Flavin, who nonchalantly admits to shooting Thormann in frustration because Flavin was suffering a migraine. Although the police celebrate finding Thormann's shooter, Lewis comforts a guilt-stricken Crosetti, who feels he took the case too personally and almost let the true shooter go free.|$|E

When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy.

5|$|Sometime between 1902 and 1905, al-Qassam {{left for}} Cairo {{to study at}} the al-Azhar Mosque. Who he studied with is disputed by sources; some {{accounts}} <b>say</b> <b>he</b> studied under the Muslim reformist scholar Muhammad Abduh and {{came into contact with}} the prominent proto-Salafist, Rashid Rida, who himself studied under Abduh, while others are skeptical of al-Qassam's relationships with either. However, the attitude al-Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well-acquainted with the ideas Abduh and Rida espoused. At al-Azhar, al-Qassam developed the thinking that would guide his future activism. Critical of a stagnant Islam, he preached among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam, one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through jihad (holy struggle). He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an ′alim and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya madrasa (Islamic school) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur'an. In addition he preached as the imam of the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Mosque.|$|E
