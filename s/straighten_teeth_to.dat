5000|$|Orthodontics truly began {{developing}} in the 18th and 19th centuries.In 1728, French dentist Pierre Fauchard, who is often credited with inventing modern orthodontics, {{published a book}} entitled [...] "The Surgeon Dentist" [...] on methods of <b>straightening</b> <b>teeth.</b> Fauchard, in his practice, used a device called a [...] "Bandeau", a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that helped expand the arch.In 1754, another French dentist, Louis Bourdet, dentist to the King of France, followed Fauchard's book with The Dentist's Art, which also dedicated a chapter <b>to</b> <b>tooth</b> alignment and application. He perfected the [...] "Bandeau" [...] {{and was the first}} dentist on record to recommend extraction of the premolar <b>teeth</b> <b>to</b> alleviate crowding and to improve jaw growth.|$|R
50|$|Orthodontic {{retainers}} are custom-made devices, {{usually made}} of wires or clear plastic, that hold teeth in position after surgery or any method of realigning teeth. Once {{a phase of}} orthodontic treatment has been completed <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>teeth,</b> there remains a lifelong risk of relapse (a tendency for <b>teeth</b> <b>to</b> return to their original position) due {{to a number of}} factors: recoil of periodontal fibres, pressure from surrounding soft tissues, the occlusion and patient’s continued growth and development. By using retainers <b>to</b> hold the <b>teeth</b> in their new position for a length of time, the surrounding periodontal fibres are allowed to adapt to changes in the bone which can help minimize any changes <b>to</b> the final <b>tooth</b> position after the completion of orthodontic treatment.|$|R

40|$|Orthodontists {{have been}} <b>straightening</b> <b>teeth</b> for decades {{relying on the}} ancient physics {{principle}} "every action has a reaction," in which tooth displacement {{in one part of}} the jaw causes movement on the other as well. Use of dental implants as orthodontic anchors, however, is changing that principle by expediting treatment times and expanding possibilities for previously untreatable cases. In conventional orthodontics, <b>teeth</b> are used <b>to</b> move other <b>teeth,</b> but implants can serve as excellent anchors from which force is applied to move the targeted teeth without causing shifts in other teeth [...] Cases progress faster when implants are used as anchorage, but not because <b>teeth</b> are subject <b>to</b> higher force levels. Rather, it's is the result of a more efficient appliance design that provides the ability <b>to</b> move multiple <b>teeth</b> simultaneously rather than individually, as is necessary in conventional orthodontics...|$|R

It produced significantly better welds and production yields. Weldable strain gages and many diverse electronics assembly applications quickly followed.|$|R

50|$|Dental braces (also {{known as}} braces, {{orthodontic}} cases, or cases) are devices used in orthodontics that align and <b>straighten</b> <b>teeth</b> and help position them {{with regard to}} a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, overbites, open bites, deep bites, cross bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often {{used in conjunction with}} other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws.|$|R

40|$|<b>Straightening</b> <b>teeth</b> is {{an arduous}} process {{requiring}} months, often years, of applying corrective pressure {{by means of}} arch wires-better known as brace-which {{may have to be}} changed several times in the course of treatment. A new method has been developed by Dr. George Andreasen, orthodontist and dental scientist at the University of Iowa. The key is a new type of arch wire material, called Nitinol, with exceptional elasticity which helps reduce the required number of brace changes. An alloy of nickel and titanium, Nitinol was originally developed for aerospace applications by the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, now the Naval Surface Weapons Laboratory, White Oaks, Maryland. NASA subsequently conducted additional research on the properties of Nitinol and on procedures for processing the metal...|$|R
40|$|Do It Yourself” (DIY) tooth {{movement}} has gained widespread attention {{recently in the}} United States.

These options offer the consumer convenience as well as a way to save a significant amount of money while promising to provide the desired end product of a beautiful smile. Unfortunately, most of the general population is unaware of the implications of such methods of orthodontic tooth movement. It is the responsibility of dental professionals to put their educational background to use and uphold the ethical principles of clinical practice by educating the public regarding the consequences of using these methods <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> their <b>teeth.</b> DIY orthodontics is undoubtedly a threat and an opportunity for the orthodontic community, and its potential to impact the field should not be underestimated...|$|R

50|$|According to {{scholars}} and historians, braces {{date back to}} ancient times. Around 400-300 BCE, Hippocrates and Aristotle contemplated ways <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>teeth</b> and fix various dental conditions. Archaeologists have discovered numerous mummified ancient individuals with {{what appear to be}} metal bands wrapped around their teeth. Catgut, a type of cord made from the natural fibers of an animal's intestines, performed a similar role to today’s orthodontic wire in closing gaps in the teeth and mouth.The Etruscans buried their dead with dental appliances in place to maintain space and prevent collapse of the teeth during the afterlife. A Roman tomb was found with a number of teeth bound with gold wire documented as a ligature wire, a small elastic wire that is used to affix the arch wire to the bracket. Even Cleopatra wore a pair. Roman philosopher and physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus first recorded the treatment of teeth by finger pressure. Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence, poor preservation of bodies, and primitive technology, little research was carried out on dental braces until around the 17th century, although dentistry was making great advancements as a profession by then.|$|R
