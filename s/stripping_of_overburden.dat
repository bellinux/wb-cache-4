Adverse impacts on geological features of human interest may occur in a coal strip mine.

As {{described in this}} response, geologic mapping of rock surfaces was conducted as part of construction activities for the former Cherokee Nuclear Station (Cherokee). Extensive mapping of rock surfaces exposed during Cherokee Units 1 through 3 construction activities was performed at two levels. The first level of geologic mapping consisted of geologic mapping of the top-of-rock surface (after <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>overburden</b> and before blasting). Top of rock geologic mapping was conducted for Cherokee Units 1 through 3 (1 : 240 scale). The second level of geologic mapping was performed after completion of blasting, removal of rock debris, and cleaning of the exposed foundation-level rock surface. This final excavation (top-of-foundation) mapping was conducted for all of Cherokee Unit 1, and {{for a portion of}} Cherokee Unit 2 (1 : 120 scale). For convenience, Figures 1 and 2 from the Duke Energy response to RAI 02. 05. 01 - 047 are included as Enclosure 1, and illustrate the areas mapped.

40|$|Artisanal {{small-scale}} mining (ASM) has devastating {{impacts on}} the environment, such as deforestation, over-stripping of overburden, burning of bushes and use of harmful chemicals like mercury. These environmental impacts {{are a result of}} destructive mining, wasteful mineral extraction and processing practices and techniques used by the artisanal small-scale miners. This paper explores the ecological problems caused by ASM in Mzingwane District, Zimbabwe. It seeks to determine the nature and extent to which the environment has been damaged by the ASM from a community perspective. Interviews, questionnaires and observations were used to collect qualitative data. Results indicated that the nature of the mining activities undertaken by unskilled and under-equipped gold panners in Mzingwane District is characterised by massive <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>overburden</b> and burning of bushes, leading to destruction of large tracts of land and river systems and general ecosystem disturbance. The research concluded that ASM in Mzingwane District is an ecological time bomb, stressing the need for appropriate modifications of the legal and institutional frameworks for promoting sustainable use of natural resources and mining development in Zimbabwe. Government, through the Ministry of Small Scale and Medium Enterprises, need to regularise and formalise all gold mining activities through licensing, giving permanent claims and operating permits to panners in order to recoup some of the added costs in the form of taxes. At the local level, the Mzingwane Rural District Council (MRDC) together with the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) need to design appropriate environmental education and awareness programmes targeting the local community and gold panners...|$|E

They then apply inward “drag” force to quickly load the bucket, and then hoist and swing forces to cast-dump the material onto a nearby spoil pile.

5000|$|Other {{larger scale}} {{dredging}} operations {{take place on}} exposed river gravel bars at seasonal low water. These operations typically use a land based excavator to feed a gravel screening plant and sluice box floating in a temporary pond.

[...] "Pay" [...] gravel is excavated from the front face of the pond and processed through the floating plant, with the gold trapped in the onboard sluice box and tailings stacked behind the plant, steadily filling {{in the back of}} the pond as the operation moves forward. This type of gold mining is characterized by its low cost, as each rock is moved only once. It also has low environmental impact, as no <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> vegetation or <b>overburden</b> is necessary, and all process water is fully recycled. Such operations are typical on New Zealand's South Island and in the Klondike region of Canada.|$|R

40|$|The mining of {{oil sands}} near Fort McMurray, Alberta, {{involves}} the <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> salinesadie <b>overburden</b> {{to gain access}} to the oil-bearing formation. The overburden is placed in mined out pits and surface dumps and is re-contoured before being capped with a mandated 1 m soil cover. The potential for slope instability, subsidence, and salinization resulting from the character of the saline-sodic material and its interaction with fresh water makes it imperative that the amount of precipitation percolating below the root zone be minimised. Syncrude Canada Ltd is conducting a large scale cover trial at the Mildred Lake mine in order to assess the performance of different reclamation strategies. Four 1 hectare prototype covers were placed on an area referred to as the SW 30 -Dump in order to study the basic mechanisms controlling moisture movement within the cover systems. Three covers were constructed in 1999 with configurations of 1. 00 m, 0. 50 m and 0. 35 m thick and consisted of a thin layer of peat overlying varying thickness of secondary soil. A fourth study site was established on a recently reclaimed watershed capped with a 1. 00 m cover of peat/secondary mix in 1996. A field instrumentation program was carried out consisting of detailed monitoring of matric suction, volumetric water content and temperature within the different soil profiles, as well as measurements of runoff, interflow and site-specific meteorological conditions. Generally, all instrumentation performed well and was found to correctly measure the soil-atmosphere fluxes required to assess each cover alternative. Evaluation of the covers revealed that the 1 m layered cover was the only one to maintain sufficient soil moisture for all monitored growing seasons. A significant portion of the available soil water was held within the peat layer. The other three covers lacked the required storage during drier periods and on numerous occasions soil suction values exceeded the wilting point for vegetation. Interflow measured from the covers was negligible, while high intensity rainfall events and large snow melt events caused preferential flow events in all but the 1 m layered cover. Moisture contents in the shale overburden fluctuated only 1 to 2 percent during the period monitored, indicating nominal percolation into the shale beyond the cover/overburden interface...|$|R

30|$|The broad {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to improve current surface mining practices and reduce negative environmental impact <b>of</b> <b>overburden</b> removal in West Virginia (WV). The specific objectives were to (i) compare conventional surface mining method (drilling, blasting, digging, and loading) to a surface miner (SM) method, and (ii) apply the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to help select the optimal mining method based on production, cost and environmental criteria. The design and the procedures used in this research involve five interrelated modules: (i) rock properties <b>of</b> <b>overburden</b> in WV, (ii) drilling and blasting, (iii) digging and loading, (iv) SM method, and (v) comparative analysis and selection of the optimal mining method by AHP. Results of this research indicate that application of SM method would yield higher cost <b>of</b> <b>overburden</b> removal than conventional mining methods in rocks with a high unconfined compressive strength and abrasivity. A significant advantage of SM method, where applicable, is the elimination of the negative environmental impacts associated with blasting.|$|R
