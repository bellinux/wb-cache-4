5|$|The {{action would}} prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley {{had tried to}} insist on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, {{knocking down}} masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective {{range of the}} guns was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|The Warden of the Fleet Prison, who {{was also}} keeper of Westminster Hall, was tasked with keeping it clean and letting the shops and booths along the sides. Despite acting as gaoler to the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and Star Chamber {{as part of his}} duties the Warden was {{considered}} an officer of the Court of Common Pleas. All court officers were appointed for life, and could only be removed for misbehaviour. Despite this, the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice's tenure, and selling them could be very profitable.|$|E

5|$|The {{eruption}} {{occurred at}} the same time as the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, limiting the amount of supplies that could be sent to each of the disasters. Efforts were organized in Ibagué and Bogotá for Armero and in Cali for Chinchina, where medical teams gathered. Makeshift triage stations were established in Lerida, Guayabal, and Mariquita, and soon were overwhelmed with the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of victims. The remaining victims were directed to Ibagué's hospitals, as local institutions had already been destroyed or were at risk from further lahars.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{complicated}} battle tactics {{for both}} sides, but the Russians and the Austrians, having {{arrived in the}} area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick's deadly modus operandi, the oblique order. Although Frederick's troops initially gained {{the upper hand in}} the battle, the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of Allied troops gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when the combatants were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.|$|E
5|$|Deadpool was {{released}} in North America on February 12, 2016, after an unconventional viral marketing campaign. The film became both a financial and critical success: it earned over $783 million, breaking numerous records and becoming the overall highest-grossing R-rated film, the highest grossing X-Men film, and the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016; it received critical praise for Reynolds' performance, the film's style and faithfulness to the comics, and its action, though some criticized the plot as formulaic {{as well as the}} <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of jokes in the film; and it received numerous awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice Award wins and two Golden Globe nominations. Deadpool 2 is set for release on June 1, 2018.|$|E

5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached {{a position on the}} open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{records of}} Blackstone's undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College {{had been set}} out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied Greek, science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography and poetry. Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics and poetry, with his notes on William Shakespeare being included in George Steevens' 1781 edition of Shakespeare's plays. Many of Blackstone's undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts. The last element is understandable, given his family's theological interests, but the more surprising element is the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of texts he owned given his relative poverty as a student.|$|E

5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{development}} of Red and Green, all Pokémon {{were designed by}} Ken Sugimori, a long-time friend of Tajiri, {{and a team of}} fewer than ten people, including Atsuko Nishida who is credited as the designer of Pikachu. By 2013 a team of 20artists worked together to create new species designs. A committee of five people determine which designs are incorporated into the games, with Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida finalizing the look of each creature. Furthermore, Sugimori is responsible for the boxart legendary Pokémon and all of the official artwork for the games. According to Yoshida, the number of rejected Pokémon designs is five to ten times more than the number that are finalized in each game. In rare cases, rejected designs are brought back and released in a later generation. Shigeru Ohmori, director of Sun and Moon, admitted that creating new Pokémon has become a difficult task with the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of creatures designed over the franchise's 20-year history. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.|$|E

50|$|The compact hand-cranked Parvo {{camera was}} first made in Paris by André Debrie in 1908. Though expensive, it slowly built in {{popularity}} from about 1915. By the mid-1920s it was, in <b>sheer</b> <b>numbers,</b> the most-used film camera of any kind.|$|R
5|$|While Sauropelta was an {{important}} part of the Cloverly herbivore guild, the most abundant herbivorous dinosaur of the time was the large ornithopod Tenontosaurus. The smaller ornithopod Zephyrosaurus, rare titanosaur sauropods, and an unknown type of ornithomimosaur also lived alongside Sauropelta. The dromaeosaurid theropod Deinonychus fed upon some of these herbivores, and the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of Deinonychus teeth scattered throughout the formation are a testament to its abundance. Microvenator, a small basal oviraptorosaur, hunted smaller prey, while the apex predators of the Cloverly was the large allosauroid theropod Acrocanthosaurus. Lungfish, triconodont mammals, and several species of turtles lived in the Cloverly, while crocodilians prowled the rivers, lakes, and swamps, providing evidence of a year-round warm climate. The Late Jurassic fauna dominated by allosauroids, stegosaurs, and many varieties of huge sauropods gave way by Cloverly times to an Early Cretaceous fauna in which dromaeosaurs, ornithopods, and nodosaurs like Sauropelta were predominant. After the Cloverly ended, a large wave of Asian animals, including tyrannosaurids, ceratopsians, and ankylosaurids would disperse into western North America, forming the mixed fauna seen throughout the Late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Governor Lawton Chiles {{declared}} a state of emergency and activated about one-third of the Florida National Guard. Many residents evacuated, most voluntarily, from Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Lee, Martin, Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, and Sarasota counties. A total of 142shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84,340people. In Dade County alone, 515,670people were ordered to evacuate. As Andrew was approaching, an estimated 20,00030,000tourists were in the Florida Keys (Monroe County). Overall, almost 1.2million people evacuated, which contributed to the low number of fatalities, despite the intensity of the storm. Many evacuees also checked into hotels, with rooms completely booked as far north as Ocala. Ultimately, the <b>sheer</b> <b>number</b> of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of Florida, mostly along Interstate 95. United States Coast Guard vessels on or near the Florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea. Government offices and public and private schools were closed from Monroe County northward to St. Lucie County. Many colleges and universities in southeast Florida also closed, including Barry University, Broward Community College, Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of Miami. Major airports such as the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood, Key West, Miami, and Palm Beach international airports closed.|$|E
