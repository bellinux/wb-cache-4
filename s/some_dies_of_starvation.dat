5000|$|In {{its history}} of the war, the Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum {{presents}} Okinawa as being caught between the United States and the Empire of Japan. During the 1945 battle, the Japanese Army showed indifference to Okinawans' safety, and its soldiers even used civilians as human shields or just outright murdered them. The Japanese military confiscated food from the Okinawans and executed those who hid it, leading to mass starvation, and forced civilians out of their shelters. Japanese soldiers also killed about 1,000 people who spoke in the Okinawan language to suppress spying. The museum writes that [...] "some were blown apart by artillery shells, some finding themselves in a hopeless situation were driven to suicide, <b>some</b> <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>starvation,</b> <b>some</b> succumbed to malaria, while others fell victim to the retreating Japanese troops." ...|$|R

40|$|Malnutrition was {{studied in}} farmed red deer. Malnourished animals did not recover from winter energy loss, {{remained}} in poor condition throughout the summer, and <b>some</b> <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>starvation.</b> Liver analysis <b>of</b> one hind that <b>died</b> <b>of</b> malnutrition showed selenium and cobalt deficiency. This hind was cachectic and heavily infected with lungworm (Dictyocaulus spp). Serum levels of thirty-three parameters of hinds suffering from malnutrition (n= 4) {{were compared to}} values from free-ranging reference hinds (n= 10). Hinds suffering from malnutrition had significantly higher values (p< 0. 01) of glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, globulin, alpha 2 globulin, beta globulin, gamma globulin, urea and copper. The farmed hinds, however, had been fed supplementary copper and did not suffer from deficiency. Malnourished hinds had significantly lower values of albumin, creatinine and zinc. These parameters {{can be used to}} diagnose malnutrition in red deer hinds.

50|$|The {{breeding}} season for magpies is generally from late March to early July. They nest once a year, but may re-nest if their first attempt fails early. The female lays up to thirteen eggs, but the usual clutch size is six or seven. The eggs are greenish grey, marked with browns, and 33 mm (about 1.3 inch) long. Only the female incubates, for 16-21 days. The male feeds the female throughout incubation. Hatching is often asynchronous. Hatched young are altricial, brooded by the female but fed by both sexes. They fly 3-4 weeks after hatching, feed with adults {{for about two}} months, and then fly off to join other juvenile magpies. Fledging success (usually 3-4 young per nest) is lower than clutch size; {{this is not an}} unusual state of affairs in species with asynchronous hatching, as <b>some</b> nestlings often <b>die</b> <b>of</b> <b>starvation.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known purposely built prisoner-of-war {{camp was}} established at Norman Cross, England in 1797 {{to house the}} increasing number of prisoners from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government {{went to great lengths to}} provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals.

5000|$|Yau Kung Mun {{martial arts}} were {{introduced}} to the public in 1924. Prior to that time, the history extends back into the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 A.D.) in the Sil Lum Temple of Honan province. The style was originated by a Buddhist monk named Ding Yang, who being very humble and withdrawn, gave no name to the style. The secrets of the style were selectively passed on to one disciple per generation {{within the confines of the}} Temple for hundreds of years into the Ching Dynasty (1644 - 1911 A.D.). When the Manchu conquered China to begin the Qing Dynasty, the officials and sympathizers of the former Ming emperor took refuge in the temples. To prevent attempts to restore the Ming to power, the Manchu emperor ordered the destruction of the temples. Many monks were killed, the rest fled; <b>some</b> to <b>die</b> <b>of</b> <b>starvation.</b> One surviving monk was Doe Sung. Doe Sung was the principal disciple of Yau Kung Mun, and had been the chosen representative of the Temple to meet all challengers. Through Doe Sung, the style survived continuing to pass to only one disciple per generation. (See diagram).

5000|$|Helen Ann Richardson {{was born}} on 21 November 1938 in Rangoon, Burma to an Anglo Indian father and Burmese mother. Her father's name was George Desmier. She has a brother named Roger and a sister name Jennifer. Their father died during World War II. The family then trekked to Mumbai in 1943 in order {{to escape from the}} Japanese {{occupation}} of Burma. Helen told Filmfare during an interview in 1964: ...we trekked alternately through wilderness and hundreds of villages, surviving on the generosity of people, for we were penniless, with no food and few clothes. Occasionally, we met British soldiers who provided us with transport, found us refuge and treated our blistered feet and bruised bodies and fed us. By the time we reached Dibrugarh in Assam, our group had been reduced to half. Some had fallen ill and been left behind, <b>some</b> had <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>starvation</b> and disease. My mother miscarried along the way. The survivors were admitted to the Dibrugarh hospital for treatment. Mother and I had been virtually reduced to skeletons and my brother's condition was critical. We spent two months in hospital. When we recovered, we moved to Calcutta, and sadly my brother died there due to small pox". She quit her schooling to support her family because her mother's salary as a nurse was not enough to feed a family of four. In a documentary called Queen of the Nautch girls, Helen said she was 19 years old in 1957 when she got her first big break in Howrah Bridge.|$|R

500|$|The {{derivation}} of the Latin narcissus (...) is unknown. It {{may be a}} loanword {{from another}} language, for instance {{it is said to}} be related to the Sanskrit word nark, meaning 'hell'. It is frequently linked to the Greek myth of Narcissus described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, who became so obsessed with his own reflection that as he knelt and gazed into a pool of water, he fell into the water and drowned. In <b>some</b> variations, he <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>starvation</b> and thirst. In both versions, the narcissus plant sprang from where he died. Although Ovid appeared to describe the plant we now know as Narcissus there is no evidence for this popular derivation, and the person's name may have come from the flower's name. The Poet's Narcissus (N. poeticus), which grows in Greece, has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating. Again, this explanation lacks any real proof and is largely discredited. Pliny wrote that the plant ‘narce narcissum dictum, non a fabuloso puero’ (named narcissus from narce, not from the legendary youth), i.e. that it was named for its narcotic properties ( [...] narkao, [...] "I grow numb" [...] in Greek), not from the legend. Furthermore, there were accounts of narcissi growing, such as in the legend of Persephone, long before the story of Narcissus appeared (see Greek culture). It has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams evoked the image of the youth admiring his own reflection in the water.|$|R
5000|$|Seasonal hunger {{was common}} in pre-colonial and early colonial times, and {{gave rise to}} several coping {{strategies}} such as growing secondary crops like millet or sweet potatoes in case the maize crop failed, gathering wild food or relying on support from family or friends. In a purely peasant economy, farmers grow food primarily for their families’ needs. They normally have only small surpluses to store or for sale and little money to buy food {{in a time of}} shortage, even if it was available in any market. There were no significant markets, as any surplus grain not stored would be bartered for livestock or passed to dependents. If drought coincided with warfare, famine could be catastrophic, as in the great 1861-63 famine in southern Malawi, when 90% of the population <b>of</b> <b>some</b> villages <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>starvation</b> or disease, or through war. However, seasonal shortages occurred in most years and droughts ever six years on average. The imposition of colonial rule itself caused local food shortages, sometimes amounting to famine, where villages were burned and cattle killed. There were several significant famine {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, including one in the lower valley of the Shire River, an area which frequently experienced shortages, in 1903. Low rainfall in 1900-01, 1918 and 1920-21 and 1922 caused severe drought in the south and centre of the country, while in 1926 crops were destroyed by flooding. There was also distress in the north nearKasungu in 1924-25 and around Mzimba in 1938, and the shores of Lake Malawi suffered food shortages almost annually in the 1930s. However, for the first 50 years of colonial rule, much of the country fared better that the drier areas of southern Tanganyika, eastern Northern Rhodesia or Mozambique, where famine was endemic. The colonial authorities also provided some famine relief by moving maize from districts with surpluses to those with shortages and making free issues to children, the old and destitute, but they were reluctant to issue free relief to the able-bodied. After the great famine ended in 1863, despite regular seasonal hunger and high levels of chronic malnutrition, as well as acute episodes of food shortage and famine, there was no [...] "famine that kills" [...] until 1949.|$|R
40|$|The {{published}} data on {{the ecology}} of the European Wildcat Pelis silvestris Schreb, are reviewed. Wildcats inhabit the deciduous forests of the plains and lower hill regions of Western Eurasia, living mainly near natural clearings and in the peripheral zones of large forests. The male occupies a wide range, which overlaps the home range of two or more females, and is less sedentary than the latter. While travelling, the animal follows existing trails and pathways. During winter, from November till February, it seeks shelter in dens, but does not go underground during the milder part of the year. The circadian rythm of activity is irregular, but there are two main periods of activity, at dawn and dusk. The cat remains inactive in the late night. It suns itself, especially in winter, when it can be observed in late morning lying flat on thick branches or in the nests of birds of prey. The Wildcat hunts in the open and not in deep forests. Fields, meadows and clearings are its favorite hunting grounds where meadow voles, its main prey, are most abundant. The Wildcat suffers from intense summer heat and then decreases its food intake. A period of intense feeding follows in autumn, which compensates for the summer loss of weight. Its appetite remains strong until the end of December, when the cat becomes very fat. The Wildcat can withstand severe cold, but snowfall limits its altitudinal distribution. During prolonged periods of excessive snow cover it loses weight and <b>some</b> individuals sometimes <b>die</b> <b>of</b> <b>starvation.</b> The European Wildcat is a solitary carnivore, except during the mating period. Parturition occurs on the ground. The den is rudimentary; no nesting material is present but the female cleans the floor by scratching. The birth place of the kittens is sheltered from rain and moisture. Very little is known on the Wildcat's interactions with it prey animals and other vertebrate...|$|R
