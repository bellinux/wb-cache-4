5|$|The barn {{was built}} {{sometime}} around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed {{of the same}} <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> that makes up {{the exterior of the}} home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the house itself, was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish. The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50feet (15m) tall, with a width of 30feet (9m).|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{completion}} of the cell block meant a roof over a prisoner's head, the amenities of the facility were sparse. [...] The cells measured 6 × , were constructed of <b>soft</b> <b>brick,</b> and had no plumbing or artificial lights. The building had no heating or ventilation, and, in a region which often experienced temperatures below [...] in the winter and above [...] in the summer, this made for very uncomfortable tenants. [...] To alleviate the discomfort, the administration used wood stoves to heat the building and oil lamps to light it, the smoke from which combined with the stench of bucketed human waste and unwashed bodies to make the environment rank.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{building}} stands three stories, {{and features}} a partial basement and twenty rooms. Ten {{of the rooms}} were specifically designed as bedrooms. The brick building sits on a stone foundation and is cast in a mid-19th-century Italianate style. The hotel building itself features arched segmented one over one windows on all facades and floors. The wooden-framed windows are either all original or could be restored to original appearance. The windows have shallow hood moldings made of <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> and are all double hung. The original porch and balcony, removed for reasons unknown during the 1950s, measured 18 feet (5.5 m) across and 10 feet (3 m) deep. The property of the Central House has one outbuilding, a five-bay garage that dates to around the 1910s. The garage has had one roof replacement but maintains its historic integrity.|$|E

2500|$|It {{only took}} a single {{month before the}} prison was overcrowded; by August, six more prisoners had arrived. [...] The burgeoning {{population}} was quelled somewhat when, in June 1874, another tier of fourteen cells was constructed, and the civilians of Deer Lodge were calmed when a twelve foot board fence went up in 1875. [...] The prison's population continued to grow, so Congress allocated an additional $15,000 {{for the construction of}} another tier of cells, but the <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> of the building could not support any more weight. [...] Instead, the money went into an administration building with guard barracks, a warden's office, and a visitor's reception. [...] Finally, in 1885, $25,000 served to provide the prison with a three story cellblock with 42 double-occupancy cells which was completed in 1886. [...] The Montana Territorial Prison was finally completed to original specifications, just in time to be handed over to the new State of Montana in March 1890.|$|E
50|$|Records in the Linn County assessor’s office {{indicate}} that the present school house was built in 1856 of <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> {{thought to have been}} manufactured locally at Port Stottler brickyard. The building measures 20 by 26 feet and originally faced north.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{believed}} that during the ownership of Madame Rillieux (1805-1810), Edgar Degas' great-grandmother, the ground floor was enclosed with masonry walls of <b>soft</b> <b>brick.</b> Rillieux was also responsible for adding the southern gallery and several outbuildings, which are no longer extant.|$|E

50|$|Although the sand-cement renders {{typically}} {{installed as}} part of a rising damp treatment are very effective at holding back damp and ground salts, they have a number of disadvantages. These include an incompatibility with the <b>soft</b> <b>bricks</b> and mortars encountered in older buildings and a lack of insulation properties compared with more traditional plasters, resulting in an increased risk of condensation. Replastering {{is also one of the}} most expensive parts of a rising damp treatment.|$|R
50|$|In 1903, most {{houses were}} made from <b>soft</b> blue <b>bricks,</b> they had basements, and {{retaining}} walls at {{the front and back}} due to the steep slope.|$|R
5000|$|The Elks-Rogers Hotel, {{also known}} as Park Hotel of Clear Lake, in Clear Lake, Iowa, was built in 1901 as a resort hotel. It was [...] "a classic piece of late Victorian {{architecture}} often found in the trans-Mississippi West." [...] It had brick walls (made of <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> of the area), fan windows, and a large porch with Doric columns.|$|E
50|$|As the {{construction}} on the courthouse was finishing, the old county jail of 1827 burned down. The county did have enough funds to construct a new one and this project was placed on hold until 1839. The new jailhouse was located close to the courthouse. The <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> used in construction allowed many prisoners to escape {{which led to the}} whole block being surrounded by a solid board fence.|$|E
50|$|The barn {{was built}} {{sometime}} around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed {{of the same}} <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> that makes up {{the exterior of the}} home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the house itself, was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish.

5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{majority}} of the shells to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired armour piercing shells, intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively <b>softer</b> <b>brick</b> walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses. Sea water may have degraded the shells, which the Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks. The age of the shells may also have been a factor; some of the shells recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture; surplus munitions from World War I.|$|R
50|$|The main, two-story {{section of}} the {{building}} is three bays on {{the east and west}} and five bays on the north and south. Its current stucco exterior, which was added in 1943, covers thick, load-bearing walls that consist of <b>soft,</b> locally made <b>bricks,</b> many of which were salvaged from the rubble of a previous courthouse on the site. The building is on a dressed and faced stone foundation with a stone water table and the hipped roof is slightly flared, with each slope containing a vented dormer. A paneled frieze circles the entire second floor of the structure and the courthouse’s numerous double-hung 2-on-2 windows appear original. The one story addition {{on the south side of}} the courthouse was added in 1943, at the same time the stucco exterior was applied, which was necessary to protect the <b>soft</b> <b>bricks</b> from deterioration.|$|R
50|$|Howard Payne Hall {{was built}} in 1851 {{boarding}} house for women by William T. Lucky and Nathan Scarritt. The north wing was added from the burnt bricks {{that used to be}} Howard High School. The north wing was used to house classrooms. In 1959, Howard High School was chartered into Howard College. Eventually Central bought Howard College and it became a female dorm. Howard Payne Hall was closed for several years due to the use of <b>soft</b> <b>bricks</b> during its construction. In 1981, the building was reopened and used as a co-ed dorm, and is still used this way in the present.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house is}} a vernacular {{interpretation}} of the Italianate style. While it is similar in size and age with other houses in the neighborhood, its brick exterior distinguishes it from the frame houses that surround it. [...] The exterior is a <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> that is painted. The structure is a hipped roof box, and features large round-arched windows. The round arches are composed of brick with stone keystones. Large brackets with pendants band the cornice at the roof line of the two-story structure.|$|E
5000|$|Lime mortar is more porous than cement mortars, and it wicks any {{dampness}} in {{the wall}} to the surface where it evaporates. Thus any salt content in the water crystallises on the lime, damaging the lime and thus saving the masonry. Cement {{on the other hand}} evaporates water less than <b>soft</b> <b>brick,</b> so damp issues are liable to cause salt formation and spalling on brick surfaces and consequent disintegration of bricks. This damp evaporation ability is widely referred to as 'breathability'.|$|E
5000|$|Historic {{buildings}} are frequently constructed with relatively soft masonry units (e.g. <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> and {{many types of}} stone), and minor movement in such buildings is quite common {{due to the nature}} of the foundations. This movement breaks the weakest part of the wall, and with Portland cement mortar this is usually the masonry. When lime mortar is used, the lime is the weaker element, and the mortar cracks in preference to the masonry. This results in much less damage, and is relatively simple to repair.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes {{we had a}} dance. Then, for {{the wine}} to drink, three men came with {{mandolines}} and guitars, and sat in a corner playing their rapid tunes, while all danced on the dusty brick floor of the little parlour. No strange women were invited, only men; the young bloods from the big village on the lake, the wild men from above. They danced the slow, trailing, lilting polka-waltz round and round the small room, the guitars and mandolines twanging rapidly, the dust rising from the <b>soft</b> <b>bricks.</b> There were only the two English women: so men danced with men, as the Italians love to do. They love even better to dance with men, with a dear blood-friend, than with women.|$|R
50|$|The {{backdrop}} for the gingerbread is red brick, a hallmark of Vankleek Hill Victorian and Edwardian period buildings. The local rich clay deposits were kilned to a distinctive <b>soft</b> red <b>brick</b> by at least three local brick factories active here in the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} eclectic, {{combining}} Italianate {{features such as}} stucco treatment with classical elements like the formal front entrance. The stucco covering protected the <b>soft,</b> locally-made <b>brick</b> from erosion by wind and water. The building was constructed of brick-on-brick foundations which increase the width below the surface.|$|R
50|$|In 1943 a one-story frame {{addition}} with a {{flat roof}} was added along {{the full length of}} {{the south side of the}} courthouse. The addition included restrooms was needed to provide additional office and vault space. It increased the total size of the courthouse to 5,761 square feet. It was also at this time that the building was stuccoed, covering up the original brick exterior, and painted white. The stucco provided both a uniform veneer to the building and aided in preventing continued deterioration of the original <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> exterior. Additionally, small double windows located in the attic dormers were boxed in and replaced by louvered vents and battens.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{completion}} of the cell block meant a roof over a prisoner's head, the amenities of the facility were sparse. The cells measured 6 × 8 ft, were constructed of <b>soft</b> <b>brick,</b> and had no plumbing or artificial lights. The building had no heating or ventilation, and, in a region which often experienced temperatures below [...] in the winter and above [...] in the summer, this made for very uncomfortable tenants. To alleviate the discomfort, the administration used wood stoves to heat the building and oil lamps to light it, the smoke from which combined with the stench of bucketed human waste and unwashed bodies to make the environment rank.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1969 the Boland {{area was}} hit by an {{earthquake}} that caused considerable damage {{to the town of}} Tulbagh. Many of the Church Street buildings were destroyed. The extent of the damage was aptly described by the Journal Bulletin of the Simon van der Stel Foundation in 1973: [...] "A street that somehow captured the essential spirit of a unique culture looked as if it was {{in the throes of a}} nightmare: many fine gables had either tumbled or were totally destroyed, whole sections of many houses had collapsed, most of the <b>soft</b> <b>brick</b> walls had burst open in wide cracks, plaster had been torn by off in large sheets, rafters and roofs had caved in. Everything appeared to be in total and irreparable ruin." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{two-story house}} is square, with entrances on the east, south, and north. The house {{is built on}} a {{foundation}} of fieldstone and locally produced <b>soft</b> red <b>brick.</b> The east facade features two windows flanking the door and four regularly spaced windows on the second floor. The doors on {{the north and south}} are off center, with three windows on each side—one to the east and two to the west. The walls are built with the same <b>soft</b> red <b>brick</b> as the foundation. The Greek Revival porch dominates the southern, eastern, and northern facades with large Doric columns. The roof is hipped with a slight pitch. A cupola {{is at the center of}} the house; it is large enough to serve as a bedroom. A kitchen extension was constructed at the rear on the west side in the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Brick infill {{panels in}} {{stretcher}} bond fit snugly into {{the spaces between}} the timber wall members. This kind of brickwork is known as backfilling or brick nogging. The heights between the horizontal timber members are sized to suit brick dimensions. The original <b>bricks</b> are <b>soft</b> handmade <b>bricks,</b> reddish brown in colour and laid with a lime mortar.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{property}} is Sternfield Hall, with its classic Georgian <b>soft</b> red <b>brick</b> facade and late 16th Century wing {{which is probably}} {{the site of a}} medieval manor house where on April 27, 1385 a licence to crenellate at Sternefeld (Sternfield) was granted to Sir Michael de la Pole by Richard II in year eight of his reign.|$|R

50|$|None of the {{facilities}} that were associated with Le Claire's 19th century industries are extent. What remains are commercial and residential structures built between 1850 and 1900 and new construction. The commercial buildings from the 1850s and 1860s were built mostly of locally produced <b>soft</b> <b>brick.</b> The structures are narrow, two-stories in height at street level, with either two or three bays on the main facade. They are capped by either broad, low-pitched gable or half-hip roof or a front-gable. For the most part building foundations are from locally quarried limestone. The buildings {{on the east side}} of the street have exposed basements because the land drops steeply to the river at that point. The houses were built in either the Greek Revival style with symmetrical fronts and a gable roof or in a vernacular form of the Italianate style with low hipped roofs and bracketed cornices. The houses were constructed mainly in wood or brick, and rarely in limestone.|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} in the rural area of Turkey has increased due to KKP (in Turkish Köy-Kent Proje). Most of the buildings {{in the area are}} made out of limestone and adobe. But this material does not have sufficient resistance to earthquakes. The research in the field of construction at The University of Cukurova elaborates on the mechanical properties and workability of raw materials such as fibre, wheat stem, strafor, basaltic pumice and clay. The production of bricks using a significant fraction of mixed waste from wheat and different ratios of clay mixed with fibre, strafor, cement, gypsum, lime and basaltic pumice was investigated. This paper presents the use of waste in the construction of <b>soft</b> <b>bricks</b> at the KKP. The results of this study suggests that using these materials have many advantages such as energy savings, low cost and improvements in the final properties of products...|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{the asylum}} began in 1894 and was {{completed}} in 1897. The asylum was built of <b>soft</b> red <b>brick</b> with reconstituted stonework ornamentation roofed with slate in a classical Queen Anne style.
