25|$|In {{the early}} serials The Edge of Destruction and The Sensorites, it {{appeared}} that the First Doctor had only a single heart. It was not until the Third Doctor serial Spearhead from Space that the programme's then-writers came up with the concept that the Doctor has two hearts. The tie-in novel The Man in the Velvet Mask states (incorporating an explanation for the discrepancy from fan lore) that the Doctor did not grow his <b>second</b> <b>heart</b> until his regeneration into the Second Doctor.|$|E

In 2000, he told an interviewer for Esquire that, while growing up, he admired his father's ability to tell jokes and be the life of the party. Harry Joseph Letterman survived a heart attack at age 36, when David was a young boy. The fear of losing his father was constantly with Letterman as he grew up.

25|$|In March 1980, Aquino {{suffered}} a heart attack in prison. He was transported to the Philippine Heart Center, where he {{suffered a}} <b>second</b> <b>heart</b> attack. Doctors determined he needed coronary artery bypass surgery; however, no surgeon wanted to perform the operation out of fear of controversy, and Aquino refused to undergo the procedure in the Philippines out of fear of sabotage by Marcos, indicating he would either go to the United States to undergo the procedure or die in his prison cell. On May 8, 1980, First Lady Imelda Marcos arranged for Aquino and his family to leave for the U.S. He underwent the coronary bypass surgery in Dallas, Texas and met with Muslim leaders in Damascus, Syria, before settling with his family in Newton, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after winning}} the Professional Snooker Association of Canada's Invitation Event (beating Rex Williams and Paul Thornley {{in the last two}} rounds) Davis {{suffered}} the first of two heart attacks in May 1970 and did not journey to the November 1970 World Championship held in Australia and won by John Spencer. He lost 31–21 to Spencer in his first match in the 1972 championship, but beat David Greaves 16–1 {{in the second round of}} the 1973 championship before losing to Alex Higgins 16–14 in the quarter-finals. It was in this match, played at the City Exhibition Halls in Manchester, where a leak in the roof forced rain to stop play whilst a cover was found and the position of each ball marked. Davis gained his revenge in the 1974 championship, when he beat Higgins 15–14 in the quarter-finals (having earlier dispatched Bill Werbeniuk 15–5). This return match with Higgins also contained a notable incident when referee Jim Thorpe called a 'push-shot' in frame 25, a decision to which Higgins so vehemently objected that he ended up swearing at the referee. Higgins blamed his subsequent defeat on the incident. Higgins never blamed Davis for any part of this incident (indeed he praised him over it) and clearly stated his admiration for Davis for playing so well following a <b>second</b> <b>heart</b> attack. Davis for his part also praised Higgins for his 'sportmanship' in his autobiography Talking Snooker, first published in 1979. However, Davis's 1974 World Championship campaign ended with a 15–3 defeat by eventual champion Ray Reardon in the semi-finals.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of {{the fourth}} series, Russell T Davies {{acknowledged}} that the character of Gwen can be both loved and hated by the audience. He stated that as an actress Myles isn't preoccupied with her character being presented in a sympathetic light, being able [...] "to take that extraordinary deep breath and not care". io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the TV episode [...] "The Categories of Life", written by Jane Espenson, exposed the character's [...] "human vanity" [...] by showing that she has [...] "started to believe her own hype". In Anders' eyes, the character is responsible for her father's <b>second</b> <b>heart</b> attack because of her rash actions. Anders felt that later episodes in the fourth series continued to illuminate flaws in Gwen's character, describing her as someone with an [...] "addictive personality" [...] who [...] "treats her Torchwood adventures like a drug that she craves" [...] though she knows they [...] "ruin her relationships {{with her husband and}} child".|$|E
500|$|On 19 November 1963, {{the case}} of McClory v Fleming, {{following}} up the 1961 case, was heard at the Chancery Division of the High Court.

Two weeks after the case, during the weekly Tuesday staff conference at his employers, The Sunday Times, Fleming suffered a serious, <b>second</b> <b>heart</b> attack that necessitated convalescence, which he undertook at the Dudley Hotel in Hove. While there, one of Fleming's friends, Duff Dunbar, gave him a copy of Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin to read and suggested that he {{took the time to}} write up the bedtime story that Fleming used to tell his son Caspar each evening. Fleming attacked the project with gusto and wrote to his publisher, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape, joking that [...] "There is not a moment, even {{on the edge of the}} tomb, when I am not slaving for you".|$|E
