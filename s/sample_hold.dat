In this work, we point out the importance of stable {{feature selection}} for knowledge discovery from high-dimensional data, and identify two causes of instability of feature selection algorithms: selection of a minimum subset without redundant features and small sample size. We propose a general framework for stable feature selection which emphasizes both good generalization and stability of feature selection results. The framework identifies dense feature groups based on kernel density estimation and treats features in each dense group as a coherent entity for feature selection. An efficient algorithm DRAGS (Dense Relevant Attribute Group Selector) is developed under this framework.

However, the bulk environmental concentrations of DNA and RNA, and their relative ratios, also potentially provide important information on the biomass and metabolic activity of planktonic organisms. Currently, {{there is a need to}} quantify the relative living biomass levels of natural water contained in ships’ ballast tanks to regulate the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) resulting from ballast water discharge practices within the international shipping industry.

However, people differ both with respect to what they view as fair and with respect to how much weight they attach to fairness considerations. In this paper, we study the role of family background in explaining these heterogeneities in fairness preferences. In particular, we examine how socioeconomic background relates to fairness views and to how people make trade-offs between fairness and self-interest. To study this we conducted an economic experiment with a representative sample of 14 - 15 year-olds and matched the experimental data to administrative data on parental income and education. The participants made two distributive choices in the experiment. The first choice was to distribute money between themselves and another participant in a situation where there was no difference in merit. The second choice was to distribute money between two other participants with unequal merits. Our main finding is that there is a systematic difference in fairness view between children from low socioceconomic status (SES) families and the rest of the participants; more than 50 percent of the participants from low SES families are egalitarians, whereas only about 20 percent in the rest of the <b>sample</b> <b>hold</b> this fairness view.

Two major datasets are employed: the NBER Shared Capitalism Research Project employee survey dataset and the 2002 and 2006 national General Social Surveys (GSS). The GSS national survey shows that 29 % of permanent, full-time employees with at least one year on the job own their employers' stock, compared to the unsurprisingly higher 87 % of employees in the NBER "shared capitalist" firms. The employees in the national <b>sample</b> <b>hold</b> an average of $ 10, 600 of employer stock, compared to $ 52, 800 in the NBER sample. Employee owners in NBER companies with broad-based ownership structures fare better: those in majority-owned ESOPs hold on average $ 86, 000 in company stock and those in broad-based stock option plans hold options worth an average of $ 283, 000. We find no evidence [...] either between datasets or between employee-owners and non-owners within datasets [...] of substitution of company stock ownership for pay or benefits. Moreover, our analysis suggests that company stock ownership substantially raises total employee wealth, though it appears to have little effect on the overall distribution of wealth.

In fiscal year (FY) 1994 and FY 1995, three field tests were conducted to gather information {{that could be used to}} (1) increase the understanding of 300 Area building liquid waste streams based on the characterization and monitoring data collected during calendar year (CY) 1994 and CY 1995 and (2) establish improved methods for evaluating facility releases. The three field tests were (1) an evaluation of a continuous monitoring/event-triggered sampling system, (2) a volatile organic compound hold-time study, and (3) an investigation of the dilution and retention properties of the 300 Area process sewer. The results from the first field test showed that future characterization and monitoring of 300 Area facility liquid waste streams could benefit significantly from augmenting continuous monitoring with event-triggered sampling. Current continuous-monitoring practices (i. e., monitoring of pH, conductivity, and flow) cannot detect discharges of organic pollutants. Effluent control effectiveness would be enhanced by incorporating a continuous total organic carbon analyzer in the system to detect events involving releases of organic compounds.

The strategic and tactical practical conclusions for individual scholars and their agenda in the scientific periphery and the semi-periphery, to which Europe increasingly belongs, are much harder to draw than the general diagnosis. Where can scholars from outside the US attractively publish their manuscripts for the world market? How does the European Union make its point in the global scientific arena {{in the field of}} the debates about social policies and globalization? Is there a way, especially for scholars from the new member countries of the European Union, and from the newly formed “Union for the Mediterranean”, to effectively publish their works on the world market? Only three European social affairs ministries (France, Poland, Spain) afford themselves the luxury to publish their own scientific journal, while others must rely on international publishing to make their expertise heard internationally. This article tries to answer tentatively such a difficult and strategic question, and quantitatively compares the performance of Amsterdam University Press (EU); Ashgate (EU); Blackwell (EU); Cambridge UP (EU); Campus (Frankfurt/Ann Arbor) (EU); Cornell UP (USA); Edward Elgar (EU); Houghton/Mifflin (US); IOS Press (EU); Lexington (US); Monthly Review Press (US); Nova Science Publishers (US); Oxford University Press (EU); Palgrave Macmillan (EU); Praeger Publishers (EU); Routledge (EU); Rowman/Littlefield (US); Sage Publications (US); Springer-Verlag (US); St. Martin's Press (US); and Transaction Publishers (US), which in between them control a sizeable share of the social science academic book publishing market in such fields of political science as globalization or European Union studies, with up to nineteen quantitative performance criteria, ranging from market success rates on global markets both in North America as well as mainly in the Asia-Pacific and European region, comparative library presence rates at international organizations libraries, such as the European Union and the United Nations, and the quantitative impact of published titles on combined indices of peer reviewed journals and the international daily and weekly press. In addition, our study evaluates the impact of the companies’ books and journals on the literature, contained in “Google book search” and “Google scholar”, all per total company book and serials output.

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{microfluidic}} analytical devices {{have become an}} increasingly popular re- search topic because of the advantages they confer over their macro-scale counterparts. These include inherent low <b>sample</b> <b>hold</b> up volume, rapid response times and flexible operation. These benefits {{as well as their}} predisposition to automation make them ideal for use in high throughput analytical systems. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with the underpinning technical issues of per- forming a microfluidic stopped-flow reaction kinetics measurement test. These are concentrated on the ability of a syringe pump system to control the flows on-chip. The issues of particular interest are the measurement of the relaxation flow due to mechanical deformation in the syringe drive. the flushing of sample and delivery volumes on-chip and the interplay between the sample volume and delivered volume. A previous kinetics device [1) using an alternative flow control method exhibited poor performance in the sample capture process due to a breakdown in the flow control. This led to a large deviation in the measured sample volume of up to 85 %, and as a result unreliable reaction data was obtained, For this reason the flow control method was changed to syringe pump system. The ability to hold a reaction mixture in place {{for the duration of the}} reaction period is a key requirement of the stopped-flow method. Continued flow due to mechanical deformation in the syringe drive had the potential to make this impossible. The relaxation volume of a 250 ilL syringe used was measured at 10 - 15 nL at 1. 5 bar rising to 105 - 130 nL at 6 bar, depending on the volume of liquid in the syringe. To protect the reagent mixture in the reactor a syringe pressure limit of 3 bar was implemented. An analytical model was derived relating the relaxation volume to the pressure, syringe liquid volume, drive velocity and syringe size which had a good agreement with the data giving an RMS fit of 7. 4 nL. The syringe pump flow control method was shown to deliver consistent operation which was evident in the repeatability of steady state processes like the initial mixture composition, which had a mixture accuracy of 0. 5 % and a repeatahilty of 0. 3 %, and transient processes like the sample capture processes, which displayed a captured volume repeatability of 2. 2 %. As the concentration measurement was performed off-chip a study to characterise the sample capture behaviour was performed. The sample loop size was found to have no effect on the sampling process however, the loop material was found to exhibit a small effect with a PEEK loop giving a slower loop filling compared to a steel loop. The understanding gained from this work has enabled the construction of a device capable of producing reliable reaction data. The device was applied to an example reaction and data were taken over a range of reaction temperatures. Using a second-order kinetic model an activation energy of 50. 65 kJ mol- 1 and a pre-exponential factor of 3. 24 x 1010 L mol- 1 were found. The kinetic model gave a good fit to the data with an RMS error of 4. 5 %. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2014. Major: Organizational Leadership, Policy, and Development. Advisor: David Chapman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 252 pages. This {{study examined the}} extent to which academic leaders and government officials in Poland differ in their notions of good university governance, and sought to uncover how these notions intersect with global trends in higher education governance. The research objective was to identify the criteria that determine what reforms of university governance in Poland are likely be perceived as acceptable by the two groups of most powerful higher education stakeholders. The dissertation is set against the background of a crisis of public confidence in Polish higher education. After two decades of rapid and uneven system growth, there is broad agreement that the governance framework adopted by public universities in the post-communist transition is hampering higher education institutions' effectiveness and relevance. Path dependence theory suggests that institutional trajectories reinforce social and institutional arrangements selected in the past, constraining the range of future options. In Poland, key stakeholders' conceptions of governance are hypothesized to involve elements of three distinct models of higher education that {{played a significant role in}} shaping the nation's universities: the "Humboldtian" model of academic self-rule, the state-centered Soviet model, and the market-based or Anglo-Saxon model. It is also hypothesized that the path of higher education institutions in Poland is influenced by the legacy of hostile foreign rule reinforced in the period of real socialism in Polish social architecture. This legacy affects higher education by virtue of a strong public-private dichotomy, displayed in a distrust of public processes, dual norms of achievement, hostility between the governing and the governed, and populist notions of equality. The implications of these models for institutional governance are operationalized for the purposed of the analytic framework. The author adopted a qualitative approach with elements of ethnography, and the technique of elite interviewing. Study participants included representatives of the Polish government and leaders of four academic institutions in a large academic center. Study findings show that policy actors and academic leaders included in the <b>sample</b> <b>hold</b> distinct views related to the institutional structure of higher education institution, their mission, and the logic of their relationship to the state. Policy actors see higher education institutions as instruments of national development that are at their best when managed by professionals and held accountable by external stakeholders. In contrast, academics see them as autonomous social institutions engaged in the preservation of culture and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, best governed by academic insiders on the basis of social trust. Both visions emerging within the study are recognized by respondents as problematic in Poland's social environment. The notion of external accountability is complicated by the weakness of civil society and a perceived lack of readiness to assume responsibility for the public good in higher education. Meanwhile, the current model of academic self-rule renders academic leaders hostage to their constituencies while setting them at odds with the dominant academic ethos. Likewise, treating higher education institutions as instruments of the state does not achieve desired ends due to regulative mandates and output measures stalling innovation. The alternative, an institutional logic of trust-based accountability preferred by academic leaders, is proving as difficult due to strong norms of in-group loyalty that hamper merit-based evaluation. Divergent views identified in the findings are interpreted as a conflict of two "rationalized myths" - accepted narratives of formal structures rationally fostering desirable ends. They are blueprints whose main attraction is not predicted viability or effectiveness, but symbolic association with a set of deeply held values. The two myths clash within the Polish system in such a way that both sets of goals are compromised. Suggested avenues to escape the impasse are values shared by both myths and therefore potential as sites of path-dependent transformation. These values include merit-based funding for research innovation, elite education, the development of "soft skills," and the empowerment of middle management. Whether path-dependent transformation occurs will be affected by three considerations emerging from the data: the insufficiency of system-wide solutions introduced from the top down by means of regulation alone, the need of new structures for new aims, and the dangers of unreflexive borrowing of foreign organizational forms...|$|E

40|$|Sexual self-schema is a {{relatively}} new cognitive term developed to connote the cognitive self-view that is developed through sexual experience, whilst influencing sexual behaviour and attitudes. Originally developed by Andersen and Cyranowski (1994) as a measure of women’s sexual self-view, this construct was subsequently extended for use with men (Andersen et al., 1999). These two initial investigations gave rise to separate measures for women and men, and although the sub-scales of these measures shared considerable overlap, the main difference pertained to the inclusion of a negative subscale for women that was not found to exist for men. However, further investigation has seen development of a gender neutral scale (Hill, 2007) with women and men relying on similar dimensions (loving/warm, reserved/conservative, and direct/outspoken) in conceiving their sexual selves. Since conceptualisation of sexual selves in this manner, a moderate amount of research has investigated the sexual self-schema of women (e. g., Andersen & Cyranowski, 1995; Meston, Rellini, & Heiman, 2006). Yet a paucity of research exists in relation to the sexual self-schema of men. Moreover, gender comparisons of sexual self-schema are limited to Hill’s (2007) study. Thus, this study investigated the similarities and differences in women and men’s sexual self-schema using Hill’s (2007) gender neutral measure to allow for such a comparison. Relationship satisfaction associated with holding a positive sexual self-view is a concern for many individuals, and significantly contributes to an individual’s psychosocial wellbeing. Thus, for a tool such as the Sexual Self-Schema Scale to have clinical utility, identifying the personal context variables that influence an individual’s sexual self-view is important to target specific interventions. By definition, sexual self-schema is influenced by past sexual experience, and this has been evidenced in the literature to date (e. g., Andersen & Cyranowski, 1994, Andersen et al., 1999). However, mating behaviours in this context have also been linked to strategic mating and enactment of tactics to promote fulfilment of relational goals (e. g., Gangestad & Simpson, 1990). Therefore, this study included assessment of the relationships between strategic mating and tactical behaviours, and sexual self-schema. Additionally, Cyranowski and Andersen (1998) found an association between adult romantic attachment and sexual self-schema in women. However, further investigation of the influence of personal context variables (i. e., attachment) on an individual’s sexual self-schema has stalled. Furthermore, attachment is associated with the development of some psychopathological disorders (i. e., anxiety, depression, and eating disorders) that hold disorder specific schemata and influence interpersonal relationships (e. g., Bowlby, 1973, 1980; Mikulincer, 1995). Accordingly, this study extended Hill’s (2007) research to investigate the personal context variables of attachment, psychopathology, and strategic mating, tactical behaviours and sexual experience that influence women and men’s sexual self-schema. Four research questions were addressed. First, what are the similarities and differences between men’s and women’s sexual self-schemata? Second, is romantic attachment related to sexual self-schema? Third, is psychopathology related to sexual self-schema? Fourth, are mating strategies, tactics and sexual behaviour related to sexual self-schema? The current research recruited 315 participants, including female participants (71. 7 %; mean age = 36. 1, SD = 12. 9) and male participants (28. 3 %; mean age = 37. 2, SD = 12. 3). The sample included 129 students and 186 non-students. Among the 315 participants, 97 % had experienced sexual intercourse, 93 % identified themselves as heterosexual, and 72 % reported being in a current relationship. Analyses of the similarities and differences between women and men’s sexual self-schema confirmed differences found in previous research (Hill, 2007) on the loving/warm sexual self-schema dimension, with women holding a higher loving/warm sexual self-view than men. However, in contrast to prior research (Hill, 2007), there were no gender differences on the reserved/conservative dimension, and women endorsed a more direct/outspoken sexual self-schema than men. Analyses of the personal context variables associated with sexual self-schema revealed an association between attachment insecurity and loving/warm and reserved/conservative sexual self-schema dimensions, but did not influence a sexual self-view related to the direct/outspoken dimension. Depressive symptoms were the only psychopathological symptom set that was associated with all sexual self-schema dimensions for women, and the reserved/conservative and direct/outspoken dimensions for men. Furthermore, behavioural strategies held small associations with loving/warm sexual self-schema of both women and men, one behavioural tactic was associated with a direct/outspoken sexual self-schema for men, and past sexual experience was associated with a reserved/conservative and direct/outspoken sexual self-schema for both women and men. The final stage of analyses focused on assessment of the unique predictor personal context variables for each sexual self-schema for women and men. Holding a loving/warm sexual self-schema was associated similarly for women and men by attachment insecurity. However, differences emerged for depressive symptoms and mating orientation. In addition to the influence of attachment insecurity for both women and men, depressive symptoms were predictive of a loving/warm sexual self-view for women whereas short-term mating orientation was predictive for men. There were no gender differences for the reserved/conservative or the direct/outspoken sexual self-schema dimensions. Insecure anxious attachment, depressive symptoms, and past sexual behaviour predicted a more reserved/conservative sexual self-view. Furthermore, depressive symptoms and past sexual behaviour predicted a more direct/outspoken sexual self-schema. Together these results confirm that women and men in this <b>sample</b> <b>hold</b> more similarities than differences in their sexual self-view. This may be in part due to the older age of the wider community sample recruited for this investigation, and lends further support to contemporary evolutionary theories of human mating (e. g., Strategic Pluralism Theory; Gangestad & Simpson, 2 (00), which posits that women and men employ conditional mixed mating strategies dependent on environmental cues. Furthermore, from the personal context variables investigated in this study, romantic attachment and depressive symptoms were found to exert the greatest predictive value over cognitive representations of the sexual self. It would appear that additional personal context variables (such as sexual self-esteem and personality) that directly relate to interpersonal interactions and behaviour (in contrast to those that indirectly influence behaviour, such as strategic mating) are worthy of future investigation. The results of the current study offer therapeutic implications such as identifying attachment insecurities and depressive symptoms of individuals experiencing relational difficulties, and targeting interventions to modify sexual self-beliefs...|$|E

In some kinds of analog-to-digital converters, the input is compared to a voltage generated internally from a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The circuit tries a series of values and stops converting once the voltages are equal, within some defined error margin. If the input value was permitted to change during this comparison process, the resulting conversion would be inaccurate and possibly unrelated to the true input value. Such successive approximation converters will often incorporate internal <b>sample</b> and <b>hold</b> circuitry. In addition, <b>sample</b> and <b>hold</b> circuits are often used when multiple samples need to be measured at the same time. Each value is sampled and held, using a common sample clock.|$|R

World Health Organization Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality recommend that samples spend no more than 6 h between collection and analysis in a laboratory. Census data were used to estimate the minimum number of operational and surveillance samples required from piped water supplies under national regulations. Drive-times were then computed from each supply system to the nearest accredited laboratory and translated into <b>sample</b> <b>holding</b> times based on likely daily monitoring patterns. Of 62, 502 surveillance samples required annually, 5694 (9. 1 %) were found to be more than 6 h from the nearest of 278 accredited laboratories. 612 samples (1. 0 %) were more than 24 hours' drive from the nearest accredited laboratory, the maximum <b>sample</b> <b>holding</b> time recommended by the World Health Organization. An estimated 30 % of required rural samples would have to be stored for more than 6 h before reaching a laboratory. The analysis demonstrates the difficulty of undertaking microbiological monitoring in rural areas and small towns from a fixed laboratory network. Our GIS-based approach could be adapted to optimise monitoring strategies and support planning of testing and transportation infra-structure development. It could also be used to estimate <b>sample</b> transport and <b>holding</b> times in other countries...|$|R
