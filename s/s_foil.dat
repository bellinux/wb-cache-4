The coatings are used to reduce friction and wear of the turbine engine <b>s</b> <b>foil</b> air bearings during startup and shut down when sliding occurs, prior {{to the formation of}} a lubricating air film. This testing supports NASA Glenn Research Center s effort to develop Oil-Free gas turbine aircraft propulsion systems, which will employ advanced foil air bearings and NASA s PS 304 high temperature solid lubricant to replace the ball bearings and lubricating oil found in conventional engines. Glenn s Oil-Free Turbomachinery team s current project is the demonstration of an Oil-Free business jet engine. In anticipation of future flight certification of Oil-Free aircraft engines, long-term endurance and durability tests are being conducted in a relevant gas turbine environment using the Capstone microturbine engine. By operating the engine now, valuable performance data for PS 304 shaft coatings and for industry <b>s</b> <b>foil</b> air bearings are being accumulated...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the field}} of {{composite}} manufacturing simulations, {{it is well known}} that the bending behavior of fabrics and prepregs has a significant influence on the drapeability and final geometry of a composite part. Due to sliding between reinforcements within a fabric, the bending properties cannot be determined from in-plane properties and a separate test is required. The Peirce cantilever test represents a popular way of determining the flexural rigidity for these materials, and is the preferred method in the ASTM D 1388 standard. This work illustrates the severe inaccuracies (up to 72 % error) in the current ASTM D 1388 standard as well as the original formulation by Peirce, caused by ignoring higher-order effects. A modified approach accounting for higher-order effects and yielding significantly improved accuracy is presented. The method is validated using finite element simulations and experimental testing. Since no independent tests other than the ASTM D 1388 standard are available to determine the bending stiffness of fabric materials, experimental validation is performed on an isotropic, homogeneous Upilex- 50 <b>S</b> <b>foil</b> for which the flexural rigidity and tensile stiffness are related. The flexural rigidity and elastic modulus are determined through both the cantilever test (ASTM D 1388) and tensile testing. The results show that the proposed method measures an elastic modulus close to that determined through tensile testing (within 1 %), while both the Peirce formulation (+ 18 %) and ASTM standard (+ 72 %) over-estimate the elastic modulus. The proposed methodology allows for a more accurate determination of flexural rigidity, and enables the more accurate simulation of composite forming processes...|$|E
40|$|Established writers whose {{reputation}} is affixed {{to a particular}} line of argument are typically ill disposed {{to change their minds}} in public. Some authors sincerely believe that the historical record vindicates them. Others are determined that the historical record will vindicate them. Still others ignore the historical record. Among students of totalitarianism, no one had more at stake reputationally than Hannah Arendt. It is not just that The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) established her as the premier thinker on its topic. It is also that totalitarianism, as she understood it, ribbons through all of her subsequent books, from the discussion of “the social” in The Human Condition (1958) to the analysis of thinking in the posthumously published The Life of the Mind (1978). How ready was she to adapt or to change entirely arguments she had first formulated as early as the mid-to-late 1940 s? “Stalinism in Retrospect,” her contribution to Columbia University 2 ̆ 7 s Seminar on Communism series, offers a rare opportunity to answer, at least partially, this question. Arendt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foil</b> was the publication of recent books on Stalin and the Stalin era by three Russian witnesses: Nadezhda Mandelstam, Roy Medvedev, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. According to Arendt, the books meshed with her own theoretical conception of Bolshevism while changing the “whole taste” of the period: they contained new insights into the nature of totalitarian criminality and evil. “Stalinism in Retrospect” documents Arendt 2 ̆ 7 s arguments and challenges to them by a number of the seminar 2 ̆ 7 s participants. Of particular note is the exchange between her and Zbigniew Brzezinski, an expert on the Soviet Union, a major interpreter of totalitarianism in his own right, and soon to be President Carter 2 ̆ 7 s National Security Advisor (January 1977 –January 1981). Notes by the editor, Peter Baehr, offer a critical context for understanding Arendt 2 ̆ 7 s argument...|$|E

40|$|Joint Soviet-American {{measurements}} of the neutron component of space radiation (SR) were carried out during the flight of the Soviet biosatellite Cosmos- 2044. Neutron flux densities and differential energy spectra were measured inside and on the external surface of the spacecraft. Three energy intervals were employed: thermal (En or = 1. 0 MeV) neutrons. The first two groups were measured with U. S. 6 LiF detectors, while fast neutrons were recorded both by U. <b>S.</b> fission <b>foils</b> and Soviet nuclear emulsions. Estimations were made of the contributions to absorbed and equivalent doses from each neutron energy interval and a correlation was presented between fast neutron fluxes, measured outside the satellite, and the phase of solar activity (SA). Average dose equivalent rates of 0. 018 and 0. 14 mrem d- 1 were measured for thermal and resonance neutrons, respectively, outside the spacecraft. The corresponding values for fast neutrons were 3. 3 (U. S.) and 1. 8 (U. S. S. R.) mrem d- 1. Inside the spacecraft, a value of 3. 5 mrem d- 1 was found...|$|R
40|$|Recently the leading-edge tubercles on the {{pectoral}} fins of humpback whales {{have attracted}} the attention of researchers who wish to exploit this feature in the design of turbine blades to improve the blade performance. The main objective of this paper is therefore to make a further investigation into this biomimetic design inspiration through a fundamental research study involving a hydrofoil section, which represents a straightened tidal turbine blade, with and without the leading-edge tubercles, using computational and experimental methods. Firstly a computational study was conducted to optimise the design of the leading-edge tubercles by using commercial CFD code, ANSYS-CFX. Based on this study the optimum tubercle configuration for a tidal turbine blade with <b>S</b> 814 <b>foil</b> cross-section was obtained and investigated further. A 3 D hydrofoil model, which represented a "straightened" tidal turbine blade, was manufactured and tested in the Emerson Cavitation Tunnel of Newcastle University to investigate the effect of various tubercle options on the lift and drag characteristics of the hydrofoil. The experiments involved taking force measurements using a 3 -component balance device and flow visualisation using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. These tests revealed that the leading-edge tubercles may have significant benefits on the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil in terms of an improved lift-to-drag ratio performance as well as reducing the tip vortex which is main cause of the undesirable end-effect of 3 D foils. The study explores further potential benefits of the application of leading-edge tubercles on tidal turbine blades...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of adsorption of polonium onto metal surfaces by spontaneous deposition has found {{applications in the}} analysis of environmental samples such as marine sediments, foodstuff, water, and tobacco since the 1960 <b>s.</b> Silver <b>foil</b> has been preferred by many scientists but can become quite expensive for routine analysis. Deposition onto copper was first proposed in the 1970 s, but has remained poorly studied. In the present study, the cost-effective and rapid optimum conditions necessary for the optimal recovery of Po from aqueous solutions during spontaneous deposition onto copper foils was evaluated while minimizing the deposition of Bi and Pb, which may interfere with subsequent analyses. A series of experiments was performed to determine adsorption yields for Po, Bi, and Pb to copper foils for a range of pH values from 1. 0 to 5. 5, with and without stable Bi and Pb carriers. Different methods for cleaning the copper foils were also compared. After initial measurements, Po, Bi, and Pb were desorbed from the disc in plating solutions without added activity. At higher pH values (3. 0 and 5. 5), less Bi was adsorbed to the copper foils, and subsequent desorption removed up to 99. 1 % of the plated Bi. The polonium yield remained fairly constant at all pH values and was unaffected by the desorption process. There was also no measureable increase in the polonium activity after 33 days, suggesting that Bi and Pb were not significantly co-deposited. All three cleaning methods performed well, whereas uncleaned foils in the same solution showed limited uptake. The use of copper foil under the optimum conditions described here could provide a valuable alternative to the use of silver in 210 Po analyses...|$|R

Comparison {{of the resulting}} conventional Nb pair potential and Eliashberg spectral function, (alpha) (2 ̆ 72) F((omega)), with those of proximity (PETS) analyses shows excellent agreement confirming the appropriateness and accuracy of the PETS analytic procedure. The PET methodology is further adapted to proximity systems employing Mg as the N-layer backed by Nb and Ta <b>foils</b> <b>S.</b> A detailed study of C-MgO(,x) -MgNb systems for Mg thicknesses ranging from 25 (ANGSTROM) to 1100 (ANGSTROM) and C-MgO(,x) -MgTa systems over a narrower thickness range shows anomalous thickness dependence for the junction conductance resulting from an increased scattering presence over that seen in Al Nb systems. As a result the Nb phonon contributions are completely damped for Mg thicknesses greater than 400 (ANGSTROM), allowing unimpeded determination of the Mg (alpha) (2 ̆ 72) F((omega)). The resulting Eliashberg spectral function reveals the electron-phonon coupling, (alpha) (2 ̆ 72) ((omega)), to be greatly reduced for transverse phonon frequencies relative to its longitudinal phonon value;In preface to the presentation of these studies, a detailed summary of the underlying theory and description of the experimental techniques and analytic methods are presented...|$|R
40|$|Since direct {{observation}} of the collision of asteroids in space is not always convenient for earthbound observers, we have undertaken simulations of these collisions using the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range (AVGR). To simulate the collision of asteroids in space, and aluminum projectiles with velocities ranging from approx. 1 to approx. 6 km/sec were fired at 70 g to approx. 200 g fragments of chondritic meteorites. The target meteorite was placed in an evacuated chamber at the AVGR. Detectors, usually four, were set up around the target meteorite. These detectors consisted of aerogel and aluminum foil of varying thickness. The aerogel's purpose was to catch debris after the collision, and the aluminum <b>foil.</b> <b>s</b> purpose was to show {{the size of the}} debris particles through the size of the holes in the aluminum foil. Outside the chamber, a camera was set up to record high-speed film of the collision. This camera recorded at either 500 frames per second or 1000 frames per second. Three different types of targets were used for these tests. The first were actual meteorites, which varied in mineralogical composition, density, and porosity. The second type of target was a Hawaiian basalt, consisting of olivine phenocrysts in a porous matrix, which we thought might be similar to the chondritic meteorites, thus providing data for comparison. The final type was made out of Styrofoam. The Styrofoam was thought to simulate very low-density asteroids and comets...|$|R
40|$|The {{mission of}} the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) Program is to {{minimize}} and, to the extent possible, eliminate the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in civilian nuclear applications by working to convert research and test reactors, as well as radioisotope production processes, to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel and targets. Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) is reviewing the design bases and key operating criteria including fuel operating parameters, enrichment-related safety analyses, fuel performance, and fuel fabrication in regard to converting the fuel of the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) from HEU to LEU. The {{purpose of this study}} is to validate Monte Carlo methods currently in use for conversion analyses. The methods have been validated for the prediction of flux values in the reactor target, reflector, and beam tubes, but this study focuses on the prediction of the power density profile in the core. A current 3 -D Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) model was modified to replicate the HFIR Critical Experiment 3 (HFIRCE- 3) core of 1965. In this experiment, the power profile was determined by counting the gamma activity at selected locations in the core. Foils (chunks of fuel meat and clad) were punched out of the fuel elements in HFIRCE- 3 following irradiation and experimental relative power densities were obtained by measuring the activity of these foils and comparing each <b>foil</b> <b>s</b> activity to the activity of a normalizing foil. The current work consisted of calculating corresponding activities by inserting volume tallies into the modified MCNP model to represent the punchings. The average fission density was calculated for each foil location and then normalized to the normalizing foil. Power distributions were obtained for the clean core (no poison in moderator and symmetrical rod position at 17. 5 inches) and fully poisoned-moderator (1. 35 g B/liter in moderator and rods fully withdrawn) conditions. The observed deviations between the experimental and calculated values for both conditions were within the reported experimental uncertainties except for some of the foils located on the top and bottom edges of the fuel plates...|$|R
40|$|U razdoblju od 16. do 26. kolovoza 2005. stručni tim Instituta za arheologiju obavio je pokusna arheološka istraživanja na položaju Kliškovac (Turski grad, Pavlovac) jugozapadno od općinskog središta - naselja Suhopolje, u Virovitičko-podravskoj županiji. Istraživanjem su otkriveni dijelovi slojevitosti groblja s kosturnim pokopavanjem pokojnika u redovima. Na površini od 29 m 2 otkriveno je 25 grobnih cjelina. Ukopane jedinke pripadaju, vjerojatno, srednjovjekovnoj populaciji iz još nepoznatog sela. Tragovi dvaju razina pokopavanja, uz otkriće dijela zida od objekta građenog od opeka, dokazuju opravdanost potrebe daljnjega sustavnoga arheološkog zahvata. Archaeological trial {{excavations}} on {{the site}} with the noteworthy toponym Kliškovac (Turski grad, Pavlovac) in Suhopolje, conducted from 16 to 26 August 2005, proved {{the existence of a}} multilayer burial graveyard arranged in rows. The graves are as a rule oriented west-east, i. e. with the heads of the deceased to the west. The graves indicate that several generations were buried one after another, i. e. vertical stratigraphy, but also horizontal stratigraphy. The excavations proved a great density of graves, 25 of them, on a relatively small surface of 29 m 2. This clearly proves a long duration of usage of the cemetery that up to the present was unknown, and that reflects the existence of a synchronous settlement, probably an assumed village. The finds of fragments of medieval pottery and several moveable finds (perforated coins, spurs) possibly prove the time at which the dead from a neighbouring village were buried there. The exact location of that village is not known at the moment, even though during former surveys of the surroundings of Kliškovac after farming activities the possible site was located. On the other hand, the traces of two levels of burials, proved also during the archaeological campaign of 2005, along with excavation of a part of a brick wall connected with mortar on the northern slope of the railway cutting (Fig. 6) speak in favour of further systematic archaeological excavations. It is highly probable that the medieval cemetery whose existence close to the centre of Suhopolje was confirmed had been organized at a certain point of time around a sacral structure. It seems that the existence of a church (klisa) is highly possible. The nearby toponym Pavlovac and the unearthed remains of structures indicate the location of a church, or of its remains. The oldest horizon of graves in the unearthed part of the cemetery has not been excavated yet, but according to the previous finds (jewellery artefacts, perforated coins) there are clear indicators that it is a Bjelo Brdo culture cemetery. Thus we are dealing with an early church cemetery (end of eleventh and beginning of twelfth centuries) suggesting long duration, i. e. utilization during several generations (see: site map of the cemetery). Along with horizontal stratigraphy the vertical stratigraphy of the cemetery is present as well. A total of 25 graves were unearthed, and 11 were excavated. After trial excavations, the trial trench was completely covered by plastic <b>foil</b> (<b>S</b> 1) at the excavation level, and to its cover, {{in order to be able}} to continue the work in 2006. Therefore, already the first archaeological trial dig, organized in 2005 at the Suhopolje−Kliškovac site, confirmed the existence of a church cemetery, which in turn proves the existence of a medieval village, whose name was forgotten over the course of history. Still the people recall its name in the toponyms Kliškovac and Turski grad, or Pavlovac, which also confirm a medieval origin. In the period from 2006 onward, systematic archaeological excavations are planned, financed commonly by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia, the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, Virovitica−Podravina County and the local authorities in the Suhopolje Municipality. This specific excavation shall contribute to an understanding of the character and size of the Suhopolje−Kliškovac site and correspondingly its presentation as an interesting and expressible part of the overall tourism product of the Suhopolje Municipality, Virovitica−Podravina County and Croatia...|$|R
