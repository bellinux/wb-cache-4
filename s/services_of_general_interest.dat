40|$|There is {{no single}} or common {{definition}} or even understanding of Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA). Generally, the concept {{is described as a}} method based on a multi-criteria scenario and indicator approached analysis which will provide information about the territorial impact of a policy. The conceptual background of TIA is focused on Territorial Cohesion (TC), which, in turn, also lacks a single definition. TC has a strong connection to <b>Services</b> <b>of</b> <b>General</b> <b>Interest</b> (SGI) as these services are a crucial element of the Cohesion Policy. Key elements of TC are social, economic and territorial cohesion stressing a spatial coverage as well as fair and universal access of SGI regardless which region you live in. As the definition of SGI is wide and vague, a clear classification of these services is difficult to be set. In this sense, a structured theoretical framework regarding SGI was developed within the ESPON project SeGI - Indicators and perspectives for <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> in territorial cohesion and development. This paper is a spin-off of the ESPON SeGI project and aims at discussing the applicability of territorial impact assessment on <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest.</b> The following four research questions are proposed to be answered: (1) how does TIA relate with SGI? (2) To what extend can TIA be applied for assessing SGI? (3) Should the territorial impact be differently assessed for different SGI? (4) Are there any external factors that make TIA difficult to use for assessing the territorial impact of SGI? Previous research and EU policy documents constitute the empirical material in this study. The analysis is focused on an ex ante evaluation of TIA and on the methodology of critical evaluation. The findings suggest a rather limited applicability as an undefined concept (TIA) is based on another undefined concept (TC) to measure the impact on a vaguely defined concept (SGI). Moreover, the particularities of each SGI may be related to economic and social changes that could be or not territorially reflected. So, using TIA for all <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> is difficult as various external factors interfere without having a territorial impact.

40|$|Before 1990, the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> (SeGI) in Romania {{were entirely}} {{provided}} by the public authorities. Afterwards, the market was gradually liberalized and the SeGI {{captured the attention of}} private operators. Nowadays, the business sector is involved next to the public authorities in offering <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> so as to respond citizens' expectations. The cooperation between the public authorities and the business sector is more developed in the area of SeGI that prove to be profitable, such as waste service and public transport, rather than services that need high investments in infrastructure, such as electricity, gas and water supply service. Starting from these overall considerations this paper addresses the legal and institutional issues generated by the organising and the provision of SeGI, with a particular emphasis on the territorial distribution of competences and the derived responsibilities. It takes into consideration the classification of competences associated to local authorities {{as a result of the}} decentralisation process, which are divided into exclusive, shared and delegated ones. Two territorial levels are considered, namely the counties - LAU 1 (the same as NUTS 3) and the localities (municipalities, towns and communes) 2 ̆ 013 LAU 2. The development regions (NUTS 2) are not considered as they are not administrative units and, consequently, do not have competences in the administration of the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest.</b> A series of drawbacks, inconsistencies are revealed followed by reflections on the solutions adopted by the authorities in favour of economic liberalisation and sustainable development of the local communities. They are derived from the Law of communitarian services of public utilities no. 51 / 2006, which is the main pillar of the policy framework for the public services in Romania. Thus, the public services in Romania could be provided by direct and indirect management. The latter might represent the solution that would directly support the cooperation between the local public administration authorities and the business sector and would indirectly generate the liberalization of <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest.</b> The paper is based on the research conducted under the auspices of the on-going ESPON project "Indicators and perspectives for <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> in territorial cohesion and development 2 ̆ 013 SeGI" (PS 1 - 16, No. 094 / 2011), in which Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies is one of the partners involved...|$|E

Therefore, the indicators can have different functions, from offering the possibility to describe a situation, to the ability to simplify and measure that same situation being, par excellence, a means of communication (HOERNIG and SEASONS, 2004, quoting Innes, 1990 and Hoernig, 2001). Their utility is crucial to a great variety of scientific studies, typically in spatial planning and cohesion analysis, therefore, it's in this way that they are used to study the <b>Services</b> <b>of</b> <b>General</b> <b>Interest</b> in the SeGI project (ESPON) 2 ̆ 013 Indicators and perspective for <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> in territorial cohesion and development. <b>Services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> are seen as "a key element in the European model of society" and are defined as 'market and non-market services which public authorities class as being of general interest and subject to specific public service obligations'. (EC: 2001 /C 17 / 04). This definition is too wide and a classification of 6 main domains (infrastructure, ICT Telecommunication, labor market, education, care services and social housing) was proposed. The Eurostat data for regional scale is very limited in number, availability and regional coverage. In this paper a literature review of more than 35 documents have been done in order to understand regional differentiation and the most effective indicators to evaluate the effects of <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>interest.</b> The analysis show common problems that emerges in EU level. A first aspect is related to differential accessibility to the SEGI. We find a territorial differentiation in the supply of SEGI for each of the domains, where different questions and thematic emerges. Linked to infrastructure domain, question that is highlighted in literature review points to: density, length and rate of use of motorways and railways lines, air traffic, but specially, accessibility to flights. In health theme, literature review points to the question of provision of services, namely in low density and rural areas. But more important is the social accessibility conditions, that depends on persons category and also to the continuity and quality of the services. Despite the difficulties with information availability, the discussion is need, in particular in the present context of crises and political changes conducting to privatization of social services.

40|$|Social {{rental housing}} {{is one of}} the {{possible}} instruments which are applied to ensure the satisfaction of housing needs. However, public funds which are transferred to entities that operate within this area should be usually classiﬁed as State aid. The analysis presented in this paper concerns the following question: is it possible to consider the operation of a social rental housing program as <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> economic <b>interest.</b> This question seems to be a topical issue because of a new legislative initiative aiming at establishing a governmental housing program that was implemented by the Act of 10 September 2015 which amended the Act on certain forms of supporting housing construction. The aforementioned program stipulates the legal frames for refundable and preferential ﬁnancing that may be granted to speciﬁc entities in order to realise investments in social rental housing. The governmental housing program complements earlier local housing policies in force. What is signiﬁcant is that the Polish legislator decided to qualify support granted as <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> economic <b>interest,</b> as referred to in Commission Decision 2012 / 21 /UE of 20 December 2011 on the Application of Article 106 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to State aid in the form <b>of</b> public <b>service</b> compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation <b>of</b> <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> economic <b>interest.</b> Applying Commission Decision 2012 / 21 /UE to this situation raises some doubts as to the lack of clarity of a term “social housing”.
