40|$|Abstract. Protein <b>spot</b> {{detection}} is {{an important}} step in gel image analysis. The results of <b>spot</b> detection may substantially influence gel image analysis. One of the most challenges of <b>spot</b> detection is separation of <b>spots</b> from complex region, where <b>spots</b> are overlapped and saturated. In this paper, we propose a <b>spot</b> detection algorithm which is capable of detection of <b>spots</b> from complex region. The proposed approach is realized by using European distance transform and centroid marker based watershed. Firstly, we apply a standard marker-controlled watershed algorithm to roughly segment the gel image into multiple regions. For those complex region containing several overlapped <b>spots,</b> we estimate <b>spot</b> centroids through a European distance transform. The estimated centroids are then served as <b>spot</b> markers in marker-controlled watershed algorithm to make a fine <b>spot</b> segmentation. Experimental results show the proposed method can obtain high detection performance in real gel images, and can accurately identify overlapped <b>spots</b> in complex region, when compared to other popular <b>spot</b> detection methods...|$|R

5|$|The few {{aircraft}} on the Japanese flight decks at {{the time}} of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of Sōryū, fighters being spotted to augment the Combat Air Patrol. <b>Spotting</b> his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes.

40|$|Objectives: Design and {{estimate}} {{the impacts of}} a prevention program for part 1 violent crimes in micro-place crime hot <b>spots.</b> Methods: A longitudinal study of crime hot <b>spots</b> using 21 years of crime offense report data on part 1 violent crimes from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Based on kernel density smoothing for a definition of micro-place crime hot <b>spots,</b> we replicate past work {{on the existence of}} “chronic” hot <b>spots,</b> but then with such hot <b>spots</b> accounted for introduce “temporary” hot <b>spots.</b> Results: Chronic hot <b>spots</b> are good targets for prevention. They are easily identified and they tend to persist. Temporary hot <b>spots,</b> however, predominantly last only one month. Thus the common practice of identifying hot <b>spots</b> using a short time window of crime data and assuming that the resulting hot <b>spots</b> will persist is ineffective for temporary hot <b>spots.</b> Instead it is necessary to forecast the emergence of temporary hot <b>spots</b> to prevent their crimes. Over time chronic hot <b>spots,</b> while still important, have accounted for less crime while temporary hot <b>spots</b> have grown, accounting for a larger share. Chronic hot <b>spots</b> are relatively easy targets for police whereas temporary hot <b>spots</b> require forecasting methods not commonly in use by police. Conclusions: The paper estimates approximately a 10 to 20 percent reduction in part 1 violent crimes in Pittsburgh if the hot <b>spot</b> enforcement program proposed in this paper were implemented...|$|R
