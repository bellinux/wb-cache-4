5|$|The {{vestibulocochlear nerve}} (VIII) splits into the {{vestibular}} and cochlear nerve. The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and {{is an important component}} of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal.</b> The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> are contracted, {{and they}} are highly curved. The semicircular system of MCCM-HUE-8741 shows also a basal morphology, because the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> do not attach to each other.|$|R
5000|$|Balance: Semicircular canals: angular {{acceleration}} of the endolymph in the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> stimulate the vestibular receptors of the endolymph. The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> of both inner ears act in concert to coordinate balance.|$|R
50|$|The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> or <b>semicircular</b> ducts {{are three}} semicircular, {{interconnected}} tubes {{located in the}} innermost part of each ear, the inner ear. The three canals are the horizontal, superior and posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E
25|$|In rare cases, the {{crystals}} themselves can {{adhere to a}} <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> cupula, rendering it heavier than the surrounding endolymph. Upon reorientation of the head relative to gravity, the cupula is weighted down by the dense particles, thereby inducing an immediate and sustained excitation of <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> afferent nerves. This condition is termed cupulolithiasis.|$|E
25|$|The Dix–Hallpike test is {{a common}} test {{performed}} by examiners {{to determine whether the}} posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> is involved. It involves a reorientation of the head to align the posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> (at its entrance to the ampulla) with the direction of gravity. This test will reproduce vertigo and nystagmus characteristic of posterior canal BPPV.|$|E
50|$|The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> {{are filled}} with endolymph, and also contain an inner {{membranous}} sleeve that form the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b> The canals also contain the crista ampullaris. The receptor cells located in the semicircular ducts are innervated by the eighth cranial nerve, the vestibulocochlear nerve (specifically the vestibular portion).|$|R

2500|$|The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> {{found within}} the {{vestibular}} apparatus, let us know when {{we are in a}} rotary (circular) motion. The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> are fluid-filled. Motion of the fluid tells us if we are moving. [...] The vestibule is the region of the inner ear where the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> converge, close to the cochlea (the hearing organ). The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. [...] This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).|$|R
25|$|Surgical {{trauma to}} the lateral <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> (LSC) is a rare {{complication}} which does not always result in cochlear damage. Vestibular symptoms are pronounced. Dizziness and instability usually persist for several months and sometimes {{for a year or}} more.|$|E
25|$|Brain fog {{and fatigue}} are both common SCDS {{symptoms}} and {{are caused by}} the brain having to spend an unusual amount of its energy on {{the simple act of}} keeping the body in a state of equilibrium when it is constantly receiving confusing signals from the dysfunctional <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{patients}} will report {{a history of}} vertigo {{as a result of}} fast head movements. Many patients are also capable of describing the exact head movements that provoke their vertigo. Purely horizontal nystagmus and symptoms of vertigo lasting more than one minute can also indicate BPPV occurring in the horizontal <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E

5000|$|There are six {{receptor}} organs {{located in}} the inner ear: cochlea, utricle, saccule, and the lateral, anterior, and posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b> The cochlea is a sensory organ with the primary purpose to aid in hearing. The utricle and saccule are sensors for detecting angular or linear acceleration, and the three <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> detect head rotation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> and otolith organs on respiration in humans. Based on animal studies, we hypothesized that vestibular activation would elicit a vestibulorespiratory reflex. To test this hypothesis respiratory measures, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during engagement of <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> and/or otolith organs. Dynamic upright pitch and roll (15 cycles/min), which activates the otolith organs and <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> increased respiratory rate (∆ 2 ± 1 and ∆ 3 + 1 breaths/min, respectively; P< 0. 05). Dynamic yaw and lateral pitch (15 cycles/min), which activates the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> increased respiration similarly (∆ 3 ± 1 and ∆ 2 ± 1, respectively; P< 0. 05). Dynamic chair rotation (15 cycles/min), which mimics dynamic yaw but eliminates neck muscle afferent, increased respiration (∆ 3 ± 1; P< 0. 05) comparable to dynamic yaw (15 cycles/min). Increases in respiratory rate were graded as greater responses occurred during upright (∆ 5 ± 2 breaths/min) and lateral pitch (∆ 4 ± 1) and roll (∆ 5 ± 1) performed at 30 cycles/min. Increases in breathing frequency resulted in increases in minute ventilation during most interventions. Static head-down rotation, which activates otolith organs, did not alter respiratory rate (∆ 1 ± 1 breaths/min). Collectively, these data indicate that <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> but not otolith organs or neck muscle afferents, mediate increased ventilation in humans and support the concept that vestibular activation alters respiration in humans. Key words: respiratory, ventilation, otolith organs, <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> neck afferent...|$|R
25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} (BPPV) {{is the most}} common vestibular disorder and occurs when loose calcium carbonate debris has broken off of the otoconial membrane and enters a <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> thereby creating the sensation of motion. Patients with BPPV may experience brief periods of vertigo, usually under a minute, which occur with change in position.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral vestibulopathy – a {{condition}} involving loss of inner ear balance function in both ears. This {{may be caused}} by certain antibiotics, anti-cancer, and other drugs or by chemicals such as solvents, heavy metals, etc., which are ototoxic; or by diseases such as syphilis or autoimmune disease; or other causes. In addition, the function of the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> can be temporarily affected by a number of medications or combinations of medications.|$|E
25|$|According {{to current}} research, in {{approximately}} 2.5% {{of the general}} population the bones of the head develop to only 60–70% of their normal thickness in the months following birth. This genetic predisposition may explain why the section of temporal bone separating the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> from the cranial cavity, normally 0.8mm thick, shows a thickness of only 0.5mm, making it more fragile and susceptible to damage through physical head trauma or from slow erosion. An explanation for this erosion of the bone has not yet been found.|$|E

50|$|Across species, the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> of agile {{animals have}} larger arcs {{than those of}} slower ones. For example, the rapid leaper Tarsius bancanus has <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> {{much bigger than the}} slow-climbing Nycticebus coucang. The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> of brachiating gibbons are bigger than those of {{arboreal}} and terrestrial quadrupedal great apes. As a rule of thumb, arc size of the ducts decreases with body mass and consequently slower angular head motions. Arc size increases with greater agility and thus more rapid head motions. Modern humans have bigger arcs on their anterior and posterior canals, which reflect greater angular motion along the sagittal plane. The lateral canal has a smaller arc size, corresponding to reduced head movement from side to side.|$|R
50|$|The {{vestibular}} system {{consists of}} the otolith organs and the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b> Illusions in aviation are caused when the brain cannot reconcile the vestibular and visual inputs. The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> {{of which there are}} three recognizing accelerations in pitch, yaw, and roll, are stimulated by angular accelerations; the otolith organs, the saccule and utricle, are stimulated by linear accelerations. Stimulation of the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> occurs when movement of the endolymph inside the canals causes movement of the crista ampullaris and the hair cells within them. Stimulation of the otolith organs occurs when gravitational forces or linear accelerations cause movement of the otolith membrane, the otoliths, and the hair cells of the macula.|$|R
25|$|Once diagnosed, {{the gap in}} the {{temporal}} bone can be repaired by surgical resurfacing of the affected bone or plugging of the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal.</b> These techniques are performed by accessing the site of the dehiscence either via a middle fossa craniotomy or via a canal drilled through the transmastoid bone behind the affected ear. Bone cement has been the material most often used, in spite of its tendency to slippage and resorption, and a consequent high failure rate; recently, soft tissue grafts have been substituted.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.|$|E
25|$|The braincase of Protoavis {{is similar}} in some respects to Troodon, with an {{enlarged}} cerebellum that shifted the optic lobes ventrolaterally, and also has a large floccular lobe. The inner ear is also pretty similar and bird-like in both taxa. The canalicular systems and the cochlear process differ in both taxa, and the vestibular region is relatively small and located in a ventral position {{to most of the}} anterior and posterior semicircular canals. The anterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> is significantly longer than the others, and the cochlear process is a relatively long, vertically oriented tube. However, Protoavis is also remarkedly non-bird like in that it possess only a single exit for the trigeminal. However, these characters are not robust enough to identify Protoavis as a bird.|$|E

5000|$|Concerning hearing, Lussana {{argues that}} {{auditory}} vertigo, a disorder of {{the movements of}} the head and body, is due to a lesion of the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> because the victim cannot perceive the direction of sounds ("The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> and the vertigo of Meniere", Naples 1891). As for flavors, Lussana notes that the bitter taste is perceived {{on the back of the}} tongue, sweet on the tip, sour and salty at its edges ("innervation of taste".) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{roll test}} can {{determine}} whether the horizontal <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> is involved. The roll test requires the patient {{to be in a}} supine position with their head in 30° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, and checks for vertigo and nystagmus. This is followed by gently bringing the head back to the starting position. The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side, and checks again for vertigo and nystagmus. In this roll test, the patient may experience vertigo and nystagmus on both sides, but rotating towards the affected side will trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated towards the affected side, the nystagmus will beat towards the ground and be more intense.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal.</b> Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E
