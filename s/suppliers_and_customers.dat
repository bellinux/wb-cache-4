Design/methodology/approach - The study used structural equation modelling to analyze empirical survey data from 251 manufacturers in Hong Kong. Findings - The study found that modular design, product innovation, and internal coordination are positively correlated with the <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> involvement. Such involvement and product innovation lead to better new product performance. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to the use of cross-sectional data and a single key informant approach, and the industry structure of the sampled industries. Practical implications - The study examines the contextual factors of <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> involvement <b>and</b> how such involvement relates to new product development with new empirical evidence. The study not only provides new empirical evidence to support the importance of supply chain management in product development, but also extends existing literature to identify new contextual factors for such involvement. Originality/value - The study re-examines generalized beliefs about <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> involvement in new product development, and extends prior studies of the contextual dimensions of product modularity, product innovativeness, and internal coordination on such involvement in an empirical way...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper explores <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> {{value from}} an {{organisational}} strategic management view and considers how the measurement <b>and</b> management of <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> value contributes to organisational value. Its {{objective is to}} highlight how the valuation of organisations can be improved for management decision-making purposes by the incorporating the measurement of <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> value into an organisational value model. Approach - This is a conceptual paper based on an analysis of relevant literature, the concept of strategybased value, the organisational value attributes identified by Feltham & Ohlson (1995 & 1996), and the presentation of arguments to develop an enriched organisational value model. Findings - The Feltham & Ohlson (F-O) value factors are examined in terms of potential ways in which strategically-oriented management accounting information such as <b>customer</b> <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> cost, profit <b>and</b> Iifecycle value might {{improve the quality of}} information relating organisational value. This provides a measure of outcomes relating to not only organisational value but suppler <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> value, <b>and</b> allows the development of an internally focused enrichment of the Feltham & Ohlson model. Practical implications - The arguments presented and resulting re-conceptuaIisation of an organisation value model to include <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> value measures improves managers understanding of the controls and decision-making information required to manage organisational outcomes so they can mitigate or manage the costs of organisational failure.

Factors such as global climate change and environmental degradation; the depletion of natural resources; and the increasing recognition of the corporation’s role as an agent of economic and social change stimulated the interest in the performance of sustainability. Sequentially, these ‘sustainability’ issues are started to be appreciated as affecting a company’s investment value, it risk profile and its future assets and liabilities. It was suggested that one of the ways to support environmental sustainability is through environmental collaboration between firms <b>and</b> it <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customers</b> or in other words, <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> integration. This paper aims to provide empirical evidence on the influence of <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> integration on environmental sustainability performance. With the purpose of obtaining information needed, a survey was conducted on ISO 14001 certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Data from 107 companies were received and analyzed by correlation and regression analysis. Based on the results of data analysis, the variables were verified to have statistical significant associations with environmental sustainable performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that <b>supplier</b> integration <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> integration are strong predictors on environmental sustainable performance among MS ISO 14001 certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia.

40|$|Organisations {{around the}} world are today looking for new {{approaches}} to maintain or develop competitive advantages, reduce costs, free-up capital and improve quality and service. The traditional customer-supplier relation is characterised by the parties focusing on their own cost reduction, creating win-loose scenarios. Companies today are starting to develop their customer-supplier relations towards more relation-focused approaches. The systems approach is a basis for creating win-win relations between the system components. A win-win relation is looked upon in this thesis as the mutual efforts by <b>customer</b> <b>and</b> <b>supplier</b> in finding <b>and</b> reducing the effect of factors that are causing costs and losses for both <b>customer</b> <b>and</b> <b>supplier.</b> The thesis describes a suggested model for estimating win-win potential for <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> in a maintenance contract regarding civil jet engines. The model is defined as consisting of core values, techniques, and tools for estimating win-win potential. The model is applied in <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> <b>customer</b> scenario.
