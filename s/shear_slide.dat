Shear strength of the intact rock and fractures was estimated from laboratory tests and back-analyses of previous slope failures.

Equal-area stereoplots were used to analyze geological structure data to differentiate structural domains with similar structural characteristics within the final slope. A kinematic analysis was performed for each structural domain using average joint set orientations and major discontinuities projected onto the final slope.

30|$|Interface {{strength}} {{is one of}} the primary factors determining fiber’s reinforcing effect based on the mixing law of composite materials (Wo 2000). Fibers are uniformly dispersed in the asphalt, and their large surface areas could form an interface with asphalt. The acidic resin component in asphalt is a surface-active substance, and its adsorption onto the fiber’s surface, and the physical and the chemical bond effects made some asphalt components be distributed as a monolayer on the fiber surface, forming a strongly binding “fiber–asphalt” interface layer. The adhesive property of the “fiber–asphalt” was stronger than that of the discrete asphalt outside of the interface layer, leading to an improvement of the asphalt mortar. The interfacial properties of fiber-modified asphalt depend on the molecular distribution, the chemical properties of the fiber, and the molecular structure and chemical composition of asphalt. The main role of the fiber–asphalt interface is to connect the two phases, and to pass and buffer the stress between them. The fiber–asphalt interface {{plays a key role in}} the physical and mechanical properties of fiber-modified asphalt mastic material. Damage to AC material can occur at the interface, such as the pullout of fiber from the asphalt binder, and <b>shear</b> <b>slide</b> at the aggregate surface. Fiber’s adsorption of asphalt can increase asphalt’s viscosity and improve interface adhesion between asphalt and fiber or aggregate. Moreover, the increased fiber–asphalt interface adhesion improves the anti-cracking strength of AC mixture (Putman and Amirkhanian 2004).|$|E
40|$|The {{undisturbed}} Shirasu {{belongs to}} a none or weakly welded part of pyroclastic pumice-flow soil widely distributed in southern Kyushu and is counted to be an unusual soil for its frequent damages owing to rainfalls and earthquakes. As its original ground is of property like a weak rock, no rotational <b>shear</b> <b>slide</b> ever occurs in fact in the cut-off and natural Shirasu slopes. On the other hand, this soil is extremely erosive against water flow and the nearly vertical cut-off slope has traditionally been adopted. However a few kinds of local damages were unavoidable in the slope besides the tensile failures inevitably cause even at the ordinary time. This paper reports, after made clear the elastic characteristics of undisturbed Shirasu material, the elastic analysis for various cut-off slopes {{on the basis of}} the classification of original ground Shirasu (JSF standard : M 2 - 81), which has been proposed by JSSMFE in 1979. These analyses were carried out by the finite element method, assuming that the Shirasu material is an isotropic and homogeneous elastic body. The discussions were made from the view point of tensile failure of slope, and the following findings were obtained; 1) The tensile stress occured in the slope increases both with an increse of slope angle and with a decrease of hardness of Shirasu. 2) In the steep slope of θ> 60 °, the local tensile failure occurs, when the slope is higher than the non-cracking critical height, leading to the dormant cause to the slope failure. 3) The cut-off slope especially for the soft and semi-hard Shirasu should be designed in a type of comparatively moderate slope. 4) The author showed the relationship between the critical height of comparatively steep slope and the hardness of Shirasu. 5) When the steep slope is forced to be adopted for the hard Shirasu and welded tuff, it is desirable to cut the shoulder part for the purpose of the reduction of tensile stress...|$|E

40|$|Functionally graded, {{multilayer}} coatings {{consisting of}} alternating TiN/TiSiN layers were synthesized {{in an attempt}} to overcome the innate brittleness of TiSiN nanocomposite coatings, whilst maintaining high hardness. These coatings exhibited key structural characteristics that are known to render many naturally occurring materials extremely hard and robust. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> of columnar TiN grains played a vital role in controlling the inelastic deformation of these coatings, conferring a greater resistance to contact damage. Moreover, nanoindentation experiments showed that the multilayer coatings exhibited high hardness, attributed to the strong shear resistance offered by the hard TiSiN layers. A dependence of coating hardness upon indentation penetration depth (h t) was found to be proportional to 1 /√h t, according to a mechanistically based model, from which the shear stress was determined. The energy dissipation during indentation was also quantified to show the critical role of the shear stress, regulated by the thickness of TiSiN layers, in resisting contact damage in the coatings. Finite-element models were constructed and the presence of transgranular cracks in the monolithic TiSiN coating was clarified based upon experimental observations. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that the transition of the dominant deformation mechanism from brittle transgranular cracking to intergranular <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> was controlled by the microstructural characteristics of the coatings.

40|$|Two {{interfacial}} failure modes, <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> and buckling, of graphene on {{a flexible}} substrate subjected to uniaxial compression are investigated. The <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> {{starts at the}} edge region, and buckling starts at the middle region of graphene. Using shear-lag cohesive zone models and finite element (FE) simulations, the critical strain and maximum strain of graphene are predicted for the interfacial sliding failure. Then, the critical strain for the onset of buckling is derived via the theory of continuum mechanics with the van der Waals (vdW) interaction between graphene and the substrate surface taken into consideration. By comparison of the two critical failure strains and maximum strain of graphene, {{it is found that}} there exists a critical length of graphene. As the graphene length is larger than it, interfacial failure goes through four stages of development with increasing loading, including sliding and buckling. Conversely, the buckling of graphene will not occur.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{based on the}} rigid, perfectly plastic material idealization is proposed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of two deformable beams colliding with each other. The mid-point of a moving free-free beam is assumed to impinge {{on the tip of}} a cantilever beam with the beam axes perpendicular to each other. Complete solutions are obtained for various deformation mechanisms during the dynamic response process for the two deformed beams, and plastic <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> is taken into account. Attention is focused on the partitioning of the input energy between the two deformed beams after impact. A deformation map in a governing parameter plane is constructed to permit the calculation of the energy partitioning for a range of the beams' parameters. This consists of nine regions corresponding to various deformation mechanisms. Typical numerical results are presented to demonstrate the influence of structural and geometrical parameters such as the ratios of the fully plastic bending moments of the two beams, of their fully plastic shear forces, of their masses per unit length and their length, on the energy partitioning after impact. Finally, the severance limit is given for the case of both beams having rectangular cross-sections. This indicates that <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> failure may happen in either of the beams if the initial kinetic energy is sufficiently large. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As indicated by experiments, the in-plane response of masonry walls depends mainly on their failure mechanism. In the case of low vertical load and/or poor quality mortar, seismic loads cause shearing of the wall in two parts and sliding of the upper part on the other part. The mechanism is called <b>sliding</b> <b>shear</b> failure. The in-plane response of masonry walls failing in <b>sliding</b> <b>shear</b> mode is very stable and close to an elastic, perfectly plastic response with high energy dissipation and displacement capacity.

40|$|Articulation (<b>shear</b> and <b>sliding)</b> {{has been}} {{increasingly}} studied {{during the last}} two decades with the realization of its substantial involvement in daily locomotion of the human knee joint. Conventional biological responses of mechanical stimulation on chondrocyte viability has been studied for shear and sliding; but in addition, the close relationship between articulation and lubrication has emphasized the importance of cell-mediated expression of the key boundary lubricating protein proteoglycan 4 (PRG 4). While, in the absent of lubrication, <b>shear</b> and <b>sliding</b> between abnormal congruency between joint surfaces can initiate spatially-varied early degeneration, both instantly by direct mechanical damage of the cartilage and through time by mechanobiology. Thus, the overall motivation of this dissertation was to understand the effect of articulation (<b>shear</b> and <b>sliding)</b> on maintaining joint health as well as causing early or progressed degeneration in human articular cartilage. Spatially-oriented histopathological features were identified in cartilage lesions of human knee medial femoral condyles (MFCs) using a standardized, reliable grading system developed from primary literature, supporting the concept of mechanical articulation-driven cartilage deterioration. To recapitulate in vivo effects of articulation on human articular cartilage, human cartilage explants were subjected to mid to high amplitudes of articulation that can potentially stimulate chondrocyte response and cause matrix damage. Although articulation on cartilage explants induced superficial zone cell death and apoptosis (regardless of aging), only young and not old cartilage responded by secreting higher levels of PRG 4 lubricant and continuously expressed enhanced levels of autophagy. However, the articulation regime applied in the absence of lubrication was insufficient to generate noticeable wear at the cartilage surface. Elucidating the mechanobiology of early degeneration in human articular cartilage by assessing the effects of articulation (<b>shear</b> and <b>sliding)</b> on SZ chondrocyte response and the initiation of matrix damage is one step towards a systems-based understanding of synovial joint homeostasis and derangement in health, aging, and disease. Furthermore, understanding the mechanobiological environments that can initiate cartilage degeneration can be critical to the development of preventive therapies for osteoarthritis...|$|R

In addition, constant load, rather than indentation depth, has been used when mapping the mechanical properties of enamel. In this work, tooth specimens are prepared under hydrated conditions and their stiffnesses are measured by depth control across the thickness of enamel.

Hardness exhibits odd-even alternation, with the odd acids being softer and the even ones harder; the differences decrease with increasing chain length. These variations are similar to those seen for other mechanical, physical, and thermal properties of these diacids. The softness of odd acids is rationalized due to strained molecular conformations in them, which facilitate easier plastic deformation. Relationships between structural features, such as interplanar spacing, interlayer separation distance, molecular chain length, and signatures of the nanoindentation responses, namely, discrete displacement bursts, were also examined. <b>Shear</b> <b>sliding</b> of molecular layers past each other during indentation is key to the mechanism for plastic deformation in these organic crystals...|$|R

The experimental part of the research program includes tests of two large-scale shear wall specimens under inelastic load reversals. The walls were 1500 mm high and 100 mm thick, and had either 2000 mm or 1500 mm lengths, producing aspect ratios of 0. 75 and 1. 0. The effect of aspect ratio on <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> and failure modes {{was one of the}} major test parameters. The results indicated that both walls were able to develop flexural yielding and failed in crushing of diagonal struts. Little or no strength decay was observed up to approximately 0. 92 % and 1. 83 % lateral drift in walls with aspect ratios of 0. 75 and 1. 0, respectively. <b>Shear</b> <b>sliding</b> was limited to approximately 10 % of total lateral displacement, prior to the onset of strength degradation, indicating no premature failure caused by this mechanism. The deformation components indicate that flexure and shear were equally important in these walls, and formed approximately 80 % of total lateral displacement. A new analysis procedure was developed as part of the analytical investigation. The procedure can be used for strength and deformation computations for low-rise shear walls with aspect ratios of 1. 0 or less. It is based on equilibrium, compatibility, and material models. Potential failure planes are first identified and analyses of wall sections are carried out. One of the potential failure planes is the horizontal wall section at the base, and is critical against flexure. A standard plane section analysis is conducted at this section.

An inclined section analysis is conducted along this section based on experimentally observed strain variation. Diagonal compression in inclined concrete strut is checked against crushing. The strain condition computed from the inclined section analysis provide sufficient information to establish shear force-shear deformation relationship.

A new microstructural elasto-viscoplastic model was developed, based on the granular mechanics approach and the overstress theory of Perzyna. The deformation of a representative volume of the material is generated by mobilizing particle contacts. Thus, the stress-strain relationship can be derived as an average of the mobilization on these local contact planes. The local behavior is assumed to follow a Hertz-Mindlin’s elastic law, a Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion for <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> and a cone-shaped yield function for normal compression. Only a few triaxial tests, with a stage of isotropic consolidation followed with an undrained shearing up to failure at critical state, are required to calibrate the model parameters.

A transformation from a columnar-grained structure, in the binary compound, to a nanocomposite structure, consisting of CrN nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix, was observed in the coating having a Si content of 28. 5 at. %. The columnar-structured coatings were observed to deform by grain boundary <b>shear</b> <b>sliding,</b> whilst cracks occurred in nanocomposite coatings. Moreover, the coating having a Si content of 14. 3 at. % exhibited the highest hardness {{as a result of}} grain boundary strengthening facilitated by Si 3 N 4 segregation, together with solid solution strengthening of Si in CrN, the Hall-Petch effect for the finer CrN grains and a high compressive residual stress. A further increase of Si content to 28. 5 at. % led to a reduction in hardness due to the high volume fraction of the amorphous phase, together with the presence of cracks in the as-deposited coating. The findings provide deeper insight into the origin of the mechanical behaviour of CrSiN coatings...|$|R
40|$|Interfacial {{mechanics}} between graphene and substrate such as {{friction and}} adhesion plays {{a critical role}} in the morphology and functionality of graphene-based devices. Here I will present the interface sliding and buckling of monolayer graphene on a stretchable substrate. The nonlinear mechanical response of monolayer graphene on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is characterized using in-situ Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Although interfacial stress transfer leads to tension in graphene as the PET substrate is stretched, retraction of the substrate during unloading imposes compression in the graphene. Two interfacial failure mechanisms, <b>shear</b> <b>sliding</b> under tension and buckling under compression, are identifi ed. Using a nonlinear shear-lag model, the inter-facial shear strength is found to range between 0. 46 and 0. 69 MPa. The critical strain for onset of interfacial sliding is ~ 0. 3 %, whereas the maximum strain that can be transferred to graphene ranges from 1. 2 % to 1. 6 % depending on the interfacial shear strength and graphene size. Beyond a critical compressive strain of ~- 0. 7 %, buckling ridg-es are observed after unloading. In addition, I will present adhesion measurement using atomic force microscope...|$|R
