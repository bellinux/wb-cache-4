5|$|The {{film was}} chosen among 15 debut {{works for the}} 2006 Berlin Film Festival. It {{received}} enthusiastic reception from the audience as it ran to packed houses to the Chopra's surprise. Expecting an audience of about 100 Westerners, a critic visiting the festival was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the cinema hall full and people jostling for seats even on the steps.|$|E
5|$|Sameer makes {{another attempt}} to apologise. When he goes to Rani's house, he is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Suraj; Suraj is Rani's uncle, who now knows that he loves her.

5|$|The {{group were}} <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how small and {{technically}} basic the studio was, {{with only one}} microphone in {{the centre of the}} room. Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) {{to cover the cost of}} transferring the tape recording to acetate disc. As this was too expensive, Phillips said that for a cut-rate price they would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl.|$|E
30|$|It {{is also no}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that the}} MLE reduces to BLUE, which is often applied in {{centralized}} estimation [14], where the FC can obtain all raw observations of the sensors.|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't {{you tell}} me why you have come to England?" [...] she said. [...] "It was such a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you. I thought that you loved Paris and your work so much." ...|$|R
60|$|Turning to {{face this}} new danger, she was startled into a little cry of <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the head and {{shoulders}} of the mucker framed in the broken square of the half-demolished window.|$|R
5|$|Homer signs {{his family}} {{up for the}} show. Marge is traded to a nice, easygoing man named Charles Heathbar and his perfect son, while Homer gets Charles' strict wife Verity. Charles {{seems to be a}} husband who dislikes his wife and is {{constantly}} told by her what to do, so he is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Marge is understanding and kind. As Marge enjoys her time with Charles, he begins to develop an infatuation for her. Meanwhile, Homer, Bart, and Lisa are having major troubles with Verity, who disciplines them and objects to everything they do.|$|E
5|$|Kelsey wanders {{from the}} tour and {{attempts}} to phone Maria, but disturbs an unknown beast, the Bane Mother, to the annoyance of the staff, to which Wormwood orders the alarms switched off and Sarah Jane killed. Maria attempts to phone Kelsey, but sets off the alarms again, causing the Archetype to escape, transferring the focus upon him. Maria, while escaping, encounters him, who just mimics her, and they escape into a women's bathroom. Sarah Jane then enters, and although they are <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other, they manage to escape the factory, albeit without Kelsey. When they arrive back on Bannerman Road, Sarah warns Maria not to get involved as her life is too dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{attends a}} lecture at MIT, where the {{testimony}} of Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), an alien abductee, is being presented. Mulder argues against {{other members of the}} lecture over the existence of alien life, claiming that it is a lie created to cover up a program of medical experimentation on civilians run by the military industrial complex. When the lecture ends, Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber, who is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Mulder has lost his belief in alien life since the last time they met. Werber tells Mulder that he is Cassandra's doctor, and asks him to visit her.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: La Silla {{is in the}} Southern {{outskirts}} of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth, it {{may come as a}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> cloud formations result of the Peruvian Humboldt Current.|$|R
60|$|Gradually, as if unconsciously, {{she drew}} near to him, {{and when she}} lifted her head, after stooping to pick some chimney-sweeps, little grass flowers, she laughed with a slight <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him so near.|$|R
60|$|He pondered a moment, then {{climbed up}} in front of Mescal, and {{directed}} the gray out upon the valley. Soon he was among the grazing cattle. He felt no <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the H brand on their flanks.|$|R
5|$|Picard is irritated {{that the}} stellar {{cartography}} department has shut down several systems on the Enterprise, and visits the section {{to discover what}} is going on. He meets {{the head of the}} department, Lt. Commander Nella Daren, who makes an impression on Picard. It is a meeting memorable enough to later discuss with Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). At a musical recital by Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Picard is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Daren, once again, playing the piano. The two discuss music, and later meet in Picard's quarters and participate in a duet. Daren plays a portable piano and Picard performs on his Ressikan flute.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks back-line {{formation}} {{was also}} {{different from that}} in Britain. They played two five-eighths, a position invented in New Zealand, that refers to the player between the half-back and three-quarters. These two five-eighths gave the All Blacks a defensive advantage. The British press were also <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> All Blacks fullback Billy Wallace attacking so often—They had generally viewed the fullback as a defensive position. The All Blacks also thought that every player, whether a back or a forward, should make themselves available to take a pass in support of an attacking player. The teams they encountered had forwards that understood their main role of winning possession for their backs, but would not support them when attacking.|$|E
5|$|The {{two people}} fencing {{take off their}} masks, which reveal them to be Madonna and her doppelgänger <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is {{mirrored}} in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different artifacts from the Bond films {{are present in the}} room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an electric chair.|$|E
60|$|But when Mark {{hastened to}} congratulate him, {{what was his}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the poor fellow clasp his hands and raise them to Heaven, while an {{expression}} of pain--very different from that resulting from physical suffering--convulsed his features.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{a private}} trough," [...] exclaimed a thin voice, high like a peewit's cry. We started in <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a tall, black-bearded man {{looking at us}} and away from us nervously, fidgeting uneasily some ten yards off.|$|R
50|$|This team, which {{included}} the attacking talents of John Seasman, Tony Towner, Rodney Fern and Ronnie Moore could not maintain this level of performance, however, although it {{was something of a}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them relegated again the very next year.|$|R
5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|At Will and Grace's apartment, Will and Val play Pyramid against Will's friends Ellen (Leigh-Allyn Baker) and Rob (Tom Gallop). Grace, {{who comes}} home, is shocked when her Pyramid record with Will—2 minutes and 14 seconds—is {{the same as}} Will and Val's. Before leaving, Grace is horrified that Will called her Val. While at her office, Grace learns that Will is sick. She goes home to attend to him and is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Val there. Grace tells her that since she is home that Val can go. Val, however, does not leave. This results in the two fighting. The fight, however, is broken by Will and tells them to work the {{situation}} out. Grace admits she felt jealous of Val as she believed Val had replaced her, due to her not being there for Will. Will, however, reassures Grace {{that no one can}} replace her as his best friend. As a result, Grace and Val make up.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Raglan wished to {{reinforce}} the Turks and British infantry, and ordered Lucan to detach {{four of the five}} Heavy Brigade cavalry regiments and send them to the defensive line. This further angered Lucan, since splitting the force in half merely reduced the cavalry's overall effectiveness, but he again complied. The result was that the first fork of the Russian cavalry attack encountered The Thin Red Line and were driven off, while the second fork, crossing the heights above the plain, encountered four regiments of the Heavy Brigade. The Russians – with between 1,500 and 2,000 men – were initially <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the 800 British cavalry approaching, allowing Scarlett, the commander of the Heavy Brigades, to charge the Russians uphill. By this point Lucan had left Lord Cardigan in charge of the Light Brigade and raced over to the Heavies, later claiming that his duty trumpeter had ordered the British charge, which eventually forced the Russians to flee.|$|E
5000|$|Mark Bereford from The Music said [...] "Given {{the musical}} style of Diesel and the {{universal}} adoration {{for many of}} the original songs filling Americana, it's a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it fall.". He did complement the track [...] "Rag Mama Rag".|$|R
60|$|Early {{the next}} morning one of Jane's women brought in word that Judkins wished to speak to her. She hurried out, and in her <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him armed with rifle and revolver, she forgot her {{intention}} to inquire about his wound.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{delightful}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you, Mrs. Gould. I've just come down. Usual luck. Missed everything, of course. This show is just over, and I hear {{there has been}} a great dance at Don Juste Lopez's last night. Is it true?" ...|$|R
5|$|Eventually, {{during a}} date at the bowling alley, Burns decides to ask Gloria to marry him. She says yes. As Burns {{goes off to}} get some {{champagne}} to celebrate, Snake comes to rob the bowling alley, and is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Gloria, who {{turns out to be}} his ex-girlfriend. Despite Gloria's protests, Snake kidnaps her and Homer. When Burns finds Gloria's ring, dropped in the commotion, he assumes she ran off with Homer. Snake takes Gloria and Homer to his hideout. Though Gloria says she loves Burns, Snake vows he can change. The police arrive and confront Snake. Homer tries to escape but instead sets Snake's house on fire.

5|$|In 2012, he starred {{alongside}} Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a {{drama about}} a drug addict mother (Leo) and her piano prodigy son (Eisenberg), and in the magical realist romantic comedy To Rome with Love, directed by Woody Allen. That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that his face was prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E
5|$|In early December 1808, Topaze {{departed}} Brest and travelled {{across the}} Atlantic, encountering the British frigate HMS Loire in the Bay of Biscay. Loire fired on Topaze, {{but was unable}} to catch her and, despite minor damage, the French ship was able to reach the Caribbean without further incident. Nearing Cayenne on 13 January 1809, Lahalle was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the small British ship HMS Confiance emerge from the harbour and manoeuvre threateningly towards his ship. Realising that Cayenne was in British hands, he turned and sailed northwards, concerned that stronger British forces might be nearby. In fact Confiance was the only British ship in the vicinity and she was severely underarmed, with a crew of just 47 men, including 20 local inhabitants recruited on the spot. The colony had been captured just three days earlier by a combined British and Portuguese expeditionary force under Captain James Lucas Yeo.|$|E
30|$|The reader may <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a {{significant}} high fidelity simulation {{time for the}} small case study presented here; the reason for this, at least partially, is that our implementation is not generally efficient compared to commercial simulators which utilize efficient solvers particularly linear solvers.|$|R
5000|$|Slaves were chattel {{and so it}} is no <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that they}} were on {{occasion}} branded like cattle in life and in art. Another sign of slavery, less obvious and much less gruesome, was the cropped pony tail or topknot which marked an enslaved Turk in the galleys.|$|R
50|$|Honda was {{the biggest}} {{disappointment}} of the rally, showing it is still far from KTM. The difference between Mini and the new Peugeot was huge, and the best Toyotas ever, are still away from its competitors. After dominating the last Dakar last races, it was a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Kamaz {{so far from the}} lead.|$|R

Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe house because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.|$|E

Kills is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that he has left and gets angry after realizing that she was robbed. During the 1970s exploitation film-inspired fifth episode, a victim of Kills denounces her to a detective, revealing that she left him in a desert. In the following episode, Kills runs over the man who robbed her two episodes earlier, with her convertible, and retrieves her passport.

Shiva and his men defeat Parashuram, and to his surprise comes {{to know that he}} is a Vasudev, the group of scholars who have been guiding him on his journey. Parashuram is also <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Shiva as the fabled Neelkanth; in remorse for his actions, he severs his left hand. He gives the recipe of the medicine to the people of Branga and leaves for Kashi with Shiva. At Kashi, Shiva is introduced to Ganesh and Kali by Sati. Shiva recognizes Ganesh as the Naga who tried to attack on Sati and as the killer of Brahaspati. Severely angered, he leaves Sati and takes up residence at the Branga locality. One day, while playing with Kartik at a local park, three lions attack them and Ganesh becomes severely injured while saving Kartik. Shiva forgives him and together with Sati, confronts Daksha, who confesses to murdering Sati's first husband and denouncing Kali and Ganesh. Daksha blames Shiva for causing distrust between him and Sati, who disgusted with Daksha's deeds, asks him to leave Kashi and go back to Meluha.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was not necessary," [...] I assured her. [...] "A {{front door}} {{which does not}} boast a knocker or a bell must expect to be taken liberties with. But {{it is a great}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you here. I had no idea that any one was at Rowchester, or {{expected}} there, except Lord Blenavon. Has the Duke returned?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Should {{you wonder}} very much," [...] I said, {{preparing}} {{the way as}} cautiously as I could for the questions that were to come, [...] "if I owned {{that it is a}} satisfaction to me, as well as a <b>surprise,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you here? I felt very uneasy about you after you left me in the cab." ...|$|R
50|$|Dale Watkins, Adie Mings {{and record}} signing David Holmes formed {{one of the}} most potent front lines in non-league {{football}} and it was no <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Tigers battling on all fronts.
