Two mechanisms are therefore tested, i. e. agglomeration economies and the regional exploitation of technological proximity. A new dataset is applied, which includes German patent applications from within the period 1995 to 2006. Four industries are considered, two of which are science-based, whereas the remaining two are specialised <b>supplier</b> <b>industries.</b> While diversity is associated with high innovative output in the specialised <b>supplier</b> <b>industries,</b> the results for specialisation are mixed.

40|$|Using interindustry {{transaction}} in input-output tables, {{we examine}} Information Technology (IT) externalities in U. S. private industries {{over the period}} 1984 - 2000. Our empirical results show that computerization of an <b>industry's</b> customer and <b>supplier</b> <b>industries</b> reduces both labor and material costs of the industry. Moreover, cost savings driven by <b>supplier</b> <b>industries</b> are larger than those driven by customer industries. We also find that industries in the services sector enjoy more benefits from IT spillovers than industries in other sectors because of their high IT capital intensity and composition of interindustry transaction. Decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP) suggests that IT externalities can explain considerable parts of TFP growth, although possible mismeasurement of output in services industries leads to exacerbated technical changes of services industries. ...|$|R

Rather, design technology currently faces too many more pressing demands relative to its limited resources.

50|$|The {{construction}} works for SEAT's Zona Franca plant began on 1950 {{and the opening}} day came three years later on June 5, 1953, while in the meantime since 1951 the Spanish marque was starting preparations for setting up almost from scratch an entire <b>supplier</b> <b>industry</b> background. The first car in the marque's history to be produced was a SEAT 1400 model that came off the production line on November 13, 1953 with licence plate 'B-87.223'. In the following few months the plant's production output and workforce would significally increase together {{with the implementation of}} locally made components in the production process, in order to limit imports from one part and from another part to push {{to the development of the}} almost non-existent Spanish <b>supplier</b> <b>industry</b> and meet SEAT's assigned key role as the national car maker in restoring the Spanish economy of the post World War II Spain. By 1954 the use of Spanish-made parts had risen to 93% of the total and next year on May 5, 1955 the factory was officially opened. Nevertheless, the impact to the Spanish society could not be seen clear immediately, since the first model launched by SEAT was considered a luxury car therefore it was highly priced and still not affordable to the average Spanish consumer. Consequently, SEAT needed a second more economical model to compete against simpler inexpensive designs that appeared in the local market, like the Biscúter, which seemed to suit better to the unwealthy customers looking for a personal mean of transport in a suffering economic environment.|$|E

40|$|We study interindustry {{information}} technology (IT) spillover wherein IT investments made by <b>supplier</b> <b>industries</b> increase {{the productivity of}} downstream industries. Using data from U.

Our results suggest that IT intensity as well as competitiveness of the downstream industry moderate the effect of IT spillovers industries that are more IT intensive and more competitive benefit more from IT spillovers. Finally, our results suggest that the long-term effects of spillovers are greater than short-term effects, suggesting that learning periods are required to reap the benefits from the IT spillovers. open...|$|R

Initially in 1953 components were shipped as CKD kits from Italy and assembled by SEAT at their plant in Zona Franca, but in a quite short term from 1954 the Spanish-made parts rose to a 93% proportion of the total in order to limit imports and to help the development of the almost non-existent Spanish <b>supplier</b> <b>industry,</b> thus fulfilling SEAT's assigned key {{role in the development of}} the Spanish economy as the national car maker of the post World War II Spain.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{is the main}} driver for pushing the fuel cell technology to its present status. However, {{the role of the}} <b>supplier</b> <b>industry,</b> which has to develop innovative components and parts for the fuel cell system and the electrical drive train is also of crucial importance for the final success of fuel cell powered vehicles. In order to support the <b>supplier</b> <b>industry</b> developing advanced components for fuel cell vehicles, German Aerospace Center created a technology development platform. That means that DLR operates test benches and provides simulation and modelling capacities to support the <b>supplier</b> <b>industry</b> developing components for automotive fuel cell systems. The first project running on the platform was the HyLite project. Within the HyLite project DLR operated a fuel cell system test bench and also an electrical drive train and storage test bench. After a three year development phase DLR and partners demonstrated recently the final result of the HyLite project: a fuel cell powered hybrid vehicle.

40|$|The bullwhip {{effect is}} {{a major source of}} supply chain inefficiency. Whereas prior {{literature}} has identified a number of potential contributing factors and recommended such remedies as information sharing enabled by information technology (IT) or electronic linkage (EL), few studies have provided empirical support. We use industry-level data to examine whether EL use with buyer and <b>supplier</b> <b>industries</b> helps reduce the bullwhip effect as measured by inventory–demand variance ratio. Our major findings are that (1) EL use with <b>supplier</b> <b>industries</b> reduces the bullwhip effect, whereas (2), surprisingly, EL use with buyer industries increases it, but (3) this adverse effect tends to be mitigated by IT use. These findings point to the possible asymmetric effects of EL use in supply chains and provide a different perspective to the existing conclusions in the literature that EL use improves performance. Combining the above results, we have learned that the use of EL tends to behave differently depending on whether it is used upstream or downstream in the supply chain. This also sheds light on the conditions under which such investment may be more (or less) beneficial.

40|$|Academic {{interest}} in analysing {{the relationship between}} innovative performance of small firms and their recourse to external resources, especially through interorganisational relationships (IORs) has been growing over the last ten to fifteen years. However, to date the emerging literature has given limited attention to the systematic empirical assessment of the relationship and innovation inputs and outputs of cooperative product innovation. Furthermore, most of the literature focuses on cooperative innovation IORs with customer stakeholders, ignoring the potential role played by other external stakeholder groups, such as <b>suppliers,</b> <b>industry</b> partners and research/advisory organisations. This paper presents selected results from an empirical examination into {{the similarities and differences}} in the involvement of four external stakeholder groups in Australian manufacturing firms’ product innovation.
