Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child, who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.|$|E

She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of events leading up to {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Fisher {{published}} {{her first}} novel, Postcards from the Edge. The book was semi-autobiographical in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> fictionalized and satirized real-life {{events such as}} her drug addiction of the late 1970s and {{her relationship with her}} mother. It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film The Time Guardian. In 1989 Fisher played a major supporting role in When Harry Met Sally..., and in the same year she appeared with Tom Hanks as his character's wife in The 'Burbs.|$|E

She is also a jewelry designer. She has also revealed in a newspaper interview that motherhood has affected her art. Her paintings, she has said, are not as dark now as previously, and although in the past she drew mainly portraits, she now paints the whole body. She attributes this to her having become a mother and to her <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is now a more complete person.|$|E
25|$|Malfatti {{is thought}} to have been rather {{discouraged}} from her reception of her highly debated exposition and so it would make <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would try to please her audience. However, at the same time, other artists such as Tarsila do Amaral were becoming highly evolved in their search for the Brazilian identity and culture. Although Malfatti's courage and formally trained style introduced a new development to Brazilians, she almost sacrificed her artistic career simply to pave the path for other artists to forge ahead. However she will always be celebrated as the artist who brought Modernism to Brazil and, as that is no small feat, her impact is legendary.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Although Ann Perkins was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} character outside of city hall who became involved with Leslie and her political world, series co-creator Michael Schur said he believed it made <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would take a city hall job because [...] "we just decided that Leslie’s pull would {{be strong enough to}} get her to make a move, career-wise". Schur also said it {{would make it easier for}} the character to become involved in stories with the others. [...] "The Fight" [...] featured several appearances by actors who had appeared in previous Parks and Recreation episodes, including Ben Schwartz as Tom's friend Jean-Ralphio, who helps him promote Snake Juice throughout the night. Andy Forrest appeared as Andy's shoeshine customer Kyle, who is often insulted and mocked by Andy and the other characters during his shoeshines.

Around 2014, she also performed the single live during the Laneway Festival in Sydney, and Lollapalooza Brazil in Sao Paulo. At the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park on 1 August 2014, she performed the track among other songs from Pure Heroine. The performance of Lorde was well received by media outlets, with Billboard picked {{it as the}} fifth best performance of the festival, while Rolling Stone deemed it {{the best part of}} Lollapalooza in Chicago, writing, [...] "She danced like she was trying to fling her arms off her body, but just as with her voice, the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was in absolute possession of her abilities never waned.

2500|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} the [...] "True Self" [...] begins to develop in infancy, in the {{relationship}} between the baby and its primary caregiver (Winnicott typically refers to this person as [...] "the mother"). One of the ways the mother helps the baby develop an authentic self is by responding in a welcoming and reassuring way to the baby's spontaneous feelings, expressions, and initiatives. In this way the baby develops a confidence that nothing bad happens when she expresses what she feels, so her feelings don't seem dangerous or problematic to her, and she doesn't have to put undue attention into controlling or avoiding them. She also gains a <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is real, that she exists and her feelings and actions have meaning.|$|E

Tarantino is able to transform an object of moral outrage into one of aesthetic beauty......like all art forms, the violence serves a communicative purpose apart from its aesthetic value". When the female sword-wielding protagonist [...] "...skillfully slices and dices her way through......we get a <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is using them as a kind of canvas for her expression of revenge......like an artist who expresses herself through brush and paint,......expresses herself through sword and blood".|$|E

In {{both of her}} autobiographical volumes, Twenty Years at Hull-House (1910) and The Second Twenty Years at Hull-House (1930), Addams's gender constructions parallel the Progressive-Era ideology she championed. In A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil (1912) she dissected the social pathology of sex slavery, prostitution and other sexual behaviors among working class women in American industrial centers during 1890-1910. Addams's autobiographical persona manifests her ideology and supports her popularized public activist persona as the [...] "Mother of Social Work," [...] in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> represents herself as a celibate matron, who served the suffering immigrant masses through Hull-House, {{as if they were}} her own children. Although not a mother herself, Addams became the [...] "mother to the nation," [...] identified with motherhood in the sense of protective care of her people.|$|E

Her words soon made her an influential character and women flocked to see Táhirih, including one princess of the Qajar family who converted. [...] The clergy and members of the court, however, feared that she had grown too influential, and they organized seven conferences with Táhirih to convince her to recant her faith in the Báb. Instead, Táhirih presented religious [...] "proofs" [...] for the Báb's cause and—at the last of these conferences—exclaimed [...] "when will you lift your eyes toward the Sun of Truth?".

About his mother, Vikernes states that she was [...] "very race conscious", in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was afraid that Vikernes [...] "was going to come home with a black girl!" [...] At the time of the 1995 Lords of Chaos interview, Vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother, but [...] "very little contact" [...] with his father.

[...] With a rating of 7/10 (flawed yet worthy), Spin magazine's Chris Norris said: [...] "Since Janet is State-of-the-art production right down to her sculpted nose, it makes <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should call her retrospective Design. As the studio team that wrought Control, Rhythm Nation and janet. (which for record-label reasons is under-represented here), designers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are unofficial second and third Janet Jacksons. Their triumph is letting their dazzling sound sculptures fade into the background of Janet's cartoon antics." [...] Elysa Gardner with [...] Vibe magazine was in high praise of Design of a Decade, as well as Jackson herself, stating, [...] "It's been almost 10 years since Janet Jackson announced that her first name wasn't Baby, and it's easy to forget what a bold proclamation that was coming from a woman—particularly a black woman—at that time [...] Only two women were there to remind {{the rest of us}} that there was power and freedom in feminine sexuality—to reinforce the fact that we could be adorable and flirtatious and strong and assertive. And Madonna wasn't a sista.
