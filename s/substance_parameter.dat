40|$|Overall {{persistence}} (P OV) and long-range transport potential (LRTP) {{of chemicals}} are two indicators {{used in the}} context of precautionary chemical assessment. Multimedia fate models are used in research and regulatory contexts to calculate numerical indicators of P OV and LRTP. The resulting indicator values exhibit uncertainty due to model uncertainty concerning model design and due to variability and uncertainty in the substance parameters. In this study, we compare the relative magnitude of <b>substance</b> <b>parameter</b> and model uncertainty for a large set of 3175 hypothetical chemicals that evenly cover the chemical parameter space and for eight different multimedia models available for the calculation of P OV and LRTP. The assessment of the relative magnitude of the two types of uncertainty is important to direct further research and to inform the user on the level of confidence he can have in the model results. It is shown that, for P OV, <b>substance</b> <b>parameter</b> uncertainty is larger than model uncertainty in most cases (78 %), and that model uncertainty becomes more important for those chemicals which partition in considerable amounts into more than one environmental compartment. For LRTP, on the other hand, model uncertainty is higher than parameter uncertainty in most cases (61 - 81 %). This dominance of model uncertainty can be explained with known differences in the model designs. Uncertainty of P OV can thus be reduced most effectively by improving data on degradation rate constants. For LRTP, the choice of the model that is best suited for the assessment purpose in question is most essential to reduce uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|For {{the design}} and {{optimization}} of CO 2 recovery from alcoholic fermentation processes by distillation, models for vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) are needed. Two such thermodynamic models, the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) and a model based on Henry’s law constants, are proposed for the ternary mixture N 2 +O 2 +CO 2. Pure <b>substance</b> <b>parameters</b> of the Peng-Robinson EOS are taken from the literature, whereas the binary parameters of the Van der Waals one-fluid mixing rule are adjusted to experimental binary VLE data. The Peng-Robinson EOS describes both binary and ternary experimental data well, except at high pressures approaching the critical region. A molecular model is validated by simulation using binary and ternary experimental VLE data. On {{the basis of this}} model, the Henry’s law constants of N 2 and O 2 in CO 2 are predicted by molecular simulation.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is developed}} {{to quantify the}} uncertainty in a pesticide leaching assessment arising from the spatial variability of non-georeferenced parameters. A Monte Carlo analysis of atrazine leaching is performed in the Dyle river catchment (Belgium) with pesticide half-life (DT 50) and topsoil organic matter (OM) content as uncertain input parameters. Atrazine DT 50 is taken as a non-georeferenced parameter, so that DT 50 values sampled from the input distribution are randomly allocated {{in the study area}} for every simulation. Organic matter content is a georeferenced parameter, so that a fixed uncertainty distribution is given at each location. Spatially variable DT 50 values are found to have a significant influence on the amount of simulated leaching. In the stochastic simulation, concentrations exist above the regulatory level of 0. 1 microg L(- 1), but virtually no leaching occurs in the deterministic simulation. It is axiomatic that <b>substance</b> <b>parameters</b> (DT 50, sorption coefficient, etc.) are spatially variable, but pesticide registration procedures currently ignore this fact. Including this spatial variability in future registration policies would have significant consequences on the amount and pattern of leaching simulated, especially if risk assessments are implemented in a spatially distributed way...|$|R

This guidance was produced by EFSA {{in response to a}} question posed by the European Commission according to Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No. 178 / 20022 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Guidance is provided for all types of concentrations that are potentially needed for assessing ecotoxicological effects, i. e. the concentration in total soil and the concentration in pore water, both averaged over various depths and time windows. The current guidance considers both permanent crops and annual crops. The recommended exposure assessment procedure consists of four tiers. To facilitate efficient use of the tiered approach in regulatory practice, user-friendly software tools have been developed. In higher tiers of the exposure assessment, crop interception and subsequent dissipation at the crop canopy may be included. The models that simulate these processes were harmonised. In addition, easy-to-use tables for the fraction of the dose intercepted by the canopy that is washed off have been developed, which should be used in combination with the simple analytical model.

40|$|The {{high and}} still {{increasing}} number of attacks by hazardous bioorganic materials makes enormous demands on their detection. A very high detection sensitivity and differentiability are essential, {{as well as a}} rapid identification with low false alarm rates. One single technology can hardly achieve this. Point sensors can collect and identify materials, but finding an appropriate position is time consuming and involves several risks. Laser based standoff detection, however, can immediately provide information on propagation and compound type of a released hazardous material. The coupling of both methods may illustrate a solution to optimize the acquisition and detection of hazardous substances. At DLR Lampoldshausen, bioorganic substances are measured, based on laser induced fluorescence (LIF), and subsequently classified. In this work, a procedure is presented, which utilizes lots of information (time-dependent spectral data, local information) and predicts the presence of hazardous substances by statistical data analysis. For that purpose, studies are carried out on a free transmission range at a distance of 22 m at two different excitation wavelengths alternating between 280 nm and 355 nm. Time-dependent fluorescence spectra are recorded by a gated intensified CCD camera (iCCD).

However, {{with the human}} evolution and development of its activities such environment {{is no longer possible}} as the emissions are substantially larger. Sustainable water management is therefore imminent and this is why polluted water needs to be handled in an appropriate wastewater treatment plant. The required quality of water is defined with statutory values of individual <b>substance</b> <b>parameters.</b> The quality of treated water depends on the type of wastewater treatment plant and efficiency of its management. In wastewater treatment plant wastewater can be fully or only partially purified and then mixed with surface watercourses, which ensures a normal evolution of fresh water flora and fauna.

Therefore they have to be used appropriately for purification of specific wastewater to ensure proper design of a wastewater treatment plant and use of the appropriate equipment that has to be operational and regularly maintained.

To measure the supporting <b>substances</b> <b>parameters</b> through of a canine, a sensor-actuator system was developed. The sensor-actuator device was composed of a stainless steel bracket bonded to a steel wire attached to two piezoelectric transducers, with a concentrated mass attached {{to the end of}} the wire. To excite the device, high frequency voltage (between 5 and 10  KHz) was applied through the piezo-transducers, which affects the tooth by means of the vibration of the wire. High frequency mechanical vibrations allowed the appraisal of the mechanical response from the supporting substances. Mechanical responses associated with the stiffness of the support were quantified with the electrical impedance of the piezo-transducers. The device was coupled to the crown of a canine tooth simulating a condition of fixing as in the bone, the tooth was fastened by the root portion inside the supporting substance. Four supporting substances were characterized for the tests. After establishing base values of the stiffness of each supporting substance, the stiffness variations were assessed in two stages (two drillings); these were made perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the tooth, Results show that it is possible to assess stiffness variations with the proposed methodology as well as to quantify the stiffness differences, by means of variation indexes...|$|R

The main target for the Inspectorate and other co-operating supervising authorities during monitoring actions is to study the type of (suspected) waste product and the chemical composition of this product. This study was carried out in co-operation with the National Forensic Institute and the Customs Laboratory from 1 June 2001 to 30 April 2002. The RIVM co-operated with these institutes in four projects, i. e. TC 2001, SWITCH, ZOM and TC 2002.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to better understand and assess pesticide leaching at the regional scale, using both the analysis of monitoring data and spatially distributed modelling. Atrazine contamination of the Brusselian aquifer (central Belgium) is poorly understood. Considerable uncertainty surrounds whether the pollution is agricultural or non-agricultural in origin. The spatial and temporal covariance of atrazine concentrations was studied by fitting semivariogram models to monitoring data. Correlation ranges {{were found to be}} 600 metres and 600 - 700 days. A non-parametric one-way ANOVA found a strong relationship between mean concentrations and land use, whilst other environmental variables were found to be less important. Higher levels of pollution were detected in areas dominated by urban land use suggesting that atrazine residues in groundwater resulted from non-agricultural applications. Modelling pesticide leaching at the regional scale (Dyle catchment) was used to assess groundwater vulnerability. Different approaches to process soil information were tested with both a linear (modified Attenuation Factor) and a non-linear (GeoPEARL) leaching model. The CI (calculate first, interpolate later) and IC (interpolate first, calculate later) approaches were identical for the linear model, but differences in the amount of leaching were found for the non-linear model. The CI approach would be expected to give better results than IC, but the CA (calculate alone) approach is probably the best method if no spatial output is required. Finally, a methodology was developed to quantify the uncertainty arising from the spatial variability of non-georeferenced parameters (i. e. those assumed to be spatially constant in deterministic simulations). A Monte Carlo analysis of atrazine leaching was performed with six pesticide and soil properties as uncertain inputs. Spatial variability of non-georeferenced parameters had a significant influence on the amount of simulated leaching. In the stochastic simulation, concentrations exist above the regulatory level of 0. 1 µg/L, while virtually no leaching occurred in the deterministic simulation. Including the spatial variability of <b>substance</b> <b>parameters</b> (half-life, sorption coefficient [...] .) would have significant consequences for future registration policies, especially if risk assessments are implemented in a spatially distributed way.

40|$|MCom (South African and International Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 On 8 June 2012, National Treasury amended Regulation 10 (1) (c) of the Exchange Control Regulations to {{specifically}} include intellectual property. In so doing, all companies wishing to dispace intellectual property to an offshore destination had to obtain prior approval from National Treasury. However, National Treasury is reticent to grant permission to reassign these assets, as revenue from intellectual property {{is perceived to}} contribute vastly to the South African tax revenue. This amendment came into being shortly after the dismissal in the Oilwell case. This case, in essence, held that intellectual property is not capital for the purposes intended by National Treasury, and therefore no prior approval to assign it offshore is required from National Treasury. This dismissal led to a large outflow of intellectual property to tax favourable foreign locations. At the same time, it exposed transfer pricing risks that had previously gone unnoticed. Although these risks have once again been mitigated by the amendment to Regulation 10 (1) (c), {{it does not mean}} that it is now a thing of the past, best left forgotten. The South African government intends to relax or abolish all exchange control regulations in the future. At present the exact date when this is to take place is not known. Once the exchange control regulations are abolished, the transfer pricing risks associated with intellectual property will once again come to the forefront and will lead to significant loss to South African tax revenue. The three main risks that became apparent during the period before the amendment to Regulation 10 (1) (c) are the following: * Transfer pricing risk consisting of mainly: - A lack of a comparables database to enable tax administrators to determine an appropriate arm’s length price for intellectual property. - A lack of the relevant skills, experience and knowledge required to accurately assess transfer prices of intellectual property. * Challenges in obtaining relevant, comprehensive and timely information to accurately determine arm’s length prices for intellectual property transactions. * A lack of understanding the principle of economic substance and legislation in South Africa to define economic <b>substance</b> <b>parameters.</b> * In this mini-dissertation, these weaknesses are discussed in more detail to highlight to SARS the trials it faces when the exchange controls regulations are expelled.

The results of this work indicates that compression pressure increases the studied energy except plasticity, where is reduced of this parameter. The presence of friction <b>substances</b> reduces <b>parameter</b> E 1, E 2, Elis, Emax and plasticity and on the contrary increases the parameter E 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{first step}} to be {{performed}} during {{the development of a}} new industrial process should be the assessment of all hazards associated to the involved compounds. Particularly, the knowledge of all <b>substances</b> thermochemical <b>parameters</b> is a primary feature for such a hazard evaluation. CHETAH (CHEmical Thermodynamic And Hazard evaluation) is a prediction software suitable for calculating potential hazards of chemicals, mixtures or a single reaction that, using only the structure of the involved molecules and Benson's group contribution method, is able to calculate heats of formation, entropies, Gibbs free energies and reaction enthalpies. Because of its ability to predict the potential hazards of a material or mixture, CHETAH is part of the so-called “desktop methods” for early stage chemical safety analysis. In this work, CHETAH software has been used to compile a complete risk database reporting heats of decomposition and Energy Release Potential (ERP) for 342 common use chemicals. These compounds have been gathered into classes depending on their functional groups and similarities in their thermal behavior. Calculated decomposition enthalpies for each of the compounds have also been compared with experimental data obtained with either thermoanalytic or calorimetric techniques (Differential Scanning Calorimeter – DSC – and Accelerating Rate Calorimeter – ARC) ...|$|R

Student: Hamplová Kateřina Title of Thesis: The {{influence of}} the dwell time on {{the parameters of the}} stress relaxation test for microcrystalline cellulose and starch. This thesis is focused on the viscoelastic properties of pharmaceutical excipients and the tensile strength of tablets. The theoretical part describes used materials. Microcrystalline cellulose and starch were used as fillers and magnesium stearate at concentration of 1 % was used as lubricant. The stress relaxation test and its evaluation and utilization not only in pharmacy is described as well as the tensile strength of tablets. The experimental part deals with the viscoelastic properties of used materials and their mixtures with lubricant. These properties were evaluated using the stress relaxation test. At maximum compression force of 10 kN the length of dwell time was changed (60 s, 120 s, 180 s, 240 s, 300 s, 360 s, 420 s, 480 s, 540 s, 600 s). For derived parameters of elasticity A 1 - 3 and plasticity P 1 - 3 the dependence on the length of dwell time was evaluated. Parameter A 1 increases with increasing dwell time for all <b>substances.</b> For <b>parameters</b> A 2, A 3, the dependence on the dwell [...] ...|$|R
