Mycelia grown on solid agar media in laboratory petri dishes are usually referred to as colonies. These colonies can exhibit growth <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>colors</b> (due to spores or pigmentation) that can be used as diagnostic features in the identification of species or groups. Some individual fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages {{as in the case of}} a clonal colony of Armillaria solidipes, which extends over an area of more than 900ha (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000years.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of lettuce}} {{over the centuries}} has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>colors.</b> Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns. However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When {{examining}} the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> {{for a new}} product in an initial process of industrial design, they should be suitable for the product’s functionality, targeted image and concept. Additionally, it is also important that the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> differ from those of existing products so that the new design is distinctive to attract consumer attention. To support designers in their endeavor to come up with new designs, we propose a computerized method of analyzing existing designs and searching for a possible usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> different from the existing designs. First, we mathematically define feature indices to represent <b>and</b> quantify <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> characteristics of designs. Then, we analyze the usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> in existing designs, which are obtained as 3 D CAD data or 3 D shape data scanned from real products, by calculating the feature indices of the designs. By plotting the calculated results as a vector in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> feature indices space, we obtain the distribution of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usages of the existing designs. Here, we assume that the distance between the two vectors in the space represents the difference in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usages of the two designs. Based on the assumption, we search for a possible new <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usage by searching for a new vector in the space which is as far from any of the existing vectors as possible. Once such a new vector is obtained, we visualize the suggested usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> by generating 3 D polygon model examples with the feature indices quantified by the vector. We examine the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed idea by implementing it as a computer program and applying it to designs of &quot;card stands &quot; as simple actual product examples...|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} brain {{represent}} a red circle? One {{possibility is that}} there is a specialized and possibly time-consuming process whereby the attributes of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color,</b> carried by separate populations of neurons in low-order visual cortex, are bound together into a unitary neural representation. Another possibility is that neurons in high-order visual cortex are selective, by virtue of their bottom-up input from low-order visual areas, for particular conjunctions of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color.</b> A third possibility is that they simply sum <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> signals linearly. We tested these ideas by measuring the responses of inferotemporal cortex neurons to sets of stimuli in which two attributes—shape and color—varied independently. We find that a few neurons exhibit conjunction selectivity but that in most neurons the influences of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> sum linearly. Contrary to the idea of conjunction coding, few neurons respond selectively to a particular combination of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color.</b> Contrary to the idea that binding requires time, conjunction signals, when present, occur as early as feature signals. We argue that neither conjunction selectivity nor a specialized feature binding process is necessary for the effective representation of shape–color combinations...|$|R

Other important production sites are known to have been in Laconia, Boeotia, eastern Greece, and Italy. Particularly in Italy individual styles developed which were at least in part intended for the Etruscan market. Greek black-figure vases were very popular with the Etruscans, as is evident from frequent imports. Greek artists created customized goods for the Etruscan market which differed in form and decor from their normal products.

40|$|We {{proposed}} {{a kind of}} naturally combined shape-color affine moment invariants (SCAMI), which consider both <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> affine transformations simultaneously in one single system.

The conventional method is just to make a simple linear {{combination of the two}} factors. Meanwhile, the manual selection of weights is a complex issue. Our construction method is based on the multiple integration framework. The integral kernel is assigned as the continued product of the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>color</b> invariant cores.
