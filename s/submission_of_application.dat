Chang Kwang-keun (장광근) of the opposition Grand National Party expressed opposition to Jang's nomination, saying it was an example of Kim showing excessive favouritism towards his native Honam region; he stated that among the 35 applicants for the job there had been many people with better qualifications. There were also questions over the legal validity of Jang's nomination. According to Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy regulations, the president of a government-owned company is required to be a South Korean citizen.
