This system utilizes hard-limited or infinitely clipped optimal transforms and canonical analysis {{to extract the}} spectral features for data volume reduction and classification purposes. The design procedure {{is intended to be}} application-specific {{in order to make it}} maximally effective for each use. Although it could be used in a variety of circumstances, the procedure was designed with satellite data collection in mind, such as will be needed with the High-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (HIRIS), a land-oriented Earth observational sensor intended for launch in the mid- 1990 s. The computation required for the steps prior to the actual satellite data collection are straightforward and could be done with readily available subroutines.

40|$|Sun-tracking {{microwave}} radiometry is a groundbased technique where the Sun {{is used as}} a beacon source. The atmospheric antenna noise temperature is measured by alternately pointing toward-the-Sun and off-the-Sun according to a beam switching strategy. By properly developing an ad hoc processing algorithm, we can estimate the atmospheric path attenuation in all-weather conditions. A theoretical framework is proposed to describe the Sun-tracking radiometric measurements and to evaluate the overall error budget. Two different techniques, based respectively on elevation-scanning Langley method and on surface meteorological data method, are proposed and compared to estimate the clear-air reference. Application to available Sun-tracking radiometric measurements at Ka, V and W band in Rome (NY, USA) is shown and discussed together with the test of new physically-based prediction models for allweather path attenuation estimation up to about 30 dB at V and W band from multi-channel microwave radiometric data. Results show an appealing potential of this overall approach in order to overcome the difficulties to perform <b>satellite-to-Earth</b> radiopropagation experiments in the unexplored millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave frequency region, especially where experimental data from a beacon receivers are not availabl...|$|E
30|$|It is also {{important}} to remark some relevant aspects of the effects of <b>satellite-to-Earth</b> measurement geometry on ionospheric tomography technique. For example, as GPS satellites are high in altitude, an excess TEC from plasma-spheric origin may affect the reconstruction electron density. This may occur drastically during storm-time period when reproductions of short-term variabilities are desired. It is rather difficult to represent the behavior of the ionosphere above the top height because only average conditions are reproduced into the tomographic algorithm by the ionospheric model (Materassi et al., 2003). Thus such averaging, in turn, tended to minimize here the effects of the plasmasphere on the ionospheric reconstruction results. In another case, whether the number of satellite-to-receiver ray paths reduces to a situation that only high elevation satellite signals are detected, the reconstructed electron density may become poorly defined, even {{with the use of a}} set of vertical orthonormal functions. To overcome this, an assessment of quality of the electron density reconstructions was applied as suggested by Materassi and Mitchell (2005 a) and used to eliminate from the analysis the days or period of time with large percentage error in mean NmF 2 density.|$|E

Influence of the inclined ionospheric layers is a cause of the ionospheric interference in the transionospheric communication satellite-to-satellite or satellite to Earth links.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{data link}} using a Ka-band space qualified, high efficiency 200 W TWT amplifier and a bread-board modem emulator {{were created to}} explore the feasibility of very high speed communications in <b>satellite-to-earth</b> applications. Experiments were conducted using a DVB-S 2 -like waveform with modifications to support up to 20 Gbps through the addition of 128 -Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). Limited by the bandwidth of the amplifier, a constant peak symbol rate of 3. 2 Giga-symbols/sec was selected and the modulation order was varied to explore what peak data rate might be supported by an RF link through this amplifier. Using 128 -QAM, an implementation loss of 3 dB was observed at 20 Gbps, and the loss decreased as data rate or bandwidth were reduced. Building on this measured data, realistic link budget calculations were completed. Low-Earth orbit (LEO) missions based on this TWTA with reasonable hardware assumptions and antenna sizing {{are found to be}} bandwidth-limited, rather than power-limited, making the spectral efficiency of 9 / 10 -rate encoded 128 -QAM very attractive. Assuming a bandwidth allocation of 1 GHz, these computations indicate that low-Earth orbit vehicles could achieve data rates up to 5 Gbps-an order of magnitude beyond the current state-of-practice, yet still within the processing power of a current FPGA-based software-defined modem. The measured performance results and a description of the experimental setup are presented to support these conclusions...|$|E

An analytical model is introduced for describing propagation of radio waves in a stratified medium consisting of sectors with spherically symmetric refractivity distribution. This model gives analytical expressions for the phase, bending angle, and refractive attenuation of radio waves and is applied to the analysis of radio wave propagation phenomena along an extended path including the atmosphere and two parts of the ionosphere. The model explains significant amplitude and phase variations at altitudes 30 - 90 km of the RO ray perigee and attributes them to inclined ionospheric layers. Based on this analytical model, an innovative technique is introduced to locate layers in the atmosphere and ionosphere. A necessary and sufficient criterion is obtained for a layer to be located at the RO ray perigee. This criterion gives both qualitative and quantitative estimation of the displacement of an ionospheric and/or atmospheric layer from the RO ray perigee. This is important, in particular, for determining the location of wind shears and directions of the internal wave propagation in the lower ionosphere, and, possibly, in the atmosphere...|$|E

This paper describe the SANSA vision, approach {{and the benefits of}} the SANSA solution. The main aim of SANSA is to boost the performance of mobile wireless backhaul networks in terms of capacity, energy efficiency and resilience against link failure or congestion while easing the deployment in both rural and urban areas and assuring at the same time an efficient use of the spectrum.

By the smart antennas, each node can communicate with many of its neighbors where the hybrid network manager allows efficient use of the all the network resources. The research in SANSA is following two main paths: spectrum coexistence and self-organizing SON hybrid network. For the spectrum coexistences, the beamforming techniques that will enable the simultaneous operation of the terrestrial and satellite links considering the cost-performance trade-off. Additionally, smart dynamic radio resource management will be developed to explore efficient solutions for the hybrid scenario. Self-organizing load-balancing algorithms will be designed to aggregate the capacities of the terrestrial and satellite resources.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{proposes a}} method {{based on the}} use of a set of {{commercial}} <b>satellite-to-Earth</b> microwave links to rebuild finescale rainfall fields. Such microwave links exist {{all over the world and}} can be used to estimate the integrated rain attenuation over the links’ first 5 – 7 km with a very high temporal resolution (10 s in the present case). The retrieval algorithm makes use of a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4 DVAR) method involving a numerical advection scheme. The advection velocity is recovered from the observations or from radar rainfall fields at successive time steps. This technique has been successively applied to simulated 2 D rain maps and to real data recorded in the autumn of 2013 during the Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX), with one sensor receiving microwave signals from four different satellites. The performance of this system is assessed and is compared to an operational Météo-France radar and a network of 10 rain gauges. Because of the limitations of the propagation model, this study is limited to the events with strong advective characteristics (four out of eight recorded events). For these events (only), the method produces rainfall fields that are highly correlated with the radar maps at spatial resolutions greater than. The point-scale results are also satisfactory for temporal resolutions greater than 10 min (mean correlation with rain gauge data equal to approximately 0. 8, similar to the correlation between radar and rain gauge data). This method can also be adapted to the fusion of a rain gauge with microwave link measurements and, through the use of several sensors, it has the potential of being applied to larger areas...|$|E
