5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when an explosion of firedamp caused by a <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at Shakerley Colliery after an explosion of firedamp.|$|E
25|$|After hatting, {{the most}} {{important}} industry in Denton was the manufacture of lead-acid batteries by Oldham Batteries (Oldham & Son Ltd). In 1865, Joseph Oldham established a millwright general engineering shop and by 1887 this company was manufacturing machinery for the hat-making industry. Another important industry in the area was coal mining and shortly after 1887 the company began making machinery and equipment for this industry, which included miners' portable lamps. Up to this time, miners had always used the <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> devised in 1815 by Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829) but this new battery-powered Davy lamp eventually replaced the traditional <b>safety</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E
25|$|Swan {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{developers}} of the electric <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> for miners, exhibiting his first in Newcastle upon Tyne at the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers on 14 May 1881. This required a wired supply so the following year he presented one with a battery and other improved versions followed. By 1886 a lamp with better light output than a flame <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> was in production by the Edison-Swan Company. However, it suffered from problems of reliability and was not a success. It took development by others over the next 20 years or so before effective electric lamps were in common use.|$|E

25|$|Coal mining {{was very}} {{dangerous}} {{owing to the}} presence of firedamp in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> which was invented in 1816 by Sir Humphry Davy and independently by George Stephenson. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions continued, often setting off coal dust explosions, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.|$|E

25|$|Fletcher hired C. A. Russell, Solicitor and Henn Collins QC (later Baron Collins) {{to appeal}} this {{decision}} to the Divisional Court at Wigan. The reasoning behind the appeal was twofold, first; that the umpire {{was limited to}} deeming whether an open light was dangerous and not determining that mines need to be worked with a particular remedy as this went beyond his powers and second; that instead of using <b>safety</b> <b>lamps,</b> the owners could {{get rid of the}} firedamp, thus not requiring <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> as laid down in the notice.|$|R

25|$|Newcastle’s actions {{during the}} 1715 rising in {{resisting}} the rebels and declaring for George I, {{in contrast to}} the rest of the region, is the most likely source of the nickname 'Geordie', applied to people from Tyneside, or more accurately Newcastle. Another theory, however, is that the name 'Geordie' came from the inventor of the Geordie lamp, George Stephenson. It was a type of <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> used in mining, but was not invented until 1815. Apparently the term 'German Geordie' was in common use during the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{development}} of the <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> for use in coal mines, dried fish skins were used in Britain and Europe as a weak source of light. This experimental form of illumination avoided the necessity of using candles which risked sparking explosions of firedamp. Another safe source of illumination in mines was bottles containing fireflies. In 1920, the American zoologist E. Newton Harvey published a monograph, The Nature of Animal Light, summarizing early work on bioluminescence. Harvey notes that Aristotle mentions light produced by dead fish and flesh, and that both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder (in his Natural History) mention light from damp wood. He also records that Robert Boyle experimented on these light sources, and showed that both they and the glow-worm require air for light to be produced. Harvey notes that in 1753, J. Baker identified the flagellate Noctiluca [...] "as a luminous animal" [...] "just visible to the naked eye", and in 1854 Johann Florian Heller (1813–1871) identified strands (hyphae) of fungi as the source of light in dead wood.|$|E
2500|$|The {{people of}} the Tyneside area, called [...] "Geordies", have a {{reputation}} for their distinctive dialect and accent. Tynesiders may have been given this name, a local diminutive of the name [...] "George", because their miners used George Stephenson's <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> (invented in 1815 and called a [...] "Georgie lamp") to prevent firedamp explosions, rather than the Davy lamp used elsewhere. An alternative explanation relates that during the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 the Tynesiders declared their allegiance to the Hanoverian kings of Great Britain George I and George II; whereas the rest of the county of Northumberland, to the north, stood loyal to James Francis Edward Stuart.|$|E

6000|$|... [Footnote 1: Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829), {{the son of}} a wood-carver of Penzance, was apprenticed to John Borlase, {{a surgeon}} at Penzance, in whose dispensary he became a chemist. He wrote poetry as a young man, but soon {{abandoned}} the pursuit for science. Two poems on Byron by Davy, one written in 1823, the other in 1824, will be found in Dr. Davy's 'Memoirs of the Life of Sir H. Davy', vol. ii. pp. 168, 169. In October, 1798, he joined Dr. Beddoes at Bristol, where he superintended the laboratory at his Pneumatic Institution. His 'Researches, Chemical and Philosophical' (1799), made him famous. At the Royal Institution in London, founded in 1799, Davy became assistant-lecturer in chemistry, and director of the chemical laboratory. There his lecture-room was crowded by some of the most distinguished {{men and women of the}} day. Within the next few years his discoveries in electricity and galvanism, (1806-7) brought him European celebrity; his lectures on agricultural chemistry (1810) marked a fresh era in farming, and inaugurated the new movement of [...] "science with practice." [...] His famous discovery of the <b>Safety</b> <b>Lamp</b> was made in 1816. He was created a baronet in 1818. A skilful fisherman, he wrote, when in declining health, 'Salmonia, or Days of Fly-fishing', published in 1827. Ticknor ('Life', vol. i. p. 57), speaking of Davy in 1815, says, ...|$|E
60|$|In truth, the new {{philosophy}} deserves {{neither the}} praise of its eulogists, nor the blame of its slanderers. As I have pointed out, its disciples were guided by no search after practical fruits, {{during the great}} period of its growth, and it reached adolescence without being stimulated by any rewards of that nature. The bare enumeration {{of the names of}} the men who were the great lights of science {{in the latter part of}} the eighteenth and the first decade of the nineteenth century, of Herschel, of Laplace, of Young, of Fresnel, of Oersted, of Cavendish, of Lavoisier, of Davy, of Lamarck, of Cuvier, of Jussieu, of Decandolle, of Werner and of Hutton, suffices to indicate the strength of physical science in the age immediately preceding that of which I have to treat. But of which of these great men can it be said that their labors were directed to practical ends? I do not call to mind even an invention of practical utility which we owe to any of them, except the <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> of Davy. Werner certainly paid attention to mining, and I have not forgotten James Watt. But, though some of the most important of the improvements by which Watt converted the steam-engine, invented long before his time, into the obedient slave of man, were suggested and guided by his acquaintance with scientific principles, his skill as a practical mechanician, and the efficiency of Bolton's workmen had quite as much to do with the realisation of his projects.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 May 1886, HM Inspector of Mines, Mr Joseph Dickenson, {{inspected}} the pits and, on finding that candles {{were still being}} used, cited the Gingham mine and issued a notice to Herbert Fletcher stating that all the pits must change to <b>safety</b> <b>lamps.</b> The notice read: ...|$|R
50|$|After these {{witnesses}} {{two of the}} company officers took the stand, James Davidson - General Manager and Matthew William Hawkings - Company Secretary. <b>Safety</b> <b>lamps</b> had been ordered for the mine and a barometer had been provided to Hodge. The hearing was then adjourned till the next week.|$|R
50|$|Within {{months of}} Clanny's {{demonstration}} {{of his first}} lamp, two improved designs had been announced: one by George Stephenson, which later became the Geordie lamp, and the Davy lamp, invented by Sir Humphry Davy. Subsequently, Clanny incorporated aspects of both lamps and produced the ancestor of all modern oil <b>safety</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, however, George was {{not entirely}} {{occupied}} with the consideration of his growing engine. He had the clocks and watches to mend; he had Robert's schooling to look after; and he had another practical matter even nearer home than the locomotive on which to exercise his inventive genius. One day, in 1814, the main gallery of the colliery caught fire. Stephenson at once descended into the burning pit, with a chosen band of volunteers, who displayed the usual heroic courage of colliers in going {{to the rescue of}} their comrades; and, at the risk of their lives, these brave men bricked up the burning portion, and so, by excluding the air, put out the dangerous fire. Still, even so, several of the workmen had been suffocated, and one of the pitmen asked Geordie in dismay whether nothing could be done to prevent such terrible disasters in future. [...] "The price of coal-mining now," [...] he said, [...] "is pitmen's lives." [...] Stephenson promised to think the matter over; and he did think it over with good effect. The result of his thought was the apparatus still affectionately known to the pitmen as [...] "the Geordie lamp." [...] It is a lamp so constructed that the flame cannot pass out into the air outside, and so cause explosions in the dangerous fire-damp which is always liable to occur abundantly in the galleries of coal mines. By this invention alone George Stephenson's name and memory might have been kept green for ever; for his lamp has been the means of saving thousands of lives from a sudden, a terrible, and a pitiful death. Most accidents that now occur in mines are due to the neglect of ordinary precautions, and to the perverse habit of carrying a naked lighted candle in the hand (contrary to regulations) instead of a carefully guarded <b>safety</b> <b>lamp.</b> Yet so culpably reckless of their own and other men's lives are {{a large number of people}} everywhere, that in spite of the most stringent and salutary rules, explosions from this cause (and, therefore, easily avoidable) take place constantly to the present day, though far less frequently than before the invention of the Geordie lamp.|$|E

50|$|Mining {{disasters}} {{such as the}} 1954 {{accident at}} Collinsville usually led to improvements in mine safety.

50|$|Before the {{invention}} of <b>safety</b> <b>lamps,</b> miners used candles with open flames. This gave rise to frequent explosions.
