50|$|From a {{very young}} age, Angel Charavitsidis {{and his younger brother}} Daniel {{developed}} an interest for classic Rock ‘n Roll music which ultimately resulted in the original band “The Crickets” in 1996. The name was later on changed to The <b>Skelters,</b> because “The Crickets” was already used as a band’s name (Buddy Holly and the Crickets). The name <b>Skelters</b> was an idea coming from the original Beatles song “Helter Skelter” which has been the main influence of the band since its formation.Up until 2003, the lineup has changed several times, yet always consisting of Angel and Daniel. The lead guitarist and vocalist Stavros Amanatidis joined the band in 2001, while the bassist Thodoris Nikolaou in 2004. Immediately after its formation, the band started appearing live locally counting more than 1000 appearances all over Greece to date. They have appeared in the most important live stages in Thessaloniki and Athens, festivals, TV and radio shows.Also, they were the support act for other artists such as ZZ Top, Nazareth, Iron Butterfly, Pavlov’s Dog, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, Louisiana Red, helping the band to gain more recognition and fame.

The murders were {{committed}} by members of Charles Manson's cult and {{came to be known}} as Helter <b>Skelter.</b> During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. On January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.|$|E

5000|$|Each song on {{the first}} album of the <b>Skelters,</b> [...] "Explain To Me", has its own history and all the songs were written in {{different}} periods. The lyrics of the songs are mostly inspired by everyday life and real events experienced {{by members of the}} band. Because of the many musical influences of <b>Skelters,</b> each song has its own style. Specifically, the first track, entitled Let's Go Party, is a pure rock n 'roll song with uplifting mood, influenced by the Beatles, Little Richard, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Kiss. The music is written by Angel, but the lyrics are from the Angel, Daniel and Stavros. The second track, «My Life Has Changed», is a love ballad and is closer to the style of John Lennon, George Harrison and Queen.

The next track is entitled «Now Is The Chance», which is a classic rock song. The music was composed by Angel, while the lyrics were written by Daniel and Stavros. The next song, entitled «She Is A Liar», is a dance funk rock track, influenced by the Beatles, U2, Queen, and generally from the 80s music style.

60|$|As the wet {{season was}} approaching, I {{determined}} {{to return to}} Sarawak, sending all my collections with Charles Allen around by sea, while I myself proposed {{to go up to}} the sources of the Sadong River and descend by the Sarawak valley. As the route was somewhat difficult, I took the smallest quantity of baggage, and only one servant, a Malay lad named Bujon, who knew the language of the Sadong Dyaks, with whom he had traded. We left the mines on the 27th of November, and the next day reached the Malay village of Gúdong, where I stayed a short time to buy fruit and eggs, and called upon the Datu Bandar, or Malay governor of the place. He lived in a large, and well-built house, very dirty outside and in, and was very inquisitive about my business, and particularly about the coal-mines. These puzzle the natives exceedingly, as they cannot understand the extensive and costly preparations for working coal, and cannot believe it is to be used only as fuel when wood is so abundant and so easily obtained. It was evident that Europeans seldom came here, for numbers of women <b>skeltered</b> away as I walked through the village and one girl about ten or twelve years old, who had just brought a bamboo full of water from the river, threw it down with a cry of horror and alarm the moment she caught sight of me, turned around and jumped into the stream. She swam beautifully, and kept looking back as if expecting I would follow her, screaming violently all the time; while a number of men and boys were laughing at her ignorant terror.|$|R
500|$|In {{the context}} of the {{turbulent}} political climate of 1968, [...] "Piggies" [...] was adopted by the counterculture as an anti-establishment theme song.

500|$|While some reviewers have {{dismissed}} the song as monotonous, {{many others have}} admired its yearning quality and dark musical mood.

The 1976 television adaptation of Vincent Bugliosi's book, also titled Helter <b>Skelter,</b> features several Beatles songs, including [...] "Piggies" [...] and Harrison's White Album track [...] "Long, Long, Long", both performed by the group Silverspoon.

500|$|... "Helter Skelter" [...] {{was written}} by McCartney and was {{initially}} recorded in July as a blues number. The initial takes were performed by the band live and included long passages during which they jammed on their instruments. Because these takes were too long to practically fit on an LP, the song was shelved until September, when a new, shorter, version was made. By all accounts, the session was chaotic, but nobody dared suggest {{to any of the}} Beatles that they were out of control. Harrison reportedly ran around the studio while holding a flaming ashtray above his head, [...] "doing an Arthur Brown". The stereo version of the LP includes almost an extra minute of music compared to the mono, which culminates in Starr infamously shouting [...] "I've got blisters on my fingers!" [...] Charles Manson was unaware that helter <b>skelter</b> is the British name for a spiral slide found on a playground or funfair, and assumed the track {{had something to do with}} hell. This was one of the key tracks that led Manson to believe the album had coded messages referring to apocalyptic war, and led to his movement of the same name.|$|E
