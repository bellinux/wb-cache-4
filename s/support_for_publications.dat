The {{mission of the}} Foundation was to canalize the {{major part of the}} income from the rt-PA royalties towards “the execution, promotion and support of scientific research in general, and biomedical and biotechnological research in particular, by making available research grants, research positions, travel bursaries, by organizing scientific congresses and symposia, providing financial <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>publications</b> and all related activities that support the advancement of science.” With the support of the Foundation, over 100 young researchers were able to obtain further specialisation abroad; numerous congresses and symposia and two academic chairs were sponsored, the 9th floor of the research building on the Gasthuisberg Research Campus and a guesthouse on the Groot Begijnhof campus were built with financial support of the Foundation. These buildings housed for many years the Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research and the VIB Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy and their postdoctoral researchers, respectively.|$|E

Methods - Analysis of scientific articles, conference proceedings, and primary sources like documentations of OA projects and initiatives and correspondence with selected German institutions supporting Open Access. Conclusions - In Germany almost all most important scientific institutions support the development of both Open Access models, both the green way and the golden way. All German OA mandates are soft mandates which request rather than require self-archiving. They are implemented {{by the development of}} repository infrastructure and by financial <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>publications.</b> German OA advocates believe that the development of green way OA can be accelerated by changes in copyright law...|$|E
