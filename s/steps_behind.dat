2500|$|The Tsehafi Taezaz (ጸሐፌ ትእዛዝ , lit. [...] "scribe by command", {{translated}} as [...] "Minister of the Pen") {{was the most}} powerful post at the Imperial court. According to John Spencer, he was [...] "the one who traditionally walked two <b>steps</b> <b>behind</b> the Emperor to listen to and write down all orders that the latter gave out {{in the course of}} an audience or an inspection tour." [...] Spencer adds that under Haile Selassie the Tsehafe Tezaz safeguarded the Great Seal, kept the records of all important appointments, and was responsible for publishing all laws and treaties; [...] "his signature, rather than that of the Emperor, appeared on those [...] publications although the heading in each case referred to His Imperial Majesty." [...] The office was combined with that of Prime Minister during the tenure of Aklilu Habte-Wold (1961–1974).|$|E

2500|$|Frederick Lewis Taylor {{claims that}} a {{kneeling}} volley fire {{may have been}} employed by Prospero Colonna's arquebusiers {{as early as the}} Battle of Bicocca (1522). However this has been called into question by Tonio Andrade who believes this is an over interpretation as well as mis-citation of a passage by Charles Oman suggesting that the Spanish arquebusiers kneeled to reload, when in fact Oman never made such a claim. European gunners might have implemented the volley fire to some extent since at least 1579 when the Englishman Thomas Digges suggested that musketeers should, [...] "after the old Romane manner make three or four several fronts, with convenient spaces for the first to retire and unite himselfe with the second, and both these if occasion so require, with the third; the shot [...] having their convenient lanes continually during the fight to discharge their peces." [...] The Spanish too displayed some awareness of the volley technique and described it in a military manual dating to 1586: [...] "Start with three files of five soldiers each, separated one from the other by fifteen paces, and they should comport themselves not with fury but with calm skillfulness [...] such that when the first file has finished shooting they make space for the next (which is coming up to shoot) without turning face, countermarching [...] to the left but showing the enemy only the side of their bodies, which is the narrowest of the body, and [...] about one to three <b>steps</b> <b>behind,</b> with five or six pellets in their mouths, and two lighted matchlock fuses … and they load [...] promptly … and return to shoot when it's their turn again." ...|$|E
