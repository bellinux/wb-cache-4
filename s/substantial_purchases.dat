50|$|There {{were once}} cottages for workmen {{along the banks}} of the Humber west of the railway bridge. Access was via a {{footpath}} that went through a gate at the north-western end of the railway bridge over the Haven or via West Marsh Lane and two wooden gates on either side of the railway line. These cottages were not provided with electricity, water or sanitation facilities. Kerosene lamps, hand pumps and earth toilets were standard. Floors were generally constructed of brick laid directly on the ground and the walls had no damp-proof courses. Cast iron fireplaces, consisting of a coal-fired open grate with a boiler box on one side and an oven on the other, were the sole means of heating and cooking. Disposal of household rubbish and night soil consisted of dumping into the Humber at any convenient tide. A shop stocked with produce through the market boat catered for the immediate needs of the local population, but more <b>substantial</b> <b>purchases</b> required travelling to Barton on Humber, or to New Holland and from there by ferry to Hull. An additional shop, run by a Mrs Dee, was on the Barrow Road; it was a lean-to attached to a house. A coal yard was next to the shop, on the Clew Bridge side of the building, which was first owned by Mr. Dee's, but in the 1930s it was owned by a Clifford Hastings. His coal was delivered by barge along the Haven. In later years he had a further coal yard just south of the station.|$|E

Attention in the ad-vanced economies {{has focused on}} the financial sector, where the global crisis originated, and on government balance sheets, which have been affected by the economic downturn, bailout costs, and the need for massive fiscal stimulus. At the same time, to avert another Great Depression, monetary policy has been pressed into service in an unprecedented manner—from a coordinated cut in policy interest rates in October 2008 to op-erations aimed at increasing liquidity in the nonfinancial cor-porate sector and rounds of quantitative easing (QE) in ad-vanced economies. The euro area faces serious difficulty from its dependence upon bank credit and a sovereign debt problem in vulnerable euro area countries that has compounded the problems of banks holding government securities. These problems began with the bailout of Greece in April 2010 and spread to Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, despite the creation of a € 750 billion stabi-lization fund and <b>substantial</b> <b>purchases</b> of government bond...|$|E
40|$|The European Forecasting Network (EFN) is a {{research}} group of European institutions, founded in 2001 {{under the auspices of}} the European Commission. · In 2010, the recovery of the world economy will be driven by a strong expansion of production in many emerging markets. Rising exports will be the main driver of the recovery in the euro area. We expect GDP to grow around 1. 7 % and 1. 2 % during 2010 and 2011, respectively. What impedes the recovery is the state of labour markets. In fact, unemployment will continue to rise well into 2011, partly because firms with low capacity utilization will no longer be able to keep workers in employment. · The most important reason for the recovery of the real economy appears to be renewed – although still fragile – confidence on financial markets. Official interest rates close to zero and <b>substantial</b> <b>purchases</b> of highly rated assets by important central banks have drastically increased the attractiveness of more risky assets. · However, at the end of December 2009, financial markets have put the very solvency of Greece into doubt. If need be, the EU – or member states – would surely help in order to prevent an open solvency crisis, although this would make financing government debt more expensive for all euro area countries. · Inflation in the euro area will grow slowly up to an expected average annual rate of 1. 3 % in 2010. Price stability is not expected to be affected by expansionary monetary and fiscal policy and inflation will remain well below the ECB target rate during the forecasting horizon...|$|E
40|$|The {{eventual}} {{establishment of}} the Transvaal State Artillery in 1881 represents the culmination of several attempts to create an orthodox European-style force {{to act as a}} core for the burger commandos in the field. 'The Pretoria Rifle Corps' the 'Batterij Dingaan' and various volunteer 'Schutzencorps' had all enjoyed a brief existence during the 1870 's. The war of 1880 - 81, albeit successfully concluded, indicated the need for a more permanent and professional approach to the problem. The result was that the restored South African Republic raised its own artillery and mounted police corps in 1881, along the same lines as that of the Orange Free State. Various refoms were necessary {{in the first years of}} the corps' existence and certain changes of designation occurred. Only in 1890 was the money available to pui: the education and training of the State's artillerists on a sounder basis. In 1896 a further reorganisation resulted in the Corps adopting the form in which it would enter the Anglo-Boer War. For the next three years there was a considerable expansion in the number of personnel and <b>substantial</b> <b>purchases</b> of equipment to prepare the 'Staatsartillerie' for the increasingly likely event of war. When war did break out, the 'Staatsartillerie' was immediately in the front line, distinguishing itself at the sieges of Ladysmih and Mafeking. The transition to a more mobile form of warfare in March 1900 made certain challtges necessary in the constitution of the unit however, and after Bergendal, the last pitched battle of the war, only light artillery was employed by the commandos. Personnel of the 'Staatsartillerie' thus stayed in the field until the war's end and the Treaty of Vereeniging which marked the end of the 'Staatsartillerie', as well as that of the Republic which the unit had served...|$|E

40|$|A {{broad array}} of {{domestic}} institutional factors –including problems with the originate-to-distribute model for mortgage loans, deteriorating lending standards, deficiencies in risk management, conflicting incentives for the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and shortcomings of supervision and regulation– were the primary sources of the US housing boom and bust and the associated financial crisis. In addition, the extended rise in US house prices was likely also supported by long-term interest rates (including mortgage rates) that were surprisingly low, given the level of short-term rates and other macro fundamentals –a development that Greenspan (2005) dubbed a “conundrum. ” The “global saving glut” (GSG) hypothesis (Bernanke, 2005 and 2007) argues that increased capital inflows to the United States from countries in which desired saving greatly exceeded desired investment –including Asian emerging markets and commodity exporters– were an important reason that US longer-term interest rates during this period were lower than expected. This essay investigates further the effects of capital inflows to the United States on US longer-term interest rates; however, we look beyond the overall size of the inflows emphasised by the GSG hypothesis to examine the implications for US yields of the portfolio preferences of foreign creditors. We present evidence that, {{in the spirit of}} Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009), foreign investors during this period tended to prefer US assets perceived to be safe. In particular, foreign investors –especially the GSG countries–acquired a substantial share of the new issues of US Treasuries, Agency debt, and Agency-sponsored mortgage-backed securities. The downward pressure on yields exerted by inflows from the GSG countries was reinforced by the portfolio preferences of other foreign investors. We focus particularly on the case of Europe: although Europe did not run a large current account surplus as did the GSG countries, we show that it leveraged up its international balance sheet, issuing external liabilities to finance <b>substantial</b> <b>purchases</b> of apparently safe US “private label” mortgage-backed securities and other fixed-income products. The strong demand for apparently safe assets by both domestic and foreign investors not only served to reduce yields on these assets but also provided additional incentives for the US financial services industry to develop structured investment products that “transformed” risky loans into highly-rated securities. Our findings do not challenge the view that domestic factors, including those listed above, were the primary sources of the housing boom and bust in the United States. However, examining how changes in the pattern of international capital flows affected yields on US assets helps provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} origins and dynamics of the crisis. ...|$|E
