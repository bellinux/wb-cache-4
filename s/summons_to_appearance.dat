50|$|He was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> Parliament on 15 December 1357, by writs {{directed}} to Gerardo de Insula or de L'Isle, whereby he is held {{to have become}} Baron Lisle. He was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> a Council 20 June 1358.|$|R
50|$|The date of {{his death}} is unknown, but as he was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> all the parliaments of Edward I between 1300 and 1307, and is not {{mentioned}} as <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> any of Edward II, he probably died soon after the accession.|$|R
50|$|He was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> Parliament as Baron Brun, {{and thus}} by modern usage is held {{to have become}} a member of the Peerage of England, by writ of 30 June 1315, {{although}} his descendants were not <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> Parliament by this writ.|$|R

50|$|Later in 1322 he was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> serve {{against the}} Scots and against Lancaster's rebels. He was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> defend Aquitane in 1324, which was lost under the poor {{leadership}} of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, {{and to go}} to Gascony in 1325.|$|R
60|$|How {{often is}} it the case that, when impossibilities have come to pass and dreams have {{condensed}} their misty substance into tangible realities, we find ourselves calm, and even coldly self-possessed, amid circumstances which {{it would have been}} a delirium of joy or agony to anticipate! Fate delights to thwart us thus. Passion will choose his own time to rush upon the scene, and lingers sluggishly behind when an appropriate adjustment of events would seem <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> his <b>appearance.</b> So was it now with Giovanni. Day after day his pulses had throbbed with feverish blood at the improbable idea of an interview with Beatrice, and of standing with her, face to face, in this very garden, basking in the Oriental sunshine of her beauty, and snatching from her full gaze the mystery which he deemed the riddle of his own existence. But now there was a singular and untimely equanimity within his breast. He threw a glance around the garden to discover if Beatrice or her father were present, and, perceiving that he was alone, began a critical observation of the plants.|$|R

25|$|In June 1459 a Great Council was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> meet at Coventry. York, the Nevilles {{and some}} other lords refused to appear, fearing that the armed forces that had been {{commanded}} to assemble the previous month had been <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> arrest them. Instead, York and Salisbury recruited in their strongholds and met Warwick, who had brought with him his troops from Calais, at Worcester. Parliament was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> meet at Coventry in November, but without York and the Nevilles. This could only mean {{that they were to}} be accused of treason.|$|R
50|$|In 1324, Sir Ralph de Cobham was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> {{parliament}} as Baron Cobham, {{but this}} creation became extinct roughly {{a year later}} on his death.

This creation became abeyant no later than 1429. A further creation came in 1342, when Reginald de Cobham was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> parliament. However, this creation became extinct {{on the death of}} the second baron in 1403.|$|R
