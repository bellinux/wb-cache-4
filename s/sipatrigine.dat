40|$|<b>Sipatrigine</b> (BW 619 C 89), a {{derivative}} of the antiepileptic agent lamotrigine, has potent neuroprotective properties in animal models of cerebral ischemia and head injury In {{the present study}} we investigated the electrophysiological effects of <b>sipatrigine</b> utilizing intracellular current-clamp recordings obtained from striatal spiny neurons in rat corticostriatal slices and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in isolated striatal neurons. The number of action potentials produced {{in response to a}} depolarizing current pulse in the recorded neurons was reduced by <b>sipatrigine</b> (EC 50 4. 5 mu M). Although this drug preferentially blocked action potentials in {{the last part of the}} depolarizing current pulse, it also decreased the frequency of the first action potentials, Sipatrigne also inhibited tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium (Na+) current recorded from isolated striatal neurons. The EC 50 for this inhibitory action was 7 mu M at the holding potential (V-h) of - 65 mV, but 16 mu M at V-h = - 105, suggesting a dependence of this pharmacological effect on the membrane potential. Moreover, although the inhibitory action of <b>sipatrigine</b> on Na+ currents was maximal during high-frequency activation (20 Hz), it could also be detected at low frequencies, The amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), recorded following stimulation of the corticostriatal pathway, was depressed by <b>sipatrigine</b> (EC 50 2 mu M). This inhibitory action, however, was incomplete; in fact maximal concentrations of this drug reduced EPSP amplitude by only 45 %. <b>Sipatrigine</b> produced no increase in paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting that the modulation of a postsynaptic site was the main pharmacological effect of this agent, The inhibition of voltage-dependent Na+ channels exerted by <b>sipatrigine</b> might account for its depressant effects on both repetitive firing discharge and corticostriatal excitatory transmission, The modulation of Na+ channels described here, as well as the previously observed inhibition of high-voltage-activated calcium currents, might contribute to the neuroprotective efficacy exerted by this compound in experimental models of in vitro and in vivo ischemia.

40|$|Drugs {{based on}} 5 -phenyl- 2, 4 diamino {{pyrimidine}} and 6 -phenyl- 1, 2, 4 triazine derivatives {{are well known}} for their effects on the central nervous system. The study presented here provides detailed crystal structures of two pyrimidine derivatives which have neuroprotective properties in models of both grey and white matter ischemia. Recently published {{studies suggest that the}} compounds lamotrigine (a triazine derivative), and the two pyrimidines BW 1003 C 87 (I) and <b>sipatrigine</b> (II) mediate their primary in vivo mode of action by inhibiting voltage-gated Na+ channels. The X-ray crystal structures will contribute valuable data for applications involving binding and modelling studies of the biological actions of these drugs...|$|E
40|$|Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) {{channels}} are therapeutic targets for several disorders affecting humans, including epilepsy, neurodegeneration and neuropathic pain. Typically, drugs treating these conditions exert a use- and voltage-dependent inhibition of Na currents, an action {{attributed to the}} stabilisation of the slow inactivated state which is formed during prolonged depolarisation. The binding site has been suggested to reside in the channel pore at a site only accessible from the intracellular environment. What gives different chemicals having this action in common selectivity for certain disorders (e. g. neuroprotection versus epilepsy) remains a mystery. Several channel subtypes exist, with types Nav 1. 2 and Nav 1. 6 being major isoforms found in the brain, raising the possibility that different subtypes exhibit differential drug sensitivity. To investigate this issue and explore the site of drug action further, the action of several Nav channel modulators, including lidocaine (a local anaesthetic) and <b>sipatrigine</b> (a neuroprotective agent), were studied on Na currents generated by Nav 1. 2 a and Nav 1. 6 channels stably expressed in cell lines, and by acutely dissociated native cells, using electrophysiological techniques. The findings indicated that different drugs have some selectivity for particular channel subtypes. In addition, to study the slow inactivated state more selectively, fast inactivation was inhibited chemically. Inhibition of this mechanism altered both normal channel function and drug action. Drug effect during external and internal application to cells was also compared. Seemingly contrary to the current hypothesis of an internal site of action, drugs were more potent following external application, suggesting that their site of action may {{be different from the}} putative intracellularly-accessible “local anaesthetic receptor”. These experimental results were tested using a mathematical simulation of drug diffusion during whole-cell voltage-clamped electrophysiological recordings, to determine whether variations in the physicochemical properties of these drugs could explain their different potencies on internal and external application...|$|E
40|$|Abnormal {{homeostasis}} of intracellular Ca 2 + plays a deleterious role in muscle pathologies by triggering {{processes that}} lead to dysfunction and necrotic or apoptotic cell death. One pathology where there is significant Ca 2 + induced cell damage is ischemia, which initiates further damage (also mediated by Ca 2 +) generated by the required treatment process of revascularization; namely ischemia-reperfusion injury. Pharmacological agents used therapeutically for cell protection, especially for cardiac protection in ischemic heart diseases, have only directly targeted one of the elements regulating Ca 2 + homeostasis, the L-type Ca 2 + channels (calcium channel blockers). Other agents, like beta blockers, indirectly target various elements, including sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). However, there are no pharmacological agents that directly and specifically target these two crucial elements required for intracellular SR Ca 2 + homeostasis. Dr. Julio A. Copello’s group has previously studied the cardioprotective agent CGP- 37157 (CGP), a benzothiazepine (BZT) derivative of the benzodiazepine (BZD) clonazepam. CGP was previously thought to decrease intracellular SR Ca 2 + by acting as a blocker of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger (Omelchenko et al., 2003). They found, however, that CGP also activates RyRs and inhibits the SERCA, which could better explain the SR effects of the drug (Neumann et al., 2011). These results suggest that drugs inducing partial depletion of SR Ca 2 + stores could provide cellular protection in stressful circumstances or processes. The aims of the dissertation were organized based on the two processes that cause damage to muscle cells during ischemia: ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (ischemia-reperfusion injury) (Ibanez et al., 2015). Aim one and two focused on drug-protective action during the ischemic event, while aim three focused on drug protective action in the reperfusion (early post-ischemia) process. In the first Aim, experiments were designed to test the hypotheses that RyRs and/or SERCA could also be the target of i) Drugs with structural similarities to CGP (i. e., other BZTs and some BZDs) and ii) Drug known to confer cellular protection under stressful cellular conditions such as antiepileptic agents. We found that some BZTs (K 201, CGP analog) and antiepileptic agents (<b>Sipatrigine</b> and Pimozide) demonstrated potential to prevent SR Ca 2 + overload by inhibition of SERCA and, in some cases also by inducing mild activation of RyR channels. These results provided potential mechanisms of action for agents with cell protective action: targeting SERCA and preventing Ca 2 + overload in pre-ischemia process. From {{the results of the}} first aim, K 201 had the most significant effects in both SERCA inhibition and RyRs activation. Therefore, Aim 2 experiments focused on exploring with greater detail the action of the compound K 201 on RyRs, SERCA and Ca 2 + signaling. We found that K 201 is a more potent SERCA blocker than RyR agonist and that SERCA inhibition remains under acidosis mimicking ischemic conditions. In Aim 3, the focus was on testing drugs with potential to prevent the overloaded SR from leaking Ca 2 + (via RyRs) upon reperfusion. For that, we have examined various classes of organic polycationic agents in their ability to act as fast and reversible RyRs blockers. Currently, no agent with these characteristics is availableas a therapeutic or has been well defined for use as an experimental drug. The membrane permeable cation DHBP was identified as a potent RyR inhibitor with potential for rapid and transient inhibition of spontaneous SR Ca 2 + release during reperfusion. In summary, we have defined the ability of some BZTs and antiepileptic agents (K 201, CGP analog, <b>Sipatrigine</b> and Pimozide) to prevent/slow down SR Ca 2 + overload by inhibition of SERCA, which may {{play an important role in}} their mechanisms of cell protection in ischemic events. In the case of BZT, these drugs may help their cause by producing mild activation of RyR 2 channels, In addition, we have identify DHBP as a reversible and fast acting RyR inhibitor with potential as template for development of transient inhibitors of spontaneous SR Ca 2 + release which may have significant protective action against injury during early reperfusion of the heart...|$|E
40|$|P 2 X 7 receptors {{exhibit a}} mainly non-neuronal {{localisation}} on immune and glial cells and primarily function as non-selective cation channels. After prolonged or repeated exposure to agonist, functional and cellular changes occur: {{the formation of}} a large diameter pore, cell lysis and the release of mature, biologically active interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) a potent inflammatory cytokine. It is this repertoire of functions, along with its localisation that underlies the hypothesis for its involvement in pain processing. The biophysics and pharmacology of rat P 2 X 7 receptors were investigated using stable cell lines. Increases in the current amplitude were shown to be dependent upon the agonist concentration and current deactivation was agonist application number and voltage dependent. These results increased our understanding of the receptor, but have also had implications for the design of protocols to investigate antagonist potency and efficacy. GSK 31418 A was identified as a potent, reversible and voltage-independent antagonist of rat and human P 2 X 7 receptors. GSK 314181 A was > 10000 fold selective over P 2 X 4 receptors and > 1000 fold selective over P 2 X 2 / 3 receptors. GSK 314181 A produced a significant reversal of FCA-induced hypersensitivity when profiled in vivo, providing further validation of the role of P 2 X 7 receptors in inflammatory pain. Although the influence of glia cells on neuronal activity in the CNS is now well documented, the role of peripheral glia, Schwann cells and satellite cells of sensory ganglia, is less well established. Non-neuronal cells in DRG cultures were shown to express P 2 X 7 receptors by pharmacological, biophysical and immunofluorescence techniques. Native P 2 X 7 receptors expressed on these cells were shown to have many of the properties of recombinant P 2 X 7 receptors, in regards to the response to agonist activation and pharmacology. Finally, I have shown that Lamotrigine is an effective inhibitor of recombinant rat and human P 2 X 7 receptors and native P 2 X 7 receptors expressed in DRG. The potent inhibition of human P 2 X 7 by Lamotrigine was replicated with the chemical analogue and neuroprotective agent <b>Sipatrigine.</b> However, little effect was recorded for a P 2 X 7 antagonist in two models of epileptiform activity studies.
