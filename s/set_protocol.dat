40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} carried out to compare {{infectious}} complications between patients with and without a <b>set</b> <b>protocol</b> for prostate biopsy. Materials and methods: Patients whom underwent prostate biopsy at our hospital from 2001 to 2012 were first identified. Two different groups of patients were then selected from 2 different years. The cut-off year in which we started to implement a standardized protocol for prostate biopsy was 2007. Data from the patient group without a <b>set</b> <b>protocol</b> were collected from January 2001 to December 2001. Data from the patient group with a <b>set</b> <b>protocol</b> were collected from January 2012 to December 2012. Results: A total of 246 patients were selected from 2 different years. Ninety-two patients were collected from January to December 2001 (without <b>set</b> <b>protocol).</b> One hundred and fifty-four patients were collected from January to December 2012 (with <b>set</b> <b>protocol).</b> In the first group, the infectious complication rate was 10. 75 % (10 / 92), whereas in the second group, the infection rate was 1. 3 % (2 / 154). All minor complications (such as hematuria, hematospermia, dysuria, etc.) were self-resolving within 1 month. Most infectious complications were managed during outpatient department (OPD) hours with oral antibiotics. Only one patient required hospitalization (from 2001). None of the positive culture results revealed any resistant strain species. Conclusion: The minor complications were similar in both groups and were all self-resolving. Infectious complications were more prevalent in the group without a <b>set</b> <b>protocol.</b> Adequate perioperative preparation and postoperative antibiotic regimens appear to be helpful {{in the prevention of}} infectious complications...|$|E

Methods: Nine healthy, previously untrained males participated in this study. All participants performed both a 1 set and 3 <b>set</b> RT <b>protocol</b> (10 exercises, 10 RM), with the previously stated measurements taken at each time point. Results: Measured REE, FFA, G, and I levels {{were not significantly different}} at any time point (P > 0. 05). Measured RQ was significantly lower (0. 81) 24 hours after exercise compared to baseline (0. 85) within the 3 <b>sets</b> <b>protocol.</b> There was a trend for increased EI after 3 sets compared to 1 set. Muscle soreness was significantly (P 0. 05) higher during the 3 <b>sets</b> <b>protocol</b> the day of exercise and during the 24 to 48 hr post exercise period compared to 1 set. Conclusion: Three sets resulted in more fat kilocalories burned at rest after exercise compared to 1 set.

A secondary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether participants displayed a learning effect when tested using the <b>SET</b> <b>protocol</b> across three days. A repeated measures design was used, testing participants on days 1, 7, and 8. Nineteen participants (20. 05 ± 1. 26 years old) from Utah State University’s women’s soccer team completed data collection. Participants were not excluded based on history of lower extremity injury, concussion, or current illness if it did not affect participation in normal soccer activities. The VSR Sport force plate and NeuroCom® Balance Manager® software was used to complete the SET. The <b>SET</b> <b>protocol</b> instructions were followed, with the modification of all single-leg stances performed on the right leg. Test-retest reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and typical error. An ICC of 3 ̆e. 75 was considered clinically acceptable. Learning effects were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance and pairwise comparisons. Composite score ICC values ranged between. 56 -. 66, indicating moderate clinical reliability. ICC values by condition ranged from. 16 -. 71. Small to moderate typical error values were found.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of the Secure Electronic Transaction (<b>SET)</b> <b>protocol,</b> Hanaoka et al. proposed a light weight version of the <b>SET</b> <b>protocol,</b> called "LITESET"at ACISP ' 98.

We propose another way to construct an efficient <b>SET</b> <b>protocol,</b> called "Slim SET(SSET) ". For acheiving the same security level and efficiency, SSET uses the domainverifiable signcryption scheme that only predetermined n participants within the domain of protocol participants can decrypt their own part of message and verify the whole transaction.

The first stage of the <b>SET</b> <b>protocol,</b> namely Cardholder Registration, has been defined in book [1] respectively.
