In just his third start of the season, on April 12, 2014, Anderson broke his index finder while batting, sending him to the {{disabled}} list. He rejoined the Rockies rotation in July and he pitched well for them for the next month. However, on August 5, he had to leave his <b>start</b> <b>early</b> due to back spasms He wound up undergoing season-ending back surgery to repair a herniated disc in his lower back. He made only eight starts for the Rockies in the injury riddled season, with a 1–3 record and a 2.91 ERA. After the season, the Rockies declined Anderson's $12 million option for 2015, making him a free agent.|$|E
500|$|In his master's thesis, Bánáthy {{established}} his reasoning for focusing on developing leadership skills in youth rather than adults.

[...] He felt leadership development needs to <b>start</b> <b>early</b> in life, when an opportunity exists to give individuals long-term exposure to leadership behavior. Bánáthy formulated the White Stag program {{to address the needs}} of youth from 11 to 17 years of age. He did this when defining leadership as a learnable skill was still in its infancy.|$|E
500|$|UN Women {{believe that}} {{violence}} against women [...] "is rooted in gender-based discrimination and social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate such violence", and advocate moving from supporting victims to prevention, through addressing root and structural causes. They recommend programmes that <b>start</b> <b>early</b> in life and are directed towards both genders to promote respect and equality, an area often overlooked in public policy. This strategy, which involves broad educational and cultural change, also involves implementing {{the recommendations of the}} 57th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (2013). To that end the 2014 UN International Day of the Girl Child was dedicated to ending the cycle of violence.

500|$|Morrison's hip {{continued}} to hinder his play in 2006–07, {{contributing to a}} slow <b>start</b> <b>early</b> in the season. Later in the campaign, he set a Canucks record for consecutive regular season games played (colloquially known as an [...] "ironman streak"); he had not missed a contest since arriving to the team from New Jersey. Playing against the Los Angeles Kings on February 22, 2007, he surpassed Trevor Linden's old club record of 482 consecutive games played (his overall streak was at 491 games, including eight contests played with the Devils prior to his trade). Three days later, he became the League's active ironman when Avalanche defenceman Kārlis Skrastiņš was forced to miss a game with a knee injury. Skrastiņš had played in 495 consecutive games, while Morrison had 492 at the time. Offensively, Morrison finished the year with his sixth consecutive 50-point season in the NHL with 20 goals and 31 assists over 82 games. The Canucks returned to the post-season and advanced to the second round, where they were eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks. Morrison recorded 4 points in 12 playoff games.|$|E
500|$|On April 11, Sestak held {{a debate}} with Toomey in Philadelphia without Specter present, which media {{observers}} {{described as an}} explicit criticism of Specter for refusing to hold more than one debate with Sestak. During that debate, Sestak strongly attacked Toomey's voting record in what The Morning Call reporter Colby Itkowitz described as [...] "an obvious effort to show Democrats that he could hold his own {{in a general election}} matchup". At the end of the debate, Toomey voiced respect for Sestak and described him as a more principled man than Specter, who he criticized for not participating in more debates. Later that month, when the Senate candidates publicly released their quarterly campaign finance reports on April 15, it was revealed Toomey raised more {{in the first three months}} of 2010 than either Democratic candidate, adding $2.3 million to his total $4.1 million war chest compared to Specter adding $1.1 million to his total $9.1 million fund. Political analysts attributed this to the national swing in momentum toward Republicans, and said that it could indicate the Republicans would be victorious in many Senate races, including in Pennsylvania. Sestak raised $442,000 in the three-month period, down from his previous quarter, which Specter's campaign said proved Democratic donors had rejected his candidacy. Specter's fundraising advantage was significant because it allowed him to <b>start</b> <b>early</b> in running political campaign commercials.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{data from}} {{longitudinal}} studies {{conducted by the}} U.S. Department of Education, researchers Judy Goldberg Dey and Catherine Hill analyzed some 9,000 college graduates from 1992–93 and more than 10,000 from 1999–2000. The researchers controlled for a multitude of variables, including: occupation, industry, hours worked per week, workplace flexibility, ability to telecommute, whether employee worked multiple jobs, months at employer, marital status, [...] whether employee had children, and whether employee volunteered in the past year. The study found that wage inequities <b>start</b> <b>early</b> and worsen over time.

In 2011, the Wellington City Council, Mayor Celia Wade-Brown and local business leaders reiterated their support for lengthening the runway, as part of the Airport's 2030 Long Term Plan, however questions were raised about a possible conflict of interest regarding the then incumbent Mayors' role on Infratil's board of directors. The same year, Upper Hutt mayor Wayne Guppy called for further action on a runway extension, with a spokesman for the airport confirming a proposal to lengthen the southern end of the runway by 300m at an estimated cost of $1 million a metre which could <b>start</b> <b>early</b> 2015.
