Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front.

By {{far the largest}} part of this population is the North-East Arctic Cod, as it is labelled by the ICES, or the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock, {{also referred to as}} skrei, a Norwegian name meaning something like [...] "the wanderer", distinguishing it from coastal cod. The North-East Arctic Cod is found in the Barents Sea area. This stock spawns in March and April along the Norwegian coast, about 40% around the Lofoten archipelago. Newly hatched larvae drift northwards with the coastal current while feeding on larval copepods. By summer the young cod reach the Barents Sea where they stay {{for the rest of their}} life, until their spawning migration. As the cod grow, they feed on krill and other small crustaceans and fish. Adult cod primarily feed on fish such as capelin and herring. The northeast Arctic cod also shows cannibalistic behaviour.

40|$|Dynamics {{of salmon}} {{resources}} is {{of a great}} importance to most countries in the Baltic Sea region, including Lithuania. Currently, human activity is the main cause of negative impact on salmon <b>stocks</b> <b>status</b> mainly through habitat loss. Salmon restocking program started in 1998 with the aim to recover stocks in the Nemunas River basin. The program involved artificial rearing, construction of fish ladders, protection of spawning grounds, stock monitoring, fishery regulation in the sea and rivers. Our study presents data on salmon <b>stocks</b> <b>status</b> and productivity in Lithuania, including abundance of fry and smolts, age composition and genetic structure of the populations. In total, 12 rivers in Lithuania have salmon populations, but the status of the populations varies. Despite the many measures taken, smolt production in Nemunas basin is increasing slowly. Notable increase in production was observed only in recent years. Production increased substantially during 2007 - 2010 period, from 13 thousand individuals to over 47 thousand. Salmon parr density in studied rivers varied from 0. 3 – 33. 7 per 100 m² (mean value 9. 8 individuals per 100 m²). Mitochondrial, microsatellite and SNP DNA markers were used to investigate genetic structure of salmon populations. MtDNA was subjected to RFLP analysis, 17 microsatellite loci were used as markers, also samples genotyped with 5568 SNPs. Salmon population from the Nemunas basin was fixed at one haplotype for mtDNA and fell into the same group as the populations from Latvia, Estonia, Russia and Southern Sweden. Microsatellite DNA and SNPs demonstrated distinctiveness from other neighboring populations, however it also indicated lower genetic variability, which could be caused by bottleneck event...|$|R

The apparent stability in landings over the last 50 years masks {{the fact that the}} fisheries have been sustained at the cost of a dramatic increase in fishing pressure, and a change in species composition and fishing grounds. Major changes occurred between 1950 and 1970 s with a major decrease in the global biomass index.

Both the Primary Production Required by the fishery and the Fishing in balance index have declined since the 1980 s. All indices lead to conclude to a pervasive overexploitation over the last 30 years. Most exploited species considered are characterized by a severe truncation of their length and age structures, the reliance of the fishery on new recruits, and a large proportion of immature individuals in the landings. For most assessed stocks, fishing mortality is higher than Fmax and close to Fpa. Rebuilding the stocks will require a 2 - 3 -fold decrease in fishing mortalit...|$|R

40|$|Parastichopus regalis (Cuvier, 1817) is {{the most}} {{expensive}} seafood product on the catalonian market (NE Spain), with prices around 130 €/Kg (fresh weight). Despite its ecological and economic importance, biological and genetic information on this sea cucumber species is scarce. We provided the first insight on the genetic structure of P. regalis using sequences of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and 16 S genes, as well as a morphological description of its populations. Individuals were collected in six locations along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, including an area under fishery pressure (Catalonia). We found high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity for both genes, with higher levels of genetic diversity observed on COI gene. Population pairwise fixation index (FST), AMOVA and correspondence analysis (CA) based on COI, revealed significant genetic differentiation among some locations. However, further analysis using nuclear markers (e. g. microsatellites) would be necessary to corroborate these results. Moreover, the genetic and morphological data may indicate fishery effects on the Catalonian population with decrease of the size and weight average and lower genetic diversity compared to locations without fishery pressure. For an appropriate management of this species, we suggest: 1) an accurate assessment of the <b>stocks</b> <b>status</b> along the Spanish coasts; 2) the study of the reproductive cycle of this target species and the establishment of a closed fishery season according to it; 3) the founding of protected areas (i. e. not take zones) to conserve healthy populations and favour the recruitment on the nearby areas...|$|R

IOTC judges albacore in the Indian Ocean are not overfished, but maintaining or increasing effort in the core albacore fishing grounds is likely to result in further declines in albacore biomass.
