5000|$|... 1971 Production of the M 100 AL began. This was {{the first}} combine {{harvester}} {{in the world to}} be equipped with a crosswise and longitudinal <b>Self-levelling</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1999, SAME {{introduced}} the Galileo <b>self-levelling</b> <b>system</b> in the Rubin 200 tractor range. This system, developed to facilitate working on gradients, won the Golden Tractor for design Millennium Edition award in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|At a {{time when}} few {{passenger}} vehicles had independent suspension on all wheels, {{the application of the}} hydraulic system to the car's suspension system to provide a <b>self-levelling</b> <b>system</b> was an innovative move. This suspension allowed the car to achieve sharp handling combined with very high ride quality, frequently compared to a [...] "magic carpet".|$|E
5000|$|The 6.9 was {{the first}} Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the {{hydropneumatic}} <b>self-levelling</b> suspension <b>system</b> introduced by Citroën in 1954, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed air suspension.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 it had {{produced}} the world's first hydropneumatic <b>self-levelling</b> suspension <b>system</b> then, in 1955, the revolutionary DS, the first mass production car with modern disc brakes and, in 1967, it introduced {{in several of}} its models, swiveling headlights that allowed for greater visibility on winding roads; these automobiles have received various international and national level awards, including three European Car of the Year.|$|R
5000|$|... 1955 saw the {{introduction}} of the DS, the first full usage of Citroën's now legendary hydropneumatic <b>self-levelling</b> suspension <b>system,</b> tested on the rear suspension of the Traction in 1954, which was also the first production car with modern disc brakes.A single high-pressure hydraulic system was used to activate the power steering, the suspension and brakes, the brakes were power assisted to multiply the force applied by the driver.On the [...] "Citromatic" [...] (semi-automatic transmission) version, the system also operated the clutch, through a system of pistons in the gearbox cover to shift the gears in the transmission.From 1968, the DS also introduced directional headlights, that moved with the steering, improving visibility at night.The streamlined car was remarkable for its era and had a remarkable sounding name - in French, DS is pronounced , which sounds the same as , which means Goddess. It placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century competition.|$|R
50|$|A three-speed {{automatic}} transmission (a Turbo Hydramatic 350 sourced from General Motors) was standard. A four-wheel independent suspension {{with coil springs}} was augmented with a hydraulic <b>self-levelling</b> <b>system</b> (using the same system as did Citroën, but without pneumatic springs, and with the hydraulic components built under licence by Rolls-Royce), at first on all four, but later on the rear wheels only. Four wheel disc brakes were specified, with ventilated discs added for 1972.|$|E
5000|$|The {{convertible}} version Continental GT Speed includes ME17 engine management system, <b>self-levelling</b> <b>system</b> set 10 mm {{lower than the}} 575PS Continental GT convertible, Electronic Stability Control with Dynamic Mode, matrix radiator grille and bumper air intakes in dark-tint chrome finish, 21" [...] Speed alloy wheels in silver or an optional dark tint, diamond-quilted hide upholstery, Dark Tint Aluminium 'engine spin' finish (optional fine wood veneers, satin-finish Carbon Fibre option for fascia and centre console), top speed of 325 kph mph.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employs locking central and rear differentials {{to provide additional}} traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, {{also known as the}} transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear axle torque split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear axle torque split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and a steering wheel angle sensor to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986-1991) used a mechanical pressure test lever to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical test switch to break power to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock <b>self-levelling</b> <b>system</b> (SLS) when installed. Initially plagued with reliability factors, the multi-plate clutch central differentials were subject to failure; it was discontinued in 1993.|$|E
50|$|Only the modular six-cylinder engines were {{available}} from model year 1995 on. The front suspension was redesigned to more closely match {{that of the}} 850. The rear suspension received a completely redesigned multi-link independent system with a single fibreglass transverse leaf spring. The 1995 estate received independent rear suspension. Volvo reported that the single composite leaf spring used in the rear suspension of the 960 estate had the same mass as {{just one of the}} two springs it replaced. Boge's Nivomat <b>self-levelling</b> rear suspension <b>system</b> became an option rather than standard equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The 6.9 was {{the first}} Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the {{hydropneumatic}} <b>self-levelling</b> suspension <b>system</b> introduced by Citroën in 1954, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed air suspensions. Using a combination of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or [...] "accumulators" [...] in lieu of conventional shock absorbers and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's timing chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citroën's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citroën system thus might result in loss of suspension. Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven {{in the event of}} a hydraulic failure. The special hydraulic fluid required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, ride height could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50 mm) for increased ground clearance.|$|R
50|$|Chairman W {{is offered}} in six trims with two engines, a limo version, and an {{additional}} AWD 4-Tronic (Mercedes-Benz 4Matic).XGi360, once used for New Chairman, is transferred to the entry model with a straight 6-cylinder engine, and the 5-liter V8 Mercedes-Benz M113 engine and the 7G-Tronic transmission (the largest V8 engine produced in South Korea) are applied to two high-end models, VVIP and the long-wheel-base version. It has an electronically controlled <b>self-levelling</b> air suspension <b>system</b> with a rebound coil that helps reduce noise and vibration, {{as well as an}} extended rear passenger space and the front and rear both have their own screen to control the car's entertainment system, similar to Chrysler's MyGig.|$|R
30|$|UV-NIL is the lithographic method, {{offered by}} the {{custom-built}} machine, which offers the highest single exposure resolution. By first defining and etching a mould using EBL and reactive ion etching (RIE), one may cast a UV-transparent elastomer such as PDMS onto the mould, relieve it and mount it on the stepper head (with {{the assistance of a}} quartz or glass back plate) to create a UV-NIL stamp (the details of how to fabricate such a device are detailed in Section S 2 of Additional file 1). This style of stamp is advised because its elastomeric qualities act as a <b>self-levelling</b> <b>system.</b> Step-and-flash nanoimprint lithography (SF-NIL) may then be carried out using the machine. G-code can be compiled to automatically step out a full wafer of pattern for rapid replication or scaling of the original stamp pattern (an example of which may be found in the Additional file 1).|$|E
50|$|Far less {{conventional}} was the Guy Wulfrunian {{which was}} even more avant-garde than the Atlantean, {{it was designed to}} the requirements of the independent West Riding company and featured a front engine on the front entrance platform, instead of a front radiator it had two Cave-Browne-Cave heat exchangers on the upper deck front face to provide passenger heating and ventilation as well as engine cooling. The front wheels had double wishbone independent suspension and like the rear axle had a <b>self-levelling</b> air suspension <b>system,</b> the foundation braking was by disc brakes on all four wheels with a drum brake on the driveshaft providing the parking brake and the fluid flywheel adapted to serve as an integral retarder. At a time when only Jaguar and Ferrari road cars had front discs this was a technological adventure, like the AEC Routemaster and Midland Red's motorway coach it was shown with its Roe body in a cutaway-centre spread of boy's comic The Eagle where it took its place alongside V-Bombers, nuclear submarines and Deltic locomotives. Roe bodied 131 out of the 137 Wulfruninans built from 1959 to 1965.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Since the {{discovery}} of ‘bright spots’ associated with hydrocarbon deposits, ever increasing interest in determining lithological subsurface parameters has been a driving force for technological development in the hydrocarbon exploration industry. Quantification of lithological parameters is of utmost importance for reservoir prediction and monitoring. Amongst various attempts to determine these, attribute analysis of pwave data and the direct observation of shear wave data are the most visible and successful methods applied. The direct observation of shear waves in the marine environment has been attempted by several means, mainly using ocean bottom cables (OBC) that have three-component geophones (3 C) and a hydrophone in addition (thus 4 C in total). Some manufacturers offer two component geophones with only one horizontal component. These cables are {{laid out on the}} seafloor, sometimes even buried using specialized tools like ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Data transfer is through the cables as in streamers or land operations, recording is made on a boat or platform where the cable terminates. Geophones are housed in tubes with a <b>self-levelling</b> gimballed mounting <b>system,</b> damped by a viscous fluid. This technique is regarded as proven technology and has been widely accepted. Especially in production areas with many man-made obstacles, this technique also offers a safe operation, and is especially suitable for monitoring purposes (4 D– 4 C seismic). Any desired geometry and density of receivers can be laid out. Direct shear wave observations have been made by several academic institutions, both for active seismic exploration as well as for passive seismological monitoring of earthquakes. These institutions have built ocean bottom seismometers (OBS), which are also four component, two sensor instruments. Unlike OBC, they are autonomously lowered to the seafloor, record within specified time windows, and are later brought back to the surface. Amongst the various instruments designed over the past decades is the OBS range built at GEOMAR, which – due to its modular design – has been used {{for a wide range of}} applications...|$|R
