40|$|Empowerment is {{a complex}} concept that draws on education, psychological, social learning, social-structure and socio-ecological {{theories}} {{from a range of}} disciplines. It has multiple applications and its approaches can be used to highlight and address power relations, <b>social</b> exclusion, <b>marginalisation</b> and inequity. Despite this, the word empowerment is often misunderstood and in Australia its use is often framed from within the dominant culture. There are a limited number of studies that explore what Aboriginal Australians understand empowerment for themselves. This article presents the narratives from in-depth, semistructured, face-to-face interviews with Aboriginal women in Rockhampton, Central Queensland. Their words resonate some of their experiences and understandings of empowerment and the on-going impacts of Australia’s colonial history on their everyday lives and why empowerment approaches are vital...|$|R

40|$|The essay {{discusses}} Danish urban {{politics and}} its present-day challenges in two partly separated sections: first, the intra-urban issues of <b>social</b> change, <b>marginalisation</b> and exclusion, and related problems; and secondly, inter-urban or regional development.

Urban policy is a quite broad topic, which cannot easily be defined. In this essay, urban policy is used more pragmatically. In general, it can be used in three different ways: as a policy directed towards steering and regulating cities and their internal conditions; as a sector policy targeted at specific urban phenomena, such as traffic policy, housing and planning policies; and as sector policies, such as financial or social policy with unintended urban effects. This essay will focus on the first, intended sort of urban policies, although others forms have had major impact on the shaping of urban conditions...|$|R

He then used his fortune and overseas contacts to help build 120 schools in the Waldensian valleys, a Waldensian hospital, an elegant church and Waldensian headquarters in Torre Pellice in what is still known as 'the English Quarter'. He worked to strengthen the Waldensian education system and rebuild their ancient missionary zeal to carry the Waldensian faith across Italy. He built the Waldensian Church in Turin and represented them before the Dukes of Savoy in Turin. He was widely regarded as 'a father' to these people and he married a Waldensian believer from the valleys in 1850. A book, published in Italian in 2012, entitled [...] "The General of the Valdesi" [...] (Waldensians) along with the Waldensian church buildings which still distinguish Torre Pellice reflect the impact that Charles Beckwith had throughout these valleys.|$|E

30|$|Stress {{emerged as}} a cause of both antenatal and {{postnatal}} depression with causes including: loss of control, lost expectation, isolation, economic hardship, marginalisation and infant temperament. The literature reviews identified empirical studies that suggested that antenatal stress and depression resulted in altered infant temperament which in turn w{{as a cause of}} postnatal stress and depression. Other empirical studies indicated that antenatal maternal stress had effects on the foetus that potentially affected the life course. Similarly there were studies indicating a causal link between postnatal depression, poor maternal-infant attachment and detrimental impacts on child development. Support {{emerged as a}} protective factor against <b>social</b> <b>marginalisation,</b> isolation, stress and loss of control. That support was in turn influenced by family, social networks or social capital, social cohesion and social services. The quantitative studies supported the above emerging causal network but also indicated that ethnic diversity played a complex role in relation to social support. The macro role of globalisation was identified as impacting on economic and <b>social</b> <b>marginalisation</b> and maternal expectations.|$|E

The requirements are expressed by the parents of the children and by adolescents and are in contrast to official views of their 'needs'. There is no literature on the needs of these children and adolescents. The thesis thus begins with a examination of the literature on the needs of people with disabilities and people with spinal cord injury. Proponents of the social model of disability, which is based on the experiences of people with disabilities, contend that the main requirements of people with disabilities is ending their <b>social</b> <b>marginalisation,</b> and it is hypothesised that the requirements of the children and adolescents will be related to ending <b>social</b> <b>marginalisation.</b> Open-ended unstructured interviews with parents, parents and adolescents and adolescents alone (a total of 20 interviews) provided data for analysis. Analysis of the data shows that the requirements of the children and adolescents, like adults with spinal cord injuries, differ from those of people with disabilities in that there are important concerns in addition to marginalisation...|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{colonization}} of the Americas and Oceania by Europeans, the cultural, ethnic and linguistic make-up of the Americas and Oceania has been changed. This is most visible in former settler colonies {{such as the}} United States of America, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile and New Zealand, where the traditional indigenous population has been predominantly replaced demographically by non-indigenous settlers. This demographic takeover in settler countries has often resulted in the linguistic, <b>social,</b> and cultural <b>marginalisation</b> of indigenous people. However, even in countries where large populations of indigenous people remain or the indigenous peoples have mixed (mestizo) considerably with European settlers, such as Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Ecuador, relative marginalisation still exists.|$|R
40|$|Social work {{education}} {{is familiar with}} concepts such as <b>social</b> exclusion, <b>marginalisation,</b> anti-discriminatory and anti-oppressive practice. This familiarisation implies that students are adequately prepared to embrace equality and diversity, become 'culturally competent' and subscribe to moral and ethical standards including the rights of service users to respect and support regardless of sexual orientation. The ability of social work students to articulate and develop their own theories for practice and to handle personal issues when these conflict with 'theories' on equality and diversity are important aspects of learning. Educators teaching about sexual orientation issues however currently have fewer texts or support networks to draw on when addressing these. This paper looks at the effectiveness of 'debate' and 'role play' as pedagogical strategies and tools when teaching complex ethical issues on a law and ethics module. Dramatic and creative participative methods were used through the tools of debate and role play. These were used with students to explore a specific topic around gay adoption {{in the context of}} learning about anti-discriminatory law.

40|$|The latest data {{indicate}} that between 540, 000 and 760, 000 people are infected with HIV in China. Although minority nationalities represent 8. 1 % of China's total population, they {{account for more than}} 30 % of the reported HIV/AIDS cases. This study examined stigma and discrimination against drug abusers and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in a Dai minority nationality community in Yunnan, China. The study used qualitative research methods, which included participatory observations, in-depth interviews, focus-group discussions, transect walking and community mapping. A combination of different sampling strategies was used to maximise diversity of the initially selected sample. The data revealed deeply entrenched stigma and overt discrimination against drug abusers and PLHA that manifested in familial, work, civil and institutional contexts. The stigma reflected pre-existing cultural, religious sanctions against "deviant behaviours". Intervention programmes that were insensitive to the local culture and religion may have also contributed in part to the stigmatisation of drug abusers and PLHA. The major impact of stigma was that it created a vicious cycle of <b>social</b> isolation, <b>marginalisation</b> and thus addiction relapse. This in turn reinforced the stigmatisation and discrimination against drug abusers and thus hindered efforts towards prevention and control of HIV/AIDS.
