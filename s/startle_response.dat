40|$|The Antisocial {{personality}} disorder (ASPD), {{one of the}} most common co-morbid psychiatric disorders in heroin-dependent patients, is associated with a lack of affective modulation. The present study aimed to compare the affect-modulated <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> of opioid-maintained heroin-dependent patients with and without ASPD relative to those of healthy controls. Sixty participants (20 heroin-dependent patients with ASPD, 20 heroin-dependent patients without ASPD, 20 healthy controls) were investigated in an affect-modulated startle experiment. Participants viewed neutral, pleasant, unpleasant, and drug-related stimuli while eye-blink responses to randomly delivered startling noises were recorded continuously. Both groups of heroin-dependent patients exhibited significantly smaller <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> (raw values) than healthy controls. However, they showed a normal affective modulation: higher <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> to unpleasant, lower <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> to pleasant stimuli and no difference to drug-related stimuli compared to neutral stimuli.

40|$|Background: Previous data in both rat {{and mouse}} genetic models {{suggest that there}} is a genetic {{relationship}} between acute alcohol withdrawal responses and innate alcohol drinking behavior. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine whether acute alcohol withdrawal responses, as measured by acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle, may be genetically related to innate differences in alcohol preference in two mouse lines selectively bred for high (HAP 1 and HAP 2) or low (LAP 1 and LAP 2) alcohol preference. Line differences in <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> at baseline, prior to alcohol or saline treatment, were also measured. Methods: Alcohol-naive, male and female HAP 1 (n= 35) and LAP 1 (n= 32) and HAP 2 (n= 43) and LAP 2 (n= 40) mice were tested under baseline conditions and during withdrawal from a single injection of 4. 0 g/kg alcohol or equal volume of saline at 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-injection. Results: On most trial types, baseline <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> and PPI were greater in both HAP lines than in both LAP lines and <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> were greater in males than in females. During acute alcohol withdrawal, both male LAP lines, and LAP 1 females, showed reduced <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> at the 4 -hr time point during acute alcohol withdrawal. In contrast, both HAP 1 males and females showed a trend toward enhanced startle at 4 hrs in withdrawal. No clear differences in PPI during withdrawal were evident. Conclusions: These findings indicate good evidence for a genetic relationship between greater baseline acoustic <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> and PPI and high alcohol preference. Modest support for a genetic correlation between low alcohol preference and reduced <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> at 4 hrs in withdrawal was found in male mice. The suppression in acoustic startle during acute alcohol withdrawal in male LAP lines but not in male HAP lines suggests that a genetic propensity 3 toward low alcohol preference may be related to greater sensitivity to alcohol as measured by acoustic <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> during acute alcohol withdrawal...|$|R

Participants were 17 MVA survivors, 11 of whom participated in a controlled treatment study comparing cognitivebehavioral treatment (CBT) and supportive therapy (ST) versus a waitlist condition. Though participants differed significantly in their pretreatment clinical status and symptom severity, these differences were not reflected by group differences in EMG (at orbicularis oculi) to the stimuli at the initial assessment. Some cue-specificity was found, as all participants showed larger <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> to trauma-related sounds, compared to startle and neutral sounds. At posttreatment, a significant reduction in EMG reactivity to all stimuli was observed in participants who received active treatment (either CBT or ST), compared to waitlist controls.

25|$|Due to {{the gravity}} and {{intensity}} of hearing victims’ stories of abuse, professionals (social workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after hearing about the victim’s experiences with abuse. Research has demonstrated that professionals who experience vicarious trauma show signs of exaggerated <b>startle</b> <b>response,</b> hypervigilance, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts although they have not experienced a trauma personally and do not qualify for a clinical diagnosis of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|In {{many people}} with hyperacusis, an {{increased}} activity develops in the tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear {{as part of the}} <b>startle</b> <b>response</b> to some sounds. This lowered reflex threshold for tensor tympani contraction is activated by the perception/anticipation of loud sound, and is called tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS). In some people with hyperacusis, the tensor tympani muscle can contract just by thinking about a loud sound. Following exposure to intolerable sounds, this contraction of the tensor tympani muscle tightens the ear drum, which can lead to the symptoms of ear pain/a fluttering sensation/a sensation of fullness in the ear (in the absence of any middle or inner ear pathology).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to depression, {{victims of domestic}} violence also commonly experience long-term anxiety and panic, and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by flashbacks, intrusive images, exaggerated <b>startle</b> <b>response,</b> nightmares, and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse. Studies have indicated {{that it is important to}} consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother's best efforts, interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{based on the idea that}} emotion-related {{processing}} happens on various different levels. Common methods that are used to measure different aspects of emotion-related processing exhibit specific sensitivities to one or the other of these separate processing levels. Here, the hypothesis was tested that explicit and implicit measures of emotion-related processing are differently influenced by self-referenced versus unreferenced emotion. The explicit measure was self reported valence and the implicit measure was startle reflex modulation. In one session, emotional scenes were paired with short sentences inducing self-reference (e. g. “this dog will attack you” written underneath the image of an aggressive dog), while in another session, emotional scenes were presented without any reference. During both sessions explicit as well as implicit responses were collected. Self-referenced unpleasant images were rated more negative and self-referenced pleasant images were rated more positive than images with no reference. In contrast, the implicit measure indicated greater <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> related to self-reference regardless of emotion category. Under the common assumption that greater <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> reflect increased affective negativity, this means that self-referenced pleasant images elicited more negative implicit affect than unreferenced pleasant images. However, in both cases (self-referenced and unreferenced) <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> demonstrated valence depended modulation as expected. Thus, in our study <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> demonstrated sensitivity to affective valence as well as self-reference. It is concluded that self-reference is linked to increased motivation, which in turn has been reported to be detectable via startle reflex modulation (SRM) as well...|$|R

The investigation of <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> to pain might contribute to clarifying whether such alterations also expand to motivational defensive reactions. We aimed at comparing <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> to tonic heat pain with high threat (HT) or low threat (LT) in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and controls. As pain-related anxiety and catastrophizing are typically elevated in chronic pain, we expected to find stronger <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> in patients specifically under experimental HT. Methods: Patients with chronic musculoskeletal, preferentially, back pain (N = 19) and matched pain-free controls (N = 19) underwent two pain-related threat conditions (high and low) in balanced order. Only, in the HT condition, 50 % of the trials were announced to include a short further noxious temperature increase at the end. <b>Startle</b> <b>responses</b> to loud tones were always assessed prior to a potential temperature increase in the phase of anticipation and were recorded by surface electromyogram. Results: Surprisingly, we observed no differences in <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> and ratings of emotional and pain responses between patients and controls despite significantly higher pain-related anxiety and catastrophizing in the patients. Overall, startle was potentiated in the HT condition, but only in participants who started with this condition. Conclusion: Our results suggest that, in general, patients with pain are not more responsive emotionally to experimental threat manipulations despite elevated pain anxiety and catastrophizing. Instead, exaggerated responses in patients might be triggered only by individual concerns relating to pain, which are not sufficiently mirrored by our threat paradigm.

Time one startle in the context of neutral pictures predicted depression outcomes at time two, such that larger time one <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> during neutral pictures were associated with the presence of a time two depressive episode and higher time two self-report scores of depression severity (Beck Depression Scale scores). In addition, <b>startle</b> <b>responses</b> during ITIs (occurring in the absence of pictures) also predicted depression outcome, but in the opposite direction.

Sixteen healthy male volunteers participated in four weekly sessions (clonidine 0. 2 mg, modafinil 400 mg, their combination, placebo) in a double-blind, cross-over, balanced design.
