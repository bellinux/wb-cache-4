5|$|KMFDM's {{music has}} since been a fusion of {{electronic}} and heavy metal, with occasional elements of dub, as well as orchestral samples and live horns. Many songs feature prominent backing vocals by female singers such as Dorona Alberti, Travis, and Cifarelli. Many of the musicians who have played in the band are multi-instrumentalists, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> degree of versatility and freedom in the music.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always <b>so.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

25|$|Queens of P. snelleni produce males before females, {{which is}} called protandrous production.

As part of this work, USACE is the number one provider of outdoor recreation in the U.S., <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> significant emphasis on water safety.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the above}} maps can be seen {{directly}} {{in terms of the}} action of PSL and PGL on the associated projective line: PGL(n, q) acts on the projective space Pn−1(q), which has (q'n−1)/(q−1) points, and this yields a map from the projective linear group to the symmetric group on (q'n−1)/(q−1) points. For n = 2, this is the projective line P1(q) which has (q2−1)/(q−1) = q+1 points, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> map PGL(2, q) → S'q+1.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluidized}} bed filter (FBF) is a biological reactor only. The principle is to direct water through a sand (or similar media) bed from below {{so that the}} sand becomes fluidized – behaves like a fluid. This mechanism is seen in liquefaction, quick sand, and industrial processes including municipal sewage treatment. The combined surface of all sand particles in the filter is very large, and <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> large surface for aerobic denitrification bacteria. Therefore, {{the size of the}} filter can be modest.|$|E

25|$|Cousin {{marriage}} normally {{results in}} a reduced bride price. Patai states that bride price to a cousin is usually about half as high as to a nonrelative. Due to the poverty of many families this outlay often requires exceptional effort, and especially because the decision traditionally {{is in the hands}} of the groom's father, these considerations may weigh heavily on the outcome. The bride's family moreover is expected to spend much of the bride price on the bride herself, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reduced incentive to gain a higher price by avoiding cousin marriage.|$|E
25|$|A stock trader {{believes}} that the stock price of Company A will rise over the next month, due to the company's new and efficient method of producing widgets.

Moreover, their contributions were described in some detail by authors such as Vitruvius, Frontinus and Pliny the Elder, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> printed record of their many inventions and achievements.|$|E
