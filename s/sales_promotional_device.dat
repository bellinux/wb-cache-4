40|$|The study {{sought to}} analyse the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> {{activities}} as key fundamentals in the improvement of BIMCOsâ€™ performance. The objectives {{of the study were}} to: identify the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities being used by BIMCO, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities on <b>sales</b> turnover, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities on market share, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities on customer retention, to establish weaknesses of the current promotional activities and finally to identify other factors other than <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities that can improve on the companyâ€™sâ€™ performance. The literature review was used to gain a more in-depth knowledge of the researched problem. The descriptive research design was used to review literature from different authors and websites in relation to the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities to improve the organisation. The literature review chapter will focus on the following subtopics: the definition of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities, the objectives of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> strategies, growth of sales promotion, some types of promotional activities, impact of sales promotion on company performance, other factors that influence changes in company performance and the summary of the chapter. The representative population was the employees and customers (credit and cash) in Zimbabwe. The researcher used descriptive and exploratory research. The data used was collected through questionnaires and secondary data sources and a sample of 30 individuals who included both employees and customers at BIMCO. 20 questionnaires were distributed and 15 were returned, giving a response rate of 75 % and 10 interviews were carried out and 8 were successful giving a response rate of 80 %. Questionnaires and interviews were used as data collection instruments. Microsoft Excel was used in data presentation. In the analysis and interpretation, frequencies, percentages was used and closed and open ended questions were used to gather data from the respondents. Presentation then followed through the use of tables, in an attempt to make the data usable by decision makers. Data collected from the respondents was presented in the form of tables, bar graphs and pie charts. The data was also analysed and interpreted in a descriptive way. In view of the findings of the research study, it is evidenced that price discounts, exhibitions and free samples are the most common <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities being used by BIMCO. The findings revealed that the companyâ€™s current <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities are ineffective therefore there is need to improve the promotional activities to cub the problem accruing for not improving the company performance. The findings also revealed that, other factors to consider that might help in improving the companiesâ€™ performance include the price, quality, brand image, flexibility of payment terms, advertisements as well as skills training. On the conclusions the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities currently in use at BIMCO may not be effective in improving company performance as they have a relatively low influence to the variations in sales performance. It was observed in the study that BIMCO is not concurrently active in sales promotion and yet maintain higher sales volume and profitability. The researcher recognized that sales promotion has a great impact on customers and performance of the organisation as well. Irrespective of the sales increasing it is short lived because there is excitement among customers on price discounts. Recommendations are also suggested for the improvement of the current problem. A number of strategies were recommended which include adding more sales promotion activities, knowing when it is time to use promotional activities and on-the-job training for employees to enhance their experience. Since it has immerged that sales promotion alone can not increase the companyâ€™s market share, it is recommended that the company should produce quality products for their customers. For BIMCO to avoid customers from switching brands unnecessarily, the organisation should embrace more relationship strategies...|$|R

40|$|Many {{scholars}} have stressed {{the significance of}} understanding ethnic minority subcultures and the associated cultural dimension for marketing. Most of the previous research involving ethnic minority consumers has largely focused on coupon usage and remains North American in origin and application. Also, previous research emphasises the short-term nature of sales promotions, ignoring their dynamic effects in specific consumption settings such as the family. The paper explores ethnic consumers' responses to different <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> formats for packaged food products in family settings. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted in original settings involving ethnic participants who regularly shopped at mainstream supermarkets, and who were the principal grocery shoppers for the family. Findings suggest that sales promotions {{have the potential to}} make consumers more responsive, less responsive or even hostile to <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> offers and while some promotions are better perceived than others, their overall effectiveness is largely determined by their “net-worth” as perceived by ethnic consumers in a given shopping situation.

40|$|Either it {{is because}} of some {{significant}} active trends in the business world, or the attractive cut of cost and increase in profit, companies now days are focusing on sales promotion activities. But in reality, most of companies that are introducing new products are not getting what they intend to get. They are facing loses. One of the reasons is lack of understanding which specific sales promotion is preferable at that stage. As the authors described on the background of the study, a lot of studies have been done to indicate preferable <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> tools for consumer’s goods. Even though those studies have found significant results, there is still a gap which needs further investigation. According to those studies, the result that indicates the more preferable <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> tool have to be tested under different discount magnitude range and variety of products. Based on the above gap the study has been undertaken with the purpose of comparing two dominant <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> tools: price and non-price sales promotion. This comparison has been done on three new different consumer goods that have different characteristics. The authors believe that this will contribute to fill the gap on the findings of previous researches on the area of sales promotion. To fulfill the purpose of the study, descriptive and comparative type of study has been conducted by using controlled field experiment. Data has been collected by using structured questionnaire from three undergraduate classes of Umea University, Umea, which are (i. e., classes) selected using judgmental sampling. Collected data has been analyzed using SPSS-descriptive statistics. The result reveals that, consumers of newly introduced consumer good will use the price of the product as a cue for a quality and prefer to have cash discount rather than gift offers. More ever, marketing stimuli (i. e. sales promotion) can have impact on the occurrence of the impulse buying behavior. Therefore, companies that are introducing a new consumer product and using price sales promotion as a strategy are more likely to attract new consumers and create impulse buying behavior, which result in an increase in sales...|$|R
