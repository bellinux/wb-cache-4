5|$|The young ace was {{fatigued}} {{and told}} his brothers he was eagerly anticipating more time off. He ate lunch with his brothers—soup, black bread, coffee, and cake. His brothers noted his haggard appearance, apparent in his final photographs. After the meal, the three Voss brothers posed before Werner's camera, which was equipped with a timed <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> Then Voss was scheduled for another patrol.|$|E
25|$|MINOX Goldknopf 1991–1993, EL- or G-series {{version with}} a solid gold button for <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E
25|$|Focusing can be manual, by {{twisting}} {{the focus on}} the lens; or automatic, activated by pressing half-way on the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> or a dedicated AF button. To take an image, the mirror swings upwards {{in the direction of the}} arrow, the focal-plane shutter (3) opens, and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor (4), after which actions, the shutter closes, the mirror returns to the 45-degree angle, and the built in drive mechanism re-tensions the shutter for the next exposure.|$|E
5000|$|Self-timer: Electronic, l0-second delay, cancellable. When raised, flash pulses as warning before <b>shutter</b> <b>releases.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Motor-Drive R8/R9: {{like the}} Motor-Winder, but larger and gives {{continuous}} 4.5 frame/s shooting {{in addition to}} single-shot and 2 frame/s. It provides additional <b>shutter</b> <b>releases</b> ― on the handgrip and on the vertical grip on the base. Enables three-shot auto-bracketing of exposure in 0.5 or 1 EV increments.|$|R
50|$|Both units add the {{possibility}} of shutter-priority auto exposure mode by setting the lens's aperture ring to 'A'. The aperture needle disappears from the meter display, and the meter needle indicates what aperture the AE system has selected. Also, using either of the motor drive systems also enables use of electronic interval timers and remote <b>shutter</b> <b>releases,</b> both wired and wireless.|$|R
25|$|For a long time, DSLRs offered {{faster and}} more {{responsive}} performance, with less shutter lag, faster autofocus systems, and higher frame rates. Around 2016-17, specific mirrorless camera models started offering competitive or superior specifications in these aspects. The downside of these cameras being {{that they do not}} have an optical viewfinder, making it difficult to focus on moving subjects or in situations where a fast burst mode would be beneficial. Other digital cameras were once significantly slower in image capture (time measured from pressing the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> to the writing of the digital image to the storage medium) than DSLR cameras, but this situation is changing with the introduction of faster capture memory cards and faster in-camera processing chips. Still, compact digital cameras are not suited for action, wildlife, sports and other photography requiring a high burst rate (frames per second).|$|E
2500|$|During 1967 through 1969 KMZ {{built an}} {{automatic}} die-cast moulding line, allowing mass camera production. Camera production {{switched to the}} M42×1 thread (also known as Praktica thread) and an instant-return mirror was also developed. This led {{to one of the}} most famous Zenits — Zenit-E which saw (including its subtypes) over 12 million produced. A heavy and tough camera with a mechanism that was of exceedingly simple design along the lines of [...] "what isn't there, can't go wrong". [...] Automatic diaphragm functionality was not available until the introduction of the Zenit-EM, which used a direct mechanism linking the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button to the aperture mechanism, significantly increasing the effort required to release the shutter. [...] Production included both M39×1 and M42×1 mounts for the Zenit E and Zenit B models. [...] Later models were only produced in the M42×1 with the Pentax K mount available for the latest models.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>release</b> modes (and film advance) are {{controlled}} by a 4-position switch surrounding the top-mounted <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button. Positions are: ...|$|E
50|$|Self-Timer - After {{setting the}} timer the {{indicator}} lights for 10 seconds then flashes for 2. After this the <b>shutter</b> will <b>release.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Electronic vertical-travel metal <b>shutter</b> with {{electromagnetic}} <b>release.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> was <b>released</b> on DVD and Blu-ray on July 15, 2008. The Unrated Edition runs 5 {{minutes longer}} and {{includes}} commentary, featurettes, deleted scenes, and an alternate ending.|$|R
50|$|Headphones {{can be used}} as a <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> The + (volume up) button acts as a <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> for the camera.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>release</b> is {{activated}} by pressing the top-mounted <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button or by a cable release inserted {{in a standard}} socket located {{on the side of}} the camera.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exposure}} meter's {{mechanical arm}} is retracted by depressing the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button. As a result, the exposure meter will {{not produce a}} usable reading if the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button is under any pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Serios was an {{unemployed}} bellhop when his {{claims that he}} had the ability to put images on film with his mind {{came to the attention of}} Jule Eisenbud. He was tested by Eisenbud at Denver during a period of three years. Serios usually held a small cylinder or tube he called a [...] "gizmo" [...] up to the lens of an instant camera, which was then pointed at his forehead and the <b>shutter</b> <b>released.</b> He would often be drunk, or at least have been drinking, when he produced his photographs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{with the}} release of the 300mm 2.8L IS II and 400mm 2.8L IS II, IS Mode 3 was added. This mode is similar to Mode 2, except that {{stabilization}} is applied only when the <b>shutter</b> is <b>released.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} Soviet-era rangefinders, the shutter speed {{selector}} rotates when the <b>shutter</b> is <b>released,</b> {{and should not}} be changed until after the shutter has been cocked. If the shutter speed is changed without cocking the shutter first, the setting pin can be broken when the film is advanced.|$|R
5000|$|When set to bulb, {{generally}} on the [...] "M" [...] or manual {{setting of}} the camera, the shutter will stay open {{as long as the}} <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button (or <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> cable or remote) remains depressed.|$|E
5000|$|Drive modes include 10-second self-timer, 2-second delay (in {{the absence}} of remote <b>shutter</b> <b>release),</b> first burst, last burst, 3-shot {{exposure}} bracketing, 5-shot exposure bracketing, time lapse. There is no remote <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> Exposure bracketing cannot be used with self-timer modes.|$|E
50|$|AI Servo AF {{was used}} for moving objects. The lens would {{continuously}} refocus on the object in {{the centre of the}} viewfinder whilst the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button was pressed half-way. Once the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button was fully pressed, the exposure was calculated then the shutter released.|$|E
5000|$|Viewfinder level {{indicator}}. The indicator remains {{active in}} autofocus mode until the <b>shutter</b> is <b>released.</b> (In earlier Canon bodies with this feature, the indicator remains fully active only in manual focus mode; if in autofocus mode, the indicator disappears from view once the shutter button is half-pressed for autofocus.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The camera {{offers the}} {{convenience}} of image composition with wide open aperture. The aperture is stopped down to the selected value after the <b>shutter</b> is <b>released.</b> After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted {{single-stroke film advance lever}} is again wound. Focusing is via a ground glass screen with a central split-image rangefinder.|$|R
50|$|The Zone System {{requires}} that every variable in photography, {{from exposure to}} darkroom production of the print, be calibrated and controlled. The print is the last link in a chain of events, no less important to the Zone System than exposure {{and development of the}} film. With practice, the photographer visualizes the final print before the <b>shutter</b> is <b>released.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... 1g 1953 - 55 SN 400000 - 800000 - Shutter speeds {{changed to}} 25th, 50th,100th instead of old Leica 20th, 30th, 40th, 60th. Threaded shutter button to accept {{standard}} <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> instead of external thread Leica cable release which fitted over the button of earlier cameras. Mushroom type surround to <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E
50|$|Notable {{omissions}} include {{depth-of-field preview}} and {{any form of}} remote <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E
50|$|One-shot AF {{was used}} for {{stationary}} objects. Once in focus, exposure was calculated then the <b>shutter</b> was <b>released.</b> In low light or low contrast situations, the AF auxiliary light would momentarily project a series of red bands on the subject. This then enabled the AF circuits to have a subject with contrast they could focus onto.|$|R
50|$|Sega {{released}} the SegaScope 3-D for the Master System in 1987 for Japan and in 1988 for North America, {{where it was}} the first known electronic device to use LCD Active Shutter glasses. Only eight 3D compatible games were ever released. Nintendo's Famicom also featured a similar Famicom 3D System, which was an LCD <b>shutter</b> headset, <b>released</b> in 1987 only for Japan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> Island was <b>released</b> on DVD and Blu-ray on June 8, 2010, in the US, and on August 2, 2010 in the UK. The UK release {{featured}} two editions—a standard edition and {{a limited}} steel-case edition.|$|R

50|$|Instead of the M42 {{screw mount}} used by Pentax and other camera manufacturers, Nikon had {{introduced}} the three-claw F-mount bayonet lens mount system, {{which is still}} current in a more modified form today. The focal plane shutter had titanium foil blinds and was rated for 100,000 <b>shutter</b> <b>releases.</b> At the time, other SLRs used cloth blinds, which had the disadvantage {{that it was possible}} to burn a hole into the cloth of the shutter during mirror lock-up in bright sunlight.The F was also a modular system camera, with various assemblies such as the viewfinders; the focusing screens; the special 35 mm roll film 250 exposure film back and two Speed Magny film backs--one using the Polaroid 100 (now 600) type pack films, and another designed for 4x5 film accessories, including Polaroid's own 4x5 instant film back. Each of these assemblies could be fitted and removed, allowing the camera to adapt to almost any particular task. It was the first 35 mm camera offered with a successful motor drive system as opposed to a film winder. It was capable of firing up to 4 frames per second (mirror locked up) or 3 frames per section with full reflex viewing maintained.|$|R
50|$|Gitzo {{was founded}} in France by Arsène Gitzhoven in 1917, {{initially}} producing wooden and metal cassette filmbacks, and later expanding to include a line of cameras, <b>shutters,</b> and cable <b>releases.</b> Between 1942 and 1944 during World War II, the company produced military support systems.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Realist, the Kodak had a self-cocking shutter. Like later model Realists it {{had built}} in double exposureprevention {{which could be}} {{overridden}} by the manual shutter cocking lever located {{on the bottom of}} the camera. <b>Releasing</b> the <b>shutter</b> also <b>released</b> the wind mechanism, so once a picture was taken the user needed only to wind the film to be ready for the next one. The rewind knob has a crank, which most consider an improvement over the ordinary rewind knob on the Realist.|$|R
