The {{influence}} of the oil <b>supply,</b> <b>nozzle</b> type, air supply, the performance of sliding friction element under the lubrication preloads were investigated by measuring the element’s temperature and friction coefficient based on the M 2000 -A friction wear testing machine. When the load, rotating speed and air supply is at 1500 N, 210 rpm and 2. 25 m 3 /h level respectively, as the oil supply is increased, the temperature rises and friction coefficient decreases. The temperature rise decreases monotonically. The friction coefficient rises monotonically with the air supply increases when the air supply is less than 2. 4 m 3 /h, but when the air supply is more than 2. 4 m 3 /h, the friction coefficient decreases monotonically. Furthermore, when the oil supply is reached 15 ml/h, they remain almost unchanged regardless of direct nozzle and conical nozzle.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was {{determining}} optimal parameters of the investigated jet-loop reactor {{by means of the}} built by authors low cost PIV system. The criterion of optimization was value of flow rate in a draft tube.

With increase of distance between the nozzle and the upper edge of the draft tube the diameter of the stream with high velocity increases, what causes growth of flow rate of liquid at the outlet. Long draft tube causes disturbance of flow, backward circulation and decrease of flow rate, because of decrease of distance from its lower edge {{to the bottom of the}} reactor. As a result, the liquid circulation may be stopped. Liquid circulation is more intensive in wider draft tubes, wider than diameter of flowing out stream.

40|$|The {{machining}} process 'grinding' is generally critically assessed concerning {{the amounts of}} heat produced during the process operation. Relatively high friction effects in abrasive machining cause heat generation {{which can lead to}} thermal damage in the surface layer of machined parts. Furthermore an inefficient cooling and lubrication system can result in higher tool wear and surface roughness. Therefore the application of cooling lubricants is of utmost importance in grinding. Usually the optimization of the coolant supply system including the selection of the coolant itself is based only upon empirical know-how or practical trial-and-error-tests. Systematic approaches using broader experimental investigations and thus resulting optimized grinding parameters or using fluid mechanical investigations in the coolant <b>supply</b> <b>nozzle</b> or in the grinding gap are not or only rarely applied.

40|$|In {{order to}} control fluid flow within a microactuator, two special types of fluidic beam element, beam {{deflection}} amplifiers and bistable wall attachment amplifiers are miniaturised and investigated. The elements are fabricated out of Plexiglas {{by means of}} the LIGA-technique and their characteristics with different kinds of gas as working fluid are determined. Beam deflection amplifiers, which are fluidic proportional amplifiers, are fabricated with heights up to 500 #mu#m and a nozzle width of 55 #mu#m. They are operated with nitrogen and have a gain of 3. 5 at a supply pressure of 20 hPa. Bistable wall attachment amplifiers, which are fluidic flip flops, are fabricated with heights up to 500 #mu#m and nozzle widths of 30 #mu#m and 60 #mu#m. They are working with Argon, Carbon dioxide and Nitrogen as working fluid. The bistable behaviour can be observed for supply pressures higher than a certain value. Working with nitrogen, this value does not depend on the element height if the aspect ratio (=element height/width of <b>supply</b> <b>nozzle)</b> is greater than 5. In this case it is 260 hPa for elements of 30 #mu#m nozzle width and 140 hPa for elements of 60 #mu#m nozzle width. The control pressure to switch the fluidic flip flop is about 20 hPa at low supply pressures and decreases with decreasing element height. The maximum pressure at the output port at which the jet is directed depends linearly on the supply pressure. It does not depend on the element height for heights greater than 250 #mu#m. The value of the maximum output pressure is about 40 hPa at an element height of 500 #mu#m, a nozzle width of 30 #mu#m and a supply pressure of 330 hPa. The steady state flow within a fluidic flip flop is calculated numerically with finite-element-simulations. The flow through the ports is calculated with 10 % difference to the experiment and the pressure at the output ports with 20 % difference. By means of the calculations an optimization of the element geometry is achieved. In detail the geometry of the control area and the angle of the attachment walls is optimized and the characteristics of the elements are improved. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by J.

40|$|The use of {{biofuels}} {{for heating}} purposes is beneficial from a {{greenhouse gas emission}} point of view. But combustion of solid biofuels typically is related with high emission rates of CO, NOx, PAHs, VOCs and particle matter.

The window is an axially symmetric part that can be approximated by a hemisphere with a cylindrical extension (diameter 0. 31 m height 0. 42 m 0. 42 m). The cooling is accomplished by impinging several air jets onto the concave window surface. Due to concentrated solar radiation, the air <b>supply</b> <b>nozzles</b> can only be installed at the circumference of the cylindrical extension.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and laboratory measurements of the heat transfer have been carried out. In the performed 3 -D simulations, the realizable k-ε model, the k-ω model, and the SST-k-ω model are compared.

40|$|Supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet engines {{have been}} a topic of numerous analytical and experimental studies {{because they have the}} potential to provide sustainable supersonic and hypersonic flight without the added weight and complexity of an onboard oxidizer. Experimental engines have typically been fueled by hydrogen; however, recent trends have favored hydrocarbon fuels for application in simple and realistic systems. Because these fuels are less reactive than hydrogen, mechanical and chemical combustion aids have become common features in the engines intended for use with hydrocarbon fuels. This investigation explores both a mechanical and chemical scheme for aiding the combustion of gaseous ethylene: the radical farming scramjet engine configuration and a premixed supplemental oxidizer. The radical farming scramjet engine was designed to allow combustion at average combustion chamber temperatures lower than those of typical scramjet engine configurations. It was theorized that a large reduction in skin friction could be achieved by this method. Hydrogen was used to fuel the engine for the previous experiments. This investigation presents results obtained from the use of gaseous ethylene as the fuel for the radical farming scramjet engine. Experiments were conducted over a nominal <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> enthalpy of 3 MJ/kg to 7 MJ/kg. The thrust from the experiments was calculated by integrating the centerline pressure distribution over the thrust surface area. A one dimensional thrust prediction was constructed by assuming complete combustion of the fuel at all equivalence ratios. Experimental results were compared to the theoretical prediction at <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> enthalpy of 7 MJ/kg and 4 MJ/kg. Agreement with the one dimensional thrust prediction was observed at equivalence ratios from 0 to 0. 4 for a <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> enthalpy of 7 MJ/kg and from 0 to 0. 2 for a <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> enthalpy of 4 MJ/kg. Above these ranges, the experimental thrust coefficients were found to be lower than the one dimensional prediction. Experimental incremental specific impulse was determined by considering the difference in thrust caused by the injection of a given amount of fuel. Values from the experiments were compared to theoretical and experimental results from previous studies. It was observed that the incremental specific impulse from experiments at Hs = 7 MJ/kg was 1 4 to 1 3 of the impulse predicted in a previously performed quasi-two dimensional analysis for hydrogen. Ethylene was expected to produce approximately half that of hydrogen. Previous experiments with ethylene were cited to demonstrate that the discrepancy between experimental results of the current study and the previously performed quasi-two dimensional analysis was a result of the different flight speeds and varying nozzle expansion ratios. To mix a supplemental source of oxidizer with the fuel prior to injection, an oxygen delivery system was installed in the T 4 shock tunnel. This system functioned similar to the T 4 Fuel Delivery System. The injection system of the radical farming scramjet engine was modified to allow the safe mixing of fuel and oxygen before injection into the engine core. The combined fuel and oxygen injection system was tested prior to experiments using oxygen enrichment. The system was calibrated such that the amount of supplemental oxidizer was capable of stoichiometrically reacting with approximately 25 % of the fuel. Experiments were conducted with oxygen enrichment over a nominal <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> enthalpy of 3 MJ/kg to 7 MJ/kg. Enrichment results from experiments with <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> enthalpy of 4 MJ/kg to 7 MJ/kg were examined for evidence of a decrease in the distance required for combustion, an increase in thrust, or an increase in incremental specific impulse. Average pressure distributions were used to demonstrate a decrease of up to 90 mm in the distance required for the combustion of ethylene. No notable increase in thrust or incremental specific impulse was observed. A repeatable low equivalence ratio separation bubble phenomenon was observed in several enriched experiments at all test conditions. The phenomenon was determined to be a transient effect of the enrichment which consistently produced choked flow through the engine. Experiments at 3 MJ/kg were examined for evidence of combustion. A similar transient bubble behavior was observed during these experiments at low equivalence ratios. Nitrogen was substituted for the oxidizer to demonstrate that the separation bubble phenomenon was the result of combustion immediately after injection...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} stress wave force balance {{technique}} for {{the measurement of}} forces on a fuelled hypersonic flight vehicle in an impulse-type test facility. A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2 % were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3 % were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3 % and their lines of action to within 1 % of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9 %, 7 % and 9 % for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0. 566 m long and weighed approximately 6 kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected {{through a series of}} injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T 4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3. 3 MJ/kg, a <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> pressure of 32 MPa and a Mach number of 6. 6, with equivalence ratios up to 1. 4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2 % of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4 % of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3. 0 at the fuel-off condition to 17. 2 at an equivalence ratio of 1. 0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10 % of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0. 0 to 1. 0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4. 9 MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0. 8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0. 0 and 0. 8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3. 0 MJ/kg and a <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> pressure of 32 MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0. 8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2. 5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> enthalpy of 3. 3 MJ/kg and <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> pressures of 32, 26 and 16 MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0. 0 and 0. 8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a <b>nozzle</b> <b>supply</b> pressure of 16 MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel...|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{nickname}} of MELF components is that most production engineers {{do not like to}} use MELF nozzles on a SMT pick-and-place machine. For them it is waste of time to change from flat nozzles to MELF nozzles. For MICRO-MELF and MINI-MELF most SMD placers are able to use flat chip nozzles if the vacuum is high enough; i.e., higher than for flat chip components. For MELFs with the case size of 0207 or less, it is recommend to use the original MELF <b>nozzle</b> <b>supplied</b> with the SMT machine. Each supplier of such SMD pick-and-place machines offers these types of nozzles.|$|R
40|$|Noise {{data were}} {{obtained}} with a large externally blown flap model. A fan-jet engine exhaust was simulated by a 1 / 2 -scale bypass <b>nozzle</b> <b>supplied</b> by pressurized air. The nozzle was pylon mounted on a wing section having a double-slotted flap for lift augmentation. Noise radiation patterns and spectra were obtained for nozzle exhaust velocities between 400 and 1150 ft/sec. The blown flap noise data are in good agreement with previous small model results extrapolated to test conditions by Strouhal scaling. The results indicate that blown flap noise must be suppressed to meet STOL aircraft noise goals...|$|R

40|$|A new low NO_x {{combustor}} for kerosene fueled micro gasturbine was proposed, and {{the combustion}} characteristics of prototype combustor were investigated. In order {{to enhance the}} recirculation in a primary combustion zone, a swirler was set between the primary and secondary combustion zones. Combustion air was introduced through the swirler and forced to flow upward to the combustor bottom, from where the fuel spray was <b>supplied</b> through a <b>nozzle.</b> To achieve high combustion stability and low emission in wide fuel air ratio, the optimum configuration of the primary combustion zone were investigated.
