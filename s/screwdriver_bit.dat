50|$|The {{surgical}} motor is {{an electronic}} controlled torque-limiting device that also controls the speed. It is {{used with a}} twisted drill to make space in the bone for the implant or to fasten the screw (torque control can be with a torque-limiting attachment) with a <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An External Torx version exists, {{where the}} screw head has {{the shape of}} a Torx <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bit,</b> and a Torx socket is used to drive it. The {{external}} “E” Torx nominal sizing does not correlate to the “T” size, (e.g. an E40 socket is too large to fit an T40 Torx bit, while E8 Torx socket will fit a T40 Torx bit [...] ).|$|E

5000|$|Ruth - Ruth's main trouble (as was {{the case}} for nearly everyone) was having trouble in finding a stud. In {{drilling}} holes in the drywall (in the wall opposite where her toilet used to be), she drills two oversized holes using a <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bit,</b> then tries to drill a hole for a wall plug with a drill bit too small for the plug to fit. Attempting to ream a larger hole using the same bit on her fourth try also fails. In the end, although she has her wall-mount in place, her TV is not mounted at all.|$|E
40|$|The {{screwdriver}} is a {{tool that}} {{has been among the}} most widely used hand tools for decades and continues {{to be used in the}} workplace to perform a variety of fastening tasks. Advancements in fastener technology have been complemented by the development of new types of screwdriver bits. While designs may vary, so do the force application requirements placed on the tool user. The primary objective of this experiment is to analyze the relationship between user torque and <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bit</b> design. A further objective is to utilize the results to develop an effort metric by which bits of different designs can be compared. In this experiment, three types of <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bit</b> designs (straight, Phillips, and combination of straight/Phillips (ECX)) were tested to determine how the design affects the amount and type of force applied by the user when performing a fastening task. The designs were tested to simulate fastener tightening and loosening operations. Sixteen participants were tested in this study. Although there was no significant effect, the data suggest that the Phillips bit design allow subjects to exert the maximum torque and the minimum axial force. This divergence suggests that the Phillips bit may have a highe...|$|E
40|$|Case Presentation This adult {{was working}} on a ladder during a home {{restoration}} project. She placed the bit in her mouth while changing the <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bit,</b> then fell from the ladder and inadvertently swallowed the bit. In the emergency room, her review of systems and laboratories were unremarkable. Imaging revealed the bit to be within the duodenal lumen and after four days of serial xrays, the bit was retrieved by snare colonoscopy at the ileocecal junction. The patient remained asymptomatic and had no complications...|$|E

50|$|Other {{versions}} {{may include}} items like a nail file, tweezers, folding scissors, a tooth pick, a magnifying glass, <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bits</b> and others. There are also versions that have special tools for specific sports or outdoor activities like golf, horseback riding, hunting or fishing. Versions intended for cyclists {{may have a}} selection of allen (hex) keys, a selection of wrenches, screwdrivers, a spoke key, and a chain-breaker.|$|R
50|$|The flats of a hex shank {{can either}} be {{machined}} on a round shank, as in the photograph, or be the natural flats of hex bar stock. A hex shank can be grasped by a 3-jaw drill chuck or held in a chuck specifically for hex shanks. Quarter-inch hex shanks are common for machine <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bits</b> and have spread from that application {{to be used for}} drill bits that are compatible with screwdriver machinery.|$|R
50|$|Multifunction tools may be {{specialized}} for use {{in certain}} activities. Cyclists may carry a folding tool with multiple <b>screwdriver</b> <b>bits</b> or wrenches to allow adjustment of bicycle fasteners during a ride, or for repairing a broken chain. For sport fishermen, a specialized multitool may combine common functions such as cutting fishing line, crimping weights, removing hooks or opening split rings. A specialized multitool {{may be used for}} adjustment, cleaning or minor repair of a firearm in field use. The advantage of a mutlitool is saving weight and space over a set of individual tools to perform the same functions.|$|R

5000|$|Torx (pronounced [...] ), {{developed}} in 1967 by Camcar Textron, is the trademark for {{a type of}} screw head characterized by a 6-point star-shaped pattern. A popular generic name for the drive is star, as in star <b>screwdriver</b> or star <b>bits.</b> The official generic name, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 10664, is hexalobular internal. This is sometimes abbreviated in databases and catalogs as 6lobe (starting with numeral, 6, not a capital letter, G). Torx Plus is an improved head profile.|$|R
40|$|The Fastener Starter is a {{creative}} solution {{to prevent the}} loss of small fasteners during their installation. This is the only currently available tool that can firmly grip and hold a single screw, bolt, nut, washer, spacer, or any combination of these parts. Other commercially available fastener starters are unable to accommodate a variety of parts simultaneously. The Fastener Starter is a more capable and easier tool to use than prior tools. Its compact size allows it to be used effectively in cramped, difficult-to-see locations. Its design also allows it {{to be used with}} or without handles and extenders in other difficult-to-reach locations. It provides better protection against cross threading and loss of fasteners and associated parts. The Fastener Starter is non-magnetic and does not off-gas, thus meeting flight hardware requirements. The Fastener Starter incorporates a combination of features of several commercially available tools, providing an improved means of installing small fasteners. The Fastener Starter includes a custom molded insert that can be removed easily and replaced with a conventional tool bit (e. g., a <b>screwdriver</b> or hex-driver <b>bit).</b> When used with the insert, the Fastener Starter prevents cross threading and damage to internal threaded holes. This is achieved by allowing the fastener to slip within the tool insert when used without a conventional tool bit. Alternatively, without the insert and with a tool bit, the Fastener Starter can torque a fastener. The Fastener Starter has a square recess hole that accepts a conventional square drive handle or extension to accommodate a variety of applications by providing flexibility in handle style and length...|$|R
