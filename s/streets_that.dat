5|$|During World War II, {{the state}} was {{building}} a beltline system for Grand Rapids. This highway, numbered M-114 was decommissioned by 1945 and the <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> composed it were given new designations. Byp. M-21 was routed along 28th Street from Grandville to Paris Township and along East Beltline into Grand Rapids Township. In 1953, the mainline M-21 was rerouted to replace its bypass around downtown, decommissioning the Byp. M-21 designation.|$|E

The library, still operational today, was constructed in 1905 with a combination of philanthropical gifts from different sources including Andrew Carnegie. The building was designed, in part, by architect Paul O. Moratz.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some of {{the functions of the}} Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of the Council of Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the <b>streets,</b> <b>that</b> Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E
5|$|However, by 1973, NY27 {{had been}} cut back to its {{interchange}} with the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn while unsigned I-478 was assigned to both the Battery Tunnel {{and all of the}} West Side Elevated Highway south of the Lincoln Tunnel. NY9A was cut back to the Lincoln Tunnel as a result. The extension of I-478 into Manhattan was eliminated following the collapse of part of the Elevated Highway in 1973, an event which led to the demolition of the highway south of 59th Street. Demolition was completed in 1989. NY9A was shifted onto 12th Avenue, one of the surface <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> the Elevated Highway had run atop of, but was otherwise unaffected as the route's south end was initially kept at the Lincoln Tunnel.|$|E

5|$|In Syracuse, NY5 is {{parallel}} to I-690 for much of its routing but never encounters the highway, thus making the north–south <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> intersect NY5 entry points to and from I-690. In downtown Syracuse, West Genesee Street becomes James Street. At {{the southern tip of}} the interchange between I-690 and I-81, NY5 transfers onto Erie Boulevard and intersects State Street (US11), but passes under I-81 without access. From the downtown area to DeWitt, NY5 is divided. At the Syracuse–DeWitt boundary, NY5 intersects NY635 and eastward, it curves to a southeast course. Near Shoppingtown Mall, NY5 turns east onto Genesee Street to begin an overlap with NY92. Less than a mile east of the mall, NY5 and NY92 intersect I-481 at a cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
5|$|Of the Chinese dialect {{groups that}} {{occupied}} {{the area of}} Middle Road, the Hainanese community was the largest. Its enclave was adjacent to European churches, army camps and the Raffles Hotel, and extended from the seashore along Beach Road westwards towards North Bridge Road. The three <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> run perpendicular to these two – Middle Road, Purvis Street and Seah Street were respectively called Hainan First Street, Hainan Second Street and Hainan Third Street by the Hainanese and other Chinese communities.|$|E
5|$|On September13, 1966, NY111 was realigned {{south of}} Hauppauge {{to follow a}} {{slightly}} more westerly alignment to the hamlet of Islip along Joshua's Path and Islip Avenue, two <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> ran parallel to the route's original path on Carleton Avenue and Wheeler Road. Ownership and maintenance of NY111's former routing was transferred to Suffolk County, which redesignated the road as CR17. The ultimately cancelled eastern extension of the Northern State Parkway would have crossed NY111 just south of Village of the Branch at a point north of Mount Pleasant Road. An interchange between the parkway and NY111 was planned at that location.|$|E

5|$|The loop was {{originally}} proposed in 1986 {{as part of}} a downtown revitalization effort. Almost from the beginning before the highway was commissioned in 1989, it was affected by controversial proposals. The first was related to suggestions by community leaders to rename city streets in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Another controversy dealt with rebuilding the streets {{as part of a}} downtown beautification project; the downtown business community protested the original scope of construction, and the Lansing City Council threatened to cancel the project in response to the controversy. In 2010, additional controversies surfaced regarding the posting and enforcement of speed limits on city streets in Michigan, including the <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> make up the Capitol Loop.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{category of}} public roadway in Marquette County {{is that of}} city streets. The streets are maintained {{by one of the}} three cities in the county: Ishpeming, Negaunee, or Marquette. The cities are responsible for maintaining any <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> are not otherwise under the control of state or county. Lakeshore Drive in Ishpeming was transferred to state control in 1999 to become part of Bus. M-28, and Grove Street in Marquette is also CR500. These two streets, like others in the county, are {{under the jurisdiction of the}} state or county.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop Interstate 96 (BL I-96) is a {{business}} loop of I-96 through the city of Lansing. The western terminus is at I-96's exit90 northwest of Lansing in Watertown Township in Clinton County near the I-96/I-69 junction. From there, it follows Grand River Avenue under I-96. East of I-96, BL I-96 intersects Francis Road, which provides access to I-69, and then passes under I-69. Grand River Avenue is three lanes, one in each direction divided by a central turn lane, and runs past light industrial areas, crossing into Lansing and Eaton County near the Capital Region International Airport. The area around the airport is commercial, but east of there North Grand River Avenue runs through residential neighborhoods. Near the intersection with Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard, the business loop runs along the Grand River and then BL I-96 turns eastward on North Street to an interchange with Cedar and Larch streets. The business loop turns and splits onto the one-way pairing of the three-lane Cedar (southbound) and Larch (northbound). As it runs southward, the highway runs parallel to the Grand River through Old Town Lansing. At Oakland Avenue (westbound) and Saginaw Avenue (eastbound), BL I-96 intersects the two one-way <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> carry BL I-69. It continues south through {{the eastern edge of}} downtown Lansing.|$|E

5|$|Following Nikolai Podgorny's {{removal from}} office, rumours started {{circulating}} within the top circles, {{and on the}} <b>streets,</b> <b>that</b> Kosygin would retire due to bad health. During one of Kosygin's spells on sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov, a like-minded conservative, to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; through this office Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a backup role. For example, at a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. Following Kosygin's resignation in 1980, Tikhonov, {{at the age of}} 75, was elected the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. At the end of his life, Kosygin feared the complete failure of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985), believing that the sitting leadership was reluctant to reform the stagnant Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Running {{immediately}} {{next to the}} river, M-13 meets I-75/US23 at that freeway's exit153 just {{southeast of}} the Zilwaukee Bridge. The highway runs along Bay City Road as it continues to follow the Saginaw River through the Crow Island State Game Area. On {{the south side of}} Bay City, the name changes to River Road. M-13 passes the James Clements Municipal Airport and transitions to follow Broadway Street into downtown. At Lafayette Street, M-13 turns west and merges with M-84. The two highways run concurrently across the Saginaw River on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge. The structure's two spans connect the riverbanks with the Middle Ground Island in the center. West of the bridge, M-13/M-84 follows Salzburg Avenue to the intersection with Euclid Avenue. At that location, M-13 turns north along Euclid Avenue, which runs along the western city line. M-13 meets the 2 one-way <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> carry M-25 and the I-75 business spur at the intersections with Thomas and Jenny streets. From this intersection on, M-13 forms a part of the Lake Huron Circle Tour. Farther north, the highway turns northwesterly on Huron Road; Euclid Avenue continues north as M-247.|$|E
5|$|The Reed City Bus. US10 {{was created}} by 1960 to follow Chestnut and Church streets into the community's central {{business}} district and through adjacent residential areas. In 1975 when US10 was rerouted to follow the freeways around Clare, the former routing through downtown on McEwan and Fifth streets was redesignated as a business loop; it was also signed to provide connections between US10 and what is now US127 because of an incomplete interchange between those two freeways. The Midland business loop dates back to 1961 and follows Eastman Avenue and two sets of one-way streets before completing its routing as a freeway. The two business loops created for Flint and Pontiac were designated in 1941 and 1961, respectively. They followed <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> were once part of US 10, but after additional changes to US10's routing in Michigan, they were renumbered as business loops of other highways in 1962 and 1986, respectively. Near Flint, part of US10 was replaced by M-54 when the US Highway was moved to a freeway, and near Pontiac it was replaced by US24 after US10 was truncated in the state.|$|E

5|$|While Michigan was {{the second}} state to post route designations along its highway system in 1919, Michigan {{actually}} began assigning internal trunkline designations for internal inventory purposes as early as 1913. From 1918 to 1926, only the M-numbered highway designations existed on state highways throughout Michigan, while {{the creation of the}} US Highway System in 1926 caused several existing designations to be either reassigned or retired altogether. Public Act131 of 1931 allowed the MSHD to take control over the city and village <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> carried state highways through cities and villages in the state. The 1932 McNitt Act consolidated all of the township-controlled roads into 83 county road commissions. On May 4, 1935, the state opened the first highway welcome center next to US12 in New Buffalo near the Indiana state line; Michigan was the first state in the country to do so at the time.|$|E
5|$|Business Spur Interstate 75(BS I-75) is a {{business}} spur running through Bay City following {{a section of the}} current routing of M-25 through town. Formerly a full business loop numbered Business Loop Interstate75 (BL I-75), it followed what is now M-84 back to end at I-75/US23 at exit160 south of downtown. The business route also follows <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> previously were numbered Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23). The spur starts at exit162 on I-75/US23 at the same interchange where M-25 and US10 end. BS I-75 runs concurrently along M-25, and for about the first , the spur is a four-lane freeway bounded by residential subdivisions on either side. In Bangor Township, the freeway ends and BS I-75/M-25 splits into a one-way pairing of Thomas Street (eastbound) and Jenny Street (westbound). These two three-lane streets continue along a residential area {{on the west side of}} Bay City. East of intersections with Henry Street, the opposing sides of traffic merge back together near Veterans Memorial Park to cross the Saginaw River on the four-lane Veterans Memorial Bridge. On the eastern side of the river, BS I-75/M-25 splits again into the one-way pairing of the three-lane McKinley Street (westbound) and 7th Street (eastbound). Just three blocks east of the river, BS I-75 ends at the intersections with M-84 (Washington Avenue) in downtown Bay City. On average each day in 2013, 11,678vehicles use the business loop east of the M-13 junction, and 29,391vehicles do so west of the M-84 junction, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop of US127 through Jackson that is wholly concurrent with M-50. Its southern end is at an interchange in a rural section of Summit Township. From exit34 on US127, the business loop runs north and northwesterly, crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the roadway is bounded by businesses as it runs along Cooper Street through residential areas on the southeastern side of Jackson. In the downtown area, Bus. US127/M-50 merges with Business Loop Interstate94 (BL I-94) and splits to follow a one-way pairing of <b>streets</b> <b>that</b> form a loop through downtown. Northbound traffic continues along {{the eastern side of}} this loop on Cooper Street and crosses the Grand River again. At the intersection with Michigan Avenue, BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 turns westward onto Louis Glick Highway around the northern side of downtown. The business loop crosses the Grand River a third and final time along Louis Glick. On the western side of downtown, the business loop angles southwesterly as Louis Glick Highway merges into Michigan Avenue. (At the same time, the southern half of the one-way loop, Washington Street, also splits from Michigan Avenue.) BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 follows Michigan Avenue westward through residential neighborhoods to an intersection with West Avenue, where Bus. US127/M-50 turns northward, separating from BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). As the business loop approaches its parent highway, it transitions into a commercial area. The northern terminus of Bus. US127 is at the same interchange northwest of Jackson in Blackman Township where the US127 and I-94 freeways merge.|$|E
