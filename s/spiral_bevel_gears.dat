40|$|Abstract. Based on <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> NC {{manufacture}} {{principle and}} generating {{motion of the}} generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> cutting is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of gear tooth surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established. The contacting points of gear tooth surfaces can be used for tooth contact analysis. The parametric curve interpolator is combined with <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> NC machining, and is applied to the self-developed <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> NC milling machine to control the gear cutting. Experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective in the control of NC machining for the <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|R
40|$|A <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> system {{supported}} on thrust bearings considering the coupled bending-torsional nonlinear vibration is proposed and an eight {{degrees of freedom}} (8 DOF) lumped parameter dynamic model of the <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> system combined with time-varying stiffness, static transmission error, gear backlash, and bearing clearances is investigated. The <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> system is analyzed with the equations of motion and the dynamic response is solved using the Runge-Kutta method. The effects of mesh frequency, mesh damping coefficient, load coefficient, and gear backlash are revealed, which describe the true mesh characteristics of the <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> system. The bifurcation characteristics as jump discontinuities, periodic windows, and chaos are obtained by studying time histories, phase plane portraits, Poincaré maps, Fourier spectra, and global bifurcation diagrams of the gear system.

50|$|Hypoid gears {{are still}} common in larger trucks {{because they can}} {{transmit}} higher torque. A higher hypoid offset allows the gear to transmit higher torque. However increasing the hypoid offset results in reduction of mechanical efficiency and a consequent reduction in fuel economy. For practical purposes, it is often impossible to replace low efficiency hypoid gears with more efficient <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> in automotive use because the spiral bevel gear would need a much larger diameter to transmit the same torque. Increasing {{the size of the}} drive axle gear would require an increase {{of the size of the}} gear housing and a reduction in the ground clearance.|$|E
50|$|Tatra {{differentials}} are {{a unique}} design that uses two opposing <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> {{instead of the}} usual single set. The differential gears are part of the input drive shaft rather than between the output axles as in a conventional differential. All versions of the Tatra differential have locking pins that can force the differential gears to rotate together, “locking” the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the dual output bevel gears allow the axles to swing around the drive axle without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the input drive shaft goes essentially straight through the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all axles driven. The whole assembly is part of the backbone frame.|$|E
