5|$|The {{history of}} vigilante {{justice and the}} Montana Vigilantes began in 1863 in what {{was at the time}} a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory. Vigilante {{activities}} continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana Territorial period until the territory became the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montana</b> on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.|$|E
5|$|Glacier is {{considered}} to have excellent air and water quality. No major areas of dense human population exist anywhere near the region and industrial effects are minimized due to a scarcity of factories and other potential contributors of pollutants. However, the sterile and cold lakes found throughout the park are easily contaminated by airborne pollutants that fall whenever it rains or snows, and some evidence of these pollutants {{has been found in}} park waters. Wildfires could also impact the quality of water. However, the pollution level is currently viewed as negligible, and the park lakes and waterways have a water quality rating of A-1, the highest rating given by the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montana.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{paleontologist}} Charles H. Sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton {{from the}} slightly older Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur Gorgosaurus libratus in 1914. Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montana.</b> Finding, {{largely due to}} a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of Albertosaurus, which had been named first, and G. libratus was renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus Albertosaurus backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.|$|E

5|$|Kelly pool {{has long}} been {{associated}} with gambling—so much so, that it was made illegal in some municipalities in the US and Canada. In the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montana,</b> for example, the playing of kelly pool was punishable by a $25 fine until the law was repealed in 1964. Likewise, the playing of kelly pool was banned in the Canadian province of Manitoba at least as of 1918. Gambling exploits associated with kelly pool were often depicted in Clare Briggs' comic strip of the same name, which centered on the game. The Kelly Pool strip (panel pictured at right), ran in the New York Tribune's sports section from 1912 to 1917.|$|E
5|$|Montana Highway87 (MT87) is {{a primary}} state highway located in the southwestern region of the U.S. <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montana.</b> The highway travels through mainly rural areas in Raynolds Pass, from the MontanaIdaho state line to an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 287 (US 287). The route travels through a portion of Gallatin National Forest. In 1922, a road in the location of MT 87 {{was added to the}} highway system, and a few years later the road was designated as portions of two early auto trails. In 1959, the route was rapidly improved due to the collapse of US 287 nearby. During 1967, much of the highway was reconstructed along its current location.|$|E
