5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
25|$|The {{thumb is}} not opposable in all primates— some primates, {{such as the}} <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> and colobus, are {{virtually}} thumbless. The <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> compensates for this by using the hairless part of its long, prehensile tail for grabbing objects. In apes and Old World monkeys, the thumbs can be rotated around its axis, but the extensive area of contact between the pulps of the {{thumb and index finger}} is a human characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> mainly forage in the {{canopies}} {{of forests}} and rely mostly on their senses of sight, smell, taste, and touch to find food. Brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> are mainly herbivores and frugivores. A main {{component of the}} brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkey’s</b> diet is ripe fruit. 83% of their diet is lipid rich fruits. However, in drier seasons where fruit is less abundant, brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> feed on leaves, seeds, flowers, bark, honey, decaying wood, and occasionally insects such as termites and caterpillars. Brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> feed on different species of figs year around. Scientists have observed <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> eating soil and clay, and hypothesized that {{the reasons for this}} behavior could be to obtain minerals from the soil, for phosphorus, or in order to maintain a pH-balance in their digestive system. Brown <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> find water to drink on the forest floor at “salado sites.” Competition for food occurs between <b>spider</b> <b>monkeys</b> and other frugivorous primates.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} {{that much of the}} area has been reduced to a {{patchwork}} of clearings for cattle ranches and peasant communities, the Lacandon contains some of the most extensive and best preserved remnants of lower montane rainforest in Mexico and Central America. The best conserved area is within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, which has about 290,000 hectares of the Reserve in good condition. The Lacandon is the best known of Mexico’s rainforest areas because of the attention it has received in the press and efforts by international organizations to protect what is left of it. The Lacandon {{is one of the most}} biodiverse rainforests in the world, with as much as 25% of Mexico’s total species diversity. The predominant native vegetation is perennial high rainforest with trees that can grow to an average height of thirty meters and often to fifty or sixty including Guatteria anomala, Ceiba pentandra, Swietenia macrophylla, Terminalia amazonia and Ulmus mexicana. Mammoth Guanacaste trees shrouded in vines and bromeliads among clear running streams, enormous firms, palms and wild elephant’s ear plants can still be seen. It has 1,500 tree species, 33% of all Mexican bird species, 25% of all Mexican animal species, 44% of all Mexican diurnal butterflies and 10% of all Mexico's fish species. The jungle contains many endangered species such as the red macaw, the eagle, the tapir, the <b>spider</b> <b>monkey,</b> the howler monkeys, and the swamp crocodile. It is one of the last jungles in North America big enough to support jaguars. Central American jaguars are reported, though rare, in Selva Zoque.|$|E

500|$|In spider monkeys, the {{clitoris}} {{is especially}} developed {{and has an}} interior passage, or urethra, that makes it almost identical to the penis, and it retains and distributes urine droplets as the female <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> moves around. Scholar Alan F.

Because spider monkeys of South America have pendulous and erectile clitorises long enough to be mistaken for a penis, researchers and observers of the species look for a scrotum to determine the animal's sex; a similar approach is to identify scent-marking glands that may also be present on the clitoris.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the changes}} in the 2006–2008 report, not all species were removed from the 2008–2010 list due to {{improvement}} in their situation. [...] Instead, new species were added to bring attention to other closely related species with very small populations that are also at risk of extinction. For example, the highly endangered eastern black crested gibbon (Nomascus nasutus) replaced the Hainan black crested gibbon. [...] The Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) replaced the Horton Plains slender loris (Loris tardigradus nycticeboides) because the former has been hit the hardest of Asian lorises, all of which are declining rapidly due primarily to capture for the exotic pet trade, as well as use in traditional medicines and forest loss. [...] In another case, the brown-headed <b>spider</b> <b>monkey</b> (Ateles fusciceps fusciceps) was omitted from the list since no spokesperson could be found for the species.

[...] These epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. It is suggested that the total arthropod species richness of the tropical canopy might be as high as 20 million.
