5|$|The game's {{energy system}} gives players 5 energy {{points at the}} start. Beginning a run in any mode costs one point, and it takes 10 minutes for a point to recharge. Players can pay to refill energy by {{spending}} ISO-8s. Players can make friends at the leaderboard; once per day they can <b>send</b> <b>and</b> request 5 energy points, which are stored in their inboxes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the <b>send</b> <b>and</b> receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to <b>send</b> <b>and</b> receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after commissioning, New York became {{flagship}} for the United States {{occupation of}} Veracruz in 1914. During World War I, she became flagship of Battleship Division 9, commanded by Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman. Sent {{to reinforce the}} British Grand Fleet in the North Sea, she conducted blockade and escort duties. She twice {{came into contact with}} German U-boats, and is believed to have accidentally sunk one. She returned to the United States {{at the end of the}} war, and began taking on patrol and training duties. New York was fitted with XAF RADAR in February 1938, including the first United States duplexer so a single antenna could both <b>send</b> <b>and</b> receive.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still <b>send</b> <b>and</b> receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E

5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to <b>send</b> <b>and</b> receive social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible}} for an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles play a {{prominent}} role in the game, replacing the moves and transformations featured in its predecessors. The vehicles can be built freely by the player from over 1600 different components available, such as body panels, engines, wheels, wings, propellers, fuel tanks and weapons. Vehicles range from automobiles, motorbikes, boats and aeroplanes. In order to create vehicles, the player must collect vehicle parts and bluepints which are scattered throughout the hub world, or can be earned after winning specific challenges. The player may also purchase preset blueprints and vehicle parts from Humba Wumba in Showdown Town. In addition, players can also <b>send</b> <b>and</b> receive blueprints over Xbox Live.|$|E
5|$|The game's single-player mode lets players {{control a}} war veteran, Eastern European Niko Bellic. During the story, Niko meets various new {{characters}}, {{many of whom}} he befriends. These characters can then perform favours for Niko whenever he asks; for example, his cousin Roman, who owns a taxi service, can send one of his cabs to Niko and take him to any destination around the city. Cabs are always available during gameplay, allowing players to quickly travel to a destination. Throughout {{the course of the}} game, players are also faced with morality choices, which alter the storyline appropriately depending on the player's choice. While free roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as bowling or darts. Other available activities include a vigilante mini-game, and in-game television programming. Niko has a smartphone for contacting friends and starting activities. The smartphone is also used to access the game's online multiplayer mode, and to enter cheat codes. To access the in-game Internet, which allows Niko to <b>send</b> <b>and</b> receive emails and set up prospective dates with potential girlfriends, Niko can use Internet caf√©s located around the city. The game also features a subway system, allowing players to quickly traverse through the game's world.|$|E
