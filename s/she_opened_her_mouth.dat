500|$|In the 1950 and 1951 general elections, Roberts was the Conservative {{candidate}} for the safe Labour seat of Dartford. The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; prospective candidate Bill Deedes recalled that [...] "Once <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{the rest of us}} began to look rather second-rate". She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate. She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds, but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951. Denis funded his wife's studies for the bar; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation. Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{spent most}} of his early career at Universal Studios until The Thing, after which he left for Lucasfilm to work on Return of the Jedi at the {{invitation}} of Howard Kazanjian. From that point on, Brown's career has taken on a freelance aspect that has allowed him to work on an eclectic list of films and with some of the top actors in the business including Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kevin Bacon. During the filming of a scene with Barbra Streisand on All Night Long in which Streisand was playing a character who could not sing, Brown remembered, [...] "...when we started to film that scene, <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and this incredible voice came out. And everybody on the set just stood there with their mouths open listening to this. Then she stopped because {{she was supposed to be}} singing badly....It was astounding being in the room with her." ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs Bowater's {{eyes were}} like lead in her long, dark-skinned face. <b>She</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> her gaze {{travelled}} slowly until, as I realized, it had fixed {{itself on the}} large yellowing photograph behind my back.|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} so stiffly upright {{on a hard}} chair and had so much the {{appearance}} of having been hewn from the living rock that every time <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> {{it was as if}} a statue had spoken.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{searched for}} strawberries, {{but she found}} none, and {{returned}} home in a very bad temper. When <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to tell her mother what had befallen her in the wood, a toad jumped out, so that everyone was quite disgusted with her.|$|E
5000|$|Father and son {{are delighted}} by her performances, but when <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and reveals a very wilful and wayward character, Cornelius is less charmed.

While the worthy pair go to fetch it, Mephistopheles converses with Bertha and vanishes into his room.|$|R

Then <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and a strong Northern English accent burst out - a nostalgic flashback reminiscent of the old Boddingtons advert's that featured glamorous women with pronounced Manchester accents.

6000|$|... "What for? What for?" [...] Sandra would say, {{putting the}} book back, and strolling to the looking-glass and {{pressing}} her hair.

5000|$|... "I'm Outta Love" [...] {{has been}} lauded by {{contemporary}} music critics. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic called the song an [...] "aggressive dancefloor item," [...] and added: [...] "The minute <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>she</b> starts reminding you of other singers, especially Aretha Franklin." [...] Michel Paoletta, editor for Billboard magazine, declared [...] "I'm Outta Love" [...] a [...] "sonic joyride ... which moves and grooves with a spirit all its own."

In addition to further pieces of concept art and actual, in-game screenshots, the first official teaser was released. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fan video eight months prior, it also portrays Alice in therapy: after being hypnotized by her doctor in a bizarre office filled with dismembered arms hanging from the ceiling, as <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to speak, large amounts of blood and teeth pour out. As the game title appears, a whispering voice is heard saying, [...] "What have you done?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Gaga's {{performance}} {{also received}} mixed reviews from critics. Matt Zoller Sietz of Vulture called Gaga [...] "terrible {{here in the}} way that Madonna was terrible in a lot of her '90s films, at once too poised and too blank." [...] David Weigand of the San Francisco Chronicle said Gaga [...] "makes an enormous visual impact, but the minute <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to deliver a line, it's obvious that acting just isn't one of her many talents." [...] Ben Travers of IndieWire wrote that he [...] "wouldn't {{go so far as to}} say Gaga's talent adds much to the proceedings, but her presence - and the manner in which its captured - certainly does." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there was}} a long pause before any one spoke a word. Mr. Flick had been {{forbidden}} to speak, and Sir William, having made his proposition, was determined to await the lady's reply.

60|$|Her {{insulting}} taciturnity {{was enough}} sometimes {{to make one}} gnash one's teeth with rage. When <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> it was only to be abominably rude in harsh tones to the associate of her reprobate father; and the full approval of her aged relative was conveyed to her by offensive chuckles. If not that, then her remarks, always uttered {{in the tone of}} scathing contempt, were of the most appalling inanity.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{specific}} inquiry {{was briefly}} this," [...] the man continued. [...] "She gave herself away the moment <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She behaved, in fact, like a farmer's daughter asking questions of a gipsy girl.

5000|$|In December 2015, Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie sparked {{controversy}} and accusations of racism {{when it was}} announced that Janette Tough would be playing a male Japanese character named Huki Muki. Korean American comedian Margaret Cho accused Janette Tough of [...] "yellowface", which she described as [...] "when white people portray Asian people. And unfortunately it's happening in this film." [...] Upon release of the film it became apparent that the character was not, in fact, Japanese but Scottish. When asked about the controversy Jennifer Saunders replied [...] "the whole film is about people being what they're not, Huki Muki is a brand, she is the designer and she looks a bit Japanese, but the moment <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>she's</b> from Glasgow.

5000|$|The second {{manner in}} which the {{familiar}} spirit commonly appeared to magical practitioners in Britain was that they would be given to a person by a pre-existing individual, who was sometimes a family member and at other times a more powerful spirit. For instance, the alleged witch Margaret Ley from Liverpool claimed, in 1667, that she had been given her familiar spirit by her mother when she died, while the Leicestershire cunning-woman Joan Willimot related, in 1618, that a mysterious figure whom she only referred to as her [...] "master", [...] "willed <b>her</b> to <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and he would blow into her a fairy which should do her good.

30|$|The first example {{takes place}} at Silvana’s home. This takes place in an {{afternoon}} and it’s a moment of contemplation between Silvana and her father.

Silvana responds, looks back and exchanges gaze. The father is smiling as he holds Silvana’s dummy. He takes in and out the dummy, when <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> the father takes the dummy. The father is smiling all through the interaction as he pretend to put in and out the dummy in Silvana’s lips. Silvana responds to this fun and teasing game by opening and closing <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and by making sounds of her own.|$|R
