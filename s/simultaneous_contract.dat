It allows efficient computation of multiple instances of oblivious transfer protocols. We apply this protocol to improve the fast <b>simultaneous</b> <b>contract</b> signing protocol, recently proposed in [11], which gains its speed from computation of time-consuming operations in advance. Using batch oblivious transfer, a better efficiency can be achieved. ...|$|E

We propose novel and efficient protocol for contract signing {{based on a}} construction by Even, Goldreich, and Lempel. We focus on the reduction of on-line computational complexity of the protocol. A {{significant part of the}} most time-consuming operations can be pre-computed. An important component used in our protocol is an efficient oblivious transfer, which can be of interest per se...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the naked {{exclusion}} model of Rasmusen, Ramseyer and Wiley (1991) and Segal and Whinston (2000 b), we examine whether sequential contracting is more conducive to exclusion in the lab, and whether it leads to lower exclusion costs for the incumbent, than <b>simultaneous</b> <b>contracting.</b> We find that an incumbent who proposes exclusive contracts to buyers sequentially, is better able to deter entry than an incumbent who proposes contracts simultaneously. In contrast to theory, this comes at a substantial cost for the incumbent. ...|$|R

Accounting for the observation that buyers are more likely to accept an exclusive contract the higher the payment, substantially improves the fit between theoretical predictions and observed behavior...|$|R
40|$|A new {{construction}} for hash chains called double hash chains is presented. It uses two one-way hashfunction operations to compute each link {{from the previous}} one. The {{new construction}} {{can be used for}} implementing a one-time, public-key digital signature scheme. The hash chain provides the signature scheme with an inherent self-continuation feature. The signature scheme commits to signature bits one bit at a time, making it well suited for <b>simultaneous</b> <b>contract</b> signing. The signature scheme is very simple to construct, manage and use, an important property especially for smart card applications. General methods for enhancing hash chains performance by storing intermediate links to reduce computation are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Oblivious Transfer (OT) is an {{important}} cryptographic tool, which has found its usage in many crypto protocols, such as Secure Multiparty Computations [9], Certified E-mail [2] and <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>Contract</b> Signing [20]. In this paper, we propose three k-out-of-n OT (OT n k) protocols based on additive homomorphic encryption. Two of these protocols prohibit malicious behaviors from both sender and receiver. We also achieve efficient communication complexity bounded by O(l · n) in bits, where l {{is the size of}} the encryption key. The computational complexity is same or better than the most efficient existing protocols. Due to the semantic security property, the sender cannot get receiver’s selection. When the receiver tries to retrieve more than k values, the receiver is caught cheating with 1 − 1 /m probability (Protocol II) or the receiver is unable to get any value at all (Protocol III). We introduce a novel technique based on the solvability of linear equations, which could find its way into other applications. We also provide an experimental analysis to compare the efficiency of the protocols...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{viability}} and e¤ects of exclusive contracts when Cournot competition is introduced, {{as opposed to the}} Bertrand competition that is assumed in the existing literature. An exclusive contracts involves a buyer agreeing to buy a certain part or all of his input from a seller. If he breaches this contract, he has to pay damages. It is found that if a monopolist or multiple sellers in a Cournot monopsony close a (partially) exclusive contract with the buyer, it depends on the method of calcultation of expectation damages whether entry by homogenous competitors will be blocked or not. In a Bertrand upstream monopoly with multiple Cournot retailers and a <b>simultaneous</b> <b>contracting</b> phase, the options to deter entry from a more e ¢ cient competitor are limited. Whether entry is deterred at best depends on the perception of each buyer about his competitors. However, entry deterrence is still possible under certain circumstances. Finally, when two upstream Bertrand rms sell to Cournot retailers and contracting happens sequentially, they can use exclusive contracts to co-exist and both make a pro 8 ̆ 5 t, despite behaving competitively...|$|R
40|$|Visual Management {{is a key}} {{approach}} {{in the implementation of}} Lean Production. It emphasizes the importance of developing easy-to-understand visual devices for sharing knowledge within an organization. Such visual devices can {{play an important role in}} mitigating the complexity of engineer-to-order production systems. A major difficulty in managing engineer-to-order prefabricated building systems is the need to integrate planning and control of different processes, such as design, fabrication and assembly on site, in a multiple project environment. This paper reports preliminary findings on the implementation of visual devices for collaborative and integrated planning and control in a Steel Fabricator, which designs, fabricates and assembles steel structures. The aim of this paper is to understand how visual management tools can contribute to improve the effectiveness of planning and control in this environment. A set of visual devices have been used in the planning and control system in this company, including a panel that makes available information about 200 <b>simultaneous</b> <b>contracts</b> in an easy-to-understand way. The implementation of those tools has enhanced the participation of different people in the planning process from operational levels or from the different production units...|$|R

His second film was Männer vor der Ehe in 1936, this to be followed by numerous roles in other films. As for his film work during the period of the Third Reich, the theatrical director Hellmuth Matiasek commented: [...] "His appearance and manner - evoking pre-war salons rather than the trenches of the Eastern Front - spared him from productions commissioned by Joseph Goebbels and he played in classics by Goethe, Theodor Storm and Fontane." [...] A short film made early in the war, Barbara, did not get past the censor: in this he played the soldier husband of Lotte Werkmeister. However, when he was sent to the front, his wife would find fulfilment with a job on the railway. In the NS-inspired war film, Spähtrupp Hallgarten, directed by Herbert B Fredersdorf, Klinger comes across as boyish, eye-winking and at times foolhardy.|$|R

An {{employee}} who {{has reached the}} age of 60 and meets the entitlement conditions required to earn the right to the contributory social security retirement pension, may apply for partial retirement. The worker must arrange, by agreement with the firm, a part-time contract that reduces the working day and salary by a minimum of 25 % and a maximum of 85 % each. If the worker applies for partial retirement at an age less than 65 the firm will arrange a <b>simultaneous</b> relief <b>contract,</b> in order to fill the working day left vacant by the partially retired worker. In cases in which the worker applies for partial retirement at the age of 65 or older, {{it is not necessary to}} arrange a relief contract provided that the other requirements are met.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem faced by an agent contracting multiple self-interested service providers, {{that are able to}} flexibly manipulate their quality of service in order to maximise their own utility, to complete a single computational task. We extend an existing model of such service providers, and derive optimal task procurement mechanisms in the setting where the agent has full knowledge of the cost functions of these service providers (considering both simultaneously and sequentially procurement). We then extend these results to the incomplete information setting where the agent must elicit cost information from the service providers, and we characterise a family of incentive-compatible and individuallyrational mechanisms. Sequential procurement always generates greater utility for an agent than <b>simultaneous</b> procurement, and <b>contracting</b> multiple providers is preferable to contracting just one. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} a {{class of}} agency problems in which the optimal contract is tractable and attainable in closed form. By modeling the noise before the action in each period, we force the contract to provide sufficient incentives state-by-state, rather than merely on average. This tightly constrains the set of admissible contracts and allows for a simple solution to the contracting problem. Our results continue to hold in continuoustime, where noise and actions are <b>simultaneous.</b> The tractable <b>contracts</b> of Holmstrom and Milgrom (1987) can thus be achieved in settings {{that do not require}} exponential utility, a pecuniary cost of effort, Gaussian noise or continuous time. The contract’s functional form is independent of the agent’s reservation utility and noise distribution. Moreover, if the cost of effort is pecuniary (multiplicative), the contract is linear (log-linear) in output and its slope is independent of both of these parameters plus the utility function...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model that}} pictures how inflation is determined in a decentralized market process where prices are set in both <b>simultaneous</b> and sequential <b>contracts.</b> Price setting {{is seen as a}} coordination game between the price setters of sequential contracts. An important property of the model is that inflation thus can be explained without any reference to the quantity of money. Following up the finding that inflation is determined in a coordination game, it is subsequently claimed that whenever inflation does not follow a random path, people do seem to follow some rule of thumb when predicting future price levels. In the last section of the paper, it is finally claimed that this rule is best understood as a focal point, and furthermore that the central banks provides the focal point for inflation in the western world today. Central banks could thus be shown to be able to influence inflation rates, although the quantity of money plays no part in this process.

40|$|Transmembrane {{potentials}} and membrane {{characteristics of}} Stentor coeruleus were studied {{by means of}} microelectrodes and standard electrophysiological techniques. Intracellular resting potentials {{were found to be}} variable and recordable for only a brief span of time owing to the encapsulation of the recording electrodes. During this brief time span of recorded resting potentials were anamolous in that they were generally of positive polarity. When an extended Stentor was stimulated to contract, a 10 – 60 mv negative-going transient response was recorded from intracellular electrodes. After the electrodes had been encapsulated, a diphasic transient response was observed when the penetrated animal <b>contracted.</b> <b>Simultaneous</b> recordings from intracellular and encapsulated electrodes showed that the diphasic and negative-going transient responses occurred simultaneously. Contractions of Stentor occurred in 7 to 8 msec following a 2 to 3 msec latent period after a suprathreshold shock. Records obtained by use of photomultiplier and microelectrodes indicated that the contractions began 1. 8 msec after the onset of the diphasic response. Prepotentials were observed prior to mechanically stimulated responses...|$|R
30|$|Epistemic {{governance}} and epistemic innovation policy formulate a critique against too-narrowly defined approaches to governance, where governance follows one-sidedly bureaucratic or technocratic considerations. Instead, epistemic governance (also quality management and quality enhancement) and epistemic innovation {{policy should be}} regarded as a plea for a more comprehensive understanding, where the explicit-making, comprehension and reflection of knowledge, knowledge production, and knowledge application are keys for a successful governing and governance. For the further progress of advanced knowledge society, advanced knowledge economy, and advanced knowledge democracy, universities and the higher education sectors are crucial for driving development. How should the governance of higher education, the quality enhancement of universities, and the careers of academic faculty (the academic profession) be organized? Epistemic governance introduces here a novel approach and understanding. Epistemic governance emphasizes that the underlying epistemic structure, the underlying epistemic base, or the underlying epistemic paradigms (knowledge paradigms) of those organizations, institutions, or systems (sectors), which should be governed, are being addressed. This defines a benchmark and set of criteria for internal and external governance in higher education that is interested in applying a good, effective, and sustainable governance. Quality assurance, quality enhancement, and quality management of higher education, from the perspective of epistemic governance, should also orient themselves to quality and quality dimensions that cross-refer to the underlying epistemic structure of higher education. In a traditional understanding, the academic career patterns of the academic core faculty at universities follow a tenure-track logic. Cross-employment (multi-employment), on the contrary, refers to academic faculty (the academic profession) with <b>simultaneous</b> employment <b>contracts</b> to more than one organization only within or both inside and outside of higher education. Epistemic governance, in combination with crossemployment, should add to the organizational flexibility and creativity of universities and other higher education institutions, supporting the integration of a pluralism and diversity of knowledge production (basic research in the context of knowledge application and innovation), the formation of nonlinear innovation networks, and providing a rationale for a new type of academic career model.|$|R
