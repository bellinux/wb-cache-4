The speed of rotating air gap flux is made free or adjustable.

We used two 3 D elastic finite-element approaches that employ split nodes for the computations. In homoge-neous and weakly heterogeneous half-spaces with faults dipping ≲ 50 °, maximum fault-normal peak velocities occurred on the hanging wall. However, for fault dips ≳ 50 °, maximum fault-normal peak velocities occurred on the footwall. Bilateral and unilateral rupture simulations in weakly heterogeneous media found that reverse-faulting <b>slip</b> velocities (<b>frequency</b> band 1 – 3. 5 Hz) were on average 39 % larger than those during normal faulting.

Our numerical and analytic investigations reveal a host of complex temporal phenomena such as phase <b>slips,</b> <b>frequency</b> suppression, multiple periodic states and chaos.

Our time delayed feedback model offers a simple paradigm for obtaining and investigating these temporal states in a single oscillator. We construct a detailed bifurcation diagram of the oscillator as a function of the time delay parameter and the driving strengths of the feedback terms. We find some new states in the presence of the quadratic nonlinear feedback term with interesting characteristics like birhythmicity, phase reversals, radial trapping, phase jumps and spiraling patterns in the amplitude space.

In this report, we present a vector control system in which the amplitude and the frequency of the phase voltage are separately controlled without current control circuit, using a pulse-width controlled voltage source inverter.

40|$|Reverse osmosis (RO) {{promises}} {{to play an}} increasingly crucial role in water supply, especially via desalination. One of the major problems faced by RO technology is the decline in membrane performance due to concentration polarisation (CP) and fouling. CP increases the osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane, hence reducing the net driving pressure gradient. Moreover, CP increases the probability of fouling. An electro-osmosis technique is proposed in this thesis which {{has the potential to}} reduce CP because it induces the movement of fluid in the vicinity of membrane, thus improving mixing within the boundary layer and enhancing mass transfer. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to simulate steady and unsteady electro-osmotic flow (EOF) in 2 D unobstructed and obstructed channels. First, a mathematical simplification of EOF is developed that reduces the required computational load while retaining the model’s accuracy and physical meaning. It is shown that EOF can be mimicked using a slip velocity. The results from CFD are found to be in good agreement both with published data and with more rigorous simulation approaches. For steady EOF in unobstructed channels, the spatial variation in slip velocity is found to be the driver for mass transfer enhancement. For uniform-unsteady EOF in unobstructed channels, a sinusoidal time-varying electro-osmotic slip velocity has negligible effect on the time-averaged hydrodynamics and mass transfer, because the effect is nullified within the time oscillation period. Nevertheless, there are still benefits for using unsteady EOF for fouling reduction/prevention, as increases in <b>slip</b> velocity <b>frequency</b> and amplitude increase the maximum wall stress which is a proxy for fouling reduction. For unsteady EOF in spacer-filled channels, the simulation results show that an oscillating slip velocity has the potential to induce vortex shedding. This occurs when a resonant <b>slip</b> velocity <b>frequency</b> is used for Reynolds numbers near the transition from steady to unsteady flow...|$|R

40|$|High-performance AC {{machinery}} and drive {{systems can be}} found in a variety of applications ranging from motion control to vehicle propulsion. However, machine parameters can vary significantly with electrical frequency, flux levels, and temperature, degrading the performance of the drive system. While adaptive control techniques can be used to estimate machine parameters online, it is sometimes desirable to estimate certain parameters offline. Additionally, parameter identification and control are typically conflicting objectives with identification requiring plant inputs which are rich in harmonics, and control objectives often consisting of regulation to a constant set-point. In this dissertation, we present research which seeks to address these issues for high-performance AC {{machinery and}} drive systems. The first part of this dissertation concerns the offline identification of induction machine parameters. Specifically, we have developed a new technique for induction machine parameter identification which can easily be implemented using a voltage-source inverter. The proposed technique is based on fitting steady-state experimental data to the circular stator current locus in the stator flux linkage reference-frame for varying steady-state <b>slip</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and provides accurate estimates of the magnetic parameters, as well as the rotor resistance and core loss conductance. Experimental results for a 43 kW induction machine are provided which demonstrate the utility of the proposed technique by characterizing the machine over a wide range of flux levels, including magnetic saturation. The remainder of this dissertation concerns the development of generalizable design methodologies for Simultaneous Identification and Control (SIC) of overactuated systems via case studies with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs). Specifically, we present different approaches to the design of adaptive controllers for PMSMs which exploit overactuation to achieve identification and control objectives simultaneously. The first approach utilizes a disturbance decoupling control law to prevent the excitation input from perturbing the regulated output. The second approach uses a Lyapunov-based adaptive controller to constrain the states to the output error-zeroing manifold on which they are varied to provide excitation for parameter identification.
