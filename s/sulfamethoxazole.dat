25|$|Hypersensitivity {{reactions}} are less common in nonantibiotic sulfonamides, and, though controversial, {{the available evidence}} suggests those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics {{do not have an}} increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to the nonantibiotic agents. A key component to the allergic response to sulfonamide antibiotics is the arylamine group at N4, found in <b>sulfamethoxazole,</b> sulfasalazine, sulfadiazine, and the anti-retrovirals amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine sulfonamides do not cross-react to sulfonamides that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine sulfonamides. It has therefore been argued that the terms 'sulfonamide allergy' or 'sulfa allergy' are misleading, and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g. 'cotrimoxazole allergy').|$|E
25|$|January 1991 – September 1994: Outbreak in South America, {{apparently}} initiated when a Chinese ship discharged ballast water. Beginning in Peru, {{there were}} 1.04million identified cases and almost 10,000 deaths. The causative agent was an O1, El Tor strain, with small differences from the seventh pandemic strain. In 1992 a new strain appeared in Asia, a non-O1, nonagglutinable vibrio (NAG), which was named O139 Bengal. It was first identified in Tamil Nadu, India {{and for a}} while displaced El Tor in southern Asia. It decreased in prevalence from 1995 to around 10% of all cases. It is considered to be an intermediate between El Tor and the classic strain, and occurs in a new serogroup. Scientists warn of evidence of wide-spectrum resistance by cholera bacteria to drugs such as trimethoprim, <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> and streptomycin.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, <b>sulfamethoxazole,</b> and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E

50|$|The synergy between {{trimethoprim}} and <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> {{was first}} {{described in the}} late 1960s. Trimethoprim and <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> have a greater effect when given together than when given separately, because they inhibit successive steps in the folate synthesis pathway. They are given in a one-to-five ratio in their tablet formulations {{so that when they}} enter the body their concentration in the blood and tissues is roughly one-to-twenty — the exact ratio required for a peak synergistic effect between the two.|$|E
50|$|Trimethoprim binds to {{dihydrofolate reductase}} and {{inhibits}} {{the reduction of}} dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). THF is an essential precursor in the thymidine synthesis pathway and interference with this pathway inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Trimethoprim's affinity for bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is several thousand times greater than its affinity for human dihydrofolate reductase. <b>Sulfamethoxazole</b> inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, an enzyme involved further upstream in the same pathway. Trimethoprim and <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> are commonly used in combination due to possible synergistic effects, and reduced development of resistance. This benefit has been questioned.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sulfamethoxazole</b> {{distributes}} into most {{body tissues}} {{as well as}} into sputum, vaginal fluid, and middle ear fluid. It also crosses the placenta. About 70% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. Its Tmax (or time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma) occurs 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-life of <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> is 10 hours. However, the half-life of the drug noticeably increases in people with creatinine clearance rates equal to or less than 30 mL/minute. A half-life of 22-50 hours has been reported for people with creatinine clearances of less than 10 mL/minute.|$|E
50|$|Pyrimethamine is {{also used}} in {{combination}} with sulfadiazine to treat active toxoplasmosis. The two drugs bind the same enzymatic targets as the drugs trimethoprim and <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> - dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfamethoxazole</b> (SMZ or SMX) is an antibiotic. It is {{used for}} {{bacterial}} infections such as urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and prostatitis and is effective against both gram negative and positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli.|$|E
50|$|Dapsone is {{commonly}} used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine {{for the treatment of}} leprosy. It is also used to both treat and prevent pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). It is also used for toxoplasmosis in people unable to tolerate trimethoprim with <b>sulfamethoxazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trimethoprim (TMP) is an {{antibiotic}} used {{mainly in the}} treatment of bladder infections. Other uses include for middle ear infections and travelers' diarrhea. With <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> or dapsone it may be used for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfamethoxazole,</b> a sulfonamide, induces its {{therapeutic}} effects by {{interfering with}} the de novo (that is, from within the cell) synthesis of folate inside microbial organisms such as protozoa, fungi and bacteria. It does this by competing with p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the biosynthesis of dihydrofolate.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} {{trimethoprim}} causes {{a backlog of}} dihydrofolate (DHF) and this backlog can work against the inhibitory effect the drug has on tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis; {{this is where the}} <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> comes in, its role is in depleting the excess DHF by preventing it from being synthesised in the first place.|$|E
50|$|Thymineless {{death is}} the {{phenomenon}} by which bacteria, yeasts and mammalian cells undergo cell death when they are starved of thymidine triphosphate (dTTP), an essential precursor for DNA replication. This phenomenon underlies the mechanism of action of several antibacterial, antimalarial and anticancer agents, such as Trimethoprim, <b>Sulfamethoxazole,</b> Methotrexate and Fluorouracil.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{side effects of}} <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> are {{gastrointestinal}} disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria). There have been rare instances where severe adverse reactions have resulted in fatalities. These include Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.|$|E
50|$|Sulfonamides are {{prepared}} by the reaction of a sulfonyl chloride with ammonia or an amine.Certain sulfonamides (sulfadiazine or <b>sulfamethoxazole)</b> are sometimes mixed with the drug trimethoprim, which acts against dihydrofolate reductase. As of 2013, the Republic of Ireland is the largest exporter worldwide of Sulfonamides, accounting for approximately 32% of total exports.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfamethoxazole,</b> a sulfanilamide, is a {{structural}} analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). They compete with PABA to bind to dihydropteroate synthetase and inhibit conversion of PABA and dihydropteroate diphosphate to dihydrofolic acid, or dihydrofolate. Inhibiting {{the production of}} dihydrofolate intermediate interferes with the normal bacterial synthesis of folic acid (folate). Folate is an essential metabolite for bacterial growth and replication because it is used in DNA synthesis, primarily at thymidylate and purine biosynthesis, and amino acids synthesis, including serine, glycine and methionine. Hence, blockage of folate production inhibits the folate-dependent metabolic processes for bacterial growth. Since it inhibits bacterial growth, <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> is considered a bacteriostatic antibiotic.Sulfonamides are selective against bacteria because they interfere with the synthesis of folate, a process which does not occur in humans. Human do not synthesize folate, and must acquire it through diet.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is with penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, or co-trimoxazole {{for one to}} two years. Any {{treatment}} lasting {{less than}} a year has an approximate relapse rate of 40%. Recent expert opinion is that Whipple's disease should be treated with doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine for 12 to 18 months. Sulfonamides (sulfadiazine or <b>sulfamethoxazole)</b> may be added for treatment of neurological symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Strains of M. goodii show {{rapid growth}} on Middlebrook 7H10 and trypticase soy agar at 30°C, 35°C and 45°C within 2-4 days. They are {{susceptible}} to the antibiotics amikacin, ethambutol, and <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> but show intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and tobramycin and variable susceptibility to cefmetazole, cefoxitin and clarithromycin. They are resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and skin rashes. It is a sulfonamide and bacteriostatic. It resembles a {{component}} of folic acid. It prevents folic acid synthesis in the bacteria that must synthesize their own folic acid. Mammalian cells, and some bacteria, do not synthesize but require preformed folic acid (vitamin B9), they are therefore insensitive to <b>sulfamethoxazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Actinomyces {{bacteria}} are generally sensitive to penicillin, which is frequently {{used to treat}} actinomycosis. In cases of penicillin allergy, doxycyclin is used.Sulfonamides such as <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> {{may be used as}} an alternative regimen at a total daily dosage of 2-4 grams. Response to therapy is slow and may take months.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may also be used as an adjunct to conventional therapy when the disease process is refractory to antibiotics and surgical treatment.|$|E
50|$|Trimethoprim {{has shown}} to have {{activity}} against a variety of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. However, resistance to trimethoprim and other drugs aimed at DHFR can arise due {{to a variety of}} mechanisms, limiting the success of their therapeutical uses. Resistance can arise from DHFR gene amplification, mutations in DHFR, decrease in the uptake of the drugs, among others. Regardless, trimethoprim and <b>sulfamethoxazole</b> in combination has been used as an antibacterial agent for decades.|$|E
50|$|Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), {{also known}} as co-trimoxazole among other names, is an {{antibiotic}} used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It consists of one part trimethoprim to five parts <b>sulfamethoxazole.</b> It is used for urinary tract infections, MRSA skin infections, travelers' diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, and cholera, among others.
