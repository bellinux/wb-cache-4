Oxirane groups {{on the surface of}} nanofibers were replaced with reducing agent, hydrazine. Surface modified nanofibers were allowed to react with ammonia solution of AgNO 3.

30|$|A simple {{model for}} the {{formation}} of SiNWs during the silver metal-assisted chemical etching of Si was presented by Smith et al. [16]. When Si is immersed in HF/Ag+ solution, <b>silver</b> nanoparticles <b>nucleate</b> immediately and quickly grow. During the initial nucleation stage, individual hemispherical particles are essentially isolated on the Si surface and grow independently. Silver nucleation and growth is a highly dynamic process, allowing silver to dissolve, redeposit, and/or surface migrate to more energetically favored sites. Another comprehensive formation mechanism of porous SiNWs by the etching of Si wafers in HF/AgNO 3 was proposed by Li et al. [18]. The porous structures within the SiNWs were attributed to Si oxidation induced by Ag nanoparticles. It was found that the higher HF concentration was favorable for the growth of SiNWs, and the formation of SiNWs was significantly affected by the Ag+ ion concentration.|$|R
40|$|Nucleation {{and growth}} of solids from {{solutions}} impacts many natural processes and are fundamental to applications in materials engineering and medicine. For a crystalline solid, the nucleus is a nanoscale cluster of ordered atoms, which forms through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. These mechanisms have important consequences on the morphology and nucleation rates of the resultant crystals but {{it is unclear whether}} a nucleus forms spontaneously from solution in a single step or through multiple steps. Using in-situ electron microscopy, we observe and quantify how gold and <b>silver</b> nanocrystals <b>nucleate</b> from a supersaturated aqueous gold and silver solution in three distinct steps: (I) spinodal decomposition into solute-rich and solute-poor liquid phases, (II) nucleation of amorphous gold nanoclusters within the gold-rich liquid phase, followed by (III) crystallization of these amorphous clusters. Our ab-initio calculations on gold nucleation suggest that these steps might be associated with strong gold-gold atom coupling and water-mediated metastable gold complexes. The understanding of intermediate steps in nuclei formation has important implications for the formation {{and growth of}} both crystalline and amorphous materials. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} orange-to-blue {{frequency}} upconversion (UC) in Pr 3 + doped chalcogenide glass (Ga 10 Ge 25 S 65) doped with Ag 2 S and heat treated under different conditions to <b>nucleate</b> <b>silver</b> nanoparticles (NPs). The experiments were performed using 7  ns pulses from a dye laser that operates at ∼ 590  nm, in resonance with the 3 H 4 → 1 D 2 transition of Pr 3 + ions. The enhancement {{observed in the}} UC emission at ∼ 494  nm, ascribed as 3 P 0 → 3 H 4 transition of the Pr 3 + ion, is attributed to the large local field acting on the emitting ions due {{to the presence of}} the metallic NPs...|$|R
30|$|For these applications, it is {{of current}} {{interest}} the synthesis of metal, dielectric, and semiconductor nanoparticles of controllable size and shape. One further step {{is the development of}} experimental procedures that allow the formation of nanostructured patterns with the particles. In our method, we <b>nucleate</b> <b>silver</b> nanocrystals from Ag+ ions provided by silver nitrate (AgNO 3) inside microemulsions. The nanoparticle arrays are obtained when the samples are spread and allowed to dry over a substrate. The Ag+ ions are reduced to Ag atoms by ethylene glycol, the polar phase in the microemulsion. A related procedure has proved successful in the synthesis of spherical silver nanoparticles in solutions of AgNO 3 in ethylene glycol [30]. The main difference with our approach is that we confine the Ag+ ions in narrow cylindrical channels, which are obtained by microemulsifying ethylene glycol with isooctane; the microemulsions have been stabilized with an anionic surfactant: dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT).|$|R
40|$|Multi-walled carbon {{nanotube}} (MWCNT) multilayer thin films with controlled thickness were pre-assembled on electrodes by alternatively depositing MWCNT and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) via a layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were then electro-deposited on the MWCNT surface from AgNO 3 solution using a potentiostatic double pulse technique. The size, density and morphology of silver nanoparticles that electrodeposited on MWCNT were {{controlled by the}} pulse parameters. When a voltage pulse of - 600 mV was used to <b>nucleate</b> <b>silver</b> nanoparticles and a growth pulse of - 105 mV was applied to grow the particles, silver particles of 10 - 500 nm with varied density could be electro-generated on MWCNT surface. The formation of Ag NPs and the morphology of the MWCNT/Ag NP composite films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The MWCNT/Ag NP composite films exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity to the reduction of hydrogen peroxide which was also shown to be slightly affected by the size and density of Ag NPs on the film...|$|R
40|$|Composite or hybrid {{materials}} are {{commonly found in}} Nature, formed through the concentration and subsequent nucleation of ions upon organic templates that are most often protein based. Examples include the deposition of calcium containing salts in bone, teeth and the inner ear and iron oxide structures in magnetotactic bacteria. Biological organisms use {{a limited number of}} metal ions, the principal ones being calcium and iron, with lesser amounts of strontium, and barium. The ability to utilize other ions to generate composites offers the possibility of new material properties. New materials incorporating silver would be useful in the context of antimicrobial functions. Therefore, in the present study, a new route to such functionalized biomaterials is reported. Genetically engineered fusion proteins are created by the incorporation of nucleotides corresponding to short silver binding peptides identified by a combinatorial biopanning process into the consensus sequence of silk from the spider, Nephila clavipes. The resulting chimeric silk-silver binding proteins nucleated Ag ions from a solution of silver nitrate while the silk protein provided a stable template material which could be processed into films, fibers, and three-dimensional scaffolds. The silk films inhibited microbial growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microrganisms on agar plates and in liquid culture, thus highlighting the potential of these chimeric material systems as antimicrobial biomedical coatings. Genetically engineered spider silk was modified to incorporate a short peptide sequence to <b>nucleate</b> <b>silver</b> ions. The resulting hybrid protein combines the strength and biocompatibility of silk with nucleation of silver ions for antimicrobial functions. The table of contents figure shows: a) silver nanoparticles formed {{on the surface of the}} silk protein, b) inhibition of microbial growth. Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
