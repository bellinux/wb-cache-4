40|$|Summary:. Even a mild {{degree of}} {{postoperative}} deviation {{of the nasal}} dorsum and/or columella from the midsagittal plane could be enough to displease a patient. Postoperative judgment of the nasal dorsum and the columellar positioning on the midsagittal plane is somewhat of a subjective decision determined by the surgeons’ naked eye. Most innovations tend to evolve from necessities. The risk and reality of misjudging the positioning for both the nasal dorsum and/or the columella led me to develop a device for the objective measurement of the midsagittal axis of the nose. I have called it the rhinoplasty <b>setsquare</b> device. This device is made from 316 quality stainless chrome. It is completely sterilizable. It consists of 4 main parts. During the finishing touches of the operation, the correct placement of the rhinoplasty <b>setsquare</b> device will provide the surgeon with an objective decision that will help make the positioning of the nasal dorsum and the columella more precise. When I conducted my research on literature and device catalogs for possible devices designed for measurement in rhinoplasty operations, I ran into devices such as the Castroviejo caliper, calibrated lateral crus stabilizer, Joseph measuring rod, and Thorpe Marchac caliper. All of them are unique in their function and design. However, as far as I could see, there is no device similar in form and function to my rhinoplasty <b>setsquare</b> device. I have been using this device for 8 months for all my rhinoplasty patients. I am more confident now in my postoperative results due to its objective measurement of the midsagittal line...|$|E
50|$|The <b>SETsquared</b> Partnership, usually known {{simply as}} <b>SETsquared,</b> is a {{business}} incubation network run by five universities in Southern England. <b>SETsquared</b> stands for Southern England Technology Triangle. The partnership was formed in 2002, between the University of Bath, the University of Bristol, the University of Southampton and the University of Surrey. The University of Exeter joined the partnership in 2011.|$|R
50|$|At Bath, <b>SETsquared</b> {{are based}} in the University of Bath Innovation Centre in Carpenter House.|$|R
50|$|In Surrey, <b>SETsquared</b> {{is based}} in the Surrey Technology Centre within Surrey Research Park, Guildford.|$|R
50|$|In December 2014, <b>SETsquared</b> opened another centre, in the Basing View {{business}} park in Basingstoke, Hampshire, assisted {{by a grant}} of £100,000 from Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council.|$|R
50|$|As Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University of Southampton (2000-04), {{he led the}} {{development}} and implementation of an ambitious vision for Enterprise and Innovation, including the partnership with IP2IPO and <b>SETsquared</b> together with the universities of Bristol, Bath and Surrey.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to hosting and supporting startup companies, <b>SETsquared</b> promotes university-to-business technology transfer and guides students into entrepreneurship. It has been mainly {{financed by the}} Higher Education Funding Council for England's Higher Education Innovation Fund and by membership fees for businesses.|$|R

Instabear was awarded Best Graduate Start up 2014 by <b>SETsquared</b> Enterprise Awards and {{appeared}} on Redbrick research as one of Five Pioneering UK Student Startups 2014. Akhtar still runs the company alongside working at a creative agency. During {{his third year}}, he also started working on WillyKini, a project he presented in The Apprentice.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which university incubators are connected with their regional economy in terms of key resources such as intellectual capital (in the form of new research ideas that have commercial potential), human resource (scientific and industry expertise) and finance. Drawing on network visualisation methods initially pioneered by Casper and Murray (2005), Casper (2007) and Gilding (2008), we analyse patterns of organisational collaboration and clusters among firms which are supported by one of the university incubator programmes in the UK: <b>SETsquared</b> Business Acceleration Centres at Universities of Bath, Bristol, Southampton and Surrey. The study investigates networks at local, national and international levels, identifying the spatial patterns that have evolved in the region since the inception of <b>SETSquared</b> programme in 2003. The paper highlights the significance and persistence of external resource, which is attracted at the local and university level, and makes impacts at the regional level, if appropriate partnership structures are in place. The paper points out the significance of brand-building at the partnership level, which is linked to inter-regional level with strong ties with the wider strong mega-region of Oxford, Cambridge and London.

30|$|An {{alternative}} route to market for new inventions and innovations {{may be the}} creation of a spin-off company. A company structure has to be created, investment procured, a management team formed, and many other matters attended to. The RCT sets up spin-off companies as new businesses, and has helped establish 26 new companies, as at September of 2014. Support for new companies is offered via the <b>SETsquared</b> incubator which provides close mentoring, introduction to investors and training as well as the more traditional desk and meeting space.|$|R
50|$|GO Science Ltd {{was founded}} in 2002 in Bristol, UK by a former BAe {{director}} of Underwater Systems, and {{a founder of the}} Las Iguanas restaurant chain, to develop a ‘ring wing’ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).Initial funding was from the South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA) in 2006.In November 2008 ICON Corporate Finance raised significant investment (19.4%) for GO Science from Kenda Capital, the manager of the Shell Technology Ventures Fund 1 (STVF) with Kenda directors joining the board.The prototype vehicle was developed in the University of Bristol labs, then at Redhill Farm Business Park and later at Aztec West, outside Bristol. An office was opened at the <b>SETsquared</b> Business Acceleration Centre at the University of Bristol.|$|R
50|$|Engine Shed {{is a new}} use {{for part}} of the Old Station, Brunel's {{original}} building, in partnership with the University of Bristol. Opened in December 2013, it hosts business incubators, including <b>SETsquared</b> and WebStart Bristol, which support a cluster of hi-tech startup companies. Engine Shed leases its office space to the incubators, who in turn sub-let space on more flexible terms to the companies, which are selected for their high growth potential, and high expected benefits for the regional economy. In December 2015, with the building fully occupied, additional space was made available in the form of Boxworks, which was rapidly constructed by ForwardSpace next to Engine Shed using 20 shipping containers. This was intended to be a temporary solution until an Engine Shed 2 is built. Public consultation for Engine Shed 2 took place in November 2016.|$|R
