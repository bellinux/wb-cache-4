Upon her fall at 5/139, a collapse started in the final overs, as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. The Australians completed a 22-run win. In the final group match against the hosts, Duffin came in at 3/52 and hit 13 from 17 balls, as Australia eventually finished on 7/133. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> catch as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten {{at the top of}} their quartet.|$|E
25|$|Elliott {{was part}} of the 2010 World Twenty20 winning team in the West Indies and played in all but one of Australia's matches. In the first warm-up match against New Zealand, which Australia lost by 18 runs, Elliott took 1/17 from three overs, {{removing}} top-scorer Suzie Bates for 51. She then made 4 from 7 balls at the end of Australia's innings. In the last warm-up match against Pakistan, Elliott came in with two balls remaining and made 2 from 2 balls before being run out from the last ball as Australia made 5/166. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> catch and did not bowl as Australia won by 82 runs.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Sthalekar was {{selected}} in the Australia Under-21 team to play against New Zealand A. In her first match she scored 81 before being run out, but this was not enough to prevent a five-wicket defeat. The New Zealand attacked her bowling during the match, taking 45 runs from her nine overs without losing a wicket. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket in each of the next two matches as Australia won by ten and nine wickets respectively, before scoring 27—again run out—and taking 3/39 in the fourth match to help secure a 15-run win. She ended the series with 108 runs at 54.00 and six wickets at 22.50 and an economy rate of 3.46.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 Rose Bowl series, Farrell {{played in}} each of the five ODIs during the Australian leg of the competition. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket {{in each of}} the matches and made ducks in both of her innings. She ended the ODIs with five wickets at 21.60 and an economy rate of 3.25 as Australia won all five matches. The ODIs were {{followed}} by five T20 internationals, three at Bellerive Oval in Hobart and the last two in New Zealand. Farrell played in all but the fourth T20 game, taking five wickets at 17.80 and an economy rate of 6.35 and she batted twice, scoring two runs at 2.00. New Zealand won all five T20s and Farrell was left out of the three ODIs on New Zealand soil.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Sthalekar {{played in}} four matches for Australia Youth against New Zealand A before the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand. Her batting was not effective, {{yielding}} 21 runs at 4.25, but she was incisive and economical with the ball, taking five wickets at 4.80 and economy rate of 1.33. Seven of her 18 overs were maidens. In the Rose Bowl series, Australia hosted three ODIs before travelling to New Zealand for three more matches. Sthalekar performed steadily but unspectacularly during the series. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket in the first five matches before failing to dismiss anyone in the final ODI, ending with five wickets at 38.00 and an economy rate of 4.31. She scored 88 runs at 17.60, making 33 in the first and last matches. Australia won all but the fourth match of the series.|$|E
25|$|Sthalekar {{had another}} {{consistent}} {{season in the}} 2006–07 WNCL. Apart from one wicketless game, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> or two wickets {{in each of the}} seven remaining round-robin matches. New South Wales struggled early in the season, narrowly winning the first match by three wickets against Victoria before losing three matches in a row against the same team and Queensland. Sthalekar failed to capitalise on her starts in these matches, making 40, 27, 31 and 0 as her team averaged 177 in the three losses. New South Wales fought back to win their four remaining matches to qualify for the finals; in the last qualifying match, Sthalekar made 92 not out to guide her team to an eight-wicket win and seal their berth in the deciding matches against Victoria. In the first final, Sthalekar took 1/22 and made nine as New South Wales reached their target of 137 with only one wicket in hand. She then scored three and went wicketless as Victoria squared the series with an eight-wicket the next day. In the deciding final, Sthalekar was attacked by the Victorians, conceding 34 runs from seven overs. In the run-chase, she top-scored with 83 as the defending champions prevailed by three wickets to win consecutive titles. Sthalekar ended the series with 11 wickets at 27.36 at an economy rate of 2.95 and 325 runs at 36.11.|$|E

Despite seeing him only twice after 1855 (he moved to San Francisco in 1862), she variously referred to him as [...] "my Philadelphia", [...] "my Clergyman", [...] "my dearest earthly friend" [...] and [...] "my Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood".|$|E
500|$|According to {{journalist}} Barry Miles, after Lennon and Ono {{had been}} injured {{in a car accident}} in June 1969, partway through recording Abbey Road, a bed was installed in the studio with a microphone so the latter could make artistic comments about the album. Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during {{the latter part of the}} Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members. George Harrison verbally assaulted her after <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking. The English press dubbed her [...] "the woman who broke up the Beatles", but Ono has stated that the Beatles broke up themselves without any direct involvement from her, adding [...] "I don't think I could have tried even to break them up." [...] In an interview with Dick Cavett, Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up The Beatles and even Harrison said in an interview with Cavett that the Beatles had problems long before Ono came on the scene.|$|E

500|$|Healy was {{selected}} in the Australian squad for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand in February 2010 due to an injury to the incumbent wicketkeeper and captain Jodie Fields. The selection committee released a statement saying [...] "Alyssa has been identified for higher honours {{for a number of}} years and now gets the chance to display her wicket-keeping skills and attacking batting on the international stage". Healy made her ODI debut at the Adelaide Oval and played in all five ODIs in the Australian leg of the series. In her first match, she scored 21 from 11 balls in the death overs, hitting four fours as Australia made 241 before bowling out the visitors for 126 to seal a 115-run win. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> catch, removing Amy Satterthwaite from the bowling of Rene Farrell. Healy made consecutive ducks in the next two matches, and made four in the final match at Junction Oval. She had only brief opportunities with the bat in the closing stages of the innings. She ended the series with 25 runs at 6.25 and a strike rate of 100.00, five catches and a stumping.|$|E

2500|$|In 690, Empress Dowager Wu's cousin's son Zong Qinke {{submitted}} {{a number of}} modified Chinese characters intended to showcase Empress Dowager Wu's greatness. She adopted them, and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> of the modified characters, Zhao (曌), to be her formal name (i.e., the name by which the people would exercise naming taboo on). 曌 was made from two other characters: Ming (明) on top, meaning [...] "light" [...] or [...] "clarity", and Kong (空) on the bottom, meaning [...] "sky." [...] The implication appeared to be {{that she would be}} like the light shining from the sky. (Zhao (照), meaning [...] "shine", from which 曌 was derived, might have been her original name, but evidence of that is inconclusive.) Later that year, after successive petition drives, initially started by the low-level official Fu Youyi, began to occur in waves, asking her to take the throne, Emperor Ruizong offered to take the name of Wu as well. On 18 August, 690, she approved of the requests. She changed the name of the state to Zhou, claiming ancestry from the Zhou dynasty, and took the throne as Empress Regnant (with the title of Empress Regnant Shengshen (聖神皇帝), literally [...] "Divine and Sacred Emperor or Empress Regnant"). Emperor Ruizong was deposed and made crown prince with the atypical title of Huangsi (皇嗣). This thus interrupted Tang dynasty, and she became the first (and only) woman to reign over China as Empress Regnant.|$|E
2500|$|About 445,000 {{double eagle}} coins were minted in 1933, {{but only one}} was ever legally released. King Farouk of Egypt {{contacted}} Nellie Tayloe Ross, then Director of the U.S. Mint, and requested one 1933 double eagle for his extensive coin collection. Since the 1933 coins were not circulated, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> coin to the Smithsonian Institution and received documentation of its rarity. She then issued an export document allowing the Egyptian king to receive his coin. After the deaths of Farouk and the general who inherited the king's collection, the coin disappeared into a European collector's possession. It resurfaced when Stephen Fenton acquired it. When he tried to auction it off, both he and the auctioneer were arrested and the coin was seized. It {{was placed in the}} vault of the Secret Service in their office in the World Trade Center. While the provenance and paperwork proving ownership was debated ad nauseam in the courts, the coin was transferred to Fort Knox for further safekeeping. The World Trade Center was attacked and destroyed later that year. An agreement was reached between the U.S. Government and Stephen Fenton. The Fenton Farouk, as it came to be called, was sold at auction for $7.9 million in 2002 with a 10% auctioneer's premium and $20 to [...] "monetize" [...] the coin. Fenton and the government split the proceeds of the auction, with the provision that any further 1933 double eagles would be seized and not auctioned. In 2003, a Philadelphia woman named Joan Switt Langbord found 10 1933 double eagles in a safe deposit box that once belonged to her parents; when she took them to be appraised, they were seized by the United States Treasury as stolen property. Investigators claimed that Langbord's father, Israel Switt, conspired with a clerk inside the mint to steal the coins. He had been investigated previously for the crime, leading to the confiscation of several gold pieces, but the statute of limitations had prevented him from being prosecuted. Langbord sued to have the coins returned to her, but in July 2011, a federal jury ruled the stolen coins were property of the U.S. government.|$|E
