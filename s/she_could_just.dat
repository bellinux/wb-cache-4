500|$|It {{is worth}} pondering what {{the title of}} Mariah Carey's {{eleventh}} studio album could refer to. Emancipation, maybe, in a nod to her 2005 comeback album, The Emancipation of Mimi; or perhaps {{the energy of the}} original equation, a statement that Carey still has what it takes to party all night at the age of 37, even as she describes herself as [...] "eternally 12". Then again, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be identifying herself alongside Einstein as a fellow genius. Either way, 'E=MC²' finds Carey loopier than ever, embracing her own larger-than-life image with gusto: Mariah Carey Squared indeed.|$|E
500|$|Writing for School Library Journals blog Good Comics for Kids, Snow Wildsmith {{reviewed}} {{the first volume}} positively, and wrote, [...] "The elements her fans adore are all there: beautiful characters, gender ambiguity, horror themes, blood and gore, and, of course, gorgeous costumes." [...] According to Wildsmith, the unexplained aspects of the plot helped to create interest for the readers. David Welsh of Comic World News had more mixed feelings about the first volume; although he praised the aesthetic, premise, translation, and guignols, he wrote that Yuki's work would be more appealing [...] "if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> strike that balance between creative focus and intellectual abandon and emotional shamelessness." [...] About.com's Deb Aoki reviewed it negatively, criticizing its plot. Aoki wrote that it would only appeal to fans of Yuki. While finding aspects of the setting and costume design historically confusing and trying on the reader's suspension of disbelief, Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network wrote that the Gwin's backstory, the quick pacing, Yuki's detailed art, and her frightening portrayal of zombies made the third volume [...] "a winning entry in an already fascinating series." [...] Silverman had mixed feelings about the dense page layouts: according to her, they contributed to the narrative suspense, although they affected the reader's ability to easily read the volume in places. In her review of the fourth volume, Silverman praised the character development and Yuki's ability to create mysteries, although she wrote that not all readers would enjoy the numerous plot twists. She also suggested {{the possibility of a}} metaphor for the French Revolution in the series. Another reviewer for Anime News Network, Carlo Santos gave the third volume a C-; while he praised Yuki's illustrations and ability to create [...] "dramatic revelations," [...] he wrote that it was overshadowed by the confusing and cluttered narrative.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{she feels}} {{as if she is}} the fulcrum, Agnes begins and ends the play on her musings of insanity. She wonders if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> {{suddenly}} slip off into madness and what that would be like. She wonders what her husband would do if that happened. Would she be an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment is a very large issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.” ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not {{shake it}} off in the train; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> keep back the tears.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} held a strip so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> see 'Dolores M. Mohun,' and she unhesitatingly answered 'Yes'--very much surprised.|$|R
6000|$|Honest and fine, she couldn't greatly pretend she didn't see it. Still <b>she</b> <b>could</b> pretend <b>just</b> a little. [...] "But {{why should}} you be so dreadfully right?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> {{discern the}} outline of a little house, not unlike a bathing-machine without wheels.|$|E
60|$|Ethelberta {{turned and}} looked up. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> discern Neigh's form upon {{the steps of the}} fleche above, {{ascending}} toilsomely in search of her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> discern {{his action}} as he shrugged his shoulders, {{and spread out}} his palms in silence. That cold dislike which is the anger of unimpassioned beings was {{hardening}} within him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; oh, no! it's {{bad news}} from home," [...] and Christie's head went down again, {{for a kind}} word was more than <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear <b>just</b> then.|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't find pleasanter ladies than Mrs. Drane and her daughter," [...] he said. [...] "The {{latter is}} copying some {{manuscript}} for me, which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do <b>just</b> as well here as at my house--" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{opened the}} {{casement}} instantly, {{and put out}} her hand to him, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> perceive his outline. He clasped her fingers, and she noticed the heat of his palm and its shakiness.|$|R
60|$|Wilhelmina {{leaned back}} in her chair as the last trick fell. Her eyes were turned towards the window. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see the avenue of elms down which her agent had ridden a short while since. Deyes, through half closed eyes, watched her with some curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|And by {{a glimmer}} of moonlight, through {{curtains}} designed to keep out nothing, she stole up to the bed. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see his face, and eyes {{looking up at her}} with a sort of adoration. She put her hand on his forehead and whispered: [...] "Are you comfy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And Gyp sat {{looking up}} at the {{apparition}} of her husband. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see his eyes straining after that flying nymph. Miss Daphne's faun! Why, even his ears were pointed! Had she never noticed before, how like a faun he was? Yes--on her wedding-night! And she said quietly: ...|$|E
50|$|Claire Finnerty (2006-2007) (Fiona Wass) is Michelle's best mate - a beautician. She is very {{wild and}} loves biting men. From her {{behaviour}} towards both genders, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be either bisexual or <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be <b>just</b> a single young woman willing to experiment, flirt {{and have fun}} with both genders before settling down.|$|R
60|$|She {{still held}} his hand, with a perplexed and saddened face. The admirable {{absence of any}} jealousy on his side--his large and generous {{confidence}} in her love for him--was just the rebuke to her that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel; <b>just</b> the rebuke also (in my opinion) that she had deserved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I think you're fonder of me than Tom is," [...] said Maggie. Then, {{wondering}} how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> convince Philip that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> like him <b>just</b> as well, {{although he was}} crooked, she said,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hollo! {{what did}} you put out the light for?' he angrily answered; and as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> {{distinguish}} his white shirt sleeves, she sprang to him. Steps went hurriedly down the stairs. 'Gone!' they both cried at once; Mervyn, with an imprecation on the darkness, adding, 'Go and ring the bell. I'll watch here.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{at first}} quite dark in the cabin, but as the visitor’s eyes became {{accustomed}} to it, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> discern the outlines of a small table, while a steady breathing assured her that somebody was sleeping close by. Feeling {{her way to the}} table she discovered, a locker, and, taking a seat, coughed gently. The breathing continuing quite undisturbed, she coughed again, twice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. I {{began to}} figure then {{that this was}} a mother lion, and that her cubs were close by, and that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as well sneak up and drop on me from above as not. So I got down and left her alone. It was her popping up now here and now there like a ghost that locoed me. I was sure scared." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tirzah Todd {{laughed and}} showed her white teeth and merry eyes so pleasantly {{that no one could}} help liking to talk with her, but alas! old Pucklechurch took care {{to let them know that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be <b>just</b> as merry in a {{different}} way at the [...] "Fox and Hounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I think you're fonder of me than Tom is," [...] said Maggie, rather sorrowfully. Then, {{wondering}} how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> convince Philip that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> like him <b>just</b> as well, {{although he was}} crooked, she said: ...|$|R
60|$|She paused again. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not {{remember}} <b>just</b> what Luella Delia Philpotts had said trust was to love. It was something extremely neat, {{but it had}} slipped her memory.|$|R
6000|$|For {{some months}} longer, Mr. Gracedieu lingered. One morning, {{he said to}} Eunice: [...] "I want to teach you to knit. Sit by me, and see me do it." [...] His hands fell softly on his lap; his head sank little by little on her shoulder. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> hear him whisper: [...] "How {{pleasant}} it is to sleep!" [...] Never was Death's dreadful work more gently done.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're quite welcome. Laws, {{but your}} eyes is like your ma's. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> about talk with hers. Your father was sorter homely but awful nice. I mind hearing folks {{say when they}} was married that there never was two people more in love with each other--Pore creatures, they didn't live much longer; but they was awful happy while they was alive, and I s'pose that counts for a good deal." ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} longer she {{remained}} standing beside the open window, listening to his footfall on the flagged path. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> distinguish his moving form from the surrounding gloom, as he crept along the shadows towards the boundary of the garden. Then as for one brief minute she saw his figure outlined above the garden wall, she closed the window very slowly and turned away from it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] he said, whilst in the fast-gathering dusk <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> {{perceive}} the sudden hardening of his face, {{the look of}} wild passion in his eyes, [...] "but for that evening in Boulogne, but for that alternative which that devil placed before me, I might never have known how much you meant to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lamo {{has stated}} {{that he would not}} have turned Manning in [...] "if lives werent in danger... Manning was in a war zone and {{basically}} trying to vacuum up as much classified information as <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>just</b> throwing it up into the air." [...] WikiLeaks responded by denouncing Lamo and Wired Magazine reporter Kevin Poulsen as [...] "notorious felons, informers & manipulators", and said: [...] "journalists should take care." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tippengray {{was very}} fond of driving, and his spirits had risen again. But {{he was a good}} deal {{surprised}} when Miss Calthea declined to take the seat beside him, preferring to occupy the rear seat {{with her back to the}} horse. By turning a little to one side, <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> talk <b>just</b> as well, and it was more comfortable in such a small vehicle as a village cart to have a whole seat to one's self.|$|R
6000|$|Her nerves were hurting her. She looked {{automatically}} {{again at}} the high, uncurtained windows. In the last dusk <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> perceive outside a huge fir-tree swaying its boughs: {{it was as if}} she thought it rather than saw it. The rain came flying on the window panes. Ah, why had she no peace? These two men, why did they tear at her? Why did they not come--why was there this suspense? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{schooner}} at once bore up, discharging {{the guns}} on the starboard side as she came round, and laying her course {{as close to the}} wind as she could be jammed, showed her stern to the pirate. Two of his guns forward were fired, others could not be brought to bear. The Arrow was now almost retracing her course, for the wind was west-nor'-west, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> follow the line of coast.|$|E
60|$|Taking a {{sprig of}} {{jessamine}} and holding {{it to her}} nose, she went up to that picture. In the dim light, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see {{the outline of the}} face and the eyes gazing at her. The scent of the blossom penetrated her nerves; in her heart, something faintly stirred, as a leaf turns over, as a wing flutters. And, blossom and all, she clasped her hands over her breast, where again her heart quivered with that faint, shy tremor.|$|E
60|$|Once more poor Mrs. Quack {{was quite}} {{overcome}} with her troubles and sorrows. Peter wished {{with all his}} heart {{that he could do}} something to comfort her, but of course he couldn't, so he just sat still and waited until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> tell him <b>just</b> what did happen to Mr. Quack.|$|R
5000|$|She {{insists that}} Nina undress and places the sari on her. The Contessa then cuts Nina's long, {{dark hair and}} puts makeup on her and {{transforms}} the maid into a beautiful woman. Nina tells the Contessa <b>she</b> wishes <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be <b>just</b> like her, but the Contessa says that is a silly desire. While listening to the Contessa's stories, Nina imagines herself living out the Contessa's existence, triggering a series of fantasy sequences, all set in elaborate settings such as casinos and Venetian palazzos.|$|R
5000|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.3 out of 10 and {{wrote in his}} verdict, [...] "With no Fish to follow (yay!) Gotham {{actually}} {{figured out a way}} to insert Barbara back into the story in an intriguing way. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have <b>just</b> been a victim of the Ogre. Or someone that Gordon needed to save (again). But they chose to make her somewhat of a broken kindred spirit. Does she know what she's getting herself into? Probably not. But it'd be even cooler if she did." ...|$|R
