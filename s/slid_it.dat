500|$|Sitting on {{the bench}} as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson [...] "had a feeling" [...] that he could score. [...] He {{convinced}} coach Sinden to send him out when Peter Mahovlich left the ice. Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from Yvan Cournoyer {{in front of the}} net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. [...] As he got to his feet, Phil Esposito recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound and <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6–5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. [...] It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and Alexander Yakushev. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. [...] The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.|$|E
500|$|During {{a typical}} Polish {{coronation}} ceremony {{in the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the king-elect received Szczerbiec after his anointment and before being crowned and enthroned. The primate of Poland, that is the archbishop of Gniezno, picked up the unsheathed sword from the altar {{and handed it to}} the kneeling king. At the same time, he recited a formula which asked the monarch to use the sword to rule justly, defend the Church, fight evil, protect widows and orphans, and to [...] "rebuild what is damaged, maintain what is rebuilt, avenge what is unjust, reinforce what is well managed," [...] etc. Then, the king handed the sword to the Crown sword-bearer (miecznik koronny), who <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into the scabbard and passed on to the primate. The primate, aided by the Crown and Lithuanian sword-bearers, fastened the scabbard to the king's belt. The king stood up and, facing onlookers, withdrew Szczerbiec, made three times {{the sign of the cross}} with it, and wiped it against his left arm before replacing it in the scabbard. The king's sword-wielding abilities were closely watched by his new subjects during this part of the ritual. When Augustus III betrayed his poor fencing skills at his coronation, nobles joked that they were going to have [...] "a peaceful lord". After Szczerbiec, a bishop handed the sovereign the Grunwald Swords symbolizing the monarch's reign over the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth.|$|E
60|$|He <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> {{into the}} left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head. Her hand crept to his, <b>slid</b> over <b>it,</b> drew {{it up to}} her breast. She was swaying nearer to him. He pulled his hand free and fled to his tent.|$|R
60|$|A small rope was handy, and {{lowering}} this, each <b>slid</b> along <b>it</b> into {{the waters of}} the harbor. Then they struck out swiftly but silently; and in a few minutes the fog and darkness hid them completely from view.|$|R
60|$|Nod {{listened to}} her flattery, and, having untied his {{precious}} bundle, he <b>slid</b> down with <b>it</b> softly to the ground.|$|R
60|$|Bartley {{mounted to}} {{the left side of the}} open buggy {{standing}} at the curb-stone, and Lapham, gathering up the hitching-weight, <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> under the buggy-seat and mounted beside him.|$|E
6000|$|MacDonald counted {{his cards}} carefully, to make double {{sure it was}} not a foul hand, wrote a sum on a paper slip, and <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into the pot, with the simple utterance:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Billy {{caught it}} as deftly {{as a dog}} catches a bit of biscuit, looked at it in great surprise, tossed it in the air, bit its rim critically, and finally <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into his {{trousers}} pocket.|$|E
60|$|Frank drew a pace or two {{nearer the}} edge of the cañon, and felt a creepy shiver run through him as he looked down. The rock he stood upon arched out a little over the shadowy hollow, through the bottom of which the wild waters seethed and clamored. He {{supposed}} that he stood at least sixty feet above them. The rock on the opposite side also projected, so that the rift was wider at the bottom than at the top. In one place, however, the crest of it had broken away and plunged into the gulf, leaving a short slope down which stones and soil had <b>slid.</b> <b>Its</b> lower edge lay about twelve feet beneath him, though the distance would have been rather less if it could have been measured horizontally.|$|R
50|$|The side {{joined the}} National League in 1973. During the 1980s <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> from Division 4 to Division 6 in season 1988-89.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} into my father's face, and the peace that shone from <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> into my soul and gave me strength.|$|R
6000|$|... "And here's a {{piece of}} cake," [...] added Jack, and <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> along, under {{the edge of the}} table. Then Pepper got up and left the room. He did not know where to go and so walked slowly in the {{direction}} of the boathouse.|$|E
60|$|His hand {{accepted}} the moist tender gland and <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into a sidepocket. Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid {{them on the}} rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.|$|E
60|$|I had {{not much}} time to {{consider}} the situation, for while he had been speaking, Uncle Beamish had waded through the snow, and finding the barn door unfastened, had <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> to one side. Instantly the horse entered the dark barn, fortunately finding nothing in his way.|$|E
60|$|Algy Martyn chased {{an elusive}} piece of carrot about his soup plate, {{watching}} it interestedly as <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> coyly from the spoon.|$|R
60|$|The air {{was cool}} and bracing, and the snow on the highway well packed down, so that the cutter <b>slid</b> over <b>it</b> with ease. As Abner Filbury had said, the steed was a mettlesome one, and soon Sam found he had {{all he could do}} to hold the horse in.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s the {{enclosed}} tubular chute type fire escape became widely accepted for schools, hospitals and other institution replaced the open iron ladder type. Its main advantage was {{people would have}} no reason to use it for another other than a fire escape and patients could be <b>slid</b> down <b>it</b> in a fire on their bedding.|$|R
60|$|When Jonas {{was sure}} that he was in, he took the old fender and <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> down very {{cautiously}} between the trap and the box, so as to cover the open part entirely, and make a sort of grated front, like a cage. Then he took the trap away, and there the little nut-cracker was, safely imprisoned, but yet fairly exposed to view.|$|E
6000|$|... "A sad spectacle," [...] {{said the}} Negro President, and he sighed as he spoke. [...] "One wonders if our civilisation, if our moral {{standards}} themselves, are slipping from us." [...] Then half in reverie, {{or as if}} overcome by the melancholy of his own thought, he lifted a spoon {{from the table and}} <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> gently into the bosom of his faded uniform.|$|E
60|$|Joel {{ran down}} to his skiff and, leaping in, began to row vigorously across. Bostil watched while the workmen turned the boat over and <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> off the sand-bar and tied it {{securely}} to the mooring. Bostil observed that not a man there saw anything unusual about the river. But, for that matter, {{there was nothing to}} see. The river was the same.|$|E
60|$|He {{stepped up}} on the porch. There was no bell. He searched for it, running his hand uneasily {{over the surface of}} the door. All at once there was a click, a sharp snap on a level with his eyes. Cole glanced up, startled. A lens was {{vanishing}} as the door section <b>slid</b> over <b>it.</b> He had been photographed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'All right; I {{am taking}} the responsibility.' I {{was just as}} anxious to kill the boat, now, as I had been to save her before. I {{impressed}} my orders upon my memory, to be used at the inquest, and made a straight break for the reef. As it disappeared under our bows I held my breath; but we <b>slid</b> over <b>it</b> like oil.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you doubt}} me," [...] Ronald said, [...] "you {{can send a}} man to the wall. I felt my feet loosen a tile and <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> down into the gutter." ...|$|R
60|$|Next {{day they}} did {{not go back to}} the fence, but worked at the gateway on the blind corrals. Pan {{constructed}} the opening to resemble a narrow aisle of scrub oak. Material for this they cut from the bluff and <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> down to the level. By sunset one corral had been almost completed. It was large enough to hold a thousand horses. One third of it was fenced by the bluff.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He had {{hated her}} {{throughout}} that second pursuit, and had longed for retaliation on her. He now counterfeited her signature to an instrument, leaving {{all she had}} to leave, to her daughter--ten years old then--to whom the property passed absolutely, and appointing himself the daughter's Guardian. When He <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> under the pillow of the bed on which she lay, He bent down in the deaf ear of Death, and whispered: [...] "Mistress Pride, I have determined a long time that, dead or alive, you must make me compensation in Money.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} girl, and Penelope began hastily {{to amend the}} disarray of her hair, which she tumbled into a mass {{on the top of}} her little head, setting off the pale dark of her {{complexion}} with a flash of crimson ribbon at her throat. She moved across the carpet once or twice with the quaint grace that belonged to her small figure, made a dissatisfied grimace at it in the glass, caught a handkerchief out of a drawer and <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into her pocket, and then descended to Corey.|$|E
5000|$|... eSATAp cables are {{available}} with wide connectors to plug directly into the power and signal connectors of a bare drive, providing a 12 V supply {{in the case of}} a desktop machine. A version of this wide connector is found inside every external sata hard drive enclosure; when the hard drive is <b>slid</b> inside, <b>it</b> mates with a connector that supplies it with both signal and power.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cut him loose, fellows!" [...] cried Flapp, {{and this}} was done, and Dick {{staggered}} to the table, clutched <b>it,</b> <b>slid</b> {{to the floor and}} acted as if he had fallen into a deep sleep.|$|R
60|$|The opening {{was almost}} square, with three sides of rough rock. In trying {{to climb up}} some of the rocks Tom gave one a shove and <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> from sight, {{revealing}} an opening beyond.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a pause}} of five full {{minutes after}} this, and the blue-green flame died down. Janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets, while Azizun turned {{her face to the}} wall and took the terrier in her arms. Suddhoo put out an arm {{mechanically}} to Janoo's huqa, and she <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> across the floor with her foot. Directly above the body and on the wall, were a couple of flaming portraits, in stamped paper frames, of the Queen and the Prince of Wales. They looked down on the performance, and, to my thinking, seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Henry stooped {{down and}} got a record from the basketful we'd brought, <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> in the phonograph, and started her off. It was a cornet solo, very neat and beautiful, {{and the name of}} it was 'Home, Sweet Home.' Not one of them fifty odd men in the room moved while it was playing, and the {{governor}} man kept his eyes steady on Mellinger. I saw Mellinger's head go up little by little, and his hand came creeping away from the package. Not until the last note sounded did anybody stir. And then Homer P. Mellinger takes up the bundle of boodle and slams it in the governor man's face.|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{glanced over}} his shoulder, and saw Pancho, his major‐domo, {{standing}} half dressed not far behind him with a lantern and a big machete in his hand. He stooped, picked up the knife, and {{with a flick of}} his fingers <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into his sleeve. Then he held the lantern higher, and Appleby recognized his adversary as a weight clerk in the sugar mill. He blinked with his eyes, and the damp dripped from his face, which showed haggard and drawn; but Appleby, who wondered if his own wore that look, surmised that this was not due to cowardice, and understood why the man breathed in gasps.|$|E
60|$|He made a noose, {{and flung}} it forth with care. <b>It</b> <b>slid</b> close to where Dave lay, but the youth failed to grasp it. Then the rope was flung a second and a third time.|$|R
60|$|Very {{slowly the}} wing of his {{antagonist}} seemed to broaden as the impetus of his blow turned it up. He saw the full breadth of it and then <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> downward out of his sight.|$|R
60|$|Greatly {{fortified}} by this interview, Lady Valleys rejoined {{her daughter}} in the ear; but while <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> on amongst the multitudinous traffic, signs of unwonted nervousness began to start out through the placidity of her face.|$|R
