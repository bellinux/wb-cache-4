5|$|The Cooper {{hijacking}} {{marked the}} beginning of the end for unfettered and unscrutinized airline travel. Despite the initiation of the federal <b>sky</b> <b>marshal</b> program the previous year, 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972; 19 of them were for the specific purpose of extorting money and most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba. In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes. In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.|$|E
2500|$|Bar Lev put {{the plane}} into a steep nosedive which threw the two hijackers off-balance. [...] Argüello {{reportedly}} threw his sole grenade down the airliner aisle, but {{it failed to}} explode, and he was hit {{over the head with}} a bottle of whiskey by a passenger after he drew his pistol. Argüello shot steward Shlomo Vider and according to the passengers and Israeli security personnel, was then shot by a <b>sky</b> <b>marshal.</b> His accomplice Khaled was subdued by security and passengers, while the plane made an emergency landing at London Heathrow Airport; she then claimed that Argüello was shot four times in the back after he and Khaled failed to hijack the airplane. Vider underwent emergency surgery and recovered from his wounds; Argüello died in the ambulance taking both him and Khaled to Hillingdon Hospital. Khaled was then arrested by British police.|$|E

50|$|Singapore Airlines and Silkair deploy <b>sky</b> <b>marshals</b> {{in their}} flights. Such members are armed with {{firearms}} loaded with special ammunition and dart-firing stun gun.|$|R
50|$|It later {{emerged that}} the senior {{counter-terrorism}} {{officer in charge}} of the operation had feared for public safety and the diplomatic impact of a potential armed confrontation with Almog's bodyguards and El Al <b>sky</b> <b>marshals</b> should police have boarded the plane and attempted to execute the warrant. It was suspected that with a person of Almog's stature on board, there may have been as many as four or five <b>sky</b> <b>marshals</b> on the plane, and there was also no intelligence on whether Almog was accompanied by personal bodyguards. A second concern was the legal implications of boarding the plane after El Al had refused police entry.|$|R

50|$|Rico is {{apparently}} cleared of charges and subsequently awarded a promotion {{to the rank}} of General, and given permanent command of the Marauder program. Anoke is reported to have died in a terrorist attack (staged by the government earlier to explain his disappearance) and given a hero's funeral. Dix and Lola are married, Admiral Phid is appointed the new <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> with Dix as her second-in command, and Holly becomes a Federal chaplain. Dozens of peace protesters are hanged in connection to the purported terrorist attack. The new <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> Phid, impressed with the way that <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> Anoke was rendered servile by the Arachnids' religion, decides the Federation should adopt a religion, and Christianity is embraced by the Federation.|$|E
50|$|Months {{after the}} September 11 attacks, private {{operators}} like Jet Airways and Air Sahara introduced <b>sky</b> <b>marshals</b> {{in some of}} their flights and had plans to increase it. Indian Airlines had previously started this in December 1999 after the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814.|$|R
50|$|Qantas {{undertook}} a full security review following the incident {{and promised to}} secure the flightdeck doors on all of their aircraft by 1 November. The airline dismissed the suggestion of armed <b>sky</b> <b>marshals</b> on each flight as too expensive, and a full body search of passengers to detect wooden objects as unfeasible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sky</b> <b>Marshals</b> {{are rarely}} used on flights {{originating}} from the UK. Officers from The Metropolitan Police Service Aviation Security Operational Command Unit (SO18) are used on random flights, however {{details of the}} programme are not made public {{and the extent of}} their use is not widely known. For this reason their use is not heavily documented in the media.|$|R

50|$|On {{their way}} back to Sanctuary, the Fleet's secret HQ, Captain Lola Beck (Jolene Blalock) is marooned on a {{classified}} planet, OM-1, with <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> Anoke. Admiral Enolo Phid (Amanda Donohoe) suppresses this information. Dix finds out thanks to an officer who thinks this is wrong and recruits Rico to rescue the <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> and Lola, the latter being one of the few in possession of the coordinates to Sanctuary, which would cripple the military if the Arachnids learned of its location.An apparent earthquake causes Dr. Wiggs (Danny Keogh) to fall into a crevasse, while the <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> views a giant eye staring back at him from below. Cynical cook Jingo Ryan (Jon Falkow) is next to die after he takes shelter within a cluster of supposed rock outcroppings, which are actually Arachnid limbs which pull him below. Engineer Bull Brittles (Stelio Savante) asks the very religious flight attendant, Holly Little (Marnette Patterson), to marry him, but dies shortly after.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{mandatory}} passenger screening {{enacted by the}} FAA at U.S. airports beginning in 1973, the customs security officer force was disbanded and its personnel were absorbed by the U.S. Customs Service. By 1974 armed <b>sky</b> <b>marshals</b> were a rarity on U.S. aircraft. The former customs security officers were reassigned as customs patrol officers, customs inspectors, and customs special agents.|$|R
2500|$|During the crisis, on 11 September President Nixon {{initiated}} {{a program to}} address the problem of [...] "air piracy", including the immediate launch of a group of 100 federal agents to begin serving as armed <b>sky</b> <b>marshals</b> on U.S. flights. Nixon's statement further indicated the U.S. departments of Defense and Transportation would determine whether X-ray devices then available to the military could be moved into civilian service.|$|R
5000|$|Pakistan International Airlines Flight 661 (PK661/PIA661) was a {{domestic}} passenger flight from Chitral to Islamabad that crashed near Havelian on 7 December 2016.

5000|$|Commando Cody is {{the hero}} in two 12-episode science fiction serials made by Republic Pictures, played by George Wallace in 1952's Radar Men from the Moon [...] and Judd Holdren in 1953's Commando Cody: <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> of the Universe.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{numerous}} security improvements {{following the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, Flight 1737 lacked certain security arrangements. The {{door to the}} flightdeck had not been adapted to completely block access from the outside, {{and there was no}} <b>sky</b> <b>marshal</b> on board.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> serial is a prequel to Republic's Radar Men {{from the}} Moon {{theatrical}} serial. The first episode has characters Joan and Ted, Commando Cody's established sidekicks in Radar Men, applying for {{their jobs and}} meeting Cody for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The Australian Protective Service was the Commonwealth Government's {{specialist}} custodial, {{protective security}} and Counter Terrorist law enforcement agency. Plain clothed operations were normally restricted {{to members of}} the NSW Region Escort Response Group (ERG) and the more recently introduced Air Security Officers (<b>Sky</b> <b>Marshals).</b> However, Protective Service members in locations such as Darwin deployed regularly in the mid to late 90s to escort Immigration detainees, usually in civilian attire to blend in on domestic aircraft.|$|R
50|$|At the mid-level, {{more than}} 1,000 women were {{advanced}} into many positions that women had never held before, such as <b>sky</b> <b>marshals,</b> tug boat captains, FBI agents, and forest rangers. The {{number of women}} appointed to boards and commissions increased as well, from over 250 in the first year, to 339 women {{by the end of}} May 1973. It was during this time that the first women became generals and admirals in the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|R
5|$|German {{politicians}} of the then government parties (Social Democrats and Liberals) {{as well as}} the opposition (the conservative Union parties) generally acclaimed the non-violent outcome of the hijacking. This reflected the public opinion that with the Munich attackers having left the country, the risk of further terrorist acts against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient airport security to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing <b>sky</b> <b>marshals,</b> which at that time were already common on certain flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others.|$|R

5000|$|On Earth, General Hauser confronts Admiral Phid {{about why}} she is abandoning the <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal,</b> only to be arrested. Later, Phid reveals to him that <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> Anoke is {{responsible}} for the downfall of Roku San, having been in communication with the [...] "Brain of Brains", also known as [...] "Behemecoatyl", through the original brain bug captured in Starship Troopers, as he has psychic powers. The <b>Sky</b> <b>Marshal</b> adopted their religion, hoping he could save humanity from the bugs if he could make peace with them. It is revealed that he turned off the electric barrier surrounding the base on Roku San to show his willingness to make peace between the two species. The Federation now believes the Brain Bug allowed itself to be captured in the first place on Planet P in order to pass on intelligence from inside the Federation. The Federation makes the decision to kill and dissect the captured brain but it overhears them and unleashes a telepathic attack, killing a few soldiers by exploding their skulls before Hauser kills it. It is revealed that Admiral Phid ignored the distress calls of those abandoned on OM-1 so she could become the new Sky Marshal; however, she failed to take into account that Lola, {{who is one of the}} few pilots of the Federation that know the location of Sanctuary, was with Anoke.|$|E
