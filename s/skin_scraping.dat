25|$|They {{are very}} prone to Demodex Mange due to culling for performance. There are two {{different}} types of Demodex Mange, namely Localized and Generalized Demodex. Although it is not contagious it is sometimes difficult to treat due to immunodeficiency in some puppies. The Localized symptoms are usually loss of hair in small patches on the head and feet of the puppies. This type will usually heal as the puppies grow and their immune systems grow stronger. The second type which is Generalized Demodex mange is a more severe form of the sickness. The symptoms are more severe and include loss of hair throughout the entire body and the skin may also be scabby and bloody. Generalized are usually hereditary due to immunodeficiency genes that are passed on from Sire and Dam to their puppies. A simple <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> test will allow the vet to diagnose demodex mange. The most widely used method to treat Demodex Mange is ivermectin injections or oral medications. Since Demodex Mange lives in the hair follicles of the dog, Ivermectin will kill these mites at the source.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background: Skin {{testing is}} a {{mainstay}} in allergology, and its importance is increasing in several fields. The ability {{to choose the}} most suitable technique according to the clinical setting is an advantage for the medical team. Objectives: To describe in detail an alternative technique of the coetaneous allergy test (<b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> test) conceived as {{a variation of the}} former skin scratch test; to evaluate its value as a tool for diagnosis of immune sensitization; and to com-pare its accuracy with the skin prick test. Methods: The <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> test and <b>skin</b> prick test were performed {{side by side with the}} same allergen extracts in 162 hu-man subjects classified in two groups according to the known presence or absence of serum specific-IgE to these aller-gens. Results: The sensitivity of the <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> test to detect immediate reactions was 85. 0 %. The sensitivity of the skin prick test was 86. 5 %. The sensitivity of both techniques analyzed together as a unique procedure was 94. 2 %. The specificity of the <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> test was 90. 1 %. The specificity of the skin prick test was 72. 9 %. The specificity of both tests analyzed to-gether as a unique procedure was 70. 5 %. Conclusions: The <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> test is an alternative and complementary technique for allergic skin testing, and it is able to detect IgE-specific immune sensitization without the disadvantages of the skin scratch test.

40|$|Background: Demodex mites are {{involved}} in different skin diseases and are commonly detected by <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> tests or superficial biopsies. A new high-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) with high lateral and axial resolution in a horizontal (en-face) and vertical (slice) imaging mode might offer the possibility of noninvasive and fast in vivo examination of demodex mites. Methods: Twenty patients with demodex-related skin diseases and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were examined by HD-OCT. Mites per follicle and follicles per field of view were counted and compared to <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> tests. Results: HD-OCT images depicted mites in the en-face mode as bright round dots in groups of 3 - 5 mites per hair follicle. In the patients with demodex-related disease, a mean number of 3. 4 mites per follicle were detected with a mean number of 2. 9 infested follicles per area of view compared to a mean of 0. 6 mites in 0. 4 infested follicles in the controls. The <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> tests were negative in 21 % of the patients. Conclusion: The innovative HD-OCT enables fast and noninvasive in vivo recognition of demodex mites and might become a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of demodex-related skin diseases.

40|$|This {{case report}} {{describes}} {{an outbreak of}} Cryptocaryon irritans that occurred in a 120 gallon recirculating tropical saltwater mixed-species system. Mortalities were found on morning observation with more occurring slowly throughout the day. A full diagnostic work up was performed on a freshly dead specimen, which included external and internal microscopic examination and bacteriology culture. The external examination included gross observations, <b>skin</b> <b>scrape,</b> fin clip and gill clip. The internal examination included wet mount preparations of the liver, spleen, stomach, intestines, anterior and posterior kidneys. The diagnosis was made on <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> by finding the adult feeding stage of Cryptocaryon irritans called the trophont. Upon questioning the owner, {{it was discovered that}} one species present in the tank was introduced about 10 to 14 days previously without quarantine. Another issue was that the tank was placed in direct contact with another tank. Therefore, there was a high probability of transmission to the neighboring tank. Live specimens in the neighboring tank were skin scrapped to look for feeding stages of Cryptocaryon and those <b>skin</b> <b>scrapes</b> were negative. Both tanks were treated with Chloroquine at 10 mg/L for three weeks duration. All of the fish in the original tank died by the following day. Fortunately, there were no mortalities in the neighboring tank. This case report demonstrates the importance of quarantine and biosecurity to prevent outbreak of disease. It also demonstrates the feasibility of the private practioners to diagnose fish diseases...|$|R
50|$|About 40 {{types of}} fungi can cause ringworm. They are {{typically}} of the Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton type. Risk factors include using public showers, contact {{sports such as}} wrestling, excessive sweating, contact with animals, obesity, and poor immune function. Ringworm can spread from other animals or between people. Diagnosis is often based on the appearance and symptoms.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{efficacy}} of skin impression with acetate tape and the deep <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> test to find D. canis and S. scabiei in dogs. During six months, 134 samples were collected by both techniques from 115 dogs treated at the dermatology service of the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Santa Maria (HVU-UFSM). Of these patients, 27 had demodicosis and 12 had scabies. The impression with acetate tape test (ITT) was shown to be significantly superior to the deep <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> test (DSST) in finding D. canis and S. scabiei mites (p = 0. 007). Based on our results we could conclude that acetate tape impression is a reliable method for diagnosing and monitoring therapy of dermatopathies caused by mites {{and can be used}} to replace the traditional deep <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> method.

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} Mello and Madeira’s comments on our article 1 and herein we discuss the points they raised. They emphasized <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We agree that <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> is a good method for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis; however, it has shown to be less sensitive than press imprint smear (PIS), 2 – 5 and <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> should not be done in clearly infected ulcers {{and should not be}} performed in non-ulcerated lesions. On the other hand, local anesthesia is recommended for the comfort of the patient. As <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> does not elucidate a large proportion of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis, neither does it allow the diagnosis of several other diseases, so we recom-mend that a skin biopsy should be performed at the same time. To do it, one will need all things used in PIS, plus a scalpel blade or a curette, making its cost a little higher than with PIS. Suturing is not necessary for a 3 -mm punch biopsy. We understand that a microscopy technician with a short train-ing course can learn to identify amastigotes, because he or she is someone already used to see other microorganisms. We are not referring to a lay person on microscopy. On the other hand, the performance of procedures (<b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> or other) by technicians, is a matter that concerns us because before doing scraping or other procedures, it is necessary to evaluate the patient and the lesion: if the lesion is infected, if it is close to varicose veins, and other aspects of it. These interventions require training and qualification that a technician does not have to perform the tasks Mello and Moreira suggest. We should make all efforts to guarantee that even in poor-resource areas, any intervention in humans, even the simplest one should be done in accordance with the best practices, by quali-fied professional and under good supervision...|$|E

Immunohistochemistry and metachromatic staining for inflammatory cells were performed to compare alopecic and normal skin. In addition, we compared these biopsies with those previously obtained from macaques with generalized alopecia and dermal inflammatory infiltrates consistent with cutaneous hypersensitivity disorders and with those from animals with normal haircoats. Bacterial and fungal cultures, <b>skin</b> <b>scrapes,</b> surface cytology, and bloodwork were unremarkable. Affected skin showed only mild histologic alteration, with rare evidence of trichomalacia and follicular loss. Numbers of mast cells and CD 3 + lymphocytes did not differ between alopecic and normally haired skin from the same animal. The number of mast cells in alopecic skin from animals in the current cohort was significantly lower than that in skin of animals previously diagnosed with a cutaneous hypersensitivity disorder. Numbers of both mast cells and CD 3 + lymphocytes in alopecic skin from the current cohort were similar to those from biopsies of animals with normal haircoats.

Sixty-seven dogs diagnosed with demodicosis were enrolled in the study. Thirty dogs had localized and 37 had generalized demodicosis. Twenty-seven of the 67 dogs had complicated (secondarily infected) and 40 had noncomplicated form. On each dog, a single lesion was randomly selected to obtain one deep <b>skin</b> <b>scraping,</b> hair plucking, and, when present (n = 13) exudate. For <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> and exudate microscopy, an area under a cover slip measuring 2. 2 x 2. 2 mm was examined, while trichography included the evaluation of 100 hair shafts. At least one parasitic element was found in 85. 1 % of trichograms, and 100 % of exudate preparations. The number of parasitic elements was higher in skin scrapings compared to the other two methods. The diagnostic sensitivity of skin scrapings was higher than that of hair pluckings for the total number of samples (P = 0. 002) and for those obtained from dogs with the localized (P = 0. 004) and the noncomplicated (P = 0. 002) forms of the disease. The diagnostic sensitivity of hair pluckings was higher in generalized and complicated demodicosis compared to the localized and noncomplicated variants. Based on these results, exudate microscopy may be equally sensitive to deep skin scrapings, and trichography may be of value in generalized and complicated demodicosis, although a negative result cannot rule it out...|$|E
