They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.

2500|$|Bucky Katt is Rob's {{selfish and}} cynical <b>Siamese</b> <b>Cat.</b> His ears are nearly always drawn laid back {{flat on his}} head, a feline sign of defiance, aggressiveness, and he is missing an upper canine tooth. The Humane Society found Bucky huddled on a trash can, while the cat {{was only a few}} weeks old, in Hackensack, New Jersey, later to be adopted by Rob. While Bucky's father has never been mentioned, Bucky gave his mother's maiden name on a credit card {{application}} as [...] "Tricky Woo," [...] an allusion to the ludicrously pampered (but in fact good-natured) pet dog of that name in James Herriot's stories of his experiences as a vet. Bucky has been said to be named for Negro League baseball player Buck O'Neil. Bucky lives in a dresser located in the hall closet of Rob's apartment because he refuses to share a room with Satchel. On most outdoor excursions, when Rob is present, Bucky is carried in a strap-on [...] "Bundle-O-Joy" [...] baby carrier, referenced as a way of keeping the cat out of trouble. Most of Bucky's aggression is directed at Satchel, although most of his attempts usually fail as Satchel does not have enough intelligence for Bucky's rude sarcasm and is often unaware that he is even being insulted. Three obsessions dominate Bucky's life: Fungo Squiggly; his desire to stop the [...] "monkey invasion"; and wanting to film a movie or TV show about himself.|$|E
2500|$|Cats also display pica {{behavior}} {{in their natural}} environments and {{there is evidence to}} support that this behavior has a psychological aspect to it. Some breeds (such as the <b>Siamese</b> <b>cat)</b> are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica. Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even cardboard and then progress into ingestion of these substances. This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common. [...] Theories explaining why this behavior becomes active during this time suggest that early weaning and stress as a consequence of separation from the mother and litter-mates and exposure to a new environment are to blame. Eating wool or other substances may be a soothing mechanism that cats develops to cope with the changes. Pica is also observed predominately during 6–8 months of a cat's life when territorial and sexual behaviors emerge. Pica may be induced by these social stressors. [...] Other theories contemplated include pica as a redirection of prey-catching/ingestion behavior as a result of indoor confinement, especially common among oriental breeds due to risk of theft. [...] In natural environments pica has been observed in parrots (such as macaws) and other birds and mammals. Charles Munn has been studying Amazon macaws lick clay from riverbeds in the Amazon to detoxify the seeds they eat. Amazon macaws spend two to three hours a day licking clay. [...] Munn has found that clay helps counter the tannin and alkaloid in the seeds the macaws ingest, a strategy that is also used by native cultures in the Andes Mountains in Peru.|$|E

40|$|Familial AA {{amyloidosis}} is a hereditary trait in Abyssinian cats, {{with the}} kidney {{as the main}} target organ. The amino acid sequence of the amyloid A protein of the Abyssinian cat has been described earlier. Recently, familial amyloidosis {{has been found in}} <b>Siamese</b> <b>cats,</b> with the liver as the main target organ. In the present paper, we describe the complete amino amid sequence of the major constituent protein, of two <b>Siamese</b> <b>cats.</b> <b>Siamese</b> hepatic protein AA showed homology with, but was different from all feline SAA and AA sequences hitherto reported. Two substitutions (46 Q-R and 52 A-V) from the Abyssinian protein sequence were identified one of which (46 Q-R) is a non-homologous substitution not found in mammalian SAA, but is present in two bird AA amyloid proteins. This shows the presence of an unique amyloidogenic SAA isotype in <b>Siamese</b> <b>cats</b> Both the <b>Siamese</b> and the Abyssinian sequence are amyloidogenic, thus making identification of amyloidogenic residues difficult. Apart from the apparent inherent amyloidogenicity of SAA, it can not be excluded that certain amino acid substitutions could enhance its amyloidogenicity but also could contribute to tissue predilection in amyloidosis. status: publishe...|$|R

Conan lures the Red <b>Siamese</b> <b>Cats</b> to the attic of the airship and incapacitates them one by one. Heiji, meanwhile, confronts four policemen at Kōfuku-ji revealing they are part of the Red <b>Siamese</b> <b>Cats</b> and used the airship to evacuate the city in order to steal the priceless buddharupas. The four fake policemen are then arrested by the Nara police. Conan enters the smoking room where Ran is quarantined and reveals that the Red <b>Siamese</b> <b>Cats</b> never released a bacterium. He explains the smoking room was sprayed with an irritating lacquer which causes a rash when it contacts the skin. Conan then realizes that Fujioka was feigning the symptoms of the bacteria and is the mastermind behind the heist.|$|R

25|$|The orange litter-mates {{of white}} tigers are not prone to strabismus. <b>Siamese</b> <b>cats</b> and albinos of every species {{which have been}} studied all exhibit the same visual pathway {{abnormality}} found in white tigers. <b>Siamese</b> <b>cats</b> are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality {{is that there is}} a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in <b>Siamese</b> <b>cats.</b> Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.|$|R
