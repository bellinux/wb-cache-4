25|$|The foreign {{exchange}} market is the most liquid financial market in the world. Traders include governments and central banks, commercial banks, other institutional investors and financial institutions, currency speculators, other commercial corporations, and individuals. The average daily turnover in the global {{foreign exchange}} and related markets is continuously growing. According to the 2010 Triennial Central Bank Survey, coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements, average daily turnover was $3.98 trillion in April 2010 (compared to $1.7 trillion in 1998). Of this $3.98 trillion, $1.5 trillion was <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> and $2.5 trillion was traded in outright forwards, swaps, and other derivatives.|$|E
5000|$|A foreign {{exchange}} spot transaction, {{also known as}} FX spot, is an agreement between two parties to buy one currency against selling another currency at an agreed price for settlement on the spot date. The exchange {{rate at which the}} transaction is done is called the spot exchange rate. As of 2010, the average daily turnover of global FX <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> reached nearly 1.5 trillion USD, counting 37.4% of all {{foreign exchange}} transactions. [...] FX <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> increased by 38% to 2.0 trillion USD from April 2010 to April 2013.|$|E
50|$|The spot foreign {{exchange}} market imposes a two-day delivery period, originally due to the time {{it would take to}} move cash from one bank to another. Most speculative retail forex trading is done as <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> on an online trading platform.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} settlement timeframe {{for foreign}} exchange <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> is T + 2 days; i.e., two business days from the trade date. Notable exceptions are USD/CAD, USD/TRY, USD/PHP, USD/RUB, USD/KZT and USD/PKR currency pairs, which settle at T + 1.|$|E
50|$|Foreign {{exchange}} {{companies are}} normally distinct from money transfer companies or remittance companies and bureaux de change as they typically perform high-value transfers unlike their money transfer counterparts {{that focus on}} high-volume low-value transfers generally by economic migrants back to their home country or to provide cash for travelers. Transactions can be either <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> or forward transactions.|$|E
50|$|In banking, {{value date}} is the {{delivery}} date of funds traded. For <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> {{it is the}} future date on which the trade is settled. In {{the case of a}} spot foreign exchange trade it is normally two days after a transaction is agreed upon. In online banking, automated tax payments would normally coincide with the value date of the payment.|$|E
50|$|In finance, a <b>spot</b> {{contract}}, <b>spot</b> <b>transaction,</b> {{or simply}} <b>spot,</b> is a contract of buying or selling a commodity, security or currency for immediate settlement (payment and delivery) {{on the spot}} date, which is normally two business days after the trade date. The settlement price (or rate) is called spot price (or spot rate). A spot contract is in contrast with a forward contract or futures contract where contract terms are agreed now but delivery and payment will occur at a future date.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>spot</b> <b>transaction</b> is {{a two-day}} {{delivery}} transaction (except {{in the case}} of trades between the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Turkish lira, euro and Russian ruble, which settle the next business day), as opposed to the futures contracts, which are usually three months. This trade represents a “direct exchange” between two currencies, has the shortest time frame, involves cash rather than a contract, and interest is not included in the agreed-upon <b>transaction.</b> <b>Spot</b> trading {{is one of the most}} common types of Forex Trading. Often, a forex broker will charge a small fee to the client to roll-over the expiring transaction into a new identical transaction for a continuation of the trade. This roll-over fee is known as the [...] "Swap" [...] fee.|$|R

50|$|A foreign {{exchange}} swap has two legs - a spot transaction and a forward transaction - that are executed simultaneously for the same quantity, and therefore offset each other. Forward {{foreign exchange}} transactions occur if both companies have a currency the other needs. It prevents negative foreign exchange risk for either party. Foreign exchange <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> are similar to forward foreign exchange transactions {{in terms of how}} they are agreed upon; however, they are planned for a specific date in the very near future, usually within the same week.|$|E

50|$|Spot {{price for}} SRECs are {{generally}} higher than prices found in long-term contracts since the system owner {{is taking on}} market risk. If increases in supply outpace the growing demand, spot prices could fall. SRECs have traded as high as $680 in New Jersey. Meanwhile other state SREC market prices range from $45 in Delaware to $271.05 in Massachusetts. In addition {{to the strength of}} spot market demand in states experiencing supply shortages, the general lack of availability of viable long-term contracts and the heavy discounts applied to these contracts have left some system owners and project developers seeking ways to finance solar through <b>spot</b> <b>transactions.</b> In June 2010, Diamond Castle, a New York based private equity firm, announced that it would be financing projects strictly with equity {{in order to avoid the}} premiums paid in long-term contracts.|$|E
40|$|Countertrade {{agreements}} {{in international trade}} refer to a practice in which an exporter agrees to purchase in the future, from the importer, commodities proportional to his original export sale.

In this way countertrade helps reduce risk by providing information on future market conditions and by offering insurance against random fluctuations in these conditio.

40|$|We {{study the}} holdup problem in {{repeated}} transaction between a seller and a buyer {{such that the}} seller makes relation-specific investments in each period. We show that in situations where formal contracts have no value under <b>spot</b> <b>transaction</b> due to the cooperative nature of investment, writing a simple fixed-price contract can be valuable under repeated transaction: There is a range of parameter values in which a higher investment can be implemented only if a formal price contract is written and combined with a relational contract. We also show that there are cases in which not writing a formal contract but entirely relying on a relational contract increases the total surplus of the buyer and the seller. The key condition is how the investment affects the renegotiation price in general, and the alternative-use value in particular...|$|R
5000|$|Market {{convention}} {{from the}} early 1980s to 2006 was that most currency pairs were quoted to four decimal places for <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> and up to six decimal places for forward outrights or swaps. (The fourth decimal place is usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "pip"). An exception to this was exchange rates with a value of less than 1.000 which were usually quoted to five or six decimal places. Although there is no fixed rule, exchange rates numerically greater than around 20 were usually quoted to three decimal places and exchange rates greater than 80 were quoted to two decimal places. Currencies over 5000 were usually quoted with no decimal places (for example, the former Turkish Lira). e.g. (GBPOMR : 0.765432 - : 1.4436 - EURJPY : 165.29). In other words, quotes are given with five digits. Where rates are below 1, quotes frequently include five decimal places.|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{primary data}} on foreign {{exchange}} (forex) markets is {{obtained from the}} latest triennial central bank survey of forex and derivative market activity in 43 countries, conducted in April 1998 by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS, 1998). Referring to Table 1, daily global forex trades (i. e. traditional instruments of spots, swaps and forwards) have seen a phenomenal increase from US$ 18. 3 bn in 1977 to US$ 1490 bn by 1998 1. Of the total turnover in 1995, only 41 percent were <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> (Table 2). The remainder were {{in the form of}} derivatives, with swaps constituting the bulk of all financial transactions (46 percent), futures, forwards, options and other `exotic' derivatives making up the remainder 2. Financial derivatives in 1977 comprised a negligible portion of total forex transactions. Indeed, even in 1989, <b>spot</b> <b>transactions</b> constituted about three-fifths of the share of daily forex turnover...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{discussion}} regarding market designs of emissions trading. This paper examines a model in which emissions trading is introduced in the oligopolistic electricity market, which comprises both forward contracts and <b>spot</b> <b>transactions.</b> In particular we investigate how emissions trading is affected by strategic behaviour in an endogenous framework of forward and spot markets. The problem is defined as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). Simple numerical examples illustrate how strategic behaviour could affect equilibrium outcomes and what effects initial allocations of emissions rights could have on social surplus. ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that within long-term relationships agents learn the characteristics of their market partners better than through <b>spot</b> <b>transactions.</b> In contrast, little is known on how relationship-based and transaction-based markets compare when agents learn about the aggregate economy from market exchanges.

The model allows to relate the market structure to macroeconomic fundamentals such as the persistence and volatility of the aggregate productivity and the cross-sectional volatility of productivity.

40|$|Power sector {{restructuring}} {{has prompted}} {{the application of}} modern portfolio theory among market participants. Much research {{has been devoted to}} power portfolio optimization problems. However, the portfolio composition adopted in literature is rather hypothetical than realistic. From an engineering perspective, it is necessary to use real traded contract products to construct the portfolio. In this paper, clarification is made on commonly traded power contracts in the market, followed by a discussion of their pricing schemes. It is emphasized that actively traded electricity futures/forwards and options actually belong to commodity swaps and swaptions respectively. A power portfolio is then constructed for a generation company with these basic power contracts and the <b>spot</b> <b>transaction</b> as well. An optimization model is formulated to solve the asset allocation with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{new methods}} of finding business partners for joint development in Japan. These methods create opportunities for a manufacturing firm, which has excellent technology, to find an appropriate business partner. We call these methods the Osaka model. In the model, a company finds a business partner among plenty of companies, while they establish mutual trust and solve higher levels of technological difficulties. The model shares strong points of both <b>spot</b> <b>transaction</b> and conventional co-development. In other words, this model takes advantages of both Western style and Japanese style inter-business relationship. This paper also argues the environment for encouraging the model. The area should {{be a place where}} you can obtain many sources of information. Increasing meetings or facilities on specific themes is an effective method to encourage the model in the area. In addition, a database with which each technological seed has been already arranged with their technological needs is beneficial for matching them. If such a database becomes a shared knowledge in the area, the model would be promoted. ...|$|R
