50|$|The 99-day Ford {{strike of}} 1945 {{took place in}} Windsor, Ontario, Canada from September 12, 1945, to December 19, 1945. Under UAW Local 200 President Roy England, 11,000 workers walked off their jobs after 24 of their demands went unmet by the Ford Motor Company. Negotiations for a new {{contract}} had spanned 18 months and officially ended with the exodus of Ford workers at ten o'clock {{on the morning of}} September 12. The Strike included picketing and eventually led to a two-day blockade of vehicles surrounding the Ford plant on November 5. The strike ended on December 19 as both sides agreed to return to previous working conditions while arbitration regarding implementing a fully unionized shop and medical coverage continued under Justice Ivan C. Rand. His report was released on January 29, 1946. The Rand Formula, as it became known, gave the UAW formal recognition as the <b>sole</b> <b>negotiators</b> representing all employees of Ford Motor Company.|$|R

5000|$|In re El Paso Corporation Shareholder Litigation: Grant & Eisenhofer {{represented}} Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters’ Retirement System and {{was appointed}} co-lead counsel {{in a class}} action against natural gas company El Paso Corporation’s Board of Directors, Goldman Sachs, and Kinder Morgan, Inc. alleging that the Board, aided and abetted by Goldman Sachs and Kinder Morgan, breached its fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell El Paso to Kinder Morgan for a less-than-value-maximizing price. Plaintiffs alleged that the merger was tainted by significant conflicts of interest, including (i) Goldman’s serving as financial advisor to El Paso’s Board despite Goldman’s $4 billion buy-side interest in the deal stemming from its 19% ownership stake in Kinder Morgan, and (ii) the undisclosed interests of El Paso’s <b>sole</b> <b>negotiator</b> for the deal—CEO and Chairman, Douglas Foshee—in acquiring El Paso’s exploration and production assets for himself in a management buyout. The case settled for $110 million.|$|E
50|$|The three studio {{executives}} {{band together}} and, in one last desperate attempt, visit {{the home of}} a fourth studio head, who happens to be away on vacation. Alas, Prebble had just been hired by him, too, and she threatens another police raid if she is not awarded a contract as a movie star. The three studio heads begin to bargain with her, each outbidding the others, until they decide to merge their firms and thus become a <b>sole</b> <b>negotiator</b> to deal with Prebble. This is the crisis that precipitates the creation of the (fictional, and highly satirical) Perfecto-Zizzbaum Corporation—by virtue of the merger of the Colossal-Exquisite, the Perfecto-Fishbein, and the Zizzbaum-Celluloid. The vacationing executive, head of the Medulla-Oblongata studio, is not present to add his company to the mix. The actual medulla oblongata {{is a part of the}} brain that controls some of the body's lower levels of functioning; this is presumably not an accidental choice by Wodehouse.|$|E
40|$|Introduction]. The {{decision}} of the European Union's (EU) transport ministers to authorize the Commission to begin negotiation of a multilateral aviation agreement with the United States was long in coming {{and in the process}} was overtaken by developments in the airline industry itself. The EU has been fighting within itself since 1991 about whether the Commission should exercise authority that it claims under Article 113 of the EC Treaty to negotiate with "third countries" over international air services. In exercising such authority, the Commission would supplant national negotiators who are responsible for maintaining and modifying bilateral Air Service Agreements (ASAs) and would become the <b>sole</b> <b>negotiator</b> for all Member States...|$|E
25|$|Being {{a lonely}} Serbian Anglophile Mijatović {{wished to be}} {{appointed}} as the first Serbian Minister in London, but {{had to wait until}} October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the Court of St James's. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the <b>sole</b> Serbian <b>negotiator</b> in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was {{able to get out of}} the war without suffering more serious consequences. In Bucharest Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative Ivan Evstratiev Geshov concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared in such a way that he was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was more worried about what sort of reputation he would have in England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} concept of {{delegation}} of power in external trade policy, this paper aims to investigate the dynamics surrounding the European Union’s position in international trade negotiations. The analysis centres {{on the role of}} the European Commission (the agent), which by means of Treaty-based delegation and as mandated by the Council (the principal) acts as the <b>sole</b> trade <b>negotiator</b> in the international sphere on behalf of the European Union (EU). The broader negotiating process is thus conceptualised as a threelevel game, where the Commission holds an intermediary position between the European and international levels and also interacts with the Member States in the Council. After an insight into the European decision-making process for external trade, the paper further analyses the Commission’s role during the multilateral trade negotiations of the Doha Development Round. By applying the principal-agent theory to international trade negotiations in general, and subsequently to the controversial agricultural negotiations, this paper seeks to investigate some of the potential sources of autonomy that the Commission can draw upon while upholding an EU position at the international level, in addition to the “hardball” job of balancing the interests of the Member States with those of World Trade Organisation (WTO) partners. Along these lines, the paper finally aims to contribute to the literature concerning agency autonomy in EU external trade relations but also to provide a better understanding of inter-institutional relations within the EU as they may unfold in practice...|$|R
5000|$|Dialcom {{began as}} {{computer}} time-sharing services. A user would sign on using an Teletype Model 33 ASR and a modem with acoustic coupler, running at 110 bps. A command-line interface was available with programming languages such as BASIC and Fortran. The Company grew and evolved quickly over a four-year period {{through a series}} of acquisitions led by Robert F. Ryan, Founder, President and CEO. By 1974 Dialcom was nationwide and offering a number of [...] "off the shelf" [...] products such as accounting and payroll services. Dialcom [...] "reinvented" [...] itself about every four years by coming out with a completely new product line (all related though the thread of telecommunications) to become the dominant leader in whichever area it targeted, while still supporting and growing the prior underlying services. In 1974 Dialcom developed an online word processing and document management suite of products. For one of its major clients, the US House of Representatives, Dialcom supplied a total constituent management system (CRS) to 240 of the 435 House offices. This service was also marketed to associations and large corporations. Four years later Dialcom developed and successfully marketed the first commercial email service in the US and then went international with that service. Mr. Ryan was the <b>sole</b> marketer and <b>negotiator</b> for all international sales that were done at the Ministerial level in each country. In keeping with the corporate philosophy of constant innovation and evolution, during 1980 Dialcom was the creator, designer, developer, computing and network engine of [...] "The Source".|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we suggest}} {{that the degree of}} (dis) unity - both between the member states (MS) in the Council and within the Commission - is a key factor in {{affecting}} the balance between Commission autonomy and MS control in international trade negotiations. We shed empirical light on this issue, and on the relative influence of MS and the Commission in general, through a case study of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations between the European Union (EU) and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. We suggest that the differing preferences and priorities among MS and the relative cohesiveness of the Commission provided the Commission with quite a high degree of autonomy during all phases of the EPA negotiations. The informational and procedural advantages given by its institutional position as <b>sole</b> <b>negotiator</b> also contributed to the significant autonomy of the Commission...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tobacco {{industry}} documents {{provide a}} unique opportunity to explore the role transnational corporations (TNCs) played in shaping the poor outcomes of privatisation in the former Soviet Union (FSU). This paper examines British American Tobacco's (BAT's) business conduct in Uzbekistan where large-scale smuggling of BAT's cigarettes, BAT's reversal of tobacco control legislation and its human rights abuses of tobacco farmers have been documented previously. This paper focuses, instead, on BAT's attitude to competition, compares BAT's conduct with international standards and assesses its influence on the privatisation process. Methods: Analysis of BAT documents released through litigation. Results: BAT secured <b>sole</b> <b>negotiator</b> status precluding the Uzbekistan government from initiating discussions with other parties. Recognising that a competitive tender would greatly increase the cost of investment, BAT {{went to great lengths to}} avoid one, ultimately securing President Karimov's support and negotiating a monopoly position in a closed deal. It simultaneously secured exclusion from the monopolies committee, ensuring freedom to set prices, on the basis of a spurious argument that competition would exist from imports. Other anticompetitive moves comprised including all three plants in the deal despite intending to close down two, exclusive dealing and implementing measures designed to prevent market entry by competitors. BAT also secured a large number of exemptions and privileges that further reduced the government's revenue both on a one- off and ongoing basis. Conclusions: BAT's corporate misbehaviour included a wide number of anticompetitive practices, contravened Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development's and BAT's own business standards on competition and restricted revenue arising from privatisation. This suggests that TNCs have contributed to the failure of privatisation in the FSU. Conducting open tenders and using enforceable codes to regulate corporate conduct would help deal with some of the problems identified...|$|E
