40|$|AbstractThe {{numerical}} {{modeling of}} hot shape rolling of <b>steel</b> <b>billet</b> {{is represented by}} using a meshless Radial Basis function Collocation Method (RBFCM). The physical model consists of coupled thermal and mechanical models. Both models are solved through a strong formulation. The material in the present formulation is assumed to behave elastic or ideally plastic. The model decomposes the 3 D geometry of the <b>steel</b> <b>billet</b> into a traveling 2 D cross section which lets us analyze the large shape reductions by a sequence of small steps. Homogeneous compression and a uniform velocity over each of the cross-sections are assumed. A meshless method, based on collocation with radial basis functions, is proposed to solve the thermo-mechanical problem. The nodal distribution is adapted by Transfinite Interpolation (TFI) and Elliptic Node Generation (ENG) at each deformation step to the new form of the billet. The solution is calculated in terms of temperatures and displacements at each node. A simple benchmark solution is compared with FEM based commercial code DEFORM. A good agreement is found between the RBFCM and the commercial code DEFORM...|$|R

40|$|The {{forecasting}} of {{asset prices}} using {{time series analysis}} techniques has focussed {{a great deal on}} the accuracy of the forecasting models. Among the traditional techniques of time series forecasting, the Box Jenkins Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models {{have been one of the}} most widely used linear time series models. There had been growing number of research indicating that novel techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be a promising model for forecasting and could prove to be a better alternative to the traditional models. The aim of this dissertation is to build a forecasting model for predicting the <b>steel</b> <b>billet</b> cash (spot) prices traded in the London Metal Exchange using the time series data of the <b>steel</b> <b>billet</b> cash prices from the period of September 2008 to June 2010. In order to achieve the aim, the R software is used to identify the appropriate ARIMA model specification, model validation and forecasting. In order to predict the time series in ANN model the Matlab software is used. The forecasting performance of the selected ARIMA and ANN models are compared in order to justify a better model for predicting <b>steel</b> <b>billet</b> cash prices. The Box-Jenkins ARIMA modelling methodology adopted indicated that the first order differencing model was weak form stationary and ARIMA (2, 1, 2) model was comparatively better fit than other models for both Mediterranean and Far-East steel prices. However the lack of model stability for different sub-period data limited the forecasting confidence of the selected model. The forecasting performance of ANN was limited with the measure of directional accuracy being lower for the best fit ANN architecture which could be attributed to the non-stationary nature of the steel prices and the random behaviour of steel prices...|$|R
