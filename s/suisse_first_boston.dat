5|$|The {{arrival of}} former Drexel Burnham Lambert {{investment}} banker Ken Moelis marked a major coup for Costas. Moelis joined UBS from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in 2001 shortly after its acquisition by Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> (although Huw Jenkins {{claimed he had}} hired Moelis to the UK Parliamentary Banking commission while under oath, which is patently false). In his six years at UBS, Moelis ultimately {{assumed the role of}} president of UBS Investment Bank and was credited, along with Costas, with the build-out of UBS's investment banking operation in the United States. Within weeks of joining, Moelis brought over a team of 70 bankers from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Costas and Moelis hired more than 30 senior U.S. bankers from 2001 through 2004.|$|E
5|$|John P. Costas, {{a former}} bond trader and co-head of Fixed income at Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> {{and head of}} Fixed Income Trading at Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998, was {{appointed}} CEO of UBS's investment banking division, which originated in SBC's Warburg Dillon Read division and was renamed UBS Warburg in December 2001. In an attempt {{to break into the}} elite bulge bracket of investment banks, in which UBS then had little success while rival Credit Suisse was establishing itself as a major player on Wall Street with the acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, Costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms. Costas had followed a similar approach in building out the UBS fixed income business, hiring over 500 sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from US$300million in 1998 to over US$3billion by 2001.|$|E

5000|$|Credit <b>Suisse</b> retired the <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> name on January 16, 2006, {{in order}} to “allow Credit Suisse to {{communicate}} as an integrated organization to clients, employees and shareholders.” The move led some to speculate that the name change reflected the diminished luster of the once great <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> name {{as a result of}} years of mismanagement and scandal. [...] However, its strategy is consistent with that of other large, international financial conglomerates. Citigroup has eliminated the Salomon Brothers name from its investment banking business, and UBS AG has done the same with the SG Warburg, Dillon Read and Paine Webber names. Deutsche Bank has effectively retired the Bankers Trust and Morgan Grenfell names.|$|R

From August 1987 to May 1988, Clarke was chairman of Majestic Wine Corporation Inc, a United States company which owned a chain of 104 stores trading as Liquor Barn in California and Arizona. Following disposal of the US based businesses, he sold the UK plc business of Majestic Wines for £15 million in 1989.|$|E
50|$|Credit Suisse {{was founded}} by Alfred Escher in 1856 under the name Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, Swiss Credit Institution) in order to fund the {{development}} of Switzerland's rail system.

In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking {{in response to the}} elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit <b>Suisse</b> partnered with <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> in 1978. After a large failed loan put <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988.

25|$|Upon {{leaving the}} State Department, Holbrooke {{was asked by}} President Clinton to become, as a private citizen, a special envoy to the Balkans given his {{distinguished}} service in the region. Holbrooke left his post as {{assistant secretary of state}} for European and Canadian affairs and joined Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston,</b> eventually taking the position of Vice Chairman. In 1997, Holbrooke became a special envoy to Cyprus and the Balkans on a pro-bono basis as a private citizen. During 1998 and 1999, in his capacity as special presidential envoy, Holbrooke worked to end the conflict between the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), who were fighting for an independent Kosovo in the Kosovo War. Holbrooke returned to Bosnia two years later to the city of Sarajevo. In March 1999 he traveled to Belgrade to deliver the final ultimatum to Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević before the NATO attack began. Holbrooke wrote numerous articles about his experiences in the Balkans, and in 1998, published the widely acclaimed book, To End a War, a memoir of his time as the chief negotiator of the Dayton Peace Accords, ending the Bosnian civil war. The New York Times ranked the book as one of the eleven best books of the year in 1998.|$|E

The restructure {{was expected to}} cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year. While Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> had been struggling, Credit Suisse's overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million. In 1999 Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division's license to operate in Japan for [...] "window dressing," [...] the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Fastow {{formulated}} two limited partnerships: LJM Cayman. L.P. (LJM1) and LJM2 Co-Investment L.P. (LJM2), for {{the purpose}} of buying Enron's poorly performing stocks and stakes to improve its financial statements. LJM 1 and 2 were created solely to serve as the outside equity investor needed for the special purpose entities that were being used by Enron. Fastow had to go before the board of directors to receive an exemption from [...] (as he had the title of CFO) in order to manage the companies. The two partnerships were funded with around $390 million provided by Wachovia, J.P. Morgan Chase, Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston,</b> Citigroup, and other investors. Merrill Lynch, which marketed the equity, also contributed $22 million to fund the entities.|$|E
500|$|Other Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> brands {{were later}} created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo. According {{to an article}} in The New York Times, First Boston became [...] "the superstar of the Euromarkets" [...] by buying stakes in American {{companies}} that wanted to issue bonds. In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green {{for the purchase of}} the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston. Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business, which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the [...] "burning bed" [...] deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.|$|E

500|$|In the 2000s Credit Suisse {{executed}} {{a series of}} restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance. Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the [...] "one bank" [...] model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a [...] "solution partners" [...] group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions. Following the restructure Credit Suisse's private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney's private banking poll. In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement. The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.|$|E

2500|$|Dynegy {{undertook}} {{a strategy to}} move into coal-fired and hydroelectric electrical generation in 2004, and out of natural gas distribution and trading. [...] In November 2004, the company acquired four natural gas-fired and four hydroelectric power generation plants in the Northeast United States. In March 2005, it agreed to settle a 1999 dispute with the Environmental Protection Agency by spending US$321 million to repair and upgrade coal-fired generating plants in Illinois to reduce pollutants. In mid-2005, Dynegy hired Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> to assist it in finding a buyer for its natural gas transmission businesses. The sale of this business came quickly: In August 2005, Dynegy sold this business to Targa Resources, a company owned by private equity firm Warburg Pincus.|$|E
2500|$|Several Dynegy {{executives}} were later convicted or indicted for {{their roles in}} Dynegy's near-collapse. [...] In June 2003, Jamie Olis (former Senior Director of Tax Planning), Gene Foster (former Vice President for Taxation), and Helen Sharkey (a former employee in Dynegy's risk control and deal structure groups), were indicted on numerous counts of mail and wire fraud. According to court documents, the three employees conceived of a plan in early 2001 to borrow money but {{make it look like}} operational revenue. [...] A corporation known as ABG Gas Supply was created. [...] ABG secured loans from Citigroup, Credit <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> <b>Boston,</b> and Deutsche Bank to buy natural gas at market prices. ABG then sold this gas at a discount to Dynegy, which resold it at market prices and booked a $300 million profit. [...] ABG then bought natural gas at market prices, and sold it at a premium to Dynegy. [...] The profits ABG booked were then used to repay the loans. [...] Prosecutors accused Olis, Foster, and Sharkey of deceiving auditors, regulators, and other company executives regarding the transactions. Foster and Sharkey plead guilty two months later. Olis was found guilty in March 2004, and sentenced to 24 years in prison. (A year later, after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a different case held that mandatory sentencing guidelines violated the Constitution, Olis' sentence was reduced to just six years in prison.) In December 2003, three former executives at Nicor Energy LLC (a joint venture of Dynegy and Nicor), were indicted for illegally manipulating that firm's income by US$11 million in 2001 to hide losses. Former chief financial officer Robert Doty agreed to pay a $376,650 fine in October 2007 for his role in helping to conceal the ABG Gas Supply scheme.|$|E
