40|$|Smoke meters with {{increased}} sensitivity, improved accuracy, and rapid response {{are needed to}} measure the smoke levels emitted by modern jet engines. The standard soiled tape meter in current use is based on filtering, which yields long term averages and is insensitive to low smoke levels. Two new optical smoke meter techniques that promise to overcome these difficulties have been experimentally evaluated: modulated transmission (MODTRAN) and photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS). Both techniques are based on light absorption by smoke, which {{is closely related to}} smoke density. They are variations on direct transmission measurements which produce a modulated signal that can be easily measured with phase sensitive detection. The MODTRAN and PDS techniques were tested on low levels of smoke and diluted samples of NO 2 in nitrogen, simulating light adsorption due to smoke. The results are evaluated against a set of ideal smoke meter criteria that include a desired smoke measurement range of 0. 1 to 12 mg cu. m. (<b>smoke</b> <b>numbers</b> of 1 to 50) and a frequency response of 1 per second. The MODTRAN instrument is found to be inaccurate for smoke levels below 3 mg/cu. m. and is able to make a only about once every 20 seconds because of its large sample cell. The PDS instrument meets nearly all the characteristics of an ideal smoke meter: it has excellent sensitivity over a range of smoke levels from 0. 1 to 20 mg/cu. m.

40|$|Background Physical {{activity}} behaviour {{is considered}} as a satisfactory additional aid method for quit smoking programs. Moreover, laboratory based studies provide strong evidence that physical activity acutely reduces cigarette cravings. An mHealth app (Physical over Smoking: Ph. o. S.) was developed {{to be used as}} a support tool for quitters to manage their cigarette cravings and help us testing the acute effectiveness of exercise on quitters under real-life conditions. Aim Aim of this study was to examine the associations between three explanatory variables of TPB-PA (attitudes, intention and perceived behavioural control for physical activity behaviour) on 3 smoking related response variables (<b>number</b> of cigarettes <b>smoked,</b> <b>number</b> of relapses and number of cravings), over a 3 month follow up period after quit smoking. Time, group and interaction of group X time were also examined. Method A quit smoking program (3 weekly sessions) which incorporated physical activity promotion applied to smokers who aimed to quit smoking. After the quit day each participant assigned randomly to a group of users of the mHealth app or to a group of non-users. Users received a short training to use the Ph. o. S app when experience cigarette cravings. The Ph. o. S app suggested short physical activities as a way to manage cravings. Forty four quitters (19 females) were assigned to a group of app users (n= 25) and to a group of non-users (n= 19). All participants completed the TPB - PA questionnaire immediately after their quit day and after that they reported their <b>number</b> of cigarettes <b>smoked,</b> <b>number</b> of relapses and number of cravings the last 7 days, at 3 days, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after. Results Perceived Behavioural Control for Physical Activity (PBC-PA) behaviour predicted the number of relapses and cigarettes smoked for a follow up period of 3 months. Higher PBC-PA indicated lower number of relapses and smoked cigarettes during the 3 month follow up period. Time trends of cigarettes <b>smoked</b> and <b>number</b> of cravings was significantly different between groups. The <b>number</b> of cigarettes <b>smoked</b> didnâ€™t increase as fast in users group as in non-users group, whereas cravings decreased faster in non-users group. Conclusion The results support previous literature suggesting that a possible mechanism behind the beneficial effects of exercise on decreasing smoking behaviour might be the increased perceived behavioural control over exercise that has an effect on the control to smoking behaviour. Moreover, using exercise to manage after quit smoking cravings can delay further smoking behaviour relapses...|$|R

The complex mixtures were recovered by successive Soxhlet extraction of filtered particulates and XAD- 2 sorbent resin with methylene chloride (DCM) and then methanol (MeOH). Bacterial mutagenicity [see Paper II (8) ] {{was found in}} the DCM extractables. Samples of DCM extracts from the two cyclic firing conditions and of the raw fuel were separated by gravity column chromatography on alumina. The resulting fractions were further characterized by a range of instrumental methods. Average yields of both unextracted particulates and of DCM extractables, normalized to a basis of per unit weight of fuel fired, were lower for continuous firing than for cyclic firing. For cyclic firing, decreasing the <b>smoke</b> <b>number</b> lowered the particulates emissions but only slightly reduced the average yield of DCM extractables. These and similar observations, here reported for two other oil burners, show that adjusting the burner to a lower <b>smoke</b> <b>number</b> has little effect on, or may actually increase, emissions of organic extractables of potential public health interest. Modifications of the burner firing cycle aimed at approaching continuous operation offer promise for reducing the amount of complex organic emissions. Unburned fuel accounted for roughly half of the DCM extractables from cyclic firing of the flame retention head burner at high and low <b>smoke</b> <b>number.</b> Large (i. e., greater than 3 ring) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were not observed in the DCM extractables from cyclic firing. However, nitroaromatics, typified by alkylated nitronaphthalenes, alkyl-nitrobiphenyls, and alkyl-nitrophenanthrenes were found in a minor subfraction containing {{a significant portion of the}} total mutagenic activity of the cyclic low smoke samples (8). Oxygen-containing PAH, typified by phenalene- 1 -one and its alkyl derivatives, are important mutagens from cyclic firing at high smoke conditions. Thus, oil burner effluents differ markedly from those of several other combustors, including the automotive diesel engine, where multiring PAH, typified by fluoranthene and alkylated phenanthrenes, account for a significant portion of the effluent mutagenicity. Implications for combustion and emissions source identification are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{efficiency}} and reduced emissions demands from users and legislative organisations have {{lead to the}} development of advanced combustion technologies for diesel engines. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a widely used technology to control diesel combustion and emissions, primarily to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Implementation of high levels of EGR (> 50 %) is able to simultaneously reduce both emissions of NOx and particulate matter (PM) to ultra low levels. However, high EGR combustion is subject to reduced combustion {{efficiency and}} stability with increased total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. This thesis presents research into low temperature diesel combustion (LTC) operation and the effects on combustion and emissions when the engine is operated under air, fuel and EGR rates encountered during transitions between LTC and conventional diesel operation modes. This has resulted in an improved understanding of the diesel combustion process and pollutant emissions with high rates of EGR, different fuel injection pressures and timings, post fuel injection and exhaust back pressures. The sensitivity of LTC to variations in engine speed, fuel injection quantity, and EGR rate and intake manifold temperature were investigated. Pseudo-transient operation of the engine was studied to interpret the transient performance of a diesel engine during transients within LTC and from LTC to conventional diesel combustion in a new European driving-cycle (NEDC) test. Experimental investigations were conducted on a single cylinder research diesel engine. Cylinder pressure, fuel consumption and gaseous and particulate emissions (filter <b>smoke</b> <b>number,</b> size distribution, and total number) were measured. The results showed that an increase in EGR rate can realise LTC on the research engine. Fuel injection parameters influenced the combustion phasing, and control of this was able to improve the combustion stability and to reduce the THC and CO emissions. The low <b>smoke</b> <b>number</b> for the LTC diesel combustion was a result of reduced mean particle size with possible changes in particulate composition. EGR is the most critical parameter influencing the LTC combustion and emissions. Transient simulation of an engine exhibits significant discrepancies in EGR rate and boost pressure. Pseudo-transient points at intermediate load condition showed significantly increased emissions, particularly <b>smoke</b> <b>number.</b> Retarded fuel injection timing and increased boost pressure were demonstrated to be an effective strategy to reduce smoke emissions for these pseudo-transient operating points.

Extensive tests on emissions, performonce and dilferent umounts of NG substitution in a direct injection (DI) diesel engine have been carried out fo, both diesel fuel only and dual fuel (DF) operations. The results show that 86 % NG could be substituted for diesel fuel at low speeds over the whole load range. Maximum IfG operotion showed higher corbon monoxide (CO) emissions than the diesel fuel only operution while smoke was reduced with DF operation. The maximum vulues of smoke emission were 30 Hutridge <b>smoke</b> <b>numbers</b> (HSIV) with the maximum IfG and 28. 5 HSIY in diesel fael only opeFatio...|$|R

40|$|Background. We {{examined}} {{whether there}} are genetic influences on nicotine withdrawal. and {{whether there are}} genetic factors specific to nicotine withdrawal, after controlling for factors responsible for risk of progression beyond experimentation with cigarettes and for quantity <b>smoked</b> (average <b>number</b> of cigarettes per day at peak lifetime use). Method. Epidemiologic and genetic analyses were conducted using telephone diagnostic interview data from Young adult Australian twins reporting any cigarette use (3026 women. 2553 men: mean age 30 years). Results. Genetic analysis of the eight symptoms of DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal suggests heritability is intermediate for most symptoms (26 - 43...|$|R
