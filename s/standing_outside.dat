Freyr, impatient, comments that one night is long, as is two nights, and questions how he will bear three, noting that frequently a month seemed shorter than half a night before being with Gerðr.|$|E
5|$|At a {{memorial}} service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including PK van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Michael Naify and William Nasser {{turned to}} Pflueger {{again for a}} new {{neighborhood}} theater design based on the Alhambra in Grenada, Spain. The Alhambra Theatre opened on November 5, 1926 with a grand facade flanked by twin minarets that glowed red at night. Pflueger's vision stayed firmly planted in the Moorish Revival style, complete to the iron scrollwork and amber shade redesign of two municipal streetlamps <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> of the theater. Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich palette of color most prominently displayed in a geometric floral pattern on the main ceiling. The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, as a Second Division side, Sunderland {{reached the}} FA Cup Final, where {{they beat the}} cup-holders Leeds United. A first half goal by Scotsman Ian Porterfield was the only goal of the game. Jimmy Montgomery {{produced}} a double save, first from a Trevor Cherry header, and then from a shot by Peter Lorimer, to prevent Leeds from scoring. At {{the end of the}} game Sunderland manager Stokoe ran onto the pitch to embrace his goalkeeper, a gesture perpetuated by the statue currently <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> the Stadium of Light. Only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976, and West Ham United in 1980, have since equalled Sunderland's achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene Harris and Klebold are <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> their high school. The player guides {{them to the}} {{cafeteria}} to plant their timed propane bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors. After the explosives are set, the two stop {{for a moment on}} a hill outside the school, discussing their alienation and hostility. After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder as many people as they can; the final number killed is up to the player. After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.|$|E

5|$|They {{were met}} by nearly 400 Insane Clown Posse fans <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> {{in front of the}} TRL studio window, all with signs {{supporting}} the duo. Thirty minutes before the show began, Viacom security guards and New York City police officers were dispatched to remove all the fans from the sidewalk. When some fans, including Robert Bruce, refused to move because it was a public street and no other individuals were asked to move, they were assaulted. All telephone requests for the video to be played were ignored, and Insane Clown Posse was never mentioned during the show. MTV later informed Island Records that the heads of the network must choose the band first before it can become eligible to be featured on TRL.|$|E
5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner <b>standing</b> <b>outside.</b> Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{graduated}} from Hamilton College with a BPhil in 1905, then studied Romance languages under Hugo A. Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained an MA in early 1906 and registered {{to write a}} PhD thesis on the jesters in Lope de Vega's plays. A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees {{and gave him a}} travel grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe. He spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace; he happened to be <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> the palace on 31 May 1906 during the attempted assassination by anarchists of King Alfonso, and left the country for fear he would be identified with them. After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris, attending lectures at the Sorbonne, followed by a week in London.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed {{to show off}} the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost in the Foyer, ghosts playing cards in the Parlor, ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo decided to make the demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E

5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were <b>standing</b> <b>outside</b> the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. <b>Standing</b> <b>outside</b> the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
