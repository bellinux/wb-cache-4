2500|$|The {{visitor center}} and gardens were {{designed}} by GWWO, Inc., Architects, an architectural design firm based in Baltimore. Chris Elcock was the lead architect. The buildings were located on the site and oriented to face north, {{the direction in which}} Tubman led slaves to freedom. Plans called for four buildings, three dedicated to exhibits and one to house administrative offices. Each of the buildings is shaped like a barn, since Tubman and the slaves she was leading to freedom often slept in barns at night and barns are evocative of the rural architecture of the area. The three exhibit buildings are clad in a light green zinc siding which will dull with time. Zinc was chosen because it is a <b>self-healing</b> <b>material</b> which the architects felt reflected the healing which has gone on since the American Civil War. The administration building is clad in wood. Construction of the buildings utilized a number of craftsman. Building materials included stone and reclaimed wood, and the architectural style featured exposed beams and timbers. [...] The buildings were designed to have windows which featured views of the surrounding wildlife refuge, little of which had changed since Tubman's day. All the structures were designed to be green buildings with at least a LEED Silver certification. The buildings feature geothermal heating and cooling, green roofs, permeable paving in parking areas and on pathways, and solar-powered external lighting.|$|E

Plate thickness of 4-6mm may be adequate for rimfire ammunition. Sloping plates deflect bullets downward into sand, water {{or some other}} capture material; but the plate angle is often steep enough to largely disintegrate the bullet upon initial impact, and bullets are expected to disintegrate upon impacting vertical plates. Shooter protection for firing positions within 25 m of the impact plate may require an anti-splash curtain of Linatex or similar <b>self-healing</b> <b>material</b> hung {{in front of the}} plate to contain any fragments of “back splash” as well as dust.

50|$|<b>Self-healing</b> <b>materials</b> are {{artificial}} or synthetically-created {{substances that}} have the built-in ability to automatically repair damage to themselves without any external diagnosis of the problem or human intervention. Generally, materials will degrade over time due to fatigue, environmental conditions, or damage incurred during operation. Cracks {{and other types of}} damage on a microscopic level have been shown to change thermal, electrical, and acoustical properties of materials, and the propagation of cracks can lead to eventual failure of the material. In general, cracks are hard to detect at an early stage, and manual intervention is required for periodic inspections and repairs. In contrast, <b>self-healing</b> <b>materials</b> counter degradation through the initiation of a repair mechanism that responds to the micro-damage. Some <b>self-healing</b> <b>materials</b> are classed as smart structures, and can adapt to various environmental conditions according to their sensing and actuation properties.|$|R

5000|$|Sottos helped {{developed}} the first polymeric <b>self-healing</b> <b>material</b> with colleagues including Jeffrey Moore and Scott White. The work {{was completed in}} 2000, and published in Nature in 2001. They have shown that microencapsulated healing agents can polymerize to heal areas of damage such as cracks smaller than a human hair. Their approach {{was to develop a}} polymeric matrix which involved both a reactive liquid healing agent and a catalyst. While undamaged, these were kept structurally separate. The liquid agent was contained inside non-reactive reservoirs within the material, while the catalyst was dispersed throughout the polymer. Once the material was damaged and a crack occurred, the reservoirs broke open, and capillary action caused the liquid agent to disperse into the damaged area, where it reacted with the catalyst and solidified to seal the crack. They have studied both the use of a contained healing agent and a dispersed catalyst, and the use of a dispersed healing agent and a contained catalyst. Using dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and Grubbs' catalyst in an epoxy matrix, polycyclopendiene was formed to seal cracks, recovering up to 75% of the original fracture toughness.|$|E

50|$|In {{extrinsic}} systems, {{the healing}} chemistries {{are separated from}} the surrounding polymer in microcapsules or vascular networks, which after material damage/cracking release their content into the crack plane, reacting and allowing the restoration of material functionalities. These systems can be further subdivided in several categories. While capsule-based polymers sequester the healing agents in little capsules that only release the agents if they are ruptured, vascular <b>self-healing</b> <b>materials</b> sequester the healing agent in capillary type hollow channels which can be interconnected one dimensionally, two dimensionally, or three dimensionally. After one of these capillaries is damaged, the network can be refilled by an outside source or another channel that was not damaged. Intrinsic <b>self-healing</b> <b>materials</b> {{do not have a}} sequestered healing agent but instead have a latent self-healing functionality that is triggered by damage or by an outside stimulus. Extrinsic <b>self-healing</b> <b>materials</b> can achieve healing efficiencies over 100% even when the damage is large.|$|R

This polymer- modified self-healing mortar has an autonomous self-healing mechanism with, a high workability, a high flexural strength and also a high adhision. The experiments that has been performed in this study show that a polymer- modified self-healing mortar is a strong material with and active self-healing. This bacterial self-healing mechanism can heal cracks up to 0. 46 mm in contrast to the autogenous self-healing (of conventional mortar) of cracks up to 0. 18 mm. Beside this the fresh mortar showed a high workability. These properties make the polymer-modified self-healing mortar a strong and a more durable mortar. This concept can also be used to produce polymer-modified self-healing concrete. Materials and EnvironmentCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{requirement for}} the autonomous capsule-based self-healing process to work is that cracks need to reach the capsules and break them such that the healing agent can be released. Ignoring all other aspects, the amount of healing agents released into the crack {{is essential to obtain}} a good healing. Meanwhile, {{from the perspective of the}} capsule shapes, spherical or elongated capsules (hollow tubes/fibres) are the main morphologies used in capsule-based self-healing materials. The focus of this contribution is the description of the effects of capsule shape on the efficiency of healing agent released in capsule-based <b>self-healing</b> <b>material</b> within the framework of the theory of geometrical probability and integral geometry. Analytical models are developed to characterize the amount of healing agent released per crack area from capsules for an arbitrary crack intersecting with capsules of various shapes in a virtual capsule-based <b>self-healing</b> <b>material.</b> The average crack opening distance is chosen to be a key parameter in defining the healing potential of individual cracks in the models. Furthermore, the accuracy of the developed models was verified by comparison to the data from a published numerical simulation study...|$|E
