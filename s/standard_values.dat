2500|$|Other {{systems for}} the {{measurement}} of dynamic quantities that used imperial and US customary units are the British Gravitational System (BG) proposed by Arthur Mason Worthington and the English Engineering System (EE). Both systems depend on the gravitational acceleration, and use the pound-force as the unit of force but use different approaches when applying Newton's laws of motion. In the BG system, force, rather than mass is a base unit while the slug is a derived unit of inertia (rather than mass). On the other hand, the EE system uses a non-coherent approach and introduce the acceleration due to gravity (g) into its equations. [...] Both these approaches led to slight variations in {{the meaning of the}} pound-force (and also of the kilogram force) {{in different parts of the}} world. [...] Various countries published <b>standard</b> <b>values</b> that should be used for g and in 1901 the CGPM published a standard value for g that should be used in the [...] "International Service of Weights and Measures", namely 9.80665m/s2 (32.174ft/s2) which is equal to the value of g at 45° latitude.|$|E

In the endgame, where there is usually little danger of checkmate, the fighting value of the king is about four points [...] [...] In the endgame, a king is more powerful than a minor piece but less powerful than a rook.
