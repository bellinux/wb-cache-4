40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two techniques}} to reduce power consumption in content-addressable memories (CAMs). The first technique is to pipeline the search operation by breaking the match-lines into several segments. Since most stored words fail to match {{in their first}} segments, the search operation is discontinued for subsequent segments, hence reducing power. The second technique is to broadcast small-swing search data on less capacitive global search-lines, and only amplify this signal to full swing on a shorter local search-line. As few match-line segments are active, few local search-lines will be enabled, again saving power. We have employed the proposed schemes in a 1024 144 -bit ternary CAM in 1. 8 -V 0. 18 -μm CMOS, illustrating an overall power reduction of 60 % compared to a nonpipelined, nonhierarchical architecture.

The algorithms of this family perform well for short patterns and middle size alphabets.

Our algorithms outperform the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm, either in the original version or with Sunday's Quick search modification, in a wide area of pattern length - alphabet size plane. In some subareas the proposed algorithms are the fastest among all known exact pattern matching algorithms.
