50|$|The {{caseless}} design {{revolved around}} {{a specially designed}} projectile, that was in effect a small rocket. The round used an internal propellant chamber {{at the rear of}} the projectile containing a ten gram silk bag filled with smokeless powder. Drilled into the base plate of the round are twelve 3.8 millimeter diameter exhaust holes. The propellant chamber is sealed by a thin aluminum <b>sealing</b> <b>cup,</b> which covers the exhaust holes. When the primer is struck, the bag of propellant ignites, and the pressure rises until the aluminum cup bursts, allowing the exhaust gas to rush through the exhaust holes pushing the projectile forward. The propellant was exhausted before the projectile left the barrel.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe natural radon decay, leakage {{and back}} {{diffusion}} {{are the main}} removal processes of radon from its container. Ignoring these processes leads to underestimate the measured value of radon related parameters like exhalation rate and radium content. This work is aimed to evaluate two different radon chambers through determining their leakage rate λv and evaluation of radon source by determine its back diffusion rate λb inside the evaluated radon chambers {{as well as a}} small <b>sealed</b> <b>cup.</b> Two different methods are adapted for measuring both the leakage rate and the back diffusion rate. The leakage rate can be determined from the initial slope of the radon decay curve or from the exponential fitting of the whole decay curve. This can be achieved if a continuous monitoring of radon concentration inside the chamber is available. Also, the back diffusion rate is measured by sealing the radon source in the chamber and used the initial slope of the buildup curve to determine λb and therefore the exhalation rate of the source. This method was compared with simple equation for λb based on the ratio of the source to the chamber volume. The obtained results are applied to ceramic tile as an important radon source in homes. The measurement is targeted the ceramic glaze before and after firing as well as the obtained tile after adhere the glaze on the tile main body. Also, six different tile brands from Egyptian market are subjected to the study for comparison...|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{the policy}} on care for prisoners who are {{addicted}} to opiates is still heterogeneous. The recent guidelines entitled 'Medicinal care for drug addicts in penal institutions' should contribute towards unambiguous and more evidence-based treatment for this group. In addition, it should improve and bring the care pathways within judicial institutions and mainstream healthcare more into line with one another. - Each rational course of medicinal treatment will initially be continued in the penal institution. - In penal institutions the help on offer is mainly focused on abstinence from illegal drugs {{while at the same}} time limiting the damage caused to the health of the individual user. - Methadone is regarded at the first choice for maintenance therapy. For patient safety, this is best given in liquid form in <b>sealed</b> <b>cups</b> of 5 mg/ml once daily in the morning. - Recently a combination preparation containing buprenorphine and naloxone - a complete opiate antagonist - has become available. - On discontinuation of opiate maintenance treatment intensive follow-up care is necessary. During this period there is considerable risk of a potentially lethal overdose. Detoxification should be coupled with psychosocial or medicinal intervention aimed at preventing relapse- Naltrexone is currently the only available opiate antagonist for preventing relapse. - In those addicted to opiates, who also take benzodiazepines without any indication, it is strongly recommended that these be reduced and discontinued. This can be achieved by converting the regular dosage into the equivalent in diazepam and then reducing this dosage by a maximum of 25 % a wee...|$|R
40|$|A sample return {{container}} {{is being}} developed by Honeybee Robotics to receive samples from a derivative of the Champollion/ST 4 Sample Acquisition and Transfer Mechanism or other samplers and then hermetically seal samples for a sample return mission. The container is enclosed in a phase change material (PCM) chamber to prevent phase change during return and re-entry to earth. This container is designed to operate passively with no motors and actuators. Using the sampler's featured drill tip for interfacing, transfer-ring and sealing samples, the container consumes no electrical power and therefore minimizes sample temperature change. The circular container houses a few isolated canisters, which will be sealed individually for samples acquired from different sites or depths. The drill based sampler indexes each canister to the sample transfer position, below the index interface for sample transfer. After sample transfer is completed, the sampler indexes a seal carrier, which lines up seals with the openings of the canisters. The sampler moves to the sealing interface and seals the sample canisters one by one. The sealing interface can be designed to work with C-seals, knife edge <b>seals</b> and <b>cup</b> <b>seals.</b> Again, the sampler provides all sealing actuation. This sample return container and co-engineered sample acquisition system are being developed by Honeybee Robotics {{in collaboration with the}} JPL Exploration Technology program...|$|R

The chamois figures largely; there are pouches made of chamois skin, walking sticks and alpenstocks tipped with chamois horn; sometimes an entire skin, horns and all, hanging disconsolately downward.
