5|$|A 1992 phylogenetic {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequences showed a strong {{possibility of a}} clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. Bovini consists of the genera Bubalus, Bos, Pseudoryx (saola), Syncerus (African Buffalo), Bison and the extinct Pelorovis. Tragelaphini consists of two genera: Taurotragus (eland) and Tragelaphus. A closer relationship between Boselaphini and Tragelaphini was predicted, and seconded by a <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in 1999.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, a <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> of Asian Americans {{resulted}} in President Bill Clinton presenting 22 Medals of Honor in 2000. Twenty of these medals went to American soldiers of Japanese descent of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team (442nd RCT) {{who served in}} the European Theater of Operations during World War II. One of these Medal of Honor recipients was Senator Daniel Inouye, a former U.S. Army officer in the 442nd RCT.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet is}} {{estimated}} to have 10 times the mass and two to four times the diameter of Earth. An object with the same diameter as Neptune has not been excluded by previous surveys. An infrared survey by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2009 allowed for a Neptune-sized object beyond 700 AU. A <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in 2014 focused on possible higher-mass bodies in the outer Solar System and ruled out Jupiter-mass objects out to 26,000 AU.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. A <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the wartime Manhattan Project. Key scientists {{working on the}} project anticipated that their development would have wide-ranging implications. However the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., was reluctant to spend project funds on activities beyond those required to win the war. Nonetheless, Arthur Compton of the Metallurgical Project in Chicago commissioned a report on post-war nuclear energy, and the Military Policy Committee, the Manhattan Project's governing body, commissioned a <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> by Richard Tolman. Both reports called for a comprehensive, government-supported nuclear energy program, with military, scientific, and industrial aspects.|$|E

30|$|In our study, {{we find a}} {{much smaller}} share of {{concurrency}} bugs than the one found by other <b>similar</b> <b>studies.</b> This could possibly {{be due to the}} different bug-source software and case studies of our <b>study</b> and other <b>similar</b> <b>studies.</b> An interesting observation is that 52 % of 351 concurrency bugs were reported in the five-year interval of 2006 – 2010, and the remaining 48 % were reported in the five-year interval of 2011 – 2015.|$|R

25|$|About 0.15% {{of adults}} (3 per 2,000) have DSPD. Using the strict ICSD {{diagnostic}} criteria, a random study in 1993 of 7,700 adults (aged 18–67) in Norway estimated {{the prevalence of}} DSPD at 0.17%. A <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in 1999 of 1,525 adults (aged 15–59) in Japan estimated its prevalence at 0.13%.|$|E
25|$|In Kentucky a <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> was done, {{examining}} the fecal pellets and stomach {{contents of the}} bats {{in and around the}} caves. The processed food showed that in this particular area the Virginia Big-Eared Bat had a diet of mainly Lepidoptera (moths) and Coleoptera (beetles), along with spiders, crickets, roaches, flies, ants, wasps and bees.|$|E
30|$|Although {{our study}} was limited to mammary tumor in an animal model, it {{provided}} a template approach to perform <b>similar</b> <b>studies</b> with other tumor types using different radiotracers. As more radiotracers become available, <b>similar</b> <b>studies</b> can be performed to facilitate their application in clinical settings. For example, such an approach could be used in 18 F-fluoromisonidazole(FMISO)-PET to evaluate how FMISO characterizes tumor tissue hypoxia in vivo in animal model and provide a roadmap for further research on FMISO-based radiotherapy planning [21].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to look at {{derivative}} usage in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe and contrast the findings to surveys done of other countries. There is no evidence of <b>similar</b> <b>studies</b> done on small sub Saharan African countries, so there is no specific literature driven expectations based outcome. One can however draw logical expectations regarding the findings based on the homogenous characteristics of smaller countries (and markets) in the rest of the world and <b>similar</b> <b>studies</b> done on those countries...|$|R

25|$|These {{results and}} {{conclusions}} were confirmed by a <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> on slugs and snails. Cabbage leaves were sprayed with caffeine solutions and fed to Veronicella cubensis slugs and Zonitoides arboreus snails. Cabbage consumption reduced over time, {{followed by the}} death of the molluscs. Inhibition of feeding by caffeine was also observed for caterpillars.|$|E
25|$|EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) is a <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> {{that was}} started in 1992 and {{involves}} 520,000 men and women mostly between 35 and 70 years old from ten European countries. Participants are recontacted every three to five years. It is specifically designed to study the respective roles of diet and genes {{in the development of}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|Meditation {{can also}} affect brains, and even change them permanently. In 2003 Professor Richie Davidson from the University of Wisconsin {{performed}} a revolutionary study. People {{were randomly selected}} into either a mindfulness training group or a control group that was put {{on a waiting list}} for training. Davidson showed that even eight weekly sessions of meditation enhanced left frontal EEG functioning. <b>Similar</b> <b>study</b> was later replicated by Professor Holzel.|$|E

25|$|In a <b>similar</b> <b>study,</b> Saffran {{found that}} adults and older {{children}} (first and second grade children) were also sensitive to syntactical information after exposure to an artificial language {{which had no}} cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present. Both adults and children were able to pick out sentences that were ungrammatical at a rate greater than chance, even under an “incidental” exposure condition in which participants’ primary goal was to complete a different task while hearing the language.|$|E
25|$|In one {{field study}} in Marrakech, Morocco, where raw sewage {{is used to}} {{fertilize}} crop fields, Ascaris eggs were detected {{at the rate of}} 0.18 eggs/kg in potatoes, 0.27 eggs/kg in turnip, 4.63 eggs/kg in mint, 0.7 eggs/kg in carrots, and 1.64 eggs/kg in radish. A <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in the same area showed that 73% of children working on these farms were infected with helminths, particularly Ascaris, probably as a result of exposure to the raw sewage.|$|E
25|$|A <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in 2007 using samples {{exclusively}} from Europe {{found that the}} most important genetic differentiation in Europe occurs on a line from the north to the south-east (northern Europe to the Balkans), with another east-west axis of differentiation across Europe. Its findings were consistent with earlier results based on mtDNA and Y-chromosonal DNA that support the theory that modern Iberians (Spanish and Portuguese) hold the most ancient European genetic ancestry, as well as separating Basques and Sami from other European populations.|$|E
