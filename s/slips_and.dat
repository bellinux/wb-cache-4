5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E

Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking he may have hit a bump ball into the ground, but the umpire thought otherwise and ruled him out. Johnson had little else to do as the pacemen made steady progress on a seaming pitch. He bowled only two overs for three runs as England fell for 186, handing Australia victory by 409 runs and a 20 series lead.|$|E

5|$|Hutton and Washbrook {{took the}} score to 42—England's highest opening {{partnership}} {{of the series}} thus far—before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson in the <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, they survived Lindwall's spell of bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back {{to put pressure on}} Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.|$|E

5|$|In 1963–64, Chappell batted {{at number}} three for SA {{for the first}} time, in a match against Queensland at Brisbane, and scored 205 not out.

A century against Victoria early the following season resulted in Chappell's selection for a one-off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964. He made 11 and took four catches, but was dropped until the Fourth Test in the 1965–66 Ashes series. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the <b>slips,</b> <b>and</b> he showed promise as a leg-spinner. At this point, the selectors and captain Bob Simpson considered him an all-rounder: he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match.|$|E
40|$|Owing to its HCP crystallography, {{deformation}} {{mechanisms of}} magnesium involve both plastic <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> deformation twinning.

We will discuss a theoretical–computational framework to model <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> twinning interactions in HCP materials with a focus on pure Mg. Plastic slip is incorporated through crystal plasticity theory which explicitly takes accounts for interactions between the different slip systems. Twinning is modeled through a relaxation-based approach, that allows capturing twinning at lower length scales. Model parameters are identified by experimental data through plane–strain compression tests. The influence of multiple active <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> twinning system will be discussed together with challenges of the numerical implementation. The effective response of polycrystalline Mg will be simulated using both exact finite element calculations and the Taylor assumption, and we will compare the simulated response to experimental results...|$|R

5|$|Bradman was on 89 {{and heading}} towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time {{courtesy}} of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but the seamer's leg cutter moved the ball the other way towards the <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> caught Bradman's outside edge. Bedser had dismissed Bradman all four times {{so far in the}} Test series. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 after Australia had lost 3/33. The tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss, Miller striking one six over square leg into the grandstand. He had also offered two chances, but none of the catches were completed. This gave Australia a lead of 478 {{at the end of the}} third day, with Miller on 22 and Brown on 7. In all, England had missed seven catches or stumpings. O'Reilly said the loss of three quick wickets in the afternoon was not so much a sign of an English revival but Australian complacency due to the large size of the lead.|$|E

New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling, snow blower accidents or <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to the snow.

40|$|The {{majority}} of existing tractors in Iran are not equipped with any tools to measure <b>and</b> display <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> ground speed. This is mainly {{due to the}} lack of national standards for measuring tools and instruments of tractors. In current research, an interchangeable system for two wheel drive tractors has been designed. Furthermore, it has been assessed after construction. To measure actual and theoretical ground speed, four rotary encoders for sensing the rotation of front and rear wheels have been utilized. <b>Slip</b> <b>and</b> ground speed were measured by means of software which has been developed in an ATmega 16 PU microprocessor. The measured <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> speed are digitally displayed on tractor dashboard. To evaluate the performance of the system, the measured values of ground speed <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> were compared with their calculated values obtained from conventional method. The Micro-controller has been programmed in such a way that the effect of front wheel sliding on slip is eliminated. In all evaluation conditions (in field and on asphalt), the maximum difference between system measurements for <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> speed <b>and</b> calculated <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> speed via conventional method was 2. 4 % and 0. 2 km h- 1, respectively.

On the first morning, England opener Len Hutton edged Toshack through the <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> was then dropped on 25. Hutton {{eventually}} reached 81 as the opening pair put on 168. Toshack was wicketless as the hosts closed the first day at 2/268. The following morning, he {{was removed from the}} attack after night-watchman Bedser hit him for three consecutive fours. After the lunch break, Toshack bowled Jack Crapp with an inside-edged half volley for five to leave England at 5/447. Toshack ended with an ineffective 1/112 from 35 overs as England made 496. He was the most expensive and uneconomical of the frontline bowlers and it was his most uneconomical performance in the Tests. He aggravated his knee injury and was later taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his bowling duties for the match and his Test career.|$|E

Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but Bedser then moved the ball the other way towards the <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> caught Bradman's outside edge. It was the fourth time out of four innings in the series that Bedser had dismissed Bradman. This left Australia at 4/329 and the next day, Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch {{so that he could}} attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. The Australian captain declared on the following day of play at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.

Johnston bowled without success {{in the first half}} of the innings; the closest he came to a wicket on the third afternoon when Len Hutton and Denis Compton were putting on a century partnership was when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point. On the fourth day, England continued to make steady progress and Johnston was unsuccessful although he was able to make the ball move sideways in the morning under cloudy conditions. He was then attacked by Hardstaff, who drove several fours through the off side and forced Bradman to remove Johnston. He returned to remove Barnett and English captain Norman Yardley late on the fourth day as the hosts’ neared 300. Barnett was caught by Miller in the <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> Johnston took a return catch to remove the English skipper. Johnston bowled 30 overs, the most of any bowler for the day, as England reached the penultimate evening on 345/6, a lead of one run. The next morning, Johnston removed Evans and bowled Jack Young to end England's innings at 441 on the final day. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 10 leadthe Australian batsmen reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.|$|E
