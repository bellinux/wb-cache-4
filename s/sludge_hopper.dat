40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} vortex separator (HDVS) {{is currently}} employed at {{wastewater treatment works}} and in the sewerage system as a combined sewer overflow (CSO) for the separation of solids from an incoming waste stream. This project presents the first stage in developing and aiding the existing design methodology for the optimisation of kinetic processes within the HDVS. The kinetic process design methodology combines hydraulic and kinetic principles by using the true mixing regime characteristics of a system and batch reactor data to determine a kinetic processes efficiency. This project used residence time distribution (RTD) analysis to extensively characterise the mixing regime within a model and prototype HDVS. The HDVS was operated with and without a baseflow component and with and without the <b>sludge</b> <b>hopper</b> {{for a range of}} inlet flow rates and flow splits covering design flow rates for a number of existing applications. The RTD was obtained using a pulse tracer injection method and described using the complete range of data analysis techniques typical employed in RTD studies. This includes the axial dispersion model (ADM), tanks-in-series model (TISM), RTD indices and a RTD combined mathematical model. The combined model is configured to quantify the inactive flow behaviour within the HDVS i. e. stagnant and dead volumes. The HDVS has a complex imperfect plug-flow mixing regime. This non-ideal flow behaviour is associated with both dispersion and dead volumes and results in short-circuiting. At low flow rates the HDVS operating without a baseflow contains fluid elements which conduct flow slower than the mean velocity. At high flow rates the inactive flow behaviour is associated with dead volumes and subsequently short-circuiting. The flow rate at which this change in mixing characteristics occurs is termed the transition flow rate and is approximately 151 /min and 901 /min for the model and prototype HDVS respectively. At all flow rates above the transition flow rate the HDVS has a very stable mixing regime, which is associated with both the inactive flow behaviour and the plug-flow mixing characteristics. The ADM and TISM parameters increase as the flow rate decreases and therefore, the HDVS has improved plug-flow mixing characteristics and reduced dispersion at low flow rates. Removing the <b>sludge</b> <b>hopper</b> reduces the inactive flow behaviour and improves the plug-flow mixing characteristics. The inactive flow behaviour within the model HDVS operating with no baseflow occupies approximately 20 - 40...|$|E
40|$|This work aim at {{introduce}} {{basic knowledge}} of CFD and it’s application in optimization of sedimentation tank and lab flocculation units. A series of specialized strategies are {{developed for the}} simulation of the sedimentation tanks and lab flocculation units. Chapter 1 is general introduction of particle removal in water and wastewater treatment, includes particle separation, as well as particle removal during chemical treatment and biological treatment. In chapter 2, background and application of CFD is introduced, development of CFD, application of CFD in different water and wastewater treatment processes are illustrated, the advantage of introduce CFD into water and wastewater treatment processes optimize and design then apparent. Governing equations and basic numerical solution procedure of CFD are introduced in chapter 3, a compact direct numerical solution of Navier-stokes equation is demonstrated in this chapter, the demonstration could help readers gain quickly understanding about some basic concepts of CFD. Some concepts used in commercial CFD software, such as pressure-velocity coupling, residual, convergence criteria and under relaxation factor, also briefly explained, these concepts {{will be used in}} following chapters. The major content of chapter 4 is turbulence model, because most flows in reality are turbulence flow, to ensure accuracy of CFD simulation, turbulence model is necessary, an appropriate turbulence model in addition to governing equations is prerequisite of acceptable CFD simulation, main stream turbulence model, includes zero equation model, one equation model, two equations k-εmodel, two equations k-ωmodel, seven equations Reynolds stress model as well as large eddy simulation, is introduced in this chapter. Chapter 5 introduce the species transport and reaction model, Residence Time Distributed (RTD) is a very important parameter in reactor design, in commercial CFD software, RTD can be obtained by solve the species transport and reaction model with assistance of continuity equation, Navier-stokes equation and turbulence models. Chapter 6 mainly focus on different multi-phase models available in current commercial CFD software, because most flows in reality consist of more than one phase, in order to increase accuracy of CFD simulation, also modeling multi-phase phenomena, different multi-phase models are coupled into commercial CFD software, multi-phase models should be selected carefully according to characteristic of phases in flow, another factor need taken into consideration when choosing a multi-phase model is computer power, since multi-phase models require higher CPU usage compare to single phase simulation. The major task of chapter 6 is introduce different multi-phase models and explain why Mixture model is selected as multi-phase model used in this study. Chapter 7 demonstrate and analyze single phase and RTD simulation result for seven different sedimentation tank models, contour of velocity gradient, velocity vector, kinetic energy and RTD curve for different designs is demonstrated. According to simulation result, several failures such as strong surface current and re-circulating current is detected in the original design, the hydraulic performance is improved in modified designs. Chapter 8 demonstrate and analyze the multi-phase simulation result, the multi-phase simulation in this chapter use transient solver, so that simulation result at different simulate times are recorded, “density current” is detected in the multi-phase simulation result, through analyze distribution of sediments, the function of <b>sludge</b> <b>hopper</b> and stability of sludge layer is studied. Chapter 9 demonstrate and analyze simulation result for one Flat Blade Turbine (FBT) and two Pitched Blade Turbines (PBT) with different inclined angles, a special mesh generation technique, namely “Multi Reference Frame (MRF) ”, also illustrate in this chapter, the mixing effect of different mixing devices is demonstrated through display contour of velocity gradient and velocity vector.

2500|$|In {{the primary}} {{sedimentation}} stage, sewage flows through large tanks, commonly called [...] "pre-settling basins", [...] "primary sedimentation tanks" [...] or [...] "primary clarifiers". The tanks {{are used to}} settle sludge while grease and oils rise {{to the surface and}} are skimmed off. Primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected <b>sludge</b> towards a <b>hopper</b> in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities. Grease and oil from the floating material can sometimes be recovered for saponification (soap making).|$|R
5000|$|The cleared flow {{is passed}} to the primary {{settlement}} tanks, where solid material settles out onto {{the floor of the}} tank. Mechanical scrapers push this <b>sludge</b> into <b>hoppers,</b> for transfer to the sludge treatment plant. Fat and grease forms a scum {{on the surface of the}} tanks, and this is skimmed off. After a period, which allows most of the organic material to settle out, the liquor passes over weirs at the end of the settlement tanks to the secondary treatment process. This consists of aeration lanes, where air is pumped through the liquor, to encourage the growth of bacteria which are already present in the wastewater. The bacteria digest the remaining organic material which is suspended or dissolved in the water. The bacteria form an activated sludge, a process developed at Davyhulme Sewage Works in Manchester by Edward Ardern, the chief chemist, and William Lockett, the chief research assistant, in 1914.|$|R
