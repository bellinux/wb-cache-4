5|$|The {{following}} month, Sarita {{entered a}} feud with Velvet Sky, scoring back-to-back pinfall victories over {{her on the}} October 28 and the November 4 episodes of Impact!, first in a six-woman tag team match {{and then in a}} singles match. Sarita and Taylor Wilde had their third match at the November 9 tapings of Xplosion, with Sarita once again coming out victorious. Despite wrestling on the November 25 episode of Impact! as a face, when she answered the challenge of TNA Women's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne and then defeated her in a non-title match, Sarita resumed her status as a heel and her feud with Sky on the December 9 episode of Impact! when, despite losing to her and Love in the first round match of a tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, Sarita claimed that <b>Sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> loser, and {{would never be able to}} beat her. On the December 23 episode of Impact!, Sky was set to wrestle for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but was forced to miss the match, after being attacked backstage by Sarita. The following week, Sarita defeated Sky in a Strap match. On the February 10 episode of Impact!, Sarita's on-screen cousin, Rosita, made her TNA debut in an eight-woman tag team match, where the duo teamed with Madison Rayne and Tara and defeated Angelina Love, Mickie James, Velvet Sky and Winter. The following week, Sarita and Rosita aligned themselves with Hernandez, who had returned from working in Mexico the previous week and had begun expressing anti-American views. Later in the evening, Sarita and Rosita defeated Angelina Love and Velvet Sky in a tag team match. Afterwards, Sky challenged Sarita to a one-on-one match, where she agreed to put her career on the line. On the March 3 episode of Impact!, Sky was able to defeat Sarita in a singles match, salvaging her career in the process.|$|E

25|$|Across the <b>Sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Dove Award-nominated Christian band {{formed in}} Nashville, Tennessee during 2000 by Matt Martin, Ben Kolarcik, and Justin Unger. Matt {{eventually}} left before their first album was recorded. Both musicians {{are of the}} singer-songwriter style.

The group toured and recorded for two years under the Word Records Label before disbanding in 2005 when both artists decided to pursue different career paths.|$|E
25|$|The Aztec world {{consisted}} of three main parts: the earth world on which humans lived (including Tamoanchan, the mythical origin of human beings), an underworld which belonged to the dead (called Mictlan ("place of death")), and the upper plane in the sky. The earth and the underworld were both open for humans to enter, whereas the upper plane in the sky was impenetrable to humans. Existence was envisioned as straddling the two worlds in a cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. Thus {{as the sun was}} believed to dwell in the underworld at night to rise reborn in the morning and maize kernels were interred to later sprout anew, so the human and divine existence was also envisioned as being cyclical. The upper and nether worlds were both thought to be layered. Mictlan had nine layers which were inhabited by different deities and mythical beings. The sky had thirteen layers, the highest of which was called Omeyocan ("place of duality") and served as the residence of the progenitor dual god Ometeotl. The lowest layer of the <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> verdant spring-like place with abundant water called Tlalocan ("the place of Tlaloc").|$|E

500|$|Found {{throughout}} Canada, {{the bird}} is popularly known by its once-official name, [...] "Canada jay". Another well-known colloquial name is [...] "whisky jack". This is {{a variation on the}} name of Wisakedjak, a benevolent trickster and cultural hero in Cree, Algonquin, and Menominee mythologies. Alternate spellings for this name include wesakechak, wiskedjak, whiskachon, and wisakadjak. The Tlingit people of northwestern North America know it as kooyéix or taatl'eeshdéi, [...] "camp robber". According to the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia, each of the seven stars of the Big Dipper depicted a different bird; the star Eta Ursae Majoris in the night <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> grey jay, Mikjaqoqwej.|$|E
500|$|After {{the failure}} of the Jacobite {{rebellion}} of 1745, Flora MacDonald became famous for rescuing Prince Charles Edward Stuart from the Hanoverian troops. Although she was born on South Uist her story is strongly associated with their escape via Skye and she is buried at Kilmuir in Trotternish. [...] Samuel Johnson and James Boswell's visit to Skye in 1773 and their meeting with Flora MacDonald in Kilmuir is recorded in Boswell's The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. Boswell wrote, [...] "To see Dr Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the English Tories, salute Miss Flora MacDonald in the isle of <b>Sky,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> striking sight; for though somewhat congenial in their notions, it was very improbable they should meet here". Johnson's words that Flora MacDonald was [...] "A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour" [...] are written on her gravestone. After this rebellion the clan system was broken up and Skye became a series of landed estates.|$|E
500|$|Small {{pieces of}} paper were sprayed as snow, which caused a problem as it scared the horses. However, the snow falling from the <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> foam substance. The actors who played the dead bodies possessed by the Gelth had simple make-up, with just shading and contact lenses and no prosthetics. The {{production}} team was mindful of the programme's audience, and decided to not have any missing facial features. Originally, visual effects company The Mill planned the computer-generated effects (CGI) to just be the [...] "ethereal swirl", but in the seance scene they ran into the challenge of animating the Gelth's mouth. The Gelth turning red during the seance scene was a [...] "last-minute" [...] change to the visual effects. The Mill overshot their quota of CGI for the episode, and compensated with small swirls in shots that focused on other characters. The head speaking was in fact actress Zoe Thorne, who had been filmed separately and used as a template for animation. In other scenes, Thorne had the challenge of matching her voice-overs to the actors who portrayed the bodies animated by the Gelth.|$|E

Sebastian Haffner used the metaphor in his book Germany: Jekyll & Hyde, published in London in 1940, in introducing {{his discussion of the}} Nazi rise to power in Germany in 1933: [...] "Back then to March 1933.

2500|$|On {{the night}} of December 14, the Aurora Borealis made an {{appearance}} unusual for that latitude, presumably caused by a large solar flare.

[...] The event was noted in the diaries and letters of many soldiers at Fredericksburg, such as John W. Thompson, Jr., who wrote [...] "Louisiana sent those famous cosmopolitan Zouaves called the Louisiana Tigers, and there were Florida troops who, undismayed in fire, stampeded the night after Fredericksburg, when the Aurora Borealis snapped and crackled over that field of the frozen dead hard by the Rappahannock ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|NPR's {{reviewer}} Amal El-Mohtar {{praised the}} novel's twist on traditional fantasy and science-fiction, which usually posits that a world is worth saving. [...] "The Stone Sky rejects {{this out of}} hand," [...] El-Mohtar writes. [...] "If the Broken Earth trilogy as a whole shows a world where cataclysm and upheaval is the norm, The Stone Sky interrogates what right worlds built on oppression and genocide have to exist." [...] Tor.com's Niall Alexander, who was critical of The Obelisk Gate, declared that The Stone <b>Sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "comprehensive confirmation of N. K.

[...] Barnes & Noble's Joel Cunningham agreed, asserting that it [...] "reshapes the face of epic fantasy," [...] as did The Verges Andrew Liptak, praising the book as [...] "a triumphant achievement in fantasy literature."

2500|$|The lack of {{features}} in the release version of the game became a point of contention, with many players using the Steam and GOG.com review pages, along with Metacritic reviews, to give it poor ratings. Sean Murray received {{a great deal of}} online criticism from players, including accusations of lying. A Reddit user temporarily took down the documented list of removed features after he received messages that congratulated him on [...] "really sticking it to these 'dirtbag' devs", which was not his intention in publishing the list; he wanted no part of the anger towards Hello Games. The subreddit forum had become hostile {{due to a lack of}} updates from Hello Games or Sony, leading one moderator to delete the subreddit due to the toxicity of the comments, later undoing that action on further review. The Hello Games' Twitter account had been hacked into in October 2016 and used to post the message [...] "No Man’s <b>Sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mistake" [...] among other tweets before the companies regained control of it, leading to confusion and additional drama within the community. Users sought refunds for the game via both Sony and Valve outside of the normal time allowance for claiming such refunds by their policies, citing the numerous bugs within the game and/or the lack {{of features}}, and while some players claim to have received such refunds, both companies have reemphasised their refund policies in response to the volume of refund requests.|$|E
