Methods: A prospective observational study initiated in 1968 – 1969, including 1462 women aged 60, 54, 50, 46, and 38 years, with follow-ups in 1974 – 1975, 1980 – 1981, and 2000 – 2001, was performed. Measures included self-reported mental stress as well as psychosomatic symptoms and smoking, physical activity, total cholesterol, S-triglycerides, body mass index, waist–hip ratio, blood pressure, <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> and mortality. Results: Smoking, not being single, and not working outside home were strongly associated with reported mental stress at baseline. Women who reported high mental stress in 1968 – 1969 {{were more likely to}} report presence of abdominal symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 85, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 39 – 2. 46), headache/migraine (OR = 2. 04, 95 % CI: 1. 53 – 2. 72), frequent infections (OR = 1. 75, 95 % CI: 1. 14 – 2. 70), and musculoskeletal symptoms (OR = 1. 70, 95 % CI: 1. 30 – 2. 23) than women who did not report mental stress. Women without these symptoms at baseline 1968 – 1969, but with perceived mental stress were more likely to subsequently report incident abdominal symptoms (OR = 2. 15, 95 % CI: 1. 39 – 3. 34), headache/migraine (OR = 2. 27, 95 % CI: 1. 48 – 3. 48) and frequent infections (OR = 2. 21, 95 % CI: 1. 12 – 4. 36) in 1974 – 1975 than women without mental stress in 1968 – 1969. There was no association between perceived mental stress at baseline and mortality over 37 years of follow-up. Conclusion: Women reporting mental stress had a higher frequency of psychosomatic symptoms than women who did not report these symptoms. Not working outside home and smoking rather than low <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> per <b>se</b> was associated with higher stress levels.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] Indicators of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> are {{associated}} with age. This study aimed to analyse {{the influence of the}} age distribution on the ranking of small areas by <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> and on the association between their <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> and standardised mortality. DESIGN [...] The ranking of small areas by <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> indicators (educational level, income, and unemployment) was compared with crude values and after correction for their age structure. The age and gender standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) of these areas for the age group 1 - 64 years was then rank correlated with both crude and age standardised measures of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status.</b> SETTING [...] This study used data for all (n = 22) boroughs of Amsterdam for the period 1986 - 91. MAIN RESULTS [...] Correction of indicators of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> for the age structure of the population hardly affects the ranking of Amsterdam boroughs by <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status.</b> All rank correlations between crude and age standardised <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> measures are above 0. 95. Rank correlations between SMR and these <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> measures also hardly change after correction for the age structure of boroughs except for education. Mean income per earner is the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> indicator most strongly associated with the SMR. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study shows that the age structure of Amsterdam boroughs has almost no influence on their ranking by <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> and a limited influence on the association between their <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> and SMR, except for educational level. The latter indicator has the strongest association with age. This result and theoretical considerations indicate that a correction for the age structure of the population will be more important if small areas differ little with regard to <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status,</b> if they vary considerably in age structure, or if a given indicator of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> shows a strong cohort effect or age association...|$|R
40|$|Health {{disparity}} by <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> {{has recently}} {{become an important}} public health concern. <b>Socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> may affect health status through several pathways including lifestyle choices. The authors tested the link between <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> and lifestyle in China (in 1993) and in the United States (in 1994 – 1996), countries with high contrasts in development, to understand health discrepancy issues cross-nationally. Healthfulness of lifestyle was measured using the Lifestyle Index, a summary score that integrates four key lifestyle factors: diet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Income and education were used as indicators of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status.</b> In China, as <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> improved, lifestyle was less healthy (relative odds for the highest <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> group = 0. 19, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 10, 0. 35). Conversely, in the United States, higher <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> was related to a healthier lifestyle (relative odds for the highest <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> group = 3. 81, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 94, 4. 94). The contrasting relation between <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> and lifestyle depicts different phases of the lifestyle transition (changes in lifestyles accompanying economic development). The differences may in part explain why nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases are more prevalent {{in the developing world}} among people with a high <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status,</b> whereas often the opposite is found in developed societies.

25|$|Undernutrition during pregnancy, {{and other}} factors, may cause intrauterine growth {{retardation}} (IUGR), {{which is one}} cause of low birth weight. However, {{it has been suggested}} that in IUGR the brain may be selectively spared. Brain growth is usually less affected than whole body weight or length. Several studies from developed nations have found that with the exception of extreme intrauterine growth retardation also affecting brain growth, and hypoxic injury, IUGR seems to have little or no measurable effect on mental performance and behavior in adolescence or adulthood. For example, acute undernutrition for a few months during the Dutch famine of 1944 caused a decrease in mean birthweight in certain areas. This was later associated with a change in performance on IQ tests for 18–19 years old Dutch males draftees from these areas compared to control areas. The subjects were exposed to famine prenatally but not after birth. During the famine, births decreased more among those with lower <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> (<b>SES),</b> whereas after the famine, there was a compensatory increase in births among those with lower SES. Since SES correlates with IQ, this may have hidden an effect caused by the undernutrition.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{communities}} or cultures, including poverty, unemployment or underemployment, {{lack of social}} cohesion, and migration, {{have been associated with}} the development of mental disorders. Stresses and strains related to socioeconomic position (<b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> (<b>SES)</b> or social class) have been linked to the occurrence of major mental disorders, with a lower or more insecure educational, occupational, economic or social position generally linked to more mental disorders. There have been mixed findings {{on the nature of the}} links and on the extent to which pre-existing personal characteristics influence the links. Both personal resources and community factors have been implicated, as well as interactions between individual-level and regional-level income levels. The causal role of different socioeconomic factors may vary by country. Socioeconomic deprivation in neighborhoods can cause worse mental health, even after accounting for genetic factors. In addition, minority ethnic groups, including first or second-generation immigrants, have been found to be at greater risk for developing mental disorders, which has been attributed to various kinds of life insecurities and disadvantages, including racism. The direction of causality is sometimes unclear, and alternative hypotheses such as the Drift Hypothesis sometimes need to be discounted.|$|E

In turn, students in these situations are often forced into academic courses and fight an uphill battle, where they have to engage in activities that are difficult to focus on, based on their circumstances.|$|E

The authors studied socioeconomic status-mortality trends with each <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> variable adjusted for the other. For all causes, an individual’s education was strongly and inversely associated with mortality; a weak but significant inverse trend was also present for area-level <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status.</b> A similar pattern was seen for all-vascular disease. For all cancers, there was again a significant inverse trend with education but no trend with area-level <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status.</b> Adjustment for conventional (non-socioeconomic status) individual-level risk factors diminished the effect of both <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> variables, although significant trends remained for men between education and all-cause, all-cancer, and all-vascular disease mortality.

All subjects resided in the greater Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area. Data collection occurred throughout 1986. Lower <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> women, the least active group, averaged 1, 536 ± 1, 701 minutes/week (±standard deviation) of total physical activity, whereas higher <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> women, the most active group, averaged 2, 079 ± 1, 807 minutes/week (p < 0. 0001). Higher <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> men averaged 1, 952 ± 1, 799 minutes/week, and lower <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> men averaged 1, 948 ± 1, 916 minutes/week. Higher socioeco-nomic status women spent significantly more time each week in leisure-time physical activity, job-related physical activity, and household physical activity than did lower <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> women.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of SociologyIntergenerational {{mobility}} is {{of interest}} to social scientists, {{in part due to}} the persistence of the quest for the “American Dream”. Intergenerational mobility is a gauge of the opportunities each group has to increase their privilege, class, and income. In addition, it helps researchers understand the way our society creates class structures. Many studies have addressed intergenerational mobility, focusing on <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> (<b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status)</b> of fathers and its effect on their sons. Other studies have looked at father’s effect on son’s and daughter’s occupational mobility, but the effect of father’s <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> on daughter’s <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> has been overlooked thus far. This study examined the intergenerational mobility of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> and if there are differences in the transmission of father’s <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> to their sons and daughters. Secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 - 2002) was used for the analysis.
