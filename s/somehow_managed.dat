5|$|The Chester Canal was an English canal {{linking the}} south Cheshire town of Nantwich with the River Dee at Chester. It was {{intended}} to link Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich, but the Trent and Mersey Canal were unco-operative about a junction at Middlewich, and so the route to Nantwich was opened in 1779. There were also difficulties negotiating with the River Dee Company, and with no possibility of through traffic, the canal was uneconomic. Part of it was closed in 1787, when Beeston staircase locks collapsed, {{and there was no}} money to fund repairs. When the Ellesmere Canal was proposed in 1790, the company saw it as a ray of hope, and <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to keep the struggling canal open. The Ellesmere Canal provided a link to the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port from 1797, and the fortunes of the Chester Canal began to improve.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the railway}} company was obtaining its own Act, which had {{initially}} included a similar clause about maintenance, but {{this had been}} dropped {{by the time the}} Act was passed. The Railway Commissioners voiced their concern that the railway had <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to gain control over a navigation without any of the details being included in their own Act.

25|$|The Hawkeyes' perfect {{season and}} hopes at a {{national}} championship were in serious jeopardy for three quarters, as Indiana went {{into the locker room}} ahead 21–7 at the half thanks to an opening-drive score and special teams miscues by the Hawkeyes (a 9-yard punt and a fumble on a punt return deep in Iowa territory). The Hoosiers looked to extend the lead to three scores when Tyler Sash <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to intercept a Ben Chappell pass and take it 86 yards the other way for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Bradman was hurried by Gilbert, but he <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to {{keep the}} first ball out. The second was a {{harmless}} one, just outside leg. The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, but {{he got back to}} his feet. Then came the bouncer, a really quick one. Bradman tried to counterattack, but it was too quick. The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.|$|E
25|$|During his {{frequent}} trips to Pakistan, Gilani {{hung out with}} heroin users and started using the drug himself. He became involved in Pakistani drug trafficking. When he was twenty-four, Gilani smuggled half a kilogram of heroin out of Pakistani tribal areas and used Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Pakistani army doctor who Gilani knew from military school, as an unwitting shield. Several days later, police in Lahore arrested Gilani for drug possession, but he <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to beat the charges. Rana continued {{to be used by}} Gilani {{over the course of his}} career as a drug trafficker; in the late 1990s, after Rana had emigrated to the U.S., Gilani used Rana's legitimate immigration consulting company in Chicago to smuggle drugs.|$|E

25|$|World War I had {{provided}} a general increase {{in demand for}} textiles, {{and many of the}} mills of New England benefited during this time. The post-war economy quickly slowed, however, and production quickly outpaced demand. The Northern mills faced serious competition from their Southern counterparts due to factors such as lower labor and transportation costs, as well as the South's large investment in new machinery and other equipment. In 1923, Fall River faced the first wave of mill closures. Some mills merged and were able to limp along until the late 1920s. By the 1930s and the Great Depression, many more mills were out of business and the city was bankrupt. A few <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to survive through World War II and into the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 tournament was {{hosted by}} New Zealand: it saw {{a repeat of}} the 1987 World Cup finale standings, as Australia took on Wales in the Bronze final and won 21-18, while New Zealand, by {{defeating}} France 8-7 in the final, became the first nation to win on home soil twice. This tournament was notable for the fact that France lost twice in the pool stages, to NZ and Tonga, and yet <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to progress {{all the way to the}} Final to face off with NZ one more time. This represented the first time any team had played each other twice in a world cup and was also the first time the winner and runner-up of the same pool progressed through to the Finals.|$|E
25|$|May 21 {{was a day}} of missed {{opportunities}} for Grant. Lee failed to take the bait of the isolated II Corps and instead marched by the most direct route to the North Anna. That night, Warren's V Corps bivouacked a mile east of the Telegraph Road and <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to miss Lee's army marching south right next to it. If Warren had attacked Lee's flank, he could have inflicted significant damage to the Confederate army. Instead, Lee's army reached the North Anna unmolested on May 22. Grant realized that Lee had beaten him to his objective and decided to give his exhausted men an easier day on the march, following Lee down the Telegraph Road {{for only a few}} miles before resting for the night.|$|E

25|$|Riiser-Larsen's {{years of}} polar {{exploration}} began in 1925 when his compatriot Roald Amundsen, the famed polar explorer, {{asked him to}} be his deputy and pilot for an attempt to fly over the North Pole. Riiser-Larsen agreed and secured the use of two Dornier Do J Wal seaplanes. The expedition, however, was forced to land close to the Pole, badly damaging one of the planes. After twenty-six days on an ice shelf, first trying to shovel tons of snow to create an airstrip, until someone suggested the easier way of tramping the snow surface, the expedition's six members squeezed themselves into the remaining plane. Riiser-Larsen <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to coax the overloaded plane {{into the air and}} flew the expedition back to the coast of Northern Svalbard.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match they faced the first the fbt20 2014 champions Lahore Lions but they lost against them with Lahore Lions winning by 6 wickets in 18.4 overs. In the second match they faced the Southern Express. Southern Express had {{a slow start}} and lost wickets {{regularly}} but <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to score 161/6 in 20 overs. The Mumbai Indians started off with an excellent opening partnership of 139 runs in just 14 overs but lost their first wicket on the 4th ball of the 15th over but skipper Kieron Pollard ended things off in blistering way with scoring 20 runs from just 7 balls. But in the last match against the Northern Knights they just managed 132 runs which the Northern Knights won comfortably 6 wickets with 16 balls to spare. In this way Mumbai's clt20 2014 campaign ended.|$|E
25|$|After {{a season}} spent {{employed}} by the VFL as the umpires' coach, Worrall was recruited by Essendon. Here, he took a talented but previously under-performing team to a premiership in his first season. The next year, 1912, an injury-ravaged Essendon team <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to upset hot favourites South Melbourne in the Grand Final. Over five completed seasons, Worrall had now coached five premiership teams. But the team declined rapidly thereafter and went into recess in 1916–1917, due to World War I. Performances failed to improve when the Same Old returned to competition, winning only fifteen out of 46 games between 1918 and 1920, prompting Worrall's retirement. The team finished last in 1918, and Worrall became {{the first man to}} coach both a premiership and a wooden-spoon team. In 1922, he reappeared briefly as an assistant to Vic Belcher at his old team Fitzroy, which {{went on to win the}} premiership from Collingwood.|$|E

25|$|The replay {{just under}} {{three weeks later}} {{was the first time}} an All-Ireland hurling decider was played on a Saturday. Clare emerged as champions {{for the first time since}} 1997 after {{defeating}} Cork by 5-16 to 3-16 in a classic at Croke Park. Shane O'Donnell, a late call-up to the starting line-up in place of Darach Honan, justified his inclusion with a stunning individual haul of 3-3, all from play. O'Donnell hit all three goals in the opening nineteen minutes of the first half and while Cork came from eight points down to draw level during the second half, the winners had a kick left in them as goals from Conor McGrath and sub Honan secured a fourth Liam MacCarthy Cup success for Clare. With 18 minutes left on the watch, the scores were level at 1-16 to 3-10 and they were deadlocked again with ten minutes left as Séamus Harnedy's goal brought Cork on terms, 2-16 to 3-13. But Clare’s response was magnificent as McGrath crashed home a magnificent 62nd-minute goal into the top corner of the Davin Stand netting. Clare pushed six points clear, 4-16 to 2-16, before Stephen Moylan’s stoppage time goal for Cork brought a spellbound Croke Park to life once more. But in the second minute of stoppage time, Honan cut in from the left touchline and <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to bundle the ball over the line for the eighth goal of a quite incredible spectacle.|$|E
25|$|In 1577, some of {{the gang}} members were caught, {{including}} Niers himself. Monika Spicker-Beck, for example, notes that a Claus Strikker confessed in April that 10 years earlier, he had worked together with Niers, and helped him murder a 20-year-old woman in Gottswald. Also, an accomplice named Peter Oblath drew {{up a list of}} 14 gang members, including the name of Peter Niers. Joy Wiltenburg notes that Niers himself was arrested and tortured in Gersbach. There, he confessed to 75 acts of murder, but <b>somehow</b> <b>managed</b> to escape. Over the next few years, until his final arrest in 1581, a number of pamphlets, ballads, and stories were written and circulated detailing his cannibalism and mastery of the black arts. For example, it was said that when Niers and Sumer's gang gathered at Pfalzburg, they had a meeting with the Devil, who gave his blessing to the gang's ambitions, even providing Niers and Sumer with monthly pay along with granting supernatural powers to Niers. Even earlier than this, however, it seems that Niers learned how to become invisible from his mentor Martin Stier, and that the only reason he was finally caught was because he was deprived of his bag containing the magical materials to make himself invisible. A critical component of such magical material was thought to be the remains of fetuses; during the casting of the spell the fetus hearts were eaten. Joy Wiltenburg mentions also another use of fetal black magic: To concoct the flesh and fats of infants into magic candles that, when lit, would allow them to rob houses without awaking the inhabitants.|$|E
