2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of his first book, My Story in 1975, he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks. In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!" ...|$|E
