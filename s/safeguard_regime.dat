This conflict became apparent in recent years when several coastal states denied passage to ships transporting nuclear materials arguing the shipments posed an environmental threat. This conflict has raised an issue which is currently unresolved: Do coastal states {{have a right to}} prohibit innocent passage to ships carrying nuclear materials if these ships fail to fulfill the requirements of the precautionary principle? This review finds the current nuclear <b>safeguard</b> <b>regime</b> does not require shipping states to provide notice to or authorization from transit states.

40|$|In this chapter, we take intense neutron sources (INS) as a {{somewhat}} futuristic case to unveil another dimension in disputes over {{the application of}} safeguards to nuclear technologies. The current IAEA <b>safeguards</b> <b>regime</b> is built on a distinction between facilities and materials. The assumption underlying such a distinction is that facilities are not a concern {{in the absence of}} nuclear materials. Historically, such a distinction made sense because {{there was no reason to}} operate nuclear fuel cycle facilities in the absence of nuclear materials. However, INS facilities do not require nuclear materials under normal operating procedures, yet they hold out the potential for producing weapons-grade plutonium in a shorter period of time and with less source material than existing facilities. As a result, they present a new challenge to the IAEA <b>safeguards</b> <b>regime.</b> We present a comparison of the timeline to produce weapons-grade plutonium with reactors, spallation neutron sources and fusion plants and discuss possible advantages and disadvantages of the respective technologies. One focus will be the possibility of fusion plants and spallation sources producing significant quantities of plutonium with less source material than ‘one effective kilogram’ of uranium. Furthermore, the question will be raised if the corresponding technologies are adequately covered by current IAEA terms like ‘facility’ and ‘reactor’...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Antineutrino {{detectors}} {{could provide}} a valuable addition to current <b>safeguards</b> <b>regimes.</b> Antineutrinos are an attractive emission to monitor due to their low interaction cross-section that prevents them from being shielded and the dependence of their spectrum on the power level and isotopic content of a reactor core. While there are antineutrino detectors currently deployed at an operational reactor, such observations cannot predict {{the effect of the}} diversion of nuclear material on the antineutrino emissions. Utilizing simulation tools, one can predict the antineutrino signatures of such abnormal operations and other reactor types that have not been experimentally measured.

40|$|As {{described}} {{in an earlier}} article [1], important information regarding reactor power and the amount and type of fissile material in reactor cores can be determined by measuring the antineutrino rate and energy spectrum, using a cubic meter scale antineutrino detector at tens of meters standoff from the core. Current International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards techniques do not provide such real-time quantitative information regarding core power levels and isotopic composition. The possible benefits of this approach are several and have been discussed in the earlier article. One key advantage is that the method gives the inspecting agency completely independent access to real-time information on the operational status and fissile content of the core. Furthermore, the unattended and non-intrusive nature of the technology may reduce the monitoring burden on the plant operator, even though more information is being provided than is available within the current IAEA <b>safeguards</b> <b>regime.</b> Here we present a detailed analytical framework for measuring the impact that such a detector might have on IAEA safeguards, if implemented. To perform the analysis, we will use initial data from our operating detector and a standard analysis technique for <b>safeguards</b> <b>regimes,</b> developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Because characterization of the prototype detector is still underway, and because improvements in the prototype could have important impact on safeguards performance, the results presented here should be understood to be preliminary, and not reflective of the ultimate performance of the system. The structure {{of this paper is}} as follows. Reactor safeguards and the relevant properties of antineutrino detectors are briefly reviewed. A set of hypothetical diversion scenarios are then described, and one of these is analyzed using the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Integrated Safeguards System Analysis Tool (LISSAT) The probability of successful diversion is calculated for one specific scenario, for two cases: (1) Use of current IAEA safeguards methods; and (2) Use of current IAEA safeguards methods along with antineutrino detectors. The relative improvement in IAEA safeguards are assessed by taking the ratio of the two probabilities (with and without antineutrino detectors) ...|$|R

40|$|Using the IAEA as a {{case for}} focused study, this thesis argues that the {{construction}} and reconstruction of the Secretariat’s legitimacy has been dependant upon several different legitimating influences at different stages in the IAEA’s evolution. In brief, it will be demonstrated that early on, {{in the absence of}} clear non-proliferation norms, power wielded by critical and self-interested actors functioned as the primary legitimator – promoting early development and insulating the organization from outside pressures. However, based upon this particular case, I will also argue that state power alone is insufficient to guarantee legitimacy and the exercise of international public authority, {{especially in light of the}} degree to which these institutions are increasingly expected to challenge the territorial sovereignty of member states. In order for an organization to acquire adequate legitimacy to exercise public authority over the long term, it must develop beyond the point at which state power is instrumental, and assume a degree of organizational autonomy. This happened with the evolution of organizational expertise recognizing the IAEA’s bureaucracy as an authority, development of specific nonproliferation rules and norms that placed the IAEA in authority, and “right” processes within the bureaucracy that reinforced these and other substantive norms, positioning the Secretariat as a trusted agent within international society. Thus, the development of a professional identity, successful norms and rules, and the elaboration of a “right” process were key to the creation of legitimacy, and as a consequence, the Secretariat’s exercise of public authority in support of the <b>safeguards</b> <b>regime.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{past decades}} {{have seen a}} steady {{development}} in the IAEA safeguards implementation pursuant to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The most notable development is {{the introduction of the}} Additional Protocol (AP) and of additional strengthening measures. The IAEA relies on safeguards equipment, which in many cases is based on a customized design to meet the quite unique IAEA safeguards requirements. As safeguards evolve, the development of equipment and improved techniques should account for the new setting of safeguards implementation. Needs of further stakeholders relevant to a successful implementation of safeguards have to be considered, foremost the state or regional authority responsible for nuclear material accounting and control (SSAC or RSAC) and the facility operators. This paper analyses the use of unattended monitoring systems and remote data transmission in application of Integrated Safeguards starting from the experiences gained when the new <b>safeguards</b> <b>regime</b> was introduced for the non-nuclear weapon states in the European Union in 2010. The cooperation between the stakeholders benefits from smartly designed safeguards equipment which leads to reduced effort for on-site inspections by the IAEA without compromising the effectiveness of safeguards implementation. The use of digital sensors with the possibility of remote data transmission facilitates delegation of routine tasks like cask sealing under surveillance to the operator. The information over the state-of-health of unattended safeguards sensors gains new quality in schemes based on short-notice randomized inspections. With regard to unattended sensors for radiation detection, fast digitization in proximity to the sensor provides further opportunities with respect to authentication of sensor data and determining the state-of-health of the system.

The {{field of}} {{cultural}} property protection in armed conflict {{is composed of}} many conventions but little law. This is because: (1) {{there is no single}} understanding of the concepts of "cultural property" or "protection" (2) due to the principle of reciprocity, the more international an armed conflict is, the lower the chances that a treaty concerning cultural property will apply and (3) no convention has yet devised a specific <b>safeguarding</b> <b>regime</b> for "cultural heritage", which refers to the most outstanding class of cultural objects. Legal scholarship often accepts this situation, or suggests adopting a new convention to solve the field's problems. However, attempting to counteract law's failure with more laws is a nonsensical exercise that would, in the long-run, worsen the current situation. This thesis rejects law-making as an alternative and argues in a new direction. It contends that it is already possible to identify a branch of international cultural heritage law (ICHL) underpinned by a set of specific principles and a systemic objective (telos). The cross-fertilisation of such principles and telos with those of IHL provides the rationale underlying the protection of cultural property in armed conflict. The thesis proposes to re-interpret this field in light of such rationale using the World Heritage Convention as its common legal denominator. Pursuant to the postulate of systemic integration and that of effet utile, the interplay between the World Heritage Convention and the 1954 Hague Convention, its 1999 Second Protocol, the 1977 Two Additional Protocols and customary international law is examined. Their interplay vests this field of law with a more consistent understanding of "cultural property" and "protection" it affords a specific regime of protection to "cultural heritage" and it ensures that, as a minimum, the obligations of the World Heritage Convention will apply in international armed conflicts...|$|R

If a robust nuclear growth scenario is realized, what might it look like, both geographically and technologically? 2. What are the relevant proliferation pathways in the context of this growth scenario, and what actions and studies might be taken to reduce the risk? Our analysis has three components: development of a mid-century demand scenario; discussion of proliferation technology pathways; recommendations that derive from these results. Some of the key recommendations entail: 1. Strengthening of the international <b>safeguards</b> <b>regime,</b> for example by integration of safeguards surveillance and security functions with fuel cycle design and operation. 2. Enhanced focus on enrichment technologies. 3. Timely closure of the back end of the fuel cycle through geological isolation of spent fuel or high-level waste. 4. Focus on fuel cycles that do not yield separated plutonium during normal operation, and control over international cooperative R&D programs. 5. Implementation of suitable international fuel cycle architectures. by Christopher Michael Jones. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Nuclear Engineering; and, (S. M.)

40|$|The {{development}} of non-destructive assay (NDA) capabilities to directly measure the fissile content in spent fuel {{is needed to}} improve the timely detection of the diversion of significant quantities of fissile material. Currently, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not have effective NDA methods to verify spent fuel and recover continuity of knowledge {{in the event of}} a containment and surveillance systems failure. This issue has become increasingly critical with the worldwide expansion of nuclear power, adoption of enhanced safeguards criteria for spent fuel verification, and recent efforts by the IAEA to incorporate an integrated <b>safeguards</b> <b>regime.</b> In order to address these issues, the use of Self-Interrogation Neutron Resonance Densitometry (SINRD) has been developed to improve existing nuclear safeguards and material accountability measurements. The following characteristics of SINRD were analyzed: (1) ability to measure the fissile content in Light Water Reactors (LWR) fuel assemblies and (2) sensitivity and penetrability of SINRD to the removal of fuel pins from an assembly. The Monte Carlo Neutral Particle eXtended (MCNPX) transport code was used to simulate SINRD for different geometries. Experimental measurements were also performed with SINRD and were compared to MCNPX simulations of the experiment to verify the accuracy of the MCNPX model of SINRD. Based on the results from these simulations and measurements, we have concluded that SINRD provides a number of improvements over current IAEA verification methods. These improvements include: 1) SINRD provides absolute measurements of burnup independent of the operator?s declaration. 2) SINRD is sensitive to pin removal over the entire burnup range and can verify the diversion of 6 % of fuel pins within 3 ? from LWR spent LEU and MOX fuel. 3) SINRD is insensitive to the boron concentration and initial fuel enrichment and can therefore be used at multiple spent fuel storage facilities. 4) The calibration of SINRD at one reactor facility carries over to reactor sites in different countries because it uses the ratio of fission chambers (FCs) that are not facility dependent. 5) SINRD can distinguish fresh and 1 -cycle spent MOX fuel from 3 - and 4 -cycles spent LEU fuel without using reactor burnup codes...|$|R
