5000|$|VADAR {{identifies}} and assigns protein {{secondary structure}} using 3 different algorithms. These three methods are then combined {{to create a}} consensus secondary structure assignment. Only 3 types of secondary structure are identified: Helices are indicated with an [...] "H", beta-strands are indicated with a [...] "B" [...] and coil or unstructured regions are identified with a [...] "C". Secondary structure assignments for each residue are listed under the column labeled SCND <b>STRUC.</b> The first secondary structure identification method (which appears in column 1) uses a geometric masking approach that was first described by Richards and Kundrot [...] with slight modifications. The second method (which appears in column 2) uses backbone dihedral angles to identify secondary structure elements in a manner initially described by Levitt and Greer [...] as well as Chou and Fasman. [...] The third secondary structure identification method uses hydrogen bonding patterns (in association with measured dihedral angles) to identify helices, beta strands and coil regions. This third method is somewhat similar to the method originally described by Kabsch and Sander. [...] The net result or consensus secondary structure is a weighted combination {{of each of the}} three methods. VADAR’s method of secondary structure identification generally identifies a higher fraction of secondary structure elements than the DSSP algorithm (64% helices and beta strands for VADAR versus 51% helices and beta strands for DSSP). In particular, VADAR’s secondary structure assignments appear to agree more closely with secondary structures identified by visual inspection (i.e. author assignments), by STRIDE (another secondary structure assignment algorithm) or via independent methods (i.e. NMR-based NOE methods).|$|E

40|$|Structural {{identity}} {{is a concept}} of symmetry in which network nodes are identified according to the network structure {{and their relationship to}} other nodes. Structural identity has been studied in theory and practice over the past decades, but only recently has it been addressed with representational learning techniques. This work presents <b>struc</b> 2 vec, a novel and flexible framework for learning latent representations for the structural identity of nodes. <b>struc</b> 2 vec uses a hierarchy to measure node similarity at different scales, and constructs a multilayer graph to encode structural similarities and generate structural context for nodes.

40|$|Motivation: Long {{terminal}} repeat (LTR) retrotransposons {{constitute a}} substantial fraction of most eukaryotic genomes and {{are believed to}} have a significant im-pact on genome structure and function. Conventional methods used to search for LTR retrotransposons in genome databases are labor intensive. We present an efficient, reliable and automated method to identify and analyze members of this important class of transposable elements. Results: We have developed a new data-mining pro-gram, LTR <b>STRUC</b> (LTR retrotransposon structure program) which identifies and automatically analyzes LTR retrotransposons in genome databases by searching for structural features characteristic of such elements. LTR <b>STRUC</b> has significant advantages over conventional search methods in the case of LTR retrotransposon families having low sequence homology to known queries or families with atypical structure (e. g. non-autonomous elements lacking canonical retroviral ORFs) and is thus a discovery tool that complements established methods. LTR <b>STRUC</b> finds LTR retrotransposons using an algo-rithm that encompasses a number of tasks that would otherwise have to be initiated individually by the user. For each LTR retrotransposon found, LTR <b>STRUC</b> auto-matically generates an analysis of a variety of structural features of biological interest. Availability: The LTR <b>STRUC</b> program is currently avail-able as a console application free of charge to academic users from the authors. Contact...|$|E
