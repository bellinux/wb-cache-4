5|$|Celtic {{then found}} {{themselves}} {{embroiled in a}} series of controversial matches in the second round against Rapid Wien. Celtic lost the first leg 1–3 in Vienna, but despite rough-house tactics from the Austrians, it was only Celtic's Alan McInally who found himself red-carded. The return match at Parkhead was an even more bad-tempered affair as Celtic raced to a 3–0 lead with goals from Brian McClair, Murdo MacLeod and Tommy Burns, all in spite of Rapid's foul play. The match erupted near the end when Burns was punched by Reinhard Kienast. In the ensuing chaos, coins and at least one bottle were thrown onto the pitch by some Celtic fans. None appeared to hit anybody, but one of the Rapid Wien players, Rudi Weinhofer, was carried off the pitch with his head <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> bandages. The match finished 3–0, with Celtic winning the tie 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E

25|$|At this point, {{the local}} {{gendarmerie}} arrived and arrested Mitchell.

25|$|Stylistically, the {{lighting}} in the San Zaccaria piece {{has become so}} soft and diffuse that it makes that in the San Giobbe appear almost raking in contrast. Giovanni's use of the oil medium had matured, and the holy figures seem to be <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> a still, rarefied air. The San Zaccaria is considered perhaps the most beautiful and imposing of all Giovanni's altarpieces, and is dated 1505, the year following that of Giorgione's Madonna of Castelfranco.|$|E
25|$|In Leonardo's {{earliest}} paintings we see {{the remarkable}} attention given to the small landscapes of the background, with lakes and water, <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> a misty light. In {{the larger of the}} Annunciation paintings is a town {{on the edge of a}} lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical strata. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around Lago di Garda and Lago d'Iseo in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of The Virgin of the Rocks, which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.|$|E

25|$|Following Australia's {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War, interest in Anzac Day reached its lowest point. On 26 April 1975 The Australian newspaper covered the passing of Anzac Day in a single story. However, in recent years Anzac Day has drawn record crowds, with {{an increasing number of}} those attending being young Australians, many of whom attend ceremonies <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> Australian flags, wearing green and gold T-shirts and beanies and with Australian flag tattoos imprinted on their skin. This phenomenon has been perceived by some as a reflection of the desire of younger generations of Australians to honour the sacrifices made by the previous generations.|$|E
25|$|In March 1977, the Australian Cricket Board {{assembled}} 218 of {{the surviving}} 224 Australia-England players for a Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket between the two nations. The match {{was the idea of}} former Australian bowler and MCC committee member Hans Ebeling who had been responsible for developing the cricket museum at the MCG. The match had everything. England’s Derek Randall scored 174, Australia’s Rod Marsh also got a century, Lillee took 11 wickets, and David Hookes, in his first test, smacked five fours in a row off England captain Tony Greig’s bowling. Rick McCosker who opened for Australia suffered a fractured jaw after being hit by a sharply rising delivery. He left the field but came back in the second innings with his head <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> bandages. Australia won the match by 45 runs, exactly the same margin as the first Test in 1877.|$|E

500|$|Brooks's {{portrait}} of Barney has a softer look than her other {{paintings of the}} 1920s. Barney sits, <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> a fur coat, in the house at 20 Rue Jacob where she lived and held her salon. In the window behind her, the courtyard is seen dusted with snow. Brooks often included animals or models of animals in her compositions to represent the personalities of her sitters; she painted Barney with a small sculpture of a horse, alluding to the love of riding that had led Remy de Gourmont to nickname her [...] "the Amazon". The paper on which the horse stands {{may be one of}} Barney's manuscripts.|$|E
500|$|Nicolas Cage {{was cast}} as Al Columbato. He reflected, [...] "I {{was terrified of}} the role of Al, because it was like nothing I'd ever done before, and I didn't know how to get to the places the role was asking me to go emotionally." [...] For scenes in which Al's face is {{disfigured}} and <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. [...] "I wanted to look like I was hit by a bomb," [...] he said. [...] "It gave me a feeling of something I had lost. I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much." ...|$|E
500|$|Lombard was {{particularly}} noted for the zaniness of her performances, {{described as a}} [...] "natural prankster, a salty tongued straight-shooter, a feminist precursor {{and one of the}} few stars who was beloved by the technicians and studio functionaries who worked with her". [...] Life magazine noted that her film personality transcended to real life, [...] "her conversation, often brilliant, is punctuated by screeches, laughs, growls, gesticulations and the expletives of a sailor's parrot". Graham Greene praised the [...] "heartbreaking and nostalgic melodies" [...] of her faster-than-thought delivery. [...] "Platinum blonde, with a heart-shaped face, delicate, impish features and a figure made to be <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> silver lamé, Lombard wriggled expressively through such classics of hysteria as Twentieth Century and My Man Godfrey." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of the Snow Hill scenes filmed at Elios {{were shot}} at night {{so that the}} fake [...] "snow" [...] looked more convincing; 26 tons of shaving cream was used to give the street a snowbound look. For the {{daylight}} scenes, the Elios set was <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> fog, to disguise {{the fact that the}} surrounding countryside had no snow. Camera overexposure was also occasionally used to avoid continuity errors. The film's costumes were designed by Enrico Job (the husband of director Lina Wertmüller), and were influenced by hippie fashion styles, including mufflers, shawls, and outfits made of fur and leather; Corbucci was known for standing heavily against the hippie subculture. Like other Spaghetti Westerns, the film was shot silent so that post-production dubbing could be performed in multiple languages.|$|E

500|$|The basic {{anthropomorphic}} form varies. Child gods {{are depicted}} nude, as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized. Certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts, signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance. Whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow—the same colors used to depict Egyptian men and women—some are given unusual, symbolic skin colors. Thus the blue skin and paunchy {{figure of the}} god Hapi alludes to the Nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought. A few deities, such as Osiris, Ptah, and Min, have a [...] "mummiform" [...] appearance, with their limbs tightly <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> cloth. Although these gods resemble mummies, the earliest examples predate the cloth-wrapped style of mummification, and this form may instead hark back to the earliest, limbless depictions of deities.|$|E

The Cordillera is gone from you as if it had {{dissolved}} itself into great piles of grey and black vapours that travel out slowly to seaward and vanish into thin air all along the front before the blazing heat of the day. The wasting edge of the cloud-bank always strives for, but seldom wins, the middle of the gulf. The sun--as the sailors say--is eating it up. Unless perchance a sombre thunder-head breaks away from the main body to career all over the gulf till it escapes into the offing beyond Azuera, where it bursts suddenly into flame and crashes like a sinster pirate-ship of the air, hove-to above the horizon, engaging the sea.|$|R
500|$|Big Painting No. 6. is a {{prime example}} of his works that both turned a mundane {{household}} task into a planned artistic operation and made a time-consuming task appear as if it was produced mechanically in an instant.

500|$|There {{are several}} pieces by Stoddart in Glasgow's Merchant City quarter. Italia, a 2.6 metre, glass re-in-forced polymer statue {{on top of}} Ingram Street {{represents}} the contribution of Italian traders to the area. Classical in style, the female form is <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> a chiton and carries symbols of ancient Italy: a palm branch {{in her right hand}} and an inverted cornucopia in her left. On John Street, a trio of figures, Mercury, Mercurius and Mercurial form a triangle. The first two, identical figures, sit above the John St. façade of the Italian centre; their English and Roman names signify the two different manifestations of the deity in Roman mythology. Here, they embody a [...] "dialogue" [...] between ancient lore and modern city life. Opposite, on a plinth on the street, stands Mercurial, cast in bronze and with the adjectival form of the name, it complements the duality of the other two with an underlying unity.|$|E

(One year after his wife's 1978 death, he married Linda Robinson, a longtime librarian at the Dallas Public Library, in a marriage that lasted until Stanley Marcus's own death in 2002.) In 1935 the Marcuses commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design a home for them on Nonesuch Road, but rejected the eventual design, which included cantilevered steel beams and terraces <b>swathed</b> <b>in</b> mosquito netting. Instead, the couple chose a design by local firm DeWitt & Washburn, whose creation became a Texas Historic Landmark. As of 1937, Marcus was one of only 22 Texans to earn a salary of $50,000 or more, according to the House Ways and Means Committee; his father, Herbert, was another, earning $75,000 as company president while vice president Stanley drew an even $50,000.|$|E
