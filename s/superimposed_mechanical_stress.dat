40|$|The polymer/metal {{adhesion}} was studied {{using the}} system polycyanurat on aluminum. As an approach of research we {{concentrated on the}} fundamental processes at the polymer/metal interface. Using ultrathin polymer films the formation and stability of this interface was investigated with surface-analytical techniques like AFM, IR, XPS and SAM and with electrochemical techniques like impedance spectroscopy and the Scanning-Kelvin-Probe. The relative humidity during the formation of thin films and the molecular structure of the polymer at the phase boundary dominate the electrochemical stability {{as well as the}} macroscopic mechanical behavior of the polymer/metal compound. By the help of adhesion promoters the molecular orientation at the interface was modified and the stability against electrolytes increased. During the research project a stress-and-strain apparatus was developed which allows to study the cracking behavior of adhered polymer films in-situ with AFM under lateral <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress.</b> Furthermore an apparatus for the Scanning-Kelvin probe was constructed in order to investigate the failure of an intern polymer/metal interface under <b>superimposed</b> electrochemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress.</b> (orig.)

Few studies have dealt with plastic adjustments in response to <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> compared to resource stress. We hypothesized that <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> should favor plastic adjustments that result in increased biomass production in zones protected from the stress and that altered growth patterns should be reversible after <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> removal.

The corrosive condition was fixed at 313  K in 0.5  kmol/m 3 NaCl solution, and the three regions were observed with increasing applied stress: No failure region 3 for Ni 3 (Si,Ti) and failure region 3 for Ni 3 (Si,Ti) with 2 Mo where the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and corrosiveness were too low to lead failure, region 2 where the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> became adequate to induce EIC at the given corrosiveness, and region 1 where the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> is too high to induce EIC at the given corrosiveness, with a consequent mechanical failure. This is defined as stress-dominated region. Moreover, the corrosiveness was changed from high to low by decreasing pH.

Methods: We used phosphoproteomic techniques to detect phosphorylation changes in chondrocytes under periodic <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and combined the results with the quantitative proteomic data to further explore the underlying mechanisms. Data were obtained by phosphorylation inhibition, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. Results: From phosphoproteomic analysis, a total of 1073 phosphorylated proteins and 2054 phosphopeptides were identified. The number of significant differentially expressed proteins and phosphopeptides was 97 and 108, respectively (ratio &#x 3 e; 1. 20 or &#x 3 c; 0. 83 at p&#x 3 c; 0. 05).

Methods and Results: Periodic <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> significantly induced sustained phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 and Tyr 576 / 577.

Furthermore, pretreatment with the Src-selective inhibitor, PP 2, and shRNA targeted to Src or suppression of Rac 1 with its selective inhibitor, NSC 23766, blocked FAK phosphorylation at Tyr, 576 / 577 but not Tyr, 397 under periodic <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress.</b> Interestingly, FAK phosphorylation neither at Tyr 397 nor at Tyr 576 / 577 was affected by PLC&# 947; 1 depletion when periodic <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> was applied.
