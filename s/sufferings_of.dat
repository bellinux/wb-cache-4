5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the <b>sufferings</b> <b>of</b> one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|Many years later, Mayavar (Nasser), a {{chieftain}} of {{a village}} in Periyamalaikozhundhu's kingdom, encounters twin brothers Ponnar and Shankar (both played by Prashanth), who are being tutored in martial arts by Rakki Annan (Rajkiran). Ponnar and Shankar are valorous and compassionate to the <b>sufferings</b> <b>of</b> the poor. One day, the twins save two sisters, Muthayi (Pooja Chopra) and Pavalayi (Dhivya Parameshwaran), from death. The girls are later revealed to be daughters of Chinna Malaikozhundhu. Impressed with Ponnar and Shankar's valour, Chinna Malaikozhundhu agrees to marry off his daughters to them.|$|E

5|$|About 185,000 Armenians {{lived in}} Vaspurakan. In {{the city of}} Van itself, there were around 30,000 Armenians, but more Armenians from {{surrounding}} villages joined them during the Ottoman offensive. The battle started on April 20, 1915, with Aram Manukian {{as the leader of}} the resistance, and lasted for two months. In May, the Armenian battalions and Russian regulars entered the city and successfully drove the Ottoman army out of Van. The Dashnaktsutiun was also involved in other less-successful resistance movements in Zeitun, Shabin-Karahisar, Urfa, and Musa Dagh. After the end of the Van resistance, ARF leader Aram Manukian became governor of the Administration for Western Armenia and worked to ease the <b>sufferings</b> <b>of</b> Armenians.|$|E
5|$|Calvert took an {{interest}} in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for persecuted English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the <b>sufferings</b> <b>of</b> the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606–1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the <b>sufferings</b> <b>of</b> mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the <b>sufferings</b> <b>of</b> their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
5|$|Along the Western front these began quite early {{after the}} war and {{continued}} for several decades, dropping in number in the mid-1920s, when interest in the war temporarily diminished, and again in the Depression years of the early 1930s. Flemish pilgrimages to Belgium graves, particularly the heldenhuldezerkjes, and memorials began in 1919, continuing through the subsequent decades. The Ossuary at Verdun was the centre for many veterans pilgrimages in the 1920s, one of the better known groups being the Fêtes de la Bataille, which travelled to the site to undertake a vigil, processions and lay wreaths. These pilgrimages were typically low-key and avoided military symbolism or paraphernalia. Ypres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons to imagine and share the <b>sufferings</b> <b>of</b> their men and gain a spiritual benefit; the Ypres League was established by veterans, and sought to transform the horrors of trench warfare into a purifying spiritual quest. The Menin Gate memorial became a focal point for British pilgrims to the Western front after it was opened in 1927. Pilgrims could come long distances: in the 1920s Canadians began to journey to Vimy and Australians began visiting Gallipoli from 1925 onwards, bringing back military souvenirs relics.|$|E

25|$|Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees {{death as}} {{pollution}} and regards {{life as the}} realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility {{for being able to}} relieve human suffering while refusing to do so.
