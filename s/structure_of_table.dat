40|$|When the {{database}} tables are concerned, alterations in the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>table</b> attributes {{have a direct}} impact on the edit fields those are used in database application software (e. g., Web pages, application software). In case when any of the attributes are changed, it becomes necessary for software or Web pages to be recompiled following the changes made in edit fields. This process of recompilation is a long and costly operation, which means a temporary pause for transactions. For this reason, that it causes important loss in financial sector. Besides, the maxim of the software engineering is that the final product should require the least updating. This study offers an object and component that aims to remove the necessity for the recompilation of application software following the amendments made in the attributes. This component is a contribution to software development and maintenance for it is capable of automatically obtaining the data of domain for the attributes in database tables and controlling the data entrance process.

40|$|Parnas {{together}} {{with a number of}} colleagues established the systematic use of certain kinds <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> as a useful tool in software documentation and inspection with an accessible, multidimensional syntax and intuitive semantics. Previous approaches to formalisation <b>of</b> <b>table</b> semantics based their definitions on the multi-dimensional array <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> and thus achieved close correspondence with the intuitive understanding <b>of</b> <b>tables.</b> In this paper, we argue that a different view, supporting a compositional semantics, is more advantageous for tool support and for reasoning about tables. For this purpose, we also need a compositional table syntax, and we perform an analysis <b>of</b> <b>table</b> syntax that leads us to a particular compositional view <b>of</b> <b>table</b> <b>structure.</b> This simple, inductive view <b>of</b> the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> allows us to provide highly flexible tools for defining the semantics of tabular expressions.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: a) to {{investigate}} the game temporal structure in high-level table tennis competitions; b) to verify the influence of game evolution in international competitions from 2009 to 2012 (World Table Tennis Championships and the Olympic Games) on game temporal structure; c) to compare game temporal structure according to the phase of competition. Comparisons between the three international tournaments demonstrated that rally duration decreased significantly (p < 0. 05) during the analyzed period (2009 - 2012), while the rest time increased (p < 0. 05) from 2009 to 2011, but decreased (p < 0. 05) from 2011 to 2012. In the competition phase analysis, {{it was found that}} rally duration decreased (p < 0. 05) in the quarterfinals in relation to the semifinals and finals, while the rest time increased (p < 0. 05) from the quarterfinals to semifinals and finals.

40|$|This {{review is}} focused on the present status of X-ray {{crystallography}} and its impact on Chemistry and the life Sciences. The discovery of the DNA double-helix structure from a fibre X-ray diagram in 1953 marked the last century, whereas the human genome project (to be completed in the year 2003, the 50 -th anniversary of Crick 2 ̆ 7 s and Watsons discovery) and the proteomics will open the new millennium. The crystal structure determinations of very complex biological assemblies such as viruses and ribosomes illustrate the power of contemporary X-ray structure analysis. The historical background is given, which touches on some of the important steps from {{the early days of the}} discovery of X-rays. The advanced and new methods and technologies of the modern era, such as third-generation synchrotrons, sensitive area detectors, up-to date Computer technologies with Computer graphics, cryotechniques, micro-crystallization methods, and genetic engineering, ali contributing to the development of X-ray crystallography, are evaluated in separate paragraphs. Some examples that illustrate the power of the methods are selected from the contemporary research in the field. Systematics of known crystal structures of small molecules and macromolecules and their assemblies collected over the years has developed our perception of the nature of the Chemical bond, and the interactions between atoms and molecules, which determine the Chemical, physical, and biological properties. This fundamental knowledge enables structure and property predictions, useful in many branches of Science and technology. A method, starting with the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>table</b> salt, has developed into a very fine tool for looking into complex living systems. Time-resolved crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy are capable of recording biological events and they inform us about the dynamics of enzymes and living cell activities. In combination with bioinformatics, very fast events, recorded experimentally or proposed theoretically, can be interpreted by the methods of molecular dynamics simulations. The vivid interplay of ideas coming from different Scientific fields and technologies has led to Capital discoveries, which have opened roads to new disciplines, such as molecular genetics and molecular medicine. These two branches, in particular, enriched by findings on DNA and protein structures, can provide efficient therapies for many diseases, health prevention, and reduce ageing problems. Our views on the nature of the Chemical bond have been revised and our horizons will be extended and clearer in the years to come. Applying an ethical approach in Science, humanity will learn how to improve the quality of life all over the world...|$|E

In this paper, {{we present a}} robust system which is capable <b>of</b> detecting <b>tables</b> from free style online ink notes and extracting their structure {{so that they can}} be further edited in multiple ways. First, the primitive <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables,</b> i. e., candidates for ruling lines and table bounding boxes, are detected among drawing strokes. Second, the logical <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> is determined by normalizing the table skeletons, identifying the skeleton structure, and extracting the cell contents. The detection process is similar to a decision tree so that invalid candidates can be ruled out quickly. Experimental results suggest that our system is robust and accurate in dealing with tables having complex structure or drawn under complex situations.

40|$|Abstract Tables are a {{ubiquitous}} form of communication. While {{everyone seems}} to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of “tabularity ” remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics <b>of</b> <b>tables.</b> There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display <b>of</b> <b>tables,</b> and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval.

Rounding of entries in statistical <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> counts has been a standard tool for preserving confidentiality of respondent data. Rounding has the disadvantage that the tables may no longer add up as expected. Controlled rounding addresses this problem but in turn introduces new problems. The rounding is no longer to the nearest value which is {{a benefit for the}} confidentiality application. However controlled rounding may not be possible for hierarchical tables or for tables with three or more dimensions. Many heuristics have addressed these problems. A careful analysis <b>of</b> the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> shows how to identify totals for which controlled rounding is always possible. The analysis shows that some choice is possible in the identified totals. The guaranteed rounding may often be extended to other totals depending upon the data in any example...|$|R
