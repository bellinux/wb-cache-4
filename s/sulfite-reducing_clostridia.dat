40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} bacteriological characteristics and shelf life of three formulations of ostrich sausages (linguiças), only differing in lean meat percentage: Formula 1, 100 % ostrich meat; Formula 2, 75 % ostrich meat + 25 % pork; and Formula 3, 50 % ostrich meat + 25 % pork + 25 % chicken. All linguiças were vacuum-packed and stored at 5 ± 2 ºC. Mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, <b>sulfite-reducing</b> <b>Clostridia,</b> coagulase-positive Staphylococci, and Escherichia coli were enumerated and Salmonella spp were isolated and identified. Initial mesophilic and psychotropic bacteria counts were high. During storage time, <b>sulfite-reducing</b> <b>Clostridia,</b> coagulase-positive Staphylococci, and Escherichia colicounts never reached the tolerance limit established by the Brazilian legislation. However, Salmonellawas isolated from a Formula 2 sample on day 1, therefore, it was considered inappropriate for consumption. The shelf lives of Formulas 1 and 3 were below 12 and 8 days, respectively. If initial bacterial counts had been lower, the shelf life of the evaluated formulas would probably be longer. This study showed that ostrich meat trimmings can be successfully used in the production of ostrich linguiças, and that the formula containing ostrich meat as the only source of lean meat presented the longest shelf life...|$|E

This study was carried out to investigate the influence of traditional fish processing on the nutritional and microbiological qualities. To this effect, some physico-chemical characteristics (moisture, proteins, fats, TBA index, total ash, minerals) were determined for fresh, smoked-dried and sun dried flesh of three fish species (Tilapia nilotica, Silurus glanis and Arius parkii) while food-spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, fecal streptococci, <b>sulfite-reducing</b> <b>clostridia</b> and moulds) were screened on the same samples. Results showed that moisture content varied between 81. 49 ± 0. 35 and 84. 33 ± 1. 28 g/ 100 g for fresh fish; between 7. 58 ± 1. 13 and 8. 95 ± 1. 73 g/ 100 g for smoked-dried fish and between 11. 5 ± 0. 71 and 14. 06 ± 2. 11 g/ 100 g for sun-dried fish. For total ash, values as high as 8. 13 ± 1. 55 - 9. 86 ± 0. 24 g/ 100 g were recorded in smoked-dried fish while much lower values were obtained for fresh fish. With regard to protein contents, fresh fish had lower amounts between 18. 81 ± 1. 55 and 21. 23 ± 1. 50 g/ 100 g while smoked-dried had the most important protein content between 69. 10 ± 2. 94 and 75. 72 ± 3. 66 g/ 100 g. All fresh fish samples showed lower fat contents than sun-dried and smoked-dried samples. Most minerals were significantly increased by sun-drying and smoking-drying.

30|$|Clostridium. {{perfringens}} is an obligate anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium, bacilli-shaped and endospore forming. It is {{a member}} of the <b>Sulfite-Reducing</b> <b>Clostridia</b> (SRC) group. C. perfringens has been isolated from sewage by many researchers (Lisle et al. 2004; Ye and Zhang 2011), because it represents 0.5 % of the faecal microflora (Leeming et al. 1998; Payment et al. 2002). Payment and Franco (1993) recommended this bacterium as an indicator for the presence of Giardia cysts in water treatment plants as well as to evaluate the quality of recreational waters (Fujioka 1997). Suresh et al. (1996) confirmed that the use of C. perfringens as well as faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci could serve as an excellent approach for identifying the presence of airborne pathogens and determining their origins or sources associated with the treatment and disposal of wastewater and biosolids.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{bacteriological}} quality of bottled natural mineral waters sold in Hungary because, in recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in consumer demand for these products in the country. In total, 492 samples of domestic and imported brands of carbonated and non-carbonated mineral waters (246 samples each) were purchased from retail outlets, and were then screened for the presence of the following indicator and potentially pathogenic bacteria: spore-forming <b>sulfite-reducing</b> anaerobes (<b>clostridia),</b> total coliforms. Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) were also determined by incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h and at 22 degrees C for 72 h. The data generated were compared to the reference criteria set by Directive 2009 / 54 /EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters. The results showed that 5. 3 % and 10. 2 % of the carbonated and non-carbonated mineral water samples tested, respectively, were positive for at least one of the specific indicator or potentially pathogenic bacteria. Overall, a total of 38 sample units (7. 7 %) failed to comply with the standards set by Directive 2009 / 54 /EC. None of the samples were judged noncompliant with current regulations on the basis of the presence of HPC bacteria at levels reaching or exceeding the acceptability limit (i. e., 100 CFU/ml at 22 degrees C or 20 CFU/ml at 37 degrees C) because the analyses were not carried out within 12 h after bottling, as required by Directive 2009 / 54 /EC. The findings of this study highlight the need for a more stringent self-control by some producers of mineral water. In addition, a more systematic surveillance by the official authorities of food control is also necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Crohn’s disease (CD) is an {{inflammatory}} bowel disease that is characterised by chronic relapsing inflammation of the digestive tract. There is a significant body of evidence that suggests the intestinal mucosal microbiome interacts with the immune response to produce pathological inflammation and together these factors {{play a major role}} in the pathogenesis of CD. The aim of this study is to investigate interactions between the human intestinal mucosal transcriptome and mucosal microbiome using multivariate redundancy analysis on microarray datasets. Methods: DNA and RNA were extracted from the same mucosal biopsies collected from CD patients (terminal ileum: n= 5 from sites with active disease, n= 4 from inactive sites (tissue with normal histology); colon: n= 8 from active and n= 6 from inactive sites). RNA was used to study the human intestinal mucosal transcriptome (Affymetrix GeneChip® Exon 1. 0 ST arrays) and DNA was used to study the resident microbiota using a custom phylogenetic microarray. The latter was designed using published gastrointestinal microbiota 16 S rRNA sequences with ~ 40 -mer oligonucleotides targeting 765 bacterial species. Through examining the expression arrays, 30 differentially expressed inflammatory response genes of interest were selected. Correlations between expression patterns for these genes were assessed. Representatives (TNFRSF 1 B, IL 2 RA, IL 8) of three groups of inflammatory genes with highly correlated expression and three uncorrelated genes of interest (CXCL 11, IL- 13 RA 1 and TIRAP) were used. Multivariate relationships between the expression of the six representative inflammatory response genes and the abundance of microbial species in colon or terminal ileum, in patients with active or inactive disease was examined using redundancy analysis using the vegan package in R 1. Correlations between the expression of individual inflammatory response genes and the abundance of individual microbes were also investigated. Results: There appears to be a significant relationship between changes in the abundance of some microbial species in intestinal mucosa with active disease and the expression of the six representative inflammatory response genes. However, this was not the case in the normal (inactive) mucosa of these patients. Where there was active disease the expression of the six genes were predicted by members of the <b>sulfite-reducing</b> bacteria <b>Clostridia</b> class (p-value 0. 02 - 0. 005) in the colon, and the Betaproteobacteria (p-value 0. 02) and Clostridia (p-value 0. 03) class members in the ileum. In the normal (inactive) mucosa of CD patients, there were no bacterial species that significantly predicted the expression of inflammatory immune response genes. There was also some evidence that the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL 8, predicted changes in the abundance of microbes in inactive colon (p-value 0. 04) and that TIRAP (toll-Il 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein), involved in the innate immune system’s recognition of microbial pathogens, was predictive of the pattern of microbial abundance in active ileum (p-value 0. 05).

40|$|The {{capability}} of clostridia spores {{to act as}} pathogen indicators in sewage sludge treatment was investigated. <b>Sulfite-reducing</b> <b>clostridia</b> and E. coli levels were monitored during waste activated sludge pre-treatments (alkali and ultrasound) and its subsequent mesophilic anaerobic digestion. E. coli was maintained or reduced depending on treatment type and intensity. However, alkali pre-treatment (35. 3  gNaOH/kg TS) by itself and alkali (157  gNaOH/kg TS) and ultrasound (27, 000  kJ/kg TS) pre-treatments followed by anaerobic digestion provoked reproducible clostridia increases. Specifically, up to 2. 7  log after 35. 3  gNaOH/kg TS pre-treatment and up to 1. 9 and 1. 1  log after digesting the 157  gNaOH/kg TS and 27, 000  kJ/kg TS pre-treated sludge, respectively. Having rejected the hypotheses of sporulation and floc dissipation, the most plausible explanation for these clostridia increases is re-growth.

Similar trends were observed in sludge and sewage. The effects of thermal treatment on various phages belonging to the three groups mentioned above and on various enteroviruses added to sewage were also studied. The results revealed that the variability in the resistance of phages agreed with the data obtained with the naturally occurring populations and that the phages that were studied were more resistant to heat treatment than the enteroviruses that were studied.

All samples were found to meet the European Legislation, but some didn’t meet the requirements of the PDO specifications. Concerning the floral origin of honey, our results showed the prevalence of rosemary (Lavandula pedunculata) pollen. The microbiological quality of all the analyzed samples was satisfactory, since fecal coliforms, <b>sulfite-reducing</b> <b>clostridia</b> and Salmonella were absent, and molds and yeasts were detected in low counts. Significant differences between the results were studied using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s HSD test.

All of these analyses followed official methodology. The physicochemical analyses indicated that a fraction of 60 % (6 / 10) of evaluated brands were in disagreement with Brazilian legislation in, at least, one of analyzed parameters. Respecting to microbiological results, it was verified the presence of filamentous fungi and yeasts in five brands of honey; total coliforms and E. coli in two brands, and absence of any other microorganisms in all evaluated brands. Simultaneous presence of filamentous fungi and yeasts with total coliforms and E. coli was observed in one sample.

We have evaluated microbial discharge events reported in the river Göta älv, which is used for raw water supply {{to the city of}} Göteborg. Elevated levels of faecal indicator bacteria were observed during periods of closed raw water intake. High bacteria levels were, however, also occasionally detected during periods of open intake, probably as a result of microbial discharge far upstream in the river which may be difficult to predict and manage by closing the intake. Accumulated upstream precipitations, resulting in surface runoff and wastewater contaminations in the catchment, correlated positively with the levels of total coliforms, E. coli, intestinal enterococci and <b>sulfite-reducing</b> <b>clostridia.</b> Levels of faecal indicator organisms were negatively correlated to the water temperature due to enhanced survival at lower temperatures. Wastewater discharges from a municipality located just upstream of the water intake resulted in elevated E. coli concentrations downstream at the raw water intake for Göteborg.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{quality control}} of {{wastewater}} treatments was monitored using selected novel and classical physicochemical and microbiological indicators, and the associations of the treatments with the effluents was analyzed. The microbiological indicators monitored were heterotrophic plate count (HPC), total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococci (FS), <b>sulfite-reducing</b> <b>clostridia</b> (SRC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella spp. The stages of wastewater treatment also were evaluated through determination of ammonia; {{biological oxygen demand}} (BOD 5); chemical oxygen demand (COD); chloride; conductivity; suspended dissolved and total solids; fats; nitrate, nitrite, and total nitrogen; pH; phosphate and total phosphorus. Additional indicators included the Escherichia coli growth inhibition (IGEC) bioassay for assessing whole effluent toxicity, spectral determinations between wavelengths (�) 190 – 650 nm, and total (TP) and soluble (SP) protein contents. Of the more common physicochemical parameters, only BOD 5, COD, suspended and total solids, and fats showed a statistically significant reduction between raw water and effluent; for the microbiological indicators, significant reduction was seen only for HPC, FC, and Ps. aeruginosa.

40|$|Of 98 {{suspected}} food-borne Clostridium perfringens isolates {{obtained from}} a nationwide survey by the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority in The Netherlands, 59 strains were identified as C. perfringens type A. Using PCR-based techniques, the cpe gene encoding enterotoxin was detected in eight isolates, showing a chromosomal location for seven isolates and a plasmid location for one isolate. Further characterization of these strains by using (GTG) 5 fingerprint repetitive sequence-based PCR analysis distinguished C. perfringens from other <b>sulfite-reducing</b> <b>clostridia</b> but did not allow for differentiation between various types of C. perfringens strains. To characterize the C. perfringens strains further, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed on eight housekeeping genes of both enterotoxic and non-cpe isolates, and the data were combined with a previous global survey covering strains associated with food poisoning, gas gangrene, and isolates from food or healthy individuals. This revealed that the chromosomal cpe strains (food strains and isolates from food poisoning cases) belong to a distinct cluster that is significantly distant {{from all the other}} cpe plasmid-carrying and cpe-negative strains. These results suggest that different groups of C. perfringens have undergone niche specialization and that a distinct group of food isolates has specific core genome sequences.

Water activity, pH and NaCl content were monitored in order to evaluate the possibility of L. monocytogenes growth. Challenge test for L. monocytogenes was performed in soft whey cheese, to determine the growth potential of pathogen during the shelf-life of product. All analyzed cheeses were compliant with microbiological criteria during the shelf-life. In soft cheeses, lactic acid bacteria increased in the course of the shelf-life period (1. 2 - 2. 6 log increase), while in semi-hard and hard cheeses it decreased (1. 6 and 5. 2 log decrease, respectively). Soft cheeses support the growth of L. monocytogenes according to determined pH values (5. 8 - 6. 5), water activity (0. 99 - 0. 94), and NaCl content (0. 3 - 1. 2 %). Challenge test showed that L. monocytogenes growth potential in selected soft cheese was 0. 43 log 10 cfu/g during 8 days at 4 °C. Water activity in semi-hard and hard cheeses was a limiting factor for Listeria growth during the shelf-life.

40|$|The {{development}} of treatment processes {{to reduce or}} reuse sewage sludge is crucial for a proper environmental management. Segregating primary from secondary sludge allows for better reuse of secondary sludge, since digested secondary sludge is better suited for agricultural application, containing about double concentration in nutrients but significantly less contaminants. However, secondary sludge (also called waste activated sludge (WAS)) is difficult to dewater compared with primary sludge due {{to the existence of}} colloidal materials and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), which strongly retain water. WAS is also more difficult to digest under anaerobic conditions due to the presence of glycan strands in microbial cell walls. The low dewaterability and digestibility of WAS can be improved by applying treatments, which can partially disintegrate the WAS by disrupting flocs and cells and solubilising the EPSs. The treatments studied in this thesis were ultrasound, low-temperature thermal and alkali with NaOH. Specifically, it has been analysed the effect of the aforementioned treatment on WAS rheology, dewatering, hygienisation and anaerobic digestion. Rheology is the study of stress-strain relationships of viscoelastic materials. All the sludges analysed (untreated and treated) behaved as non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids, which indicates that the viscosity decreases with the applied shear rate. The sludges were also thixotropic (showing a hysteresis area in the plot of stress versus shear rate), which means that the viscosity is time dependent. The three aforementioned treatments resulted in the reduction of the steady state viscosity and the hysteresis area. Complementarily, a rheological structural model was proposed to examine the variations in the thixotropic behaviour of WAS after the application of the treatments. Sludge dewatering is essential to obtain a product dry enough to allow a reduction in storage volume. The three conditions of the thermal treatment (60, 80 and 90 ºC; 1 h, including the heating time to reach the temperature) and the higher intensities of ultrasound (27, 000 kJ/kg TS) and alkali (157 g NaOH/kg TS) treatments improved sludge dewatering by centrifugation. To further evaluate the effect of treatments on the sludge dewatering, the EPSs contained in sludge were extracted and characterised. The EPSs were fractionated to generate two different EPS fractions: loosely bound EPSs (LB-EPSs) and tightly bound EPSs (TB-EPSs), where the latter is the innermost fraction and harder to release. An analysis of the untreated sludge revealed that the proteins, followed by the humic acids and polysaccharides, were the major constituents of the EPSs. Each of these components was primarily observed in the TB-EPS fraction. The treatments, particularly the alkali treatment, thoroughly solubilised the EPS, as indicated by the increase in the TOC, protein, humic acid and polysaccharide contents in the LB-EPS fraction. As a result, the dewaterability of WAS was improved. Hygienisation of the sludge is of uttermost importance if the sludge is intended for agriculture. The level of hygienisation was evaluated using three indicator organisms: Escherichia coli, somatic coliphages (SOMCPH) and spores of <b>sulfite-reducing</b> <b>clostridia</b> (SSRC). The thermal treatment at 80 ºC and the alkali treatment at 157 g NaOH kg TS allowed the hygienisation of the sludge, thus satisfying normal levels accepted by the EPA and the 3 rd official draft from the EU. Conversely, the conditions tested for the ultrasound treatment barely reduced the levels of microbial indicators. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion is a widely used method to stabilise the sludge. The alkali pre-treatment (157 g NaOH/kg TS) exhibited the greatest methane production increase (34 %) followed by the ultrasonication (27, 000 kJ/kg TS; 13 %), whereas the thermal pre-treatment (80 ºC, 15 min) presented a methane potential similar to the untreated sludge. However, the use of NaOH as a pre-treatment is rather limited because of the rising sodium concentration in the digester. El desarrollo de procesos para la reducción o reutilización de los lodos resulta determinante para una apropiada gestión medioambiental. Tratando por separado el lodo activado del primario (y no la mezcla como suele hacerse) se favorece el uso del lodo activado en agricultura tras su digestión, ya que el lodo activado contiene el doble de nutrientes y menor carga contaminante que el primario. No obstante, el lodo activado (también denominado lodo secundario o biológico) es más difícil de deshidratar que el primario, ya que presenta una estructura interna organizada de flóculos unidos por las sustancias poliméricas extracelulares (EPSs, por sus siglas en inglés), las cuales atrapan el agua. En este contexto, la reología, que es la ciencia que estudia las relaciones entre la fuerza y la deformación de los materiales, es una herramienta muy útil para la caracterización de la viscosidad o estructura interna de los lodos. El lodo activado es también más difícil de digerir anaeróbicamente debido a las cadenas de glicanos presentes en las paredes celulares de las bacterias. En resumen, para poder deshidratar y digerir un lodo activado será necesario acondicionarlo previamente mediante tratamientos, con el fin de solubilizar las EPSs y aumentar su biodegradabilidad. Si además el lodo quiere destinarse a agricultura deberá estar higienizado. En esta tesis se ha estudiado el efecto de tres tratamientos (ultrasonido, térmico a baja temperatura y alcalino con NaOH) sobre la reología, deshidratación, higienización y digestión anaerobia de lodos activados. Los tres tratamientos redujeron considerablemente la viscosidad del lodo debido a la solubilización de la las EPSs. Así mismo, la solubilización de la EPSs facilitó la expulsión del agua confinada dentro de los flóculos del lodo, mejorando la deshidratación mediante centrifugación. El tratamiento alcalino con dosis de NaOH elevadas fue el que más EPSs solubilizó, de manera que fue el que permitió extraer más agua y el que más aumentó la producción de metano, además de higienizar el lodo. No obstante, este tratamiento tiene el inconveniente de incrementar la concentración de sodio en el digestor, lo cual podría llegar a inhibir el proceso de digestión. Los ultrasonidos redujeron notablemente la viscosidad, además de mejorar la deshidratación y la digestión del lodo. Sin embargo, este tratamiento no fue capaz de higienizar el lodo. El tratamiento térmico a baja temperatura aumentó muy ligeramente la producción de metano (posiblemente debido al corto tiempo de exposición) y permitió deshidratar e higienizar el lodo...|$|E
