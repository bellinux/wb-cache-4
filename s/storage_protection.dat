50|$|San José Island Kangaroo Rats utilize burrows {{for food}} <b>storage,</b> <b>protection</b> {{from the sun}} and predators, breeding, and shelter. Dipodomys insularis creates burrows that are {{underground}} tunnels networked together with one or more entrance points. They each use 1 or 2 burrows and no more than 2 rodents inhabit each burrow. Burrows containing the opposite sex are usually found closer in distance than those that contain D. insularis of same sex. Most often, during breeding season, a male and female share a burrow. After giving birth the females were found sharing their burrows with their offspring as well. Adult San José Island Kangaroo Rats seem less prone to sharing burrows than do subadults, unless it is with the opposite sex during mating season.|$|E
50|$|The NACDA Program on Aging began over 30 {{years ago}} under the {{sponsorship}} of the United States Administration on Aging (AoA) homepage. At that time NACDA {{was seen as a}} novel experiment - neither the concept of a research archive devoted to aging issues nor the idea of making research data freely available to the public were well established. Over the years, NACDA’s mission has changed both in scope and in direction. Originally conceived as a storehouse for data, NACDA has aggressively pursued a role of increasing involvement in the research community by actively promoting and distributing data. In 1984, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) homepage became the sponsor of the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging, and NACDA has flourished under its support. Over the years, NACDA has evolved and grown in response to changes in technology. In many instances, leading the pace of change in methodology related to the <b>storage,</b> <b>protection,</b> and distribution of data.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to faster components, two significant design improvements were incorporated: base registers and additional hardware instructions. The two 18-bit base registers (one for instruction storage {{and one for}} data storage) permitted dynamic relocation: as a program got swapped {{in and out of}} main memory, its instructions and data could be placed anywhere each time it got reloaded. To support multiprogramming, the 1108 had memory protection using two base and limit registers, with 512-word resolution. One was called the I-bank or instruction bank, and the other the D-bank or data bank. If the I-bank and D-bank of a program were put into different physical banks of memory, a 1/2 microsecond advantage accrued, called [...] "alternate bank timing." [...] The 1108 also introduced the Processor State Register, or PSR. In {{addition to}} controlling the Base Registers, it included various control [...] "bits" [...] that enabled the various <b>Storage</b> <b>Protection</b> features, allowed selection of either the User or Exec set of A, X & R registers, and enabled [...] "Guard Mode" [...] for user programs. Guard Mode prevented user programs from execution of Executive Only [...] "privileged" [...] instructions, and from accessing memory locations outside the program's allocated memory.|$|E
40|$|The {{growing number}} of storage {{security}} breaches {{as well as the}} need to adhere to government regulations is driving the need for greater <b>storage</b> <b>protection.</b> However, there is the lack of a comprehensive process to designing <b>storage</b> <b>protection</b> solutions. Designing protection for storage systems is best done by utilizing proactive system engineering rather than reacting with ad hoc countermeasures to the latest attack du jour. The purpose of threat modeling is to organize system threats and vulnerabilities into general classes to be addressed with known <b>storage</b> <b>protection</b> techniques. Although there has been prior work on threat modeling primarily for software applications, to our knowledge this is the first attempt at domain-specific threat modeling for storage systems. We discuss protection challenges unique to storage systems and propose two di#erent processes to creating a threat model for storage systems: one based on classical security principles (Confidentiality, I ntegrity, Availability, Authentication, or CIAA) and another based on the Data Lifecycle Model. It is our hope that this initial work will start a discussion on how to better design and implement <b>storage</b> <b>protection</b> solutions against storage threats...|$|E
40|$|Modern storage {{systems are}} {{responsible}} for increasing amounts of data {{and the value of}} the data itself is growing in importance. Several primary storage system solutions have emerged for the protection of data: (1) Secure Storage through Cryptography, (2) Backup and Versioning Systems, (3) Immutable and Tamper-Proof Storage, and (4) Redundant Storage. Using results from published studies, we compare these four solutions against different requirements highlighting trade-offs in performance, space, attack resistance, and cost. We also present a case study of applying these solutions based on design work at NCSA. Lastly, we conclude that while different <b>storage</b> <b>protection</b> solutions may be appropriate for different requirements, some general conclusions can be made about current state-ofthe -art <b>storage</b> <b>protection</b> solutions as well as directions for future research...|$|E
