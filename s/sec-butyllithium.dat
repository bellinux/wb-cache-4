It is, however, so basic that its use requires greater care than for n-BuLi.

50|$|Common metalation {{reagents}} are the butyllithiums. tert-Butyllithium and <b>sec-butyllithium</b> {{are generally}} more reactive and have better selectivity than n-butyllithium, however, they are also more expensive and difficult to handle. Metalation is a common way of preparing versatile organolithium reagents. The position of metalation is mostly controlled by the acidity of the C-H bond. Lithiation often occurs at a position α to electron withdrawing groups, since they are good at stabilizing the electron-density of the anion. Directing groups on aromatic compounds and heterocycles provide regioselective sites of metalation, and directed ortho metelation is an important class of metalation reactions. Metalated sulfones, acyl groups and α-metalated amides are important intermediates in chemistry synthesis. Metalation of allyl ether with alkyllithium or LDA forms an anion α to the oxygen, and can proceed to 2,3-Wittig rearrangement. Addition of donor ligands such as TMEDA and HMPA can increase metalation rate and broaden substrate scope. Chiral organolithium reagents can be accessed through asymmetric metalation.|$|E
5000|$|Lithium-halogen {{exchange}} is very useful in preparing new organolithium reagents. Exchange rates usually follow the trend I > Br > Cl. Alkyl- and arylfluoride are generally unreactive toward organolithium reagents. Lithium halogen {{exchange is}} kinetically controlled, {{and the rate}} of exchange is primarily influenced by the stabilities of the carbanion intermediates (sp > sp2 > sp3) of the organolithium reagents. [...] For example, the more basic tertiary organolithium reagents (usually n-butyllithium, <b>sec-butyllithium</b> or tert-butyllithium) are the most reactive, and will react with primary alkyl halide (usually bromide or iodide) to form the more stable organolithium species. Therefore, lithium halogen exchange is most frequently used to prepare vinyl- aryl- and primary alkyllithium reagents. Lithium halogen exchange is also facilitated when alkoxy groups or heteroatoms are present to stabilize the carbanion, and this method is especially useful for the preparation of functionalized lithium reagents which cannot tolerate the harsher conditions required for reduction with lithium metal. Substrates such as vinyl halides usually undergo lithium-halogen exchange with retention of the stereochemistry of the double bond.|$|E
5000|$|Aldehyde substituents suffer {{nucleophilic}} addition in {{the presence}} of organolithium compounds; however, adducts of aldehydes with lithium diamines can serve as effective directing groups for lateral lithiation. Subsequent treatment with an electrophilic primary alkyl halide and elimination of the diamine provides functionalized aryl aldehydes.(4)Tertiary amides are highly effective directing groups. After treatment of the resulting benzylic anion with an aldehyde, cyclization leads to lactones. Carboxamides, in which the amide is attached to the aromatic ring through nitrogen rather than carbon, are also effective directing groups.(5)Related O-aryl carbamates are good directing groups; upon warming, the resulting organolithiums undergo rearrangement to benzylic amides (the Snieckus-Fries rearrangement) via migration of the carbonyl carbon from oxygen to carbon.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new method}} to prepare polypropylene-graft-polystyrene {{copolymers}} with tailored structure has been developed. The {{ability of a}} series of copolymers with variable structure to compatibilize the polypropylene-polystyrene blends was evaluated through microscopic observation of the morphology of the blends. The synthesis is a two-step process, the first one being the preparation, in the presence of ansa-zirconocene-based catalyst, of the backbones formed by i-PP sequences spaced by p-methylstyreneethylene units. In the second step, the methyl groups in the aromatic rings are reacted with <b>sec-butyllithium,</b> and the resulting metalated polymers allowed to add the styrene to initiate the side polystyrene chains growth. This synthesis turns out versatile both in the first step because by changing monomers feed ratio, backbones with different number of the sites of growth of the grafts and with different length of the polypropylene sequences can be obtained, and in the last step because, by tuning styrene concentration and reaction time, the side chains length can be regulated.

The morphologies of the blends, analyzed and compared by scanning electron microscopy, suggest that the compatibility of PP/PS blends is improved with increasing either the PP sequences length or the PS side chains length or the number of the side chains in the PP-g-PS copolymer...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of α-cumylpotassium and cyclohexene oxide produces trans-cumylcyclohexanol in high yield {{in the presence}} of excess cumene. Reactions of 1. 1 and 2. 0 equivalents of cumene with one equivalent of n-butylpotassium to make α-cumylpotassium were shown to take several days to reach a maximum yield in the subsequent {{reaction of}} α-cumylpotassium and cyclohexene oxide. Although it was initially hypothesized that the high yield was attributed to the interaction of the potassium with the aromatic rings of the α-cumyl anion and the excess cumene, which was confirmed by molecular modeling studies, these reactions demonstrated that no large excess of aromatic solvents were needed. Substituting benzene and tert-butylbenzene for cumene in this reaction gave lower yields of product. ^ Cyclohexene oxide reacted with n-butylpotassium to unexpectedly produce 2 -butylcyclohexanone in a 2 % isolated yield or in a 10 % isolated yield of its semi-carbazone derivative. Based on the literature, we hypothesized that we produced 2 -butylcyclohexanone by first opening the epoxide ring of cyclohexene oxide by SN 2 substitution with n-butylpotassium to give the alkoxide of trans- 2 -butylcyclohexan- 1 -ol as observed in the reaction of cyclohexene oxide and α-cumylpotassium. Next, a second equivalent of n-butylpotassium reacted with cyclohexene oxide to produce a carbene alkoxide. Finally, the carbene alkoxide oxidized the alkoxide of trans- 2 -butylcyclohexan- 1 -ol to 2 -butylcyclohexanone. This mechanism implies that a greater than 33 % yield is not possible. ^ The reaction of 2 -methyl- 1, 2 -epoxycyclohexane with n-butylpotassium and the reaction of cyclohexene oxide with <b>sec-butyllithium</b> did not lead to any ring opening products. ...|$|E
