5|$|Nescopeck Mountain is one {{of several}} {{mountains}} in Columbia County to contain undisturbed oak/mixed hardwood forests. This forest is also an Appalachian Oak Forest. Specific tree species on the ridge in Columbia County include red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black birch, American chestnut, pitch pine, red maple, and <b>serviceberry.</b> Other plants on the ridge include black huckleberry, lowbush blueberry, mountain laurel, sheep's laurel, bracken fern, wild sarsaparilla, and Virginia creeper.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{by their}} need for water, trees such as willows, alders, and ponderosa pines are found only near the monument's streams or springs. <b>Serviceberry</b> bushes and shrubs like {{mountain}} mahogany are found in places where moisture collects near rock slides and ledges. Elsewhere long-rooted rabbitbrush has adapted to survive in dry areas. Other shrubs with adaptive properties include greasewood, sagebrush, shadscale, broom snakeweed, antelope bitterbrush, and purple sage. Western junipers, which have extensive root systems, thrive in the dry climate; {{in the absence of}} periodic fires they tend to displace grasses and sagebrush and to create relatively barren landscapes. The Park Service is considering controlled burning to limit the junipers and to create open areas for bunchgrasses that re-sprout from their roots after a fire.|$|E
25|$|Los quejigares {{can often}} include maples, serbales, European <b>serviceberry</b> or snowy mespilus (Amelanchier ovalis), common privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.) and common dogwood (Cornus sanguinea); their {{degradation}} {{can lead to}} extensive thickets of box.|$|E

25|$|The {{pome fruits}} {{produced}} by plants in subtribe Pyrinae of family Rosaceae, such as apples and pears, have a structure (the core) in which tough tissue clearly separates the seeds {{from the outer}} softer pericarp. However, {{some of the smaller}} pomes are sometimes referred to as berries. Amelanchier pomes become so soft at maturity that they resemble a blueberry and are known as Juneberries, <b>serviceberries</b> or Saskatoon berries.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, PHNA reached an {{agreement}} with KC Parks & Recreation to plant an orchard on the vacant lot at Lexington and Montgall. In addition to providing fresh fruit and nuts for the neighborhood, this orchard will also provide a history lesson - the selected tree varieties represent trees grown in Northeast Kansas City {{as far back as}} 1860. Varieties include peaches, apples, figs, pecans, pawpaws, <b>serviceberries</b> and more.|$|R
25|$|Hobblebush and <b>serviceberry</b> {{are common}} shrubs {{at the higher}} elevations. Vascular plants {{to be found in}} the forest understorys include several fern {{varieties}} (predominantly woodfern and hay-scented), stinging nettle and jewelweed. trillium, wood sorrel, clintonia, bunchberry, starflower and foamflower round out the biome for the flowering plants.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{founding}} of the city, the area was mostly prairie and open forest. Native Americans maintained this environment, good for hunting, by burning underbrush. Trees are mainly oak, maple, and hickory, similar to the forests of the nearby Ozarks; common understory trees include eastern redbud, <b>serviceberry,</b> and flowering dogwood. Riparian areas are forested with mainly American sycamore.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} dacha fruits in cool {{temperate}} regions of Russia are apple, blackcurrant, redcurrant, gooseberry, raspberry and strawberry (sometimes also sour cherry, downy cherry, plum, pear, sea-buckthorn, Actinidia kolomikta, black chokeberry, <b>serviceberry,</b> sweetberry honeysuckle, blackberry and grape, {{but many of}} them are either rare or not hardy enough and require winter protection). Popular vegetables and herbs are potato, cucumber, zucchini, pumpkin, tomato, carrot, beetroot, cabbage, cauliflower, radish, turnip, onion, garlic, dill, parsley, rhubarb and sorrel.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit of}} several species are {{excellent}} to eat raw, tasting somewhat like a blueberry, strongly accented by the almond-like flavour of the seeds. Selections from Amelanchier alnifolia {{have been chosen}} for fruit production, with several named cultivars. Other cultivars appear {{to be derived from}} hybridization between A. alnifolia and A. stolonifera. Propagation is by seed, divisions, and grafting. <b>Serviceberries</b> graft so readily that grafts onto other genera, such as Crataegus and Sorbus, are often successful.|$|R
50|$|In {{summer and}} fall, thimbleberries, salal, raspberries, salmonberries, {{trailing}} blackberries, <b>serviceberries,</b> strawberries, huckleberries, {{and others were}} foraged. The berries were eaten fresh, or dried and formed into cakes to preserve them for winter. Mixed with dried fish and oil in recipes, pemmican made hearty late winter fare or compact, hardy provision for travel. Women and children would gather important wetland plants such as cattails for mats and wapato ("Indian potatoes") for food. Crayfish and freshwater mussels were available in the lake.|$|R
25|$|Favorite fruits dried {{for winter}} were <b>serviceberries</b> or ″kel″ (Amelanchier alnifolia or Saskatoon berry), black huckleberries or ″cemi'tk″ (Vaccinium membranaceum), red {{elderberries}} or ″mi'ttip″ (Sambucus racemosa var. melanocarpa), and chokecherries or ″ti'ms″ (Prunus virginiana var. melanocarpa). Nez Perce textiles were made primarily from dogbane or ″qeemu″ (Apocynum cannabinum or Indian hemp), tules or ″to'ko″ (Schoenoplectus acutus var. acutus), and western redcedar or ″tala'tat″ (Thuja plicata). The most important industrial woods were redcedar, ponderosa pine or ″la'qa″ (Pinus ponderosa), Douglas fir or ″pa'ps″ (Pseudotsuga menziesii), sandbar willow or ″tax's″ (Salix exigua), and hard woods such as Pacific yew or ″ta'mqay″ (Taxus brevifolia) and syringa or ″sise'qiy″ (Philadelphus lewisii or Indian arrowwood).|$|R
25|$|At the time, scurvy was well-recognized, {{but there}} was a lack of clear {{understanding}} of how to prevent the disease. Nevertheless, pioneers' consumption of the wild berries (including chokeberry, gooseberry, and <b>serviceberry)</b> and currants that grew along the trail (particularly along the Platte River) and were consumed, helped make scurvy infrequent. Marcy's guide correctly suggested that the consumption of wild grapes, greens, and onions could help prevent the disease and that if vegetables were not available, citric acid could be drunk with sugar and water.|$|E
25|$|Their staples {{included}} huckleberry, salmon, {{and roots}} (camas, bitterroot), {{but they also}} ate black moss, other berries (<b>serviceberry,</b> gooseberry, and foam berry), hazelnuts, wild carrots, peppermint, and various game meats (deer, elk, moose, caribou, rabbit, mountain sheep, mountain goat, and bear; after {{the coming of the}} horse, they also ventured east after bison). They chewed pine pitch like gum, and had a range of herbal medicines. Starting in June, mature salmon arrived at Kettle Falls, the farthest downriver that the Sinixt territory extended. The Sinixt caught only the salmon that were not strong enough to clear the falls, ensuring that the strongest went on to spawn. Both bands traveled to Red Mountain near Rossland, B.C. to harvest huckleberries in August. These seasonal events figured prominently in their culture. They hunted in late autumn, but still often were short of food by late winter.|$|E

60|$|A year's {{residence}} {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia, and various expeditions in the interior, had now given the Astorians some idea of the country. The whole coast is described as remarkably rugged and mountainous; with dense forests of hemlock, spruce, white and red cedar, cotton-wood, white oak, white and swamp ash, willow, and a few walnut. There is likewise an undergrowth of aromatic shrubs, creepers, and clambering vines, that render the forests almost impenetrable; together with berries of various kinds, such as gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, both red and yellow, very large and finely flavored whortleberries, cranberries, <b>serviceberries,</b> blackberries, currants, sloes, and wild and choke cherries.|$|R
50|$|Remote {{areas of}} uplands, bogs, wetlands, muskegs, rivers, streams, pine savannas, meadows and many glacial lakes are found {{throughout}} these forests. Native tree species include Acer saccharum (sugar maple), Acer rubrum (red maple), and Acer spicatum (mountain maple), white, red, and black oaks, aspen, beech, basswood, sumac, and paper, yellow, and river birch. Coniferous trees, including red, white, and jack pine, white spruce and balsam fir are abundant {{due to a}} dense second growth. Eastern hemlock are also present as this is the westernmost limit of its distribution. Tamarack/black spruce bogs, cedar swamps and alder thickets are common. Blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, <b>serviceberries,</b> ferns, mosses, cattails, and mushrooms also grow here, {{as well as many}} more shrubs and wildflowers.|$|R
50|$|These are {{arboreal}} {{birds that}} breed in northern forests (Witmer and Avery 2003). Their main food is fruit, which they eat from early summer (strawberries, mulberries, and <b>serviceberries)</b> through {{late summer and}} fall (raspberries, blackberries, cherries, and honeysuckle berries) into late fall and winter (juniper berries, grapes, crabapples, mountain-ash fruits, rose hips, cotoneaster fruits, dogwood berries, and mistletoe berries) (MacKinnon and Phillipps 2000, Witmer and Avery 2003). They pluck fruit from a perch or occasionally while hovering. In spring they replace fruit with sap, buds, and flowers. In the warmer {{part of the year}} they catch many insects by gleaning or in midair, and often nest near water where flying insects are abundant.|$|R

50|$|Western tanagers eat fruits (~18%) and a {{wide range}} of insects (~82%). Fruits include {{hawthorn}} apples (Crataegus spp.), raspberries (Rubus spp.), mulberries (Morus spp.), elderberries (Sambucus spp.), <b>serviceberries</b> (Amelanchier spp.), and wild and cultivated cherries (Prunus spp.). Western tanagers have been observed foraging on Perry's agave (Agave parryi) nectar. Reports of western tanager eating Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) nectar, Russian-olive fruits, and human-provided food, including bird seed and dried fruit, were summarized in. Western tanagers are major consumers of western spruce budworms (Choristoneura occidentalis), and they have been observed eating Douglas-fir tussock moth larvae (Orgyia pseudotsugata). Hymenopterans, mostly wasps and ants constituted 75% of insects in western tanager stomachs in August. The other insects were beetles (Coleoptera, 12%), mainly click beetles (Elateridae) and woodborers (Bupestridae), true bugs (Hemipterans, 8%), grasshoppers (Orthoptera, 4%) and caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 2%).|$|R
40|$|Each of {{the four}} broad forest types, often called associations, that you will read about in these Notes is a complex, highly {{variable}} mixture of trees, shrubs, and herbs. This Note describes the species you will generally find in each type. This upland type is the most widespread and currently covers the greatest area. The great range of climate, soils, and topography over which it occurs results {{in a wide variety}} of species. Oaks dominate with white, black, scarlet, and northern red being most abundant throughout the central hardwood forest. Post oak and blackjack oak occur frequently in the western part of the area and chestnut oak may be important in the eastern part of the region. Other oaks that may also be present are southern red, chinkapin, bur, and northern pin. Everywhere hickories are a minor but consistent component. Other important overstory tree species that may be present include black gum, yellow-poplar, red and sugar maples, white ash, elms, American beech, black walnut, and occasionally black cherry.

5000|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} large stretches of deciduous forest, especially with oaks, across eastern North America. They can occur, {{with varying degrees}} of success, in young successional woodlands and occasionally in extensive plantings of shade trees in suburban areas, parks, and cemeteries. For a viable breeding population, at least 10 to 12 hectares of forest are required. In winter, scarlet tanagers occur in the montane forest of the Andean foothills. Scarlet tanagers migrate to northwestern South America, passing through Central America around April, and again around October. They begin arriving in the breeding grounds in numbers by about May and already start to move south again in mid-summer; by early October they are all on their way south. The bird is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe.Scarlet tanagers are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight and then returning to the same general perch, in a hunting style known as [...] "sallying". Sometimes, however, they will also capture their prey on the forest floor. They eat mainly insects, and will opportunistically consume fruit when plentiful. Any flying variety of insect will readily be taken when common, such as bees, wasps, hornets, ants, and sawflies; moths and butterflies; beetles; flies; cicadas, leafhoppers, spittlebugs, treehoppers, plant lice, and scale insects; termites; grasshoppers and locusts; dragonflies; and dobsonflies. Scarlet tanagers also takes snails, earthworms and spiders. While summer tanagers are famous for this feeding method, when capturing bees, wasps and hornets, scarlet tanagers also rake the prey against a branch in order to remove their stingers before consumption. Plant components of their diet consists {{of a wide variety of}} fruits that eaten mainly when insects are at population lows including: blackberries (Rubus allegheniensis), raspberries (R. ideaus), huckleberries (Gaylussacia sp.), juneberries and <b>serviceberries</b> (Amelanchier spp.), mulberries (Morus rubra), strawberries (Fragaria virginiana), and chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa).|$|R
