30|$|Also, {{variation}} in the effect of ion irradiation can be observed from the newly developed <b>shoulder</b> (<b>shoulder</b> <b>labeled</b> A) in the XPS spectra along with the increasing of the irradiation energy. The origin of shoulder A is unclear at the moment; however, complex defects previously theoretically predicted [7] {{to be associated with}} Ar+ irradiation might be the reason. In addition, the commonly observed π[*]−[*]π* transition in graphene at binding energy of 290 eV [22] seems to gradually disappear as the irradiation energy is increased, indicating the FLG electronic damage. This is supported by the following further XPS investigations carried out to determine the transition from the sp 2 -bonding to sp 3 -hybridized state as a result of Ar+ ion irradiation.|$|R
