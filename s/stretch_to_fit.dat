Such conversions are indistinguishable from unmodified rifle without careful examination, and can be quite dangerous if fired with the shorter 8×57mm ammunition, as the cartridge case will <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the elongated chamber and possibly rupture in the process, which causes a potentially highly dangerous high pressure propellant gas leakage.

40|$|The Application of Existing Digitally Controlled Flat-Bed Weft Knitting to Fashion Knitwear for the Individual Body Shape of Women, Particularly Those Above UK Standard Sizes The primary {{aim of this}} {{practice}} based research was to develop, for the first time, a new combination of knitting methods which created knitted garments for larger size women that uniquely did not rely on <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> their body shape. Through working with real women, an innovative capsule collection of custom-fitted knitwear toiles incorporating 3 D knitted shape was produced which positively demonstrated the originality, effectiveness and significance ofthe outcomes. This research therefore focused on developing knitwear with an improved fit for the individual body shapes of a cohort of women over a UK size 16. In 2004, publicly available information from SizeUK indicated that the average women's size in the UK was a size 16. However following a literature search, and in conjunction with primary data from this research, it became evident that women over a size 16 were experiencing dissatisfaction with clothing fit. This disjunction formed an early driver for the research idea and helped to form the research framework that spanned three main areas: clothing fit, larger female body shape and mass knitwear manufacture. The research has been necessarily set in the wider context of debates on larger women's self-image and their relationship with fashion. Interviews and an online survey provided primary data on clothing fit, clothing choices, shopping experience, body image, body cathexis and self perception in relation to clothing. A case study research method was developed that resolved ethical issues which arose when working with participants. Prior to knit sampling, a hierarchy of desirable technical and aesthetic knit qualities was established, and a design process comparable to that in industry adopted in order to place this research in a 'real' commercial context. The knitwear was developed from manually acquired measurements and 3 D body scanned data, using specific measurement protocols developed by the research for measuring larger size. Objective and subjective evaluation of the knitwear employing wrinkle-analysis, fit and comfort tests informed a final design development process that ran parallel to commercial examples. Amongst the final outcomes {{of this research is}} a library of visual digital templates derived from the knit programming, which offers a transferable new resource for future industrial developments of this process. Their particular and unique value is to contribute information to the emerging field of mass-customisation of knitwear and larger sized clothing as recommended for EU development by the SERVIVE report of 2010. This research concluded, as a significant contribution to new knowledge in the field of larger sized fashion knitwear, that improving the fit of knitwear for larger women by removing the fit-by-stretch factor (a major style and psychological drawback for these consumers), enhanced wearing experience and enthused the wearer towards the garment.

The experimental results indicate that the proposed method would be easy to implement and could generate patterns with an improved bust girth fit. The purpose of this paper is to show that a new grading system would better serve the female population than the system currently in use. This system would also be more efficient as it would reduce the consumer time spent in fit identification as labelling would also indicate bust cup sizing. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

5000|$|Almost {{all modern}} front-entry boots consist of two sections, one around the foot, and another around the lower leg. These {{are joined by}} rivets/rotating joints near the ankle that allows the leg to pivot forward, {{but not to the}} sides.

Additionally, because the boot clamps across the foot, pulling the sides inward, it is difficult to produce a single design that fits a range of foot shapes and sizes. This leads to shell modification services, when the boot is <b>stretched</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the skier's foot, typically by heating the plastic and pressing it into place.

40|$|Abstract—High density {{memory is}} {{becoming}} more important as many execution streams are consolidated onto single chip many-core processors. DRAM is ubiquitous as a main memory technology, but while DRAM’s per-chip density and frequency continue to scale, {{the time required to}} refresh its dynamic cells has grown at an alarming rate. This paper shows how currently-employed methods to schedule refresh operations are ineffective in mitigating the significant performance degradation caused by longer refresh times. Current approaches are deficient – they do not effectively exploit the flexibility of DRAMs to postpone refresh operations. This work proposes dynamically reconfigurable predictive mechanisms that exploit the full dynamic range allowed in the JEDEC DDRx SDRAM specifications. The proposed mechanisms are shown to mitigate much of the penalties seen with dense DRAM devices. We refer to the overall scheme as Elastic Refresh, in that the refresh policy is <b>stretched</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the currently executing workload, such that the maximum benefit of the DRAM flexibility is realized. We extend the GEMS on SIMICS tool-set to include Elastic Refresh.

40|$|Serum albumin is an {{especially}} reactive molecule, binding {{both positive and negative}} small ions, organic molecules, and even neutral molecules. As such, its role in blood biochemistry is important and pervasive. This Memorandum examines the role of serum albumin with respect to the binding of H+, C 1 - and Ca++. The point of view, following much of the literature, is that the Linderstrom-Lang theory [...] which treats the molecule as a charged sphere [...] can explain the anomalous behavior of serum albumin in acidity region remote from the isoionic point. But is shown, first for H+ and then for C 1 - and a++, that while the charged sphere concept can be <b>stretched</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the laboratory data, the consequent Debye-Huckel parameter bears little relation to the predicted values. The fairly exact calculations of simultaneous events possible with the computer leaves little room for doubt that a much improved theory must be developed. In fact, one conclusion is that this theory is only approximate and that an adequate explanation probably will have to begin with the exact geometry of the molecule and the consequent intramolecular interactions. This latter procedure is almost possible today [...] with increasing knowledge of molecular structure [...] whereas it was not when the farmer theory was promulgated...|$|R

40|$|To {{correlate}} {{the burgeoning}} volume of biostratigraphic information {{available from the}} Silurian rocks of Baltica, it is advantageous to use numerical algorithms. Graphical correlation and related numerical methods routinely incorporate taxon range-ends and bentonites. Bentonites must be matched exactly. Local taxon ranges match or under-represent true ranges and may be <b>stretched</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> hypotheses of correlation. Carbon isotope excursions are better handled as conservative uncertainty intervals – a new data class with properties and freedoms that are the opposite of taxon ranges. Uncertainty intervals match or over-represent truly correlative segments and inflexion points in the local series of isotopic ratios; they may be shrunk <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> correlations between sections. By these means, three fundamentally different kinds of stratigraphic information may be combined in a mutually supportive fashion without over-stating the precision of any of them. When incorporated as uncertainty intervals, Silurian isotopic excursions improve automated construction of inter-regional, ordinal time-lines of taxon first- and last-appearances at both the coarsest and finest resolution. The known succession of a few named excursions helps to stack relatively brief stratigraphic sections into their correct order in longer time-lines. The limits and details of individual excursions support some of the highest-resolution segments of optimized time-lines of individual taxon originations and extinctions. At intermediate scales, local taxon ranges are the unrivalled information source. For the best results, detailed taxon ranges, bentonite analyses and stable isotope time series {{need to be developed}} from the same rocks as often as possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Motif {{patterns}} of maximal saturation emerged originally in contexts of pattern discovery in biomolecular sequences and have recently proven a valuable notion {{also in the}} design of data compression schemes. Informally, a motif is a string of intermittently solid and wild characters that recurs more or less frequently in an input sequence or family of sequences. Motif discovery techniques and tools tend to be computationally imposing, however, special classes of "rigid" motifs have been identified of which the discovery is affordable in low polynomial time. Results In the present work, "extensible" motifs are considered such that each sequence of gaps comes endowed with some elasticity, whereby the same pattern may be <b>stretched</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> segments of the source that match all the solid characters but are otherwise of different lengths. A few applications of this notion are then described. In applications of data compression by textual substitution, extensible motifs are seen to bring savings {{on the size of the}} codebook, and hence to improve compression. In germane contexts, in which compressibility is used in its dual role as a basis for structural inference and classification, extensible motifs are seen to support unsupervised classification and phylogeny reconstruction. Conclusion Off-line compression based on extensible motifs can be used advantageously to compress and classify biological sequences. </p...|$|R
