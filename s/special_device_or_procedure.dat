40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{progressive}} and degenerative disease, which {{may result in}} significant pain and decreased quality of life. Recent updates {{in our understanding of}} OA have demonstrated that it is a whole joint disease that has many similarities to an unhealed wound containing inflammatory cytokines. The nSTRIDE Autologous Protein Solution (APS) Kit is a medical device under development for the treatment of OA. The APS Kit processes a patient's own blood at the point of care to contain high concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines and anabolic growth factors. This study assessed the safety and treatment effects of a single intra-articular injection of APS. Eleven patients were enrolled in this study. Sufficient blood could not be drawn from one patient who was subsequently withdrawn, leaving 10 patients treated. Minor adverse events (AEs) were experienced by seven subjects (63. 6 %).

The ability to record and manipulate existing sounds (as in musique concrete), and to generate new, unknown timbres with electronic generators (as in elektronische musik), provided an extraordinary multiplication of musical resources. Much literature of the period extols the new possibilities offered by electronic music, but {{the limitations of the}} technology of the 1950 s and 1960 s and the interactions that occurred between composers and that technology have been little explored. This study attempts to document some of these interactions. The influences of the equipment and procedures of "classical studio technique" on the resulting music are examined. Selected electronic compositions are analyzed in terms of the equipment employed and the limitations this equipment may have imposed. The study reveals characteristics of certain works that are directly dependent on characteristics of the technology. New <b>devices</b> <b>or</b> <b>procedures</b> developed by composers are also detailed. Areas examined include disc technology, magnetic tape, oscillators and generators, filters, modulators and other devices, techniques of spatialization in multi-channel works, and a sampling of specialized <b>devices</b> <b>or</b> <b>procedures</b> used by individual composers. The influences excercised by voltage-controlled synthesizers, such as those designed by Robert Moog and Donald Buchla, are also discussed. Works by the following composers are studied: Bulent Arel, Henk Badings, Louis and Bebe Barron, Luciano Berio, Robert Beyer, John Cage, Mario Davidovsky, Tod Dockstader, Herbert Eimert, Kenneth Gaburo, Paul Gredinger, Karel Goeyvaerts, Bengt Hambraeus, Pierre Henry, Giselher Klebe, Gottfried Michael Koenig, Gyorgy Ligeti, Otto Luening, Bruno Maderna, llhan Mimaroglu, Pauline Oliveros, Henri Pousseur, Dick Raaijmakers, Pierre Schaeffer, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Vladimir Ussachevsky, and Edgard Varese.

The two poles in the transfer function of the filter are variables which are functions of the input frequency of the filter. The filter is a narrowband amplifier. When the filter receives an input signal, it changes the location of the two poles in the filter transfer function so that the bandpass filter has itscenter frequency equal to the input signal.
