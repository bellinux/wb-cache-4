5|$|A {{planet that}} can <b>sustain</b> life is termed habitable, even if life did not {{originate}} there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to <b>sustain</b> metabolism. The distance of Earth from the Sun, {{as well as}} its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to <b>sustain</b> flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to <b>sustain</b> flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) studies using mixed blocked/ event-related designs have shown activity consistent with separable <b>sustained</b> task-related processes and transient trial-related processes. In the mixed design, control blocks are intermixed with task blocks, during which trials are presented at varying intervals. Two studies were conducted to assess the ability of this design to detect and dissociate <b>sustained</b> task-related from transient trial-related activity. Analyses on both simulated and empirical data were performed by using the general linear model with a shape assumed for <b>sustained</b> effects, but not transient effects. In the first study, simulated data were produced with <b>sustained</b> time courses, transient time courses, and the sum of both together. Analyses of these data showed appropriate parsing of <b>sustained</b> and transient activity in all three cases. For the empirical fMRI experiment, counterphase-flickering checkerboard stimuli were constructed to produce <b>sustained,</b> transient, and combined <b>sustained</b> and transient responses in visual cortex. As with the simulation, appropriate parsing of <b>sustained</b> and transient activity was seen in all three cases; i. e., <b>sustained</b> stimuli produced <b>sustained</b> time courses and transient stimuli produced transient time courses. Combined stimuli produced both transient and <b>sustained</b> time courses. Critically, transient stimuli alone did not produce spurious positive <b>sustained</b> responses; <b>sustained</b> stimuli alone produced negligible spurious transient time courses. The results of these two studies along with supplemental simulations provide strong evidence that mixed designs are an effective tool for separating transient, trial-related activity from <b>sustained</b> activity in fMRI experiments.
