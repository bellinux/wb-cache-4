25|$|In 1430 {{following}} {{a legal battle}} over disputed titles, the Wynfords sold the reversion of the estate to John Stourton (died 1438) of Preston Plucknett in Somerset, 7 times MP for Somerset, in 1419, 1420, December 1421, 1423, 1426, 1429 and 1435. Stourton {{used it as a}} dowry for his second daughter Joan Stourton (one of his three daughters and co-heiresses) when in 1434 she married John Sydenham, MP, of Combe Sydenham in Somerset. The Sydenham family originated at the manor of Sydenham near Bridgwater, Somerset and were <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> time to have been England's largest landowners, yet their wealth seems to have fluctuated with each generation.|$|E
25|$|DSHS {{was most}} {{concerned}} about Biryukova's mental health, given her OCD diagnosis and past hospitalizations, following a complaint from the person who delivered the child. They also found the father, Alan Morgan, a convicted felon, problematic. Authorities in Florida had taken a child from his home there. The month the two were married Biryukova reported him to the police in Redmond for allegedly assaulting her and got a no-contact order; she nevertheless visited him regularly in jail in Issaquah, where he was when she gave birth, under assumed names. Both claimed to investigators they did not live together despite giving them the same address; Biryukova <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point {{she did not even}} know who the father was even though his name was on the child's birth certificate.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, with lost prestige, a divided party, {{and with her}} {{campaign}} resources partly drained by the primary fight, Romney was behind incumbent Democrat Hart from the beginning. [...] Romney issued position papers and emphasized the themes of dealing with crime and social permissiveness; she also advocated a national healthcare plan and increased attention to environmental damage caused by industry. She never made any personal attacks against Hart. [...] The only woman running for the U.S. Senate that year, she was a tireless campaigner, traveling around the state in a chartered Cessna and making as many as twelve stops a day. [...] Nevertheless, the perception grew {{that she did not}} have any vision for what she would do as a senator and was only in the race because she was George Romney's wife. [...] In response, she <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point, [...] "I'm not a stand-in or a substitute for anyone". Her campaign material continued to just refer to [...] "Lenore". [...] She also was negatively impacted, in both the primary and general election, by fallout from her husband's effort as HUD Secretary to enforce housing integration in Warren, Michigan. Consistently far ahead in polls, Hart staged a low-key campaign with few public appearances; he mostly ignored her and sometimes acted condescendingly towards her in private.|$|E
