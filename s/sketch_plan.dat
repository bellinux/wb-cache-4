[...] Brooke built a house in Tudor style, which became known as Norton Hall, using as its core the former abbot's lodgings and the west range of the monastic {{buildings}}. It is not certain which other monastic buildings remained when the abbey was bought by the Brookes; excavations suggest that the cloisters were still present.

2500|$|At some {{stage the}} medieval paint was removed. [...] John Larson, {{who carried out}} {{conservation}} work on the statue, is {{of the opinion that}} it was removed deliberately at some time before about 1660 and a coat of wax, probably beeswax, was applied to give it a plainer and a [...] "uniform dull brown appearance". [...] This may have made it [...] "less offensive to Reformers". [...] No wax was found on the replacement head of the Christ child. [...] After the Restoration the statue was on display at the priory. [...] A print of Norton Priory by the Buck Brothers dated 1727 shows the statue displayed {{in front of the house}} in the outer courtyard. [...] A <b>sketch</b> <b>plan</b> drawn by a member of the Randle Holme family of Chester at some time between 1664 and 1678 shows that statue was already sited in this position at this earlier date. [...] Although it was outside the house, it stood against a wall and was sheltered to a degree by the overhanging upper storey; this would have given it some protection from weathering. [...] At some time between 1727 and 1757 the old house was demolished and it was replaced by a new house in neoclassical style. [...] The statue was moved into the garden, and it is likely that the blue-green paint was applied around this time to give it the appearance of a bronze garden sculpture. [...] A visitor's guide to Runcorn published in 1834 states [...] "In the garden [...] is an antique gigantic figure of St. Christopher".|$|E
6000|$|SIR, - I {{have the}} honour to report further explorations {{of the course}} of the river Vaea, with {{accompanying}} <b>sketch</b> <b>plan.</b> [...] The party under my command consisted of one horse, and was extremely insubordinate and mutinous, owing to not being used to go into the bush, and being half-broken anyway - and that the wrong half. The route indicated for my party was up the bed of the so-called river Vaea, which I accordingly followed to a distance of perhaps two or three furlongs eastward from the house of Vailima, where the stream being quite dry, the bush thick, and the ground very difficult, I decided to leave {{the main body of the}} force under my command tied to a tree, and push on myself with the point of the advance guard, consisting of one man. The valley had become very narrow and airless; foliage close shut above; dry bed of the stream much excavated, so that I passed under fallen trees without stooping. Suddenly it turned sharply to the north, at right angles to its former direction; I heard living water, and came in view of a tall face of rock and the stream spraying down it; it might have been climbed, but it would have been dangerous, and I had to make my way up the steep earth banks, where there is nowhere any footing for man, only fallen trees, which made the rounds of my ladder. I was near the top of this climb, which was very hot and steep, and the pulses were buzzing all over my body, when I made sure there was one external sound in my ears, and paused to listen. No mistake; a sound of a mill-wheel thundering, I thought, close by, yet below me, a huge mill-wheel, yet not going steadily, but with a SCHOTTISCHE movement, and at each fresh impetus shaking the mountain. There, where I was, I just put down the sound to the mystery of the bush; where no sound now surprises me - and any sound alarms; I only thought it would give Jack a fine fright, down where he stood tied to a tree by himself, and he was badly enough scared when I left him. [...] The good folks at home identified it; it was a sharp earthquake.|$|E

40|$|The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) {{emphasizes}} {{assessment of}} multi-modal alternatives and demand management strategies. This emphasis {{has increased the}} need for planners to provide good comparative information to decision-makers. Benefit-cost analysis is a useful tool to compare the economic worth of alternatives and evaluate trade-offs between eco-nomic benefits and non-monetizable social and environmental impacts. In 1995, the Federal High-way Administration (FHWA) developed a <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> tool called the <b>Sketch</b> <b>Planning</b> Analysis Spreadsheet Model (SPASM) to assist planners in developing the type of economic effi-ciency and other evaluative information needed to compare across modes and demand manage-ment strategies, at a <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> level of analysis for corridor studies. When more detailed analysis is required, however, SPASM cannot be used directly, owing to several simplifying assumptions. (For example, all trips {{are assumed to be}} of an average trip length, made between the two ends of the corridor.) Also, it is difficult to use SPASM for systemwide analysis.
