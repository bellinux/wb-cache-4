40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 1995, when the Compact of Free Association between Palau and the United States entered into force, U. S. aid to Palau has included assistance provided for in the compact and related subsidiary agreements [...] direct assistance to the Palau national government, including investment in a trust fund intended to provide $ 15 million annually from 2010 through 2044; federal postal, weather, and aviation services; and construction of a major road [...] with the U. S. interest of promoting Palau's self-sufficiency and economic advancement. U. S. assistance to Palau has also included discretionary federal programs, such as health, education, and infrastructure services, that are not provided for in the compact. Compact direct assistance is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2009. In addition, the related <b>subsidiary</b> <b>agreement</b> providing for federal services to Palau will expire on that date unless renewed or extended. At that time, Palau's annual withdrawals from its trust fund can increase from $ 5 million to $ 15 million. The compact mandates that the U. S. and Palau governments review {{the terms of the}} compact and its related agreements in 2009 and concur on any modifications to those terms. The Department of the Interior's (Interior) Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) has primary responsibility for monitoring and coordinating all U. S. assistance to Palau, and the Department of State (State) is responsible for government-to-government relations. To provide accountability for compact funds, the compact's related agreements require an annual audit of Palau's use of compact funds and require Palau to submit economic development plans, identifying planned expenditures of compact assistance, and annual reports on, among other topics, its implementation of these plans. The U. S. and Palau governments are also required to hold annual economic consultations to review Palau's progress toward self-sufficiency and to consult regarding Palau's trust fund every 5 years. My statement is based on our report, which was released this week. In this report, we examined (1) the provision of compact and other U. S. assistance to Palau in 1995 - 2009, (2) Palau's and U. S. agencies' efforts to provide accountability over Palau's use of federal funds, and (3) Palau's prospects for achieving economic self-sufficiency. We conducted this performance audit from October 2007 to June 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to outline and analyze the process leading to the signing of {{regional}} development agreements between the federal Department of Regional Economic Expansion (DREE) and the provinces of Saskatchewan and British Columbia. The agreements were signed as subsidiary to General Development Agreements (GDAs) entered into with each of the provinces. The study examines a series of these <b>subsidiary</b> <b>agreements</b> signed between 1974 and 1980 in order to determine some of the forces helping to shape regional policy, to characterize working relationships and to consider the implications of particular administrative structures and processes.;The research is based on an examination of DREE documents as well as on the transcripts of numerous interviews held with DREE and other federal officials. A model of the policy process has been employed to provide a framework for the analysis. The model presents the cognitive and coordinating dimensions of policy making as two distinct but interrelated continua. The process leading to the signing of <b>subsidiary</b> <b>agreements</b> is assessed in relation to these continua.;The study shows that federal policy making processes did reflect certain tendencies in respect of both cognitive and coordinating dimensions. In terms of the cognitive, policy analysis was constrained in its depth and breadth, tended to be more incremental than synoptic, participation in analytical activity was limited, and the rationale for initiatives was often more aimed at coping with, rather than solving, problems. In terms of coordination, processes in general tended to be haphazard, passive and to function without effective central monitoring or control. Bargaining was the principal coordinating instrument, one in which the provinces came to assume a dominant role.;With these characteristics as found in the formulation of agreements under the GDAs, it is evident that the approach did not meet expectations as a tool for facilitating comprehensive analysis and broad ranging coordination in regional development. The GDA approach did relatively little to ensure an integration of development goals between both levels of government. It is also concluded that administrative structures and processes themselves played a major role in shaping the policies which emerged. (Abstract shortened with permission of author. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this thesis {{was to assess}} the direct and {{indirect}} participation of the federal government in processes which have resulted in the loss of wetlands in Southern Ontario. This study focuses on the present and past Federal programs that had or do have the potential to impact wetlands, their history, funding, and administration, and the federal legislation present for wetland preservation. The research methodology was divided into three phases. The first phase consisted of literature reviews pertaining to the management and conversion of wetland areas and reports concerned with federally funded projects and the generation of extensive interviews with key personnel from Federal Departments. The literature reviews and interviews led to the selection and examination of the specific federal programs that had or do have the potential to impact wetlands. In this first phase, the departments of Public Works, Transport Canada, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and Agriculture Canada were reviewed. The second phase of research involved the examination of federally funded agriculture drainage programs and the federal legislation that can protect wetland areas. According to Bardecki (1981 a), agricultural drainage has been the greatest contributor to the loss of wetlands in Southern Ontario. The Agricultural and Rural Development Agreement (ARDA), the Southwestern Ontario Dyking Agreement and the Eastern Ontario <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>Agreement</b> were the three programs reviewed. Phase three of the research involved the examination of the use of a case study. Dundas County was selected for the case study area. One of the major contributions of this thesis is the generation and development of a data base that allowed the comparison of the ARDA drains to the loss and potential loss of wetland areas. The base data was collected from extensive interviews and through the compilation and production of outlet drainage maps overlain upon wetland maps, all for Dundas County. Due to data limitation, the thesis does not present the case study as definite data for evaluation. Rather, the case study is only used as an illustration of the general situation {{of the impact of the}} ARDA drainage program in Southern Ontario. The results of the case study do show that there is a definite potential for the impact on wetlands from the federally funded ARDA drains, but definite conclusions cannot be made. The results of the analysis of the data base show how far an analysis of this type can go without using on-site physical data collection. In order to avoid the conversion of wetlands from federally funded programs in the future it is recommended that: a screening of federal funded programs be employed before funding is granted; all federal legislation that can be used to protect wetland area must be adhered to; all federally funded projects must be assessed by the Federal Environmental Assessment and Review Process (drainage works must be exempted); and future research could focus on building data bases for the federally funded ARDA programs in Southern Ontario. Further research into the impacts of Federal programs and policies on the wetlands of Southern Ontario is essential to the control of Federal involvement in wetland conversion...|$|E

40|$|International {{recognition}} of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands as sovereign entities accelerated following the UN Security Council termination of the US-administered UN trusteeship over them in December 1990. However, both states had already established substantial international personalities prior to the Security Council action. The governments of the United States and both nations declared the trusteeship "non-applicable" to both in 1986, concurrently with the entry into effect of the Compact of Free Association. The two nations subsequently established diplomatic ties with such diverse countries as Israel, the People's Republic of China, Australia, and numerous South Pacific neighbors, and joined a variety of international organizations, all prior to the termination. The declarations of nonapplicability were a diplomatic success, not a failure. The two entities gained loci of sovereignty when their constitutions {{went into effect in}} 1979. The newly established constitutional governments exercised their sovereignty in concluding the compact with the United States. By delegating the power of defense to the United States under the compact, the two nations became modern-day "protected states," that is, states that have voluntarily ceded part of their sovereign powers to another nation.

Such agreements had begun to encourage international interests concerning the safety and security related matters. As result, most of the countries started forcing themselves to carry out these agreements immediately. For South Korea, this was not a task too difficult to execute since the nation had already been putting major efforts into reinforcing security measures on important national facilities along with establish laws, due to the special militant environment on the Korean Peninsula between the two Koreas. However, not all laws and reinforcements were in harmony, resulting in the need for further institutional adjustments in order for the different agencies and departments to react appropriately to the matters that required coherent and integrated efforts against the Threat to Port security, in particular. The most critical issue in this matter would be the assignment of the full authority of the Port security to a single agent, the Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA). In line with this, the Ministry of Land, Transportation and Maritime Affairs (MLTM) and the regional MPAs should newly establish cells or organizations that are that are solely designated to the Port security while introducing an integrated Port security system to replace the individual efforts on each separate port of responsibility, for enhanced efficiency.

40|$|During {{the period}} April-June 2011, we bid {{farewell}} to the former Executive Secretary of the Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) Dr. Tom Okurut and welcomed Dr. Canisius Kanangire who commenced his ﬁ ve-year tenure of duty in June 2011. In this issue, Dr. Kanangire summarises his vision to scale-up the Commission’s achievements during the next ﬁ ve years. One of the biggest achievements during the last quarter was {{the signing of the}} Grant Protocol of Agreement between the East African Community (EAC) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) as well as the subsequent signing of <b>Subsidiary</b> Grant Transfer <b>Agreements</b> between the EAC Secretariat and each of the ﬁ ve Partner States to commence the implementation of the physical infrastructural works for the Lake Victoria Water Supply and Sanitation (LVWATSAN) Programme Phase II. The details of this landmark project are part and parcel of this Issue. The Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project Phase II (LVEMP II) was also blessed with the coming on board of the Republic of Burundi and the Republic of Rwanda after completing the necessary preparatory procedures. We bring you summary information on this progress. Finally, management has introduced a “Partners Forum” to allow all institutions and stakeholders working towards the sustainable development agenda of the Lake Victoria Basin to make contributions to this newsletter. The Uganda Coalition for Sustainable Development as well as Vi Agroforestry have honoured this section with its ﬁ rst two contributions. I wish you good reading. USAI...|$|R
40|$| {{position}} {{and to the}} satisfying of customers is prevented;— the temptation to resort to unpopular methods for breaking the strike is not present;— the good reputation of the company is maintained since {{it is able to}} fulfill its obligations. It seems that each of the parties gains with the formula. Let us now take a look at its weaknesses. COMMENTS ON THE NON-STOPPAGE STRIKE FORMULAThe Nature of the FormulaInsufficient knowledge {{of the nature of the}} strike. The promotors of the formula postulate that the strike has only an economic finality and that the greatest damage inflicted on the employer during a work stoppage is the immediate loss of profit. So saying, they take into account only one dimension of the strike. They omit its social, psychological and political functions. The immediate loss of profit is not the worst thing that can happen to an employer during a work stoppage. The employer fears the long-run impact rather more than the « here and now » consequences of the strike. He fears, among other things, the loss of his market. On the side of the workers, sometimes the traditional strike plays an important role of defrustration. Insufficient knowledge of the nature of union activity. The non-stoppage strike formula ignores the role of unionism. The strike is the perfect way to enhance the workers' cohesion and solidarity. If one is to remove the right to walk out, then, by the same token, the union loses what makes its strength. Modified bargaining powerOne cannot know if the formula maintains the relative bargaining power of the parties. What makes the strength of a party at the bargaining table is a set of factors. Some can be expressed in money terms but others cannot. The formula fails by converting all of these factors into money terms. Moreover, it reduces the penalties for both parties compared to the traditional strike. The smaller the penalty, the greater the will to resist and the longer the conflict. Public opinion does not intervene since it is not disturbed by a work stoppage. Danger of bad consequencesThe authors agree on the fact that the right to strike is not permanently lost since the parties can remove such a no-stoppage clause from the agreement in later collective bargaining. Once agreed upon, however, it seems that it will not be removed. On the other hand, the workers have to use their right to strike if they wish to convince the employer and themselves of their strength. With the formula, it seems that they will lose their ability to walk out. Once embarked, it becomes a vicious circle. Such a formula can incite the rank and file workers to slow down if they are not convinced of the pressure they exert during a non-stoppage strike. Also, the company would be attracted by the idea of cutting its product prices since it has to give up all its net profits. There would be, finally, the possibility that the workers would quit their jobs as they would receive only « a half day's pay for a full day's work ». Problems emerging from the implementation of the formulaDuring a strike without work stoppage, the workers are willing to renounce a part of their income. What happens to the workers hired once it has begun ? If they receive full pay, it will affect the moral of the other workers. If they receive only a part of it, they will not accept work there. Since the Marceau and Musgrave article in 1949, there has been only one agreement containing such a clause. Moreover, according to the views of the president of the company, sooner or later, industrial and union leaders are going « to have to find a better way to resolve industrial disputes ». Details of ApplicationSetting upThree means of setting up the formula are proposed : a coercive law, a permissive law and a decision of the parties without any legislation. The first would be effective in avoiding the appearance of the strike but the conflict would remain. The two others leave the parties free to choose the formula or not. By doing so, one can be sure that it will not be very useful since nobody believes in its effectiveness. Determination of the penaltiesThe penalties imposed on the parties should be determined by public referees (Marceau and Musgrave, Chamberlain, Goble). The employers will resist such intrusions in their private affairs. What about the determination of the net profit ? What will motivate the employer to operate efficiently if he is to give up all his net profit ?Goble proposes retaining 25 per cent of the manager's income. Will they accept a worse situation than during a regular strike ? What is to prevent the company from distributing at the end of the year a bonus covering that lost income ?As far as the Dunbar Formula is concerned, it is simple, but its equity is doubtful. Use of the trust fund receiptsThe Dunbar formula seems to encourage the parties to settle early (within six weeks) since they would then recover all the money withheld. In the other case, there is no such pressure. Marceau's idea of using the money to make retroactive payments is not valuable as there would no longer be a penalty. To sum up, let us say that if we stick to the idea, we give an unworkable means of imposing penalties, and if we define easy means of imposing penalties, we stand away from the formula. AnnexeDUNBAR FURNITURE STRIKE WORK AGREEMENTThis Strike Work Agreement, made and entered into 20 th day of May, 1964, by and between the Dunbar Furniture Corporation of Indiana, Berne, Indiana, its successors or assigns, hereinafter called the company. andthe Upholsterers' International Union of North America affiliated with the AFL-CIO, hereinafter designated as the Union acting through its agency, Upholsterers' Furniture and Novelty Workers' Local Union No. 222, and under charter from the said Union, for itself and in behalf of the employees now employed and hereinafter employed by the company and collectively designated herein as the employees, hereinafter called the union.

The collective bargaining agreement is reinstated and will continue; in force for the entire Strike Work period. WORK DEDUCTIONSThere will be no stoppage of work. All employees will continue to work during the Strike Work period. Onehalf of the earnings of all employees in the unit will be withheld and placed in the Strike Work Trust Fund in the custody of the Bank named in the Fiduciary Agreement. The company will place in the fund each week an amount of money equal to the total amount paid by all employees that week.

THIRD PERIOD — TWO WEEKS — 50 % RETURNEDIf the Strike Work is settled in the next two weeks, 50 % of the money will be returned to the employees and the company, less 10 c per check issued in the distribution process. FOURTH PERIOD— ONE WEEK — 25 % RETURNED If the Strike Work is settled in the next one week, 25 % of the money will be returned to the employees and the company, less 10 c per check issued in the distribution process. OLD FASHIONED STRIKE OR LOCKOUTIf the Strike Work has not been settled by the end of the fourth period (12 th week) then no money will be refunded. The Strike Work Agreement and the Collective Bargaining Agreement may then be terminated and also there may be an old fashioned strike or lockout by written notice of either party to the other. AGREEMENT RENEWEDIf no such notice has been received by either party at the end of the 13 th week after the Strike work started then the last agreement will be automatically renewed without change for one year. The expiration date will then be one year from the written date of expiration in the last written agreement. ARBITRATIONAny dispute as to the meaning or application of the agreement between the company and the union or with the fiduciary that cannot be settled otherwise will be arbitrated except only as is provided in Article IX of the fiduciary agreement, if either party to the dispute so requests. The arbitration will be under the rules and procedure outlined in the collective bargaining agreement. RULESThe following rules will be in effect with the start of the first payroll week of a strike or lockout under this Strike Work Agreement. RETIREESIn case an employee is eligible to retire and does retire, then the money that he has paid into the fund will be refunded to him when he retires. Written proof and authorization will be given to the Fiduciary in jointly signed statement. SICK OR INJUREDIf an employee is sick or injured and received benefits under the UIU Health and Welfare Fund or Workmen's Compensation or other statutory industrial compensation funds, the benefits so received will not be considered as wages. The money that he has paid into the fund will remain there pending his return. In case it is proved that he is totally disabled then the money that he has paid into the fund will be returned to him when he retires. The Fiduciary will be given proof and authorization as outlined in A above. When an employee that has been sick or injured returns to work, then he will receive a refund or will additional money so that he will pay the same percent of his wages as other employees. The payments, if any, can be divided into four weekly instalments. QUITSIn case an employee quits or is discharged during the time a Strike Work is going on, he will forfeit and lose all claim to any money that he has paid into the fund. If he should be rehired, he will start as a new employee without seniority. If the amount that he had paid into the fund was a smaller percent of his weekly wage than others paid, he will pay the difference before starting to work, to the company and the company will deposit the money so received in the fund. NO STRIKE OR SLOW DOWNIt is agreed that there will be no strike stoppage or slow down or restrictions of output during the time that the Strike Work is in effect. In case any such action should occur the company may at its option discipline or discharge any or all of the people taking part in a strike, stoppage, slow down or restriction of output.
