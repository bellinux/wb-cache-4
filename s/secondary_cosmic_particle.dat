To this aim, more than 50 telescopes have been built at CERN and installed in high schools distributed all over the Italian territory. Each EEE telescope comprises three large area Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs) and is capable of reconstructing the trajectories of the charged particles traversing it with a good angular resolution. The excellent performance of the EEE telescopes allows a large variety of studies, from measuring the local muon flux in a single telescope, to detecting extensive air showers producing time correlations in the same metropolitan area, to searching for large-scale correlations between showers detected in telescopes tens, hundreds or thousands of kilometers apart. In addition to its scientific goal, the EEE Project also has an educational and outreach objective, its aim being to motivate young people by involving them directly in a real experiment. High school students and teachers are involved in the construction, testing and start-up of the EEE telescope in their school, then in its maintenance and data-acquisition, and later in the analysis of the data. During {{the last couple of years}} a great boost has been given to the EEE Project through the organization of simultaneous and centralized data taking with the whole telescope array.

The model represents a full chain analysis based on ground-based measurements of <b>cosmic</b> rays, from <b>particle</b> spectral and angular characteristics to dose estimation. The model is based on newly numerically computed yield functions and realistic propagation of cosmic ray in the Earth magnetosphere. The yield functions are computed using a straightforward full Monte Carlo simulation of the atmospheric cascade induced by primary protons and α-particles and subsequent conversion of secondary particle fluence (neutrons, protons, gammas, electrons, positrons, muons and charged pions) to effective dose or the ambient dose equivalent. The ambient dose equivalent is compared with reference data at various conditions such as rigidity cut-off and level of solar activity. The method is applied for computation of the effective dose rate at flight altitude during the ground level enhancement of 13 December 2006. The solar proton spectra are derived using neutron monitor data.

A proper atmospheric air density and geomagnetic field are implemented in order to correctly simulate the charged particles interactions in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere. The initial simulation was done for the Atlanta (33. 460 N, 84. 250 W) region. Four different types of primary proton energies (109, 1010, 1011 and 1012 eV) were considered to determine the secondary particle distribution at the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The geomagnetic field and atmospheric air density have considerable effects on the muon particle distribution at the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The muon charge ratio at the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface was studied with ECRS simulation for two different geomagnetic locations: Atlanta, Georgia, USA and Lynn Lake, Manitoba, Canada. The simulation results are shown in excellent agreement with the data from NMSU-WIZARD/CAPRICE and BESS experiments at Lynn Lake. At low momentum, ground level muon charge ratios show latitude dependent geomagnetic effects for both Atlanta and Lynn Lake from the simulation. The simulated charge ratio is 1. 20 ± 0. 05 (without geomagnetic field), 1. 12 ± 0. 05 (with geomagnetic field) for Atlanta and 1. 22 ± 0. 04 (with geomagnetic field) for Lynn Lake.

40|$|Surface {{detector}} array (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory has {{the capability}} to observe variations in the flux of low energy <b>secondary</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>particles.</b> Flux rates of low energy particles can be obtained either from particle count rates (scaler mode) or from charge distribution of the pulses (histogram mode), detected by individual water Cherenkov detectors (WCD). In scaler mode, SD is sensitive to particles that deposit energy between ∼ 15 MeV and ∼ 100 MeV in a WCD, while in histogram mode the deposited energy range can be extended up to ∼ 1 GeV. These two low energy detection modes are excellent tools for monitoring modulations of the galactic cosmic ray flux, related to solar activity, such as Forbush decreases (with typical duration of several hours to weeks) and Solar cycle (with a duration of several years), as they provide fluxes of cosmic rays with different energies at the same detector. In this contribution we present {{an analysis of the}} effects of space weather and space climate on low energy mode data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory in the period between 2006 and 2013. In particular, we focus on the long term trend of the cosmic ray flux.

The concepts of an array of CRT detectors and the detector hardware, including the custom-designed electronics, are described in a preceding article. A CRT detector consists of two circular drift chambers of 1. 8 m diameter with six sense wires each, and a 10 cm thick iron plate as a muon filter between the two chambers. Each detector has a local electronics box with a readout, trigger, and monitoring system. The local computers at the detector stations are used for hit and track finding in parallel to the detector readout. Detector stations are permanently calibrated online, using the cosmic ray data. The online software, including data processing and calibration procedures, are presented in this paper. Ten detectors are in operation {{at the site of the}} HEGRA air shower array. The detector performance has been evaluated using data from these detectors and the HEGRA array as well as by Monte Carlo simulations. The spatial resolution has been found to be about 1 mm both in drift and in wire direction. The corresponding angular resolution is about 0. 4 in each projection for a single track. Muons are usually identified if scattered by less than 2. 5 in the iron plate, corresponding to energies of more than about 1 GeV. In HEGRA-triggered showers an overall muon identification efficiency of 87 % is achieved, with a fraction of only 0. 07 % of the electrons being misidentified as muons. (orig.) 16 refs.
