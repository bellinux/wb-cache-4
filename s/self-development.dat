5|$|The Woman's Bible is {{a two-part}} non-fiction book, written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a {{committee}} of 26 women, published in 1895 and 1898 to challenge the traditional position of religious orthodoxy that woman should be subservient to man. By producing the book, Stanton wished to promote a radical liberating theology, one that stressed <b>self-development.</b> The book attracted {{a great deal of}} controversy and antagonism at its introduction.|$|E

Modern Japanese style training emphasizes the psychological elements incorporated into a proper kokoro (attitude) such as perseverance, fearlessness, virtue, and leadership skills. Sport karate places emphasis on exercise and competition. Weapons are an important training activity in some styles of karate.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{research}} done on Dhammakaya {{meditation on the}} samatha level has shown that it reduced serum cortisol level and blood pressure, while increasing serum protein level. Systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse rate were also reduced, as well as tidal capacity, tidal volume and maximal voluntary ventilation. Finally, reaction time was reduced. Psychologically, Dhammakaya meditation reduced clinical depression while stimulating several aspects of <b>self-development.</b>|$|E

Since then Tigran has followed the best practices of the Russian violin school with its focus on technical skills, relaxed handplay, peculiar sense for the acoustic characteristics of the violin, the capabilities for creating sound, the richness and color of the created sound, and the artistic freedom and <b>self-development</b> of the violinist.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, a {{committee}} {{was established in}} the yeshiva for the furtherance of Jewish education. The committee's goal was to ensure that traditional Jewish education was available to as many Jewish children as possible. The committee saw the organization of schools in small towns where there had previously been little or no structured system of schooling. Older students in the yeshiva were selected to teach for periods of time at these schools, following which, they would return to continue their studies at the yeshiva. In addition to providing many communities at large with new educational options, these schools also gave Telzer students another opportunity for <b>self-development</b> and growth.|$|E
25|$|Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees {{death as}} {{pollution}} and regards {{life as the}} realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful <b>self-development.</b> Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility {{for being able to}} relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.|$|E

500|$|The Manual {{reflected}} Satin's neopacifist politics. [...] Commentators routinely characterized it as caustic, responsible, and supportive. [...] The {{first part}} of the Manual, on emigration, suggests that self-preservation is more important than sacrifice to a dubious cause. [...] The second half, on Canada, spotlights opportunities for <b>self-development</b> and social innovation. [...] According to Canadian social historian David Churchill, the Manual helped some Canadians begin to see Toronto as socially inclusive, politically progressive, and counter-cultural.|$|E
500|$|When Mark Satin {{was hired}} as {{director}} of the Programme in April 1967, he attempted to change its culture. [...] He also tried to change the attitude of the war resistance movement toward emigration. [...] His efforts continued after SUPA collapsed and he co-founded the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme, with largely the same board of directors, in October 1967. [...] Instead of praising self-sacrifice, he emphasized the importance of self-preservation and <b>self-development</b> to social change. [...] Rather than sympathizing with pacifists' and radicals' strategic concerns, he rebutted them, telling The New York Times that massive emigration of draft-age Americans could help end the war, and telling another reporter that going to jail was bad public relations.|$|E
500|$|Like Tocqueville, who {{described}} a faceless and bureaucratic despotism with no identifiable despot, Marx also broke with classical thinkers who {{spoke of a}} single tyrant and with Montesquieu, who discussed {{the nature of the}} single despot. Instead, Marx set out to analyse [...] "the despotism of capital". Fundamentally, Marx assumed that human history involves transforming human nature, which encompasses both human beings and material objects. Humans recognise that they possess both actual and potential selves. For both Marx and Hegel, <b>self-development</b> begins with an experience of internal alienation stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a subjective agent, renders its potential counterpart an object to be apprehended. Marx further argues that by moulding nature in desired ways the subject takes the object as its own and thus permits the individual to be actualised as fully human. For Marx, the human nature—Gattungswesen, or species-being—exists as a function of human labour. Fundamental to Marx's idea of meaningful labour is the proposition that in order for a subject {{to come to terms with}} its alienated object it must first exert influence upon literal, material objects in the subject's world. Marx acknowledges that Hegel [...] "grasps the nature of work and comprehends objective man, authentic because actual, as the result of his own work", but characterises Hegelian <b>self-development</b> as unduly [...] "spiritual" [...] and abstract. Marx thus departs from Hegel by insisting that [...] "the fact that man is a corporeal, actual, sentient, objective being with natural capacities means that he has actual, sensuous objects for his nature as objects of his life-expression, or that he can only express his life in actual sensuous objects". Consequently, Marx revises Hegelian [...] "work" [...] into material [...] "labour" [...] and in the context of human capacity to transform nature the term [...] "labour power".|$|E
500|$|Ashtanga yoga {{incorporates}} epistemology, metaphysics, ethical practices, systematic {{exercises and}} <b>self-development</b> techniques for body, mind and spirit. Its epistemology (pramanas) is {{same as the}} Samkhya school. Both accept three reliable means to knowledge – perception (pratyākṣa, direct sensory observations), inference (anumāna) and testimony of trustworthy experts (sabda, agama). Both these orthodox schools are also strongly dualistic. Unlike the Sāṃkhya school of Hinduism, which pursues a non-theistic/atheistic rationalist approach, the Yoga school of Hinduism accepts {{the concept of a}} [...] "personal, yet essentially inactive, deity" [...] or [...] "personal god". Along with its epistemology and metaphysical foundations, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy incorporates ethical precepts (yamas and niyamas) and an introspective way of life focused on perfecting one's self physically, mentally and spiritually, with the ultimate goal being kaivalya (liberated, unified, content state of existence).|$|E
500|$|Under {{free trade}} the trader {{is the master}} and the {{producer}} the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of <b>self-development,</b> of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man. [...] that protection is immoral.... Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [...] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates {{the rest of the}} world. We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefiting mankind everywhere. Well, they say, 'Buy where you can buy the cheapest'.... Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: 'Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.|$|E
500|$|The Order postulates Satanism as {{an arduous}} {{individual}} achievement of self-mastery and Nietzschean self-overcoming, {{with an emphasis}} on individual growth through practical acts of risk, prowess and endurance. Therefore, [...] "he goal of the Satanism of the ONA is to create a new individual through direct experience, practice and <b>self-development</b> [...] the grades of the ONA system being highly individual, based on the initiates' own practical and real-life acts, instead of merely performing certain ceremonial rituals". Thus Satanism, the ONA assert, requires venturing into the realm of the forbidden and illegal in order to shake the practitioner loose of cultural and political conditioning. Intentionally transgressive, the Order has been characterised as providing [...] "an aggressive and elitist spirituality". Religious studies scholar Graham Harvey claimed that the ONA fit the stereotype of the Satanist [...] "better than other groups", something which he thought was deliberately achieved by embracing [...] "deeply shocking" [...] and illegal acts.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Vassa period, many of {{the monks}} will go out far away from the monastery to find a remote place (usually in the forest) where they can hang their {{umbrella}} tents and where it is suitable for the work of <b>self-development.</b> When they go wandering, they walk barefoot, and go wherever they feel inclined. Only those requisites which are necessary will be carried along. [...] These generally consist of the bowl, the three robes, a bathing cloth, an umbrella tent, a mosquito net, a kettle of water, a water filter, razor, sandals, some small candles, and a candle lantern.|$|E
2500|$|The TM {{technique}} {{involves the}} use of a sound or mantra, and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day. It is taught by certified teachers through a standard course of instruction, which costs a fee that varies by country. According to the Transcendental Meditation movement, it is a non-religious method for relaxation, stress reduction, and <b>self-development.</b> The technique has been seen as both religious and non-religious; sociologists, scholars, and a New Jersey judge and court include those who have expressed views. [...] The United States Court of Appeals upheld the federal ruling that TM was essentially [...] "religious in nature" [...] and therefore could not be taught in public schools.|$|E
2500|$|In the Indian sociocultural milieu {{girls have}} less access to parental love, schools, {{opportunities}} for <b>self-development</b> {{and freedom of}} movement than boys do. It {{has been argued that}} they may rebel against this lack of access or seek out affection through physical relationships with boys. [...] While the data reflects trends to support this theory, it is inconclusive. [...] The freedom to communicate with adolescent boys was restricted for girls regardless of whether they lived in an urban or rural setting, and regardless of whether they went to school or not. [...] More urban girls than rural girls discussed sex with their friends. [...] Those who did not may have felt [...] "the subject of sexuality in itself is considered an 'adult issue' and a taboo or it may be that some respondents were wary of revealing such personal information." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huxley {{was among}} the friends {{rallying}} round the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and was sharpening his [...] "beak and claws" [...] to disembowel [...] "the curs who will bark and yelp". Charles Kingsley was sent a review copy, and told Darwin that he had [...] "long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species." [...] Darwin was delighted that this [...] "celebrated author and divine" [...] had [...] "gradually learnt {{to see that it}} is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of <b>self-development</b> into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws." ...|$|E
2500|$|At their {{frequent}} meetings, Owen {{argued that}} intrinsic [...] "organising energy" [...] in the [...] "embryonic germ" [...] set the lifespan {{of the species}} and precluded transmutation. The botanist Robert Brown showed Darwin a different concept, of [...] "swarming atoms" [...] inside the germ, allowing nature's <b>self-development.</b> Embarrassed by his lack of labels for his finch specimens, he examined FitzRoy's in the British Museum and contacted seamen including Syms Covington for their collections. From this {{he was able to}} relate the finches to separate islands, with distinct species on each island. As well as pressing on with his Journal, he started an ambitious project to get the expert reports on his collection published as a multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle.

2500|$|A {{campaign}} was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry. In {{the words of}} Erwan Le Corre: [...] "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or {{the benefits of a}} few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of <b>self-development.</b> If parkour becomes a sport, {{it will be hard to}} seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore." [...] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, [...] "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'" [...] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Wilber's {{spectrum}} of consciousness {{consists of three}} broad developmental categories: the prepersonal or pre-egoic, the personal or egoic, and the transpersonal or trans-egoic. A more detailed version of this spectrum theory includes nine different levels of human development, in which levels 1-3 are pre-personal levels, levels 4-6 are personal levels and levels 7-9 are transpersonal levels. Later versions also include a tenth level. The transpersonal stages, or the upper levels of the spectrum, are the home of spiritual events and developments. The framework proposed by Wilber suggests that human development is a progressive movement through these stages of consciousness. The model implies that different schools of psychology are associated with different levels of the spectrum, and that each level of organization, or <b>self-development,</b> includes a vulnerability to certain pathologies associated with that particular level. Each level also represents developmental tasks that must be properly met, or they might lead to developmental arrest. A basic tenet of Wilber's transpersonal psychology is a concept called the [...] "pre/trans fallacy". That is, a confusion of transpersonal progression with prepersonal regression. According to writers in the field western schools of psychology have [...] {{had a tendency to}} regard transpersonal levels as pathological, equating them with regressive pathological conditions belonging to a lower level on the spectrum. The pre/trans fallacy describes a lack of differentiation between these two categories.|$|E
2500|$|The group {{formed in}} 1969, {{a product of}} campus radicalism, feminism, Canadian {{nationalism}} and left-wing nationalism in general. [...] Its leaders were university professors Mel Watkins, James Laxer and Robert Laxer. It issued a Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada and with support in the NDP caucus and membership worked to try to push the party leftward. The Waffle supported the nationalization of Canadian industries {{to take them out}} of the hands of American interests. [...] The group was endorsed by the New Democratic Youth. The Waffle manifesto stated that [...] "A socialist society must be one in which there is democratic control of all institutions, which have a major effect on men's lives and where there is equal opportunity for creative non-exploitative <b>self-development.</b> It is now time to go beyond the welfare state." [...] and that [...] "The New Democratic Party must provide leadership in the struggle to extend working men's influence into every area of industrial decision-making.... By bringing men together primarily as buyers and sellers of each other, by enshrining profitability and material gain in place of humanity and spiritual growth, capitalism has always been inherently alienating. Today, sheer size combined with modern technology further exaggerates man's sense of [...] insignificance and impotence. A socialist transformation of society will return to man his sense of humanity, to replace his sense of being a commodity. But a socialist democracy implies man's control of his immediate environment as well, and in any strategy for building socialism, community democracy is as vital as the struggle for electoral success." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chakraverti {{was born}} on 3 November 1950, to diplomat Debabrata Chakraverti, and Roma Sen, a {{descendant}} of the royals. Chakraverti {{spent much of her}} early life in Montreal, Canada, where her father was stationed. He was a representative from India to the Council of ICAO. An only child, she shared her father's passion for reading and devoured books on Indian mysticism and traditions partly because people at Montreal were always asking questions about India. In 1965, while on vacation in the Laurentian mountains, Chakraverti was invited to an all woman's party by one of her mother's friends, Carlotta. There, she was introduced to the Society for the Study of Ancient Cultures and Civilizations, founded [...] by Carlotta. The group studied ancient texts, long-forgotten customs and the mystical way of life. Chakraverti was selected to join the group, through a process of initiation, and enrolled for a course with them. For the next five years, she stayed in a chalet on the mountains and studied ancient cultures and their long-forgotten rituals with eleven other women, with Carlotta as their teacher. Alcohol, close friendship or anything that distracted them from the prescribed hours of study, solitude and meditation, were taboo. Practical training in witchcraft was the only way; it included learning varied techniques of <b>self-development</b> and understanding the significance of ancient chants, movements, symbols, gestures, invoking energy from the elements, and training {{in the use of the}} apparatus integral to the craft. Chakraverti later commented, [...] "It started as an academic curiosity. [...] Wicca includes both scientific facts and old lore. We studied Carl Jung and Friedrich Nietzsche because Wicca means studying various layers of the human mind." [...] In 1972, near the completion of their course, Chakraverti, along with two other women were asked to choose between Way of Tao, Wicca and Kabbalah as their practiced craft; Chakraverti chose Wicca. She later commented that ancient goddesses like Isis, Artemis, Hecate, Kali and Freya, played an important role in deciding her future in Wicca.|$|E
