40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} thixoforming defects on the {{stress-strain}} curves of aluminum structural part were quantitatively investigated. The A 357 -MHD billet was thixoformed to manufacture a <b>shock</b> <b>tower</b> {{part of a}} small electric vehicle. All tensile specimens were machined from only a <b>shock</b> <b>tower</b> product to minimize the effects of different processing conditions. Tensile tests were performed under the almost same conditions. The fraction of solid and liquid phase, the sizes and area fractions of defects in the specimens were measured and analyzed by an image analyzing program using OM and SEM micrograph. The fracture strain values of the stress-strain curves were greatly affected by amount of defects. However, the analyses with defects existed {{in the area of}} gauge length did not show a clear explanation about the relation with the fracture strain values. The measurements of defects in the fractured surface represented more plausible results about the correlation of forming defects and fracture strains...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} Magnesium Front End {{program of}} USAMP (US Automotive Materials Partnership), a robotic cell was setup at Henrob Corporation to {{assemble}} magnesium <b>shock</b> <b>tower</b> prototypes using self-pierce riveting (SPR) with and without adhesive. Components of the prototype assemblies consisted of AZ 31 sheets, AM 30 extrusions and AM 60 castings. Because magnesium alloys have limited formability at room temperature, in-line local preheating of the parts was necessary to assist the plastic deformation that occurs during the SPR joining operation. Rapid in-line local heating was achieved using a fiber optic coupled diode laser. The laser was easily set up as an add-on tool, with minmum modification to the existing SPR tool, except for changes to the robotic cell, {{which had to be}} enclosed to comply with safety requirements for Class 4 lasers. Semiautomated production of the prototype assemblies using laser-assisted self-pierce riveting (LSPR) was demonstrated. This paper describes some findings and learning sfrom the assembly trials and presents directions for further research to improve the joining ability of magnesium by LSPR...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for modelling noise and vibration in complex mechanical structures in the mid-to-high frequency regime. It {{is based on a}} dynamical energy analysis (DEA) formulation which extends standard techniques such as statistical energy analysis (SEA) towards non-diffusive wave fields. DEA takes into account the full directionality of the wave field and makes sub-structuring obsolete. It can thus be implemented on mesh grids commonly used, for example, in the finite element method (FEM). The resulting mesh based formulation of DEA can be implemented very efficiently using discrete flow mapping (DFM) as detailed in Chappell et al. (2013) and described here for applications in vibro- acoustics. A mid-to-high frequency vibro-acoustic response can be obtained over the whole modelled structure. Abrupt changes of material parameter at interfaces are described in terms of reflection/transmission matrices obtained by solving the wave equation locally. Two benchmark model systems are considered: a double-hull structure used in the ship- building industry and a cast aluminium <b>shock</b> <b>tower</b> from a Range Rover. We demonstrate that DEA with DFM implementation can handle multi-mode wave propagation effectively, taking into account mode conversion between shear, pressure and bending waves at interfaces, and on curved surfaces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFutsal {{is a small}} {{version of}} football, which is played in over 100 countries. The smaller pitch of futsal causes players to perform {{multiple}} activities in several times such as sprinting, walking, running, jumping, cutting and so on. Consequently, the risks of non-contact injuries are increasing. One of the factors can influence the risks is a shoe-surface traction. The Current research is aimed at comparing the traction between futsal shoe and four different playing surfaces. In {{the first part of}} the experimental test, cutting maneuver as a critical activity was performed by former Bayern Munich Player, Mr. Timo Heinze. A force plate and two high speed cameras were prepared to collect forces (Fx,Fy and FZ) and angles during cutting maneuver. In the second part, a device, traction tester was considered in order to simulate the certain activity, which was reconciled with the force and angle of the subject. Accordingly, the traction between futsal shoe (Joma Top Flex 301 Sala) and four samples (Snap Sport (<b>Shock</b> <b>Tower),</b> Descol (Pulastic Outdoor), Green Tower and Snap Sport (Bounce Back)) were measured. The activity classified into two traction phases, translation and rotation. T-test results show that there are significant differences between translational traction (TT) and rotational traction (TR) in three samples (Snap Sport Bounce Back, Green tower and Descol). They are 0. 0019, 0. 0001, 0. 012 respectively (P-value< 0. 05). The mean of three trials of tractions determined that greater translational tractions (Phase 1) are associated lower rotational traction (Phase 2). To avoid foot fixation and ACL injuries in phase 2, a greater rate of TR than TT is necessary. The Snap Sport (Bounce Back) showed the higher level of translational coefficient (0. 2007) and a safe range of rotational coefficient (0. 0647). It was considered as an appropriate playing surface among other samples...|$|E
5000|$|... "Back half car" [...] - {{the rear}} {{suspension}} has been substantially modified for drag racing, usually involving weight transfer improvements and [...] "coil-over” highly adjustable <b>shock</b> absorber spring <b>towers</b> at easily compressible rates.|$|R
50|$|These {{were the}} result of {{extensive}} changes, including a strengthened chassis with extra spot welds and thicker metal around the rear <b>shock</b> <b>towers</b> and lower subframe, weight reduction (reduced sound insulation, 10% thinner windscreen, lighter wheels), more power, rev limiter set at 8500 RPM USDM (8600 RPM JDM, 8700 RPM UKDM), hand built engine featuring hand-polished and ported intake ports, high compression pistons, undercut valves and revised intake and exhaust systems, and suspension upgrades. The result was a capable sports coupe which was acclaimed by motoring journalists worldwide. Interestingly, there is only 33 lbs of net weight difference between the Integra Type R and the Integra GS-R, because the extra metal and cross bracing in the Type R almost negated most of the 98 lbs. of weight reductions. Although the JDM version was significantly lighter than the SiR (JDM ITR 96 - 97 delete could include: air bags, A/C, rear wiper, radio, center console, clock, P/S and ABS). The DC2 Type R was the only Type R ever sold in North America (With the Acura badge). For the European, Australian and New Zealand market the DC2 was sold as a Honda.|$|R
25|$|Packaging {{is cited}} as both an {{advantage}} and disadvantage of the transverse FRP leaf spring, {{as compared to}} coil springs, depending on the application. The FRP spring is typically set low in the suspension, resulting in a low center of gravity. It also allows manufactures to avoid tall spring mounts, thus resulting in a flatter load floor about the suspension. James Schefter reports that, as used on the C5 and later Corvettes, the use of OEM coilover damper springs would have forced the chassis engineers to either vertically raise the <b>shock</b> <b>towers</b> or move them inward. In the rear this would have reduced trunk space. In the front this would have interfered with engine packaging. The use of the leaf spring allowed the spring to be placed under the chassis, out of the way, while keeping {{the diameter of the}} shock-absorber assembly to that of just the damper, rather than damper and spring. However, in other applications, such as race car designs, the need to span the width of the vehicle resulted in significant design limitations. Coil and torsion springs present better packaging options for racing applications. FRP springs also have limited availability and selection as compared to coil springs. Higher cost has also been cited as a disadvantage, when comparing FRP springs to coil springs on production road cars.|$|R
