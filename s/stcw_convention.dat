40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{research}} {{as a whole is}} dedicated to studies of the work load of navigation officers and, consequently, is related to the current international research on the quality of working life. Issues of seafarers' working time are very topical because in recent years the load of navigation officers has significantly increased, either due to increase in shipping intensity, or {{in the context of the}} new international maritime law, for example, compliance with the requirements of the ISM CODE (International Management safety Code), THE ISPS (The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code). Irregularities are observed in practice of the seafarers' working hours and rest hours, and even the mismatch, as presented in the port of inspection materials. This article is intended to assess the 2 nd and 3 rd Officer's load compliance with the regulatory enactments for the work and rest regime to develop proposals to load optimization. Load analysis of Navigation officers is based on international maritime regulations that determine the work and rest regime on ships <b>STCW</b> (The International <b>Convention</b> on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers), MLC (Maritime Labour Convention).

40|$|Pick {{up almost}} any {{shipping}} related newspaper or journal published currently {{and there will}} inevitably be included a tragic tale of a shipping casualty. The efforts to reduce the casualty statistics are immeasurable as are the theories and approaches to the management of safety in our industry. There has already been much debate about the purpose, function and effectiveness of the IMO’s <b>STCW</b> code and <b>convention</b> but whatever our individual opinions, it is the code by which the industry must abide. In its foreword it mentions “minimum global standards of knowledge, understanding, experience and professional competence”. The current status of the Training for Instructors course is that as mentioned as a reference in Section A-I/ 6 of the STCW Code, it “may be of assistance in preparation of courses”. The existing requirements of trainers and educators of the code might be loosely interpreted as having knowledge of a subject and have received guidance on how to deliver training. Is this requirement sufficient? In the trade press, alongside the tales of woe relating to avoidable accidents, there are almost as many articles associated with apparently innovative approaches to training and management, directed not only at reducing these accidents but also endeavouring to improve performance. So can we ask the question, to which standards are our seafarers trained? Is it a standard which merely complies with the regulatory standard, inducing a ‘culture of compliance’? Or is it a standard well over and above mere regulatory requirements, where tasks are completed efficiently and cost-effectively, as well as safely, in order to present a commercially competitive organisation. This paper discusses, argues and counter-argues the contention and concludes with the proposal that at very least, the debate should be re-opened. ...|$|R
50|$|The 1978 <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> was {{the first}} to {{establish}} basic requirements on training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers on an international level.

50|$|The deck {{department}} {{is divided into}} deck officers and ratings. All ranks in the {{deck department}} are required to have undertaken training {{in accordance with the}} <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention.</b> For officers this involves the passing of an exam to receive a certificate of competency, the level of understanding and certification varies according to ship size. All ranks are required to have undertaken generic maritime training, which usually involves time at sea and time in an approved college. International standards under the STCW Code set out the minimum requirements for training, however individual nations also have their own maritime training regulations. For example, in the United Kingdom the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ensure that the deck department receive training and examinations in order to assume the responsibilities of their rank at sea. All seafarers of the deck department are also required to have undertaken a series of short course training, in various elements under the <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention.</b> This includes general security, safety and lifeboat training, as well as vessel-specific training, such as operations in the Polar regions and on tankers.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{signatory}} to the <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> UK {{ships are}} commanded by Deck Officers and Engineering Officers. Officers undergo 3 years of training, {{known as a}} cadetship {{at one of the}} approved maritime colleges in the United Kingdom. These include Warsash Maritime Academy, South Tyneside College, Fleetwood, Plymouth University and City of Glasgow College. Cadets usually have a choice of two academic routes; Foundation Degree or Higher National Diploma. Successful completion of this results in a qualification in marine operations or marine engineering. Generally the costs of a cadetship will be met by sponsorship from a UK shipping company. During the 3 years of training, cadets also go to sea, for a period of a year or more, usually spread across the cadetship. This affords a practical education, that along with the academic time in college prepares a candidate for a separate and final oral exam. This oral exam is carried out with a Master Mariner at an office of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Successful completion of the oral exam will result in the award of a certificate of competency. This is the international qualification, issued by the UK government which allows an Officer to work in their qualified capacity onboard a ship. Certificates are issued for different ranks and as such an Officer will usually return to complete a subsequent series of studies until they reach the highest qualification.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the {{composition}} of the crew on UK ships was diverse. This was a characteristic of the extant of the shipping companies trade, the extent of the British Empire and the availability of crew in different ports. One ship might have a largely all British crew, while another might have a crew composed of many Indians, Chinese or African sailors. Crews from outside Britain were usually drawn from areas in which the ship traded, so Far East trading ships had either Singapore or Hong Kong crews, banana boats had West Indian crews, ships trading to West Africa and Southern Africa had African crews and ships trading to the Indian Ocean (including East Africa) had crews from the Indian subcontinent. Crews made up of recruits from Britain itself were commonly used on ships trading across the North Atlantic, to South America and to Australia and New Zealand. Traditionally and still now, the ships crew is run by the Bosun, as overseen by a responsible Deck Officer, usually the Chief Mate. A ship may also have different sub-departments, such as the galley, radio department or hospitality services, overseen by a Chief Cook, Radio Officer or Chief Steward. Many of these roles have now changed, as ships crews have become smaller in commercial shipping. On most ships the Radio department has disappeared, along with the Radio Officer (colloquially known as 'sparks') replaced by changes in technology and the requirement under the <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> for Deck Officers to hold individual certification in the GMDSS System. Electro-technical Officers (ETO) also serve aboard some ships and are trained to fix and maintain the more complex systems.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{maritime}} law in seafarer training pursuant to amendments to the <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> of 2010. The basic intention of the <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> adopted in 1978 was to harmonize national regulations, seafarer training and training programs, {{as well as the}} conditions and manner of seafarer certification to raise general qualification levels of seagoing vessel crews. The <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> is occasionally amended to allow legislation to take into account and stay abreast of the changing technical standards in shipping. The latest amendments to the <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> were adopted at the Manila Diplomatic Conference in 2010, and entered into force and effect on 1 January 2012. Member states are required to complete the procedure of gradual implementation of the new provisions by 31 December 2016, with all seafarers being required to obtain certificates issued in accordance with the amended regulations by 1 January 2017. Although ship navigation during sailing has been significantly facilitated by the development of technics and technology, seafarers are now required to be well-versed in an increasing number of maritime law regulations and procedures promoting the safety of life and property at sea and the protection of the marine environment, while simultaneously ensuring unobstructed exploitation of ships. The latest amendments to the <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> in this sense, in Model Course 7. 01., impose additional seafarer training requirements, inter alia, broadening the scope of mandatory contents to be covered by maritime law courses required for the obtainment of the professional title of ship officer. The paper pays especially close attention to the newly adopted amendments and the conformity of national legislation proscribing seafarer training standards. However, it is exactly in the domain of seafarer training in maritime law that harmonization may be said to be incomplete...|$|E

40|$|The {{change in}} {{maritime}} legislative demands, both national and international, {{has had a}} significant impact on the training and education within the maritime domain. The <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> is the statutory text that regulates the training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers. During the last few years, the <b>STCW</b> <b>Convention</b> has been revised to include updated group of tasks, duties and responsibilities as well as specification on the type and extent of training and education and subsequently on the training equipment used. This update is called the Manila amendment and has entered into force as of January 2012. Some parts of the maritime sector can be considered as high-risk areas and the transportation of petroleum and chemicals in bulk can be one of them due to the impact on health and environment those substances have unless handled properly. Specific demands on personnel competencies will call for a need for specific training and education as well as specific types of training equipment. Quality efforts in education and training should include parts of assessment and evaluation to monitor how well the training objectives have been met. The Manila amendment opens up for an extended use of simulators for the assessment of competency. A simulator can be a powerful tool in the learning process, but it is still very important to measure the effect that the tool has in reaching the goals outlined in the curriculum. This Master’s Thesis will show the impact of changed legislative demands in tanker education and how a cargo-handling simulator can be used to enhance student learning. It will also look into how a cargo simulator will perform in the ability to measure students’ competence in tanker handling in the light of the goals stipulated in the STCW Code...|$|E
