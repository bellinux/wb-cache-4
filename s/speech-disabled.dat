25|$|Hearing {{people can}} also contact a deaf, hard-of-hearing, or <b>speech-disabled</b> person via VRS. To {{initiate}} a call, a hearing person calls a VRS and connects to a video interpreter who then contacts the video user.|$|E
50|$|The {{operator}} {{will not}} hear the voice user's voiced messages and the voice user {{does not need to}} voice GA. The operator will voice for the person who is <b>Speech-Disabled,</b> and the person who is <b>Speech-Disabled</b> must give the GA each time to alert the operator it is the voice user's turn. The voice user does not need to voice GA, because the HCO user can hear when the voice user finishes talking.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} purpose of TRS is simply provide a two-way communication between deaf, hard of hearing, and <b>speech-disabled</b> individuals to leverage a functional equivalence experience. The service {{is not intended}} for any companies to make lucrative profits out of the TRS fund that are not true {{to the spirit of}} relay service.|$|E
50|$|A {{less common}} call type is hearing carry over (HCO). HCO allows {{a person who}} is <b>speech-disabled</b> but can hear to use their hearing while sending {{responses}} to {{a person who is}} hearing via the HCO user's typed text. The operator voices the HCO user's typed messages, and then the HCO users picks up the handset and listens to the other voice user's response. There are many variations of HCO, including two-line HCO and HCO with privacy.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to 2-line VCO, 2-line HCO allows an HCO user using a TTY or {{computer}} {{to call a}} TRS operator, who in turn calls the HCO user on a second telephone line, which serves as the voice line. The user puts the operator on a brief hold to initiate a three-way call with the hearing person. This method is frequently used {{by people who are}} <b>Speech-Disabled</b> and like to use some of their residual speech as well not having to type [...] "GA". With 2-Line HCO, the HCO user and the voice user can interrupt each other. HCO with Privacy cannot be used with 2-Line HCO, because the operator, HCO user, and hearing person are on a three-way call.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{communication}} efficiency for <b>speech-disabled</b> users of nonvocal com-munication devices, a procedure has been developed that generates sets of units for use as language representation systems. Given a limit N {{to the number of}} units the user and device can accommodate, and the type of language system desired (phoneme sequences, letter se-quences, or words with letters), the procedure produces sets of units that require a minimum number of selections per word of message. One nonvocal individual trained in a system of this type (N = 400 phoneme sequences) improved communication rate by 30 % over an alphabet system, despite a manual selection rate that was twice as slow with the large unit set. Implications are drawn for improvement of communication rate, for the design of com-munication systems and devices, and for the development of systems for other languages...|$|E
40|$|The {{domain of}} Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) studies {{appropriate}} techniques and systems that enhance or accomplish the retaining or non-existing abilities for interpersonal communication. Some AAC users apply telegraphic language, {{as they attempt}} to speed up the interactive communication or because they are language impaired. In many AAC aids, a "sentence" is formulated by combining symbols of an icon-based communication system. To be accepted by the communication partner, the output should be a correct oral sentence of a natural language. In this paper we present our effort to develop a novel technique for expanding spontaneous telegraphic input to well-formed Greek sentences, by adopting a feature-based surface realization for Natural Language generation. We first describe the general architecture of the system that accepts compressed, incomplete, grammatically and syntactically ill-formed text and produces a correct full sentence. The NLP techniques of the two main modules, named preprocessor and translator/ generator, are then analyzed. A prototype system has been developed using Component Based Technology (CBT) which is under field evaluation by a number of <b>speech-disabled</b> users. Currently it supports fully the BLISS and MAKATON icon based communication systems. Some limitations of the module are also discussed along with possibilities for future expansions...|$|E
