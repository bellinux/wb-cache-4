50|$|Pospiviroid is a genus of viroid {{which most}} {{commonly}} infects tubers. It {{belongs to the}} family pospiviroidae.The first viroid discovered was a pospiviroid, the PSTVd species (potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid).|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s, {{symptoms}} of a previously unknown potato disease were noticed in New York and New Jersey fields. Because tubers on affected plants become elongated and misshapen, they named it the potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> disease.|$|E
50|$|The single-strandedness and {{circularity}} of viroids {{was confirmed}} by electron microscopy, and Gross et al. determined the complete nucleotide sequence of potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid in 1978. PSTVd was the first pathogen of a eukaryotic organism for which the complete molecular structure has been established. Over thirty plant diseases have since been identified as viroid-, not virus-caused, as had been assumed.|$|E
50|$|The Pospiviroid RY motif stem loop is an RNA element {{found in}} Pospiviroids such as potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid (PSTVd). The RY {{nucleotide}} sequence motif (5'-ACAGG and CUCUUCC-5') in PSTVd, {{is thought to}} bind with the tomato protein Virp1. The exact function of this motif and the significance of Virp1 binding is unknown. It is however thought that RY motifs are essential for establishing a viroid infection.|$|E
50|$|Theodor Otto Diener (born February 28, 1921) is the Swiss-American plant {{pathologist}} who, in 1971, {{discovered that the}} causative agent of the potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> disease is not a virus, but a novel agent, which consists solely of a short strand of single-stranded RNA without a protein capsid, eighty times smaller than the smallest viruses. He proposed to name it and similar agents to be discovered viroids.Viroids displace viruses as the smallest infectious agents known.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{appeared on}} plants onto which pieces from affected plants had been budded—indicating {{that the disease}} {{was caused by a}} transmissible pathogenic agent. However, a fungus or bacterium could not be found consistently associated with symptom-bearing plants, and therefore, it was assumed the disease was caused by a virus. Despite numerous attempts over the years to isolate and purify the assumed virus, using increasingly sophisticated methods, these were unsuccessful when applied to extracts from potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> disease-afflicted plants.|$|E
50|$|The Potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid ("PSTVd") was {{the first}} viroid to be identified. PSTVd is a small, {{circular}} RNA molecule {{closely related to the}} chrysanthemum stunt viroid. Present within the viroidal RNA is the Pospiviroid RY motif stem loop. The natural hosts are potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum). All potatoes and tomatoes are susceptible to PSTVd and there is no form of natural resistance. Natural infections have also been seen in avocados and infections in other solanaceous crops have been induced in the laboratory.|$|E
5000|$|In 1976, Sänger et al. {{presented}} {{evidence that}} potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid is a [...] "single-stranded, covalently closed, circular RNA molecule, existing {{as a highly}} base-paired rod-like structure"—believed {{to be the first}} such molecule described. Circular RNA, unlike linear RNA, forms a covalently closed continuous loop, in which the 3' and 5' ends present in linear RNA molecules have been joined together. Sänger et al. also provided evidence for the true circularity of viroids by finding that the RNA could not be phosphorylated at the 5' terminus. Then, in other tests, they failed to find even one free 3' end, which ruled out the possibility of the molecule having two 3’ ends. Viroids thus are true circular RNAs.|$|E
50|$|In 1959, Diener {{joined the}} US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service Pioneering Laboratory for Plant Virology at the Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, where he pursued {{the cause of}} the potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> disease. This led to the {{unexpected}} discovery of the causative agent, a small RNA molecule, eighty times smaller than the smallest known viruses, for which he proposed the term viroid. Later, viroids were characterized as single stranded covalently closed circular RNA molecules occurring as highly base-paired rod-like structures. Viroids, together with viroid-like satellite RNAs have been officially endorsed by the International Committee for Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) as a novel order of subviral agents, which, in its 2014 publication, encompassed 2 families, 8 genera and 32 species.|$|E
50|$|There {{has long}} been {{uncertainty}} over how viroids induce symptoms in plants without encoding any protein products within their sequences. Evidence suggests that RNA silencing {{is involved in the}} process. First, changes to the viroid genome can dramatically alter its virulence. This reflects the fact that any siRNAs produced would have less complementary base pairing with target messenger RNA. Secondly, siRNAs corresponding to sequences from viroid genomes have been isolated from infected plants. Finally, transgenic expression of the noninfectious hpRNA of potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid develops all the corresponding viroid-like symptoms. This indicates that when viroids replicate via a double stranded intermediate RNA, they are targeted by a dicer enzyme and cleaved into siRNAs that are then loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex. The viroid siRNAs contain sequences capable of complementary base pairing with the plant's own messenger RNAs, and induction of degradation or inhibition of translation causes the classic viroid symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Viroids {{and most}} viral {{satellites}} have small, noncoding, and highly structured RNA genomes. How they cause disease symptoms without encoding proteins {{and why they}} have characteristic secondary structures are two longstanding questions. Recent {{studies have shown that}} both viroids and satellites are capable of inducing RNA silencing, suggesting a possible role of this mechanism in the pathology and evolution of these subviral RNAs. Here we show that preventing RNA silencing in tobacco, using a silencing suppressor, greatly reduces the symptoms caused by the Y satellite of cucumber mosaic virus. Furthermore, tomato plants expressing hairpin RNA, derived from potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid, developed symptoms similar to those of potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid infection. These results provide evidence suggesting that viroids and satellites cause disease symptoms by directing RNA silencing against physiologically important host genes. We also show that viroid and satellite RNAs are significantly resistant to RNA silencing-mediated degradation, suggesting that RNA silencing is an important selection pressure shaping the evolution of the secondary structures of these pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid (PSTVd), a {{quarantine}} pathogen {{included in}} the EPPO A 2 list was identified in plants of Solanum jasminoides and S. rantonnetii in Italy. Molecular characterization of four S. jasminoides and one S. rantonnetii PSTVd isolates showed limited sequence variability. A tissue-printing hybridization method for detecting PSTVd in ornamental Solanaceae was successfully tested and its potential for large scale surveys is discussed. This {{appears to be the}} first report of PSTVd in Italy and the first report of PSTVd natu-rally infecting S. rantonnetii. Key words: PSTVd, ornamental Solanum, sequenc-ing, diagnosis, tissue printing hybridization. Viroids are the smallest infectious agents known. With a genome of only 246 - 401 nt composed of circular, single-stranded RNA without coding capacity, they cause diseases in many kinds of plants (Flores et al., 2005 a). Based on biochemical, biological and structural properties, viroids have been grouped in two families: Pospiviroidae and Avsunviroidae, which comprise nu-clear and chloroplast replicating viroid species, respec-tively (Flores et al., 2005 b). Potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid (PSTVd), the type species of Pospiviroidae, has a special historical importance {{because it was the first}} viroid to be identified and characterized when the aetiology of the potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> disease was being investigated (Diener, 2001). In spite of its narrow range of natural hosts, which in addition to potato includes tomato (Puchta et al., 1990; Elliot et al., 2001; Verhoeven et al., 2004), avocado (Querci et al., 1995) and pepino (Sham-loul et al., 1997), PSTVd has been transmitted experi-mentally to a wide range of hosts, at least 156 species in 12 families (Diener, 1979).

40|$|We {{analyzed}} in vivo-labeled RNA {{to determine which}} of the two proposed rolling-circle models is more likely to depict the replication cycle of potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid. A key feature distinguishing the two models is the presence of a circular monomeric minus strand in one and not the other. Chromatography on cellulose CF 11 was used to purify a fraction containing the replication intermediates free from single-stranded progeny. Heat denaturation followed by gel electrophoresis was used to seek possible circular templates—species required for rolling-circle replication to take place. Upon heating, a 32 P-labeled RNA was released. Limited nuclease digestion (“nicking”) revealed that this was a unitlength circular RNA. Fingerprinting identified it as a plus strand. No circular minus strands were detected in this population or in nuclease-treated samples containing RNase T 1 -resistant cores of the replication complex. Thus, potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid appears to use an asymmetric pathway in which minus strands are synthesized by rolling-circle copying, but plus strands are not. More details of the replication pathways used by various viroid-like RNAs are needed and will help to establish the evolutionary relationships among these infectious agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{sedimentation}} {{coefficients of}} the potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid, four viroid-like RNAs from cadang-cadang-disease, circular RNA from velvet tobacco mottle virus, circular RNA from Solanum nodiflorum mottle virus and double stranded RNA 5 from cucumber mosaic virus were {{measured in the}} analytical ultracentrifuge. The numbers of nucleotides of the RNA species varied between 246 and 670. The hydrodynamic models of rigid rods and flexible cylinders were applied for {{the interpretation of the}} sedimentation coefficients. Double-stranded RNA 5 from cucumber mosaic virus with 335 basepairs fits the model of a rigid rod with an hydrated diameter of 29 A. Potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid and the four viroid-like RNA species of cadang-cadang-disease form a homologous series of flexible cylinders with a Kuhn's statistical length lambda- 1 of 600 A. The circular RNA from the two viruses mentioned above are more flexibel than the viroids and viroid-like RNAs. The hydrodynamic interpretation is in accordance with thermodynamic data and secondary structure models.

40|$|The potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> {{disease was}} first {{observed}} {{early in the}} 20 th century in the northeastern United States and shown, in 1971, to be incited by a viroid, potato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid (PSTVd). No wild-plant PSTVd reservoirs have been identified; thus, the initial source of PSTVd infecting potatoes has remained a mystery. Several variants of a novel viroid, designated Mexican papita viroid (MPVd), have now been isolated from Solanum cardiophyllum Lindl. (papita güera, cimantli) plants growing wild in the Mexican state of Aguascalientes. MPVd's nucleotide sequence is most closely related {{to those of the}} tomato planta macho viroid (TPMVd) and PSTVd. From TPMVd, MPVd may be distinguished on the basis of biological properties, such as replication and symptom formation in certain differential hosts. Phylogenetic and ecological data indicate that MPVd and certain viroids now affecting crop plants, such as TPMVd, PSTVd, and possibly others, have a common ancestor. We hypothesize that commercial potatoes grown in the United States have become viroid-infected by chance transfer of MPVd or a similar viroid from endemically infected wild solanaceous plants imported from Mexico as germplasm, conceivably from plants known to have been introduced from Mexico to the United States late in the 19 th century in efforts to identify genetic resistance to the potato late blight fungus, Phytophthora infestans...|$|E
