I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

You'll often see a color painting of the Goddess prominently displayed in Hindu homes. Usually the picture is hung high on the wall <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to crane your neck backward, looking up toward her feet. [...] In India, Goddess worship is not a 'cult,' it's a religion, [...] an extraordinarily spiritually and psychologically mature tradition. Millions of people turn every day with heartfelt yearning to the Mother of the Universe." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Feynman {{delivered}} the Caltech commencement {{address on the}} topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience {{due to a lack of}} [...] "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty" [...] on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E
500|$|Araya held {{concern about}} the lyrics that King penned to [...] "In the Name of God", voicing his opinion to guitarist Hanneman. King's {{viewpoint}} was; [...] "It's like, 'C'mon, man, you're in Slayer. You're the antichrist — you said it yourself on the first album!' You can't draw the line like that. Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it — I wrote it. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to say, 'Well, it's {{just a part of}} being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck.

500|$|Taylor wanted Asgard in {{this film}} {{to have a more}} natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, {{capturing}} six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, [...] "The benefit of that is that you have some real world terrain to work with – <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there we went in there populating the terrain with different buildings." [...] For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.|$|E
500|$|Susan is {{primarily}} characterized {{as the girl}} next door. Teri Hatcher stated [...] "I’m not exactly her, but I get her. I get her insecurities, her flaws." [...] She called the character [...] "a great representation of what [...] deals with daily. Our responsibilities can be overwhelming and things often don't go as you planned, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to roll with it. Susan celebrates rolling with it". She is a hopeless romantic and often expresses her more openly and vulnerably than the other characters in the series. The series begins a year after Susan's first divorce, when she is still emotionally raw. Throughout the series, several other characters have confronted Susan about her inability to live happily and without drama. Susan has {{a close relationship with}} her daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), who often acts as the parent figure in the relationship.|$|E
500|$|Gass has {{hinted that}} the band's third album {{may be called}} Tenacious D 3-D, {{reasoning}} that [...] "It's the third record, so it should probably be 'Tenacious 3-D.'

[...] Dave Grohl has confirmed that he will appear as the drummer on the album, after performing on both Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny. In an interview with Spinner.com in December 2010, Black revealed that the band was [...] "about halfway through the writing process" [...] for its new album, telling fans to expect the release of new material [...] "at the end of 2011".

500|$|On June 14 and 22, 2005, Deep Impact {{observed}} two {{outbursts of}} activity from the comet, {{the latter being}} six {{times larger than the}} former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission co-investigator for JPL pointed out that [...] "it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this thing. You have to rely {{on the fact that the}} Impactor is a smart spacecraft as is the Flyby spacecraft. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to build in the intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing." [...] On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed.

[...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient. It's harder than you think and I got quite emotional." [...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine.

[...] Apart from the album playings, Springsteen kept setlists flexible during the third leg; sign requests continued, as in Springsteen's words they allowed [...] "the fans to have input into the show in a way that just pumps the blood into everything and enlivens the evening." [...] Born to Run remained the standard full album choice {{for the rest of the}} tour, but the two shows at New York's Madison Square Garden saw The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle and The River, with the latter's 20-song length dominating the setlist.

500|$|Lucie Delarue-Mardrus wrote love poems to Barney in {{the early}} years of the century, and in 1930 {{depicted}} her in a novel, L'Ange et les Pervers (The Angel and the Perverts), in which she said she [...] "analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me". [...] The protagonist of the novel is a hermaphrodite named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien. The book's portrayal of her is, at times, harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys. [...] Marion tells Wells that she is [...] "perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion.... ou are capable of loving someone just as they are, even a thief—in that lies your only fidelity. [...] And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> my respect." ...|$|E
500|$|Spicer says [...] "Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more {{polished}} and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected {{in his role}} as Simon Templar... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying [...] "to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous... I mean, this man {{is supposed to be a}} spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy... it's outrageous. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to treat the humour outrageously as well".|$|E
500|$|In December 2004, Domínguez made {{international}} headlines {{when she}} signed a two-year contract for second division men's team, Atlético Celaya, in Guanajuato, Mexico. Domínguez {{said of the}} signing, [...] "The thing is, that in Mexico we don't have even a decent amateur league for women, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to look for other options... I knew that the decision could go either way, but were expecting a yes. The hard {{thing is going to}} be equaling the physical force of the men, but the technique, the desire, the willpower, those are things that I already have." [...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling. FIFA ruled against mixed-sex football teams stating, [...] "There must be a clear separation between men's and women's football." [...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men. [...] "I just wanted to be given the chance to try," [...] Domínguez said. [...] "If I failed I would have been the first to say I can't do it, the first to admit it doesn't work. But at least I would have tried." ...|$|E

500|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order is {{the second}} game to use id Software's id Tech 5 engine, after Rage (2011). The game {{utilizes}} the engine to add {{a large amount of}} detail to the game world. The team often found it difficult to develop the game with 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, particularly on complex environments, but [...] "we always made it work somehow", said Matthies. He has also said that the main advantages of the engine is the speed and the detailing, while its biggest disadvantage is dynamic lighting; [...] "on the other hand the static light rendering is really awesome, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> full radiosity and can do really spectacular-looking things using that," [...] he added. Senior concept artist Axel Torvenius said that one of the main inspirations for the art design of the game was movies from the 1960s, calling out the James Bond movies. The design for the Nazis in the game was influenced by the aesthetics of the Nazis {{at the end of the}} Second World War; [...] "it's blended with the style of the 1960s and the fashion ideals of how to express yourself visually," [...] Öjerfors explained. This viewpoint is also influenced by the element of exaggeration, which is common throughout the game's design and has been acknowledged by the team as a development inspiration. Character models can be covered in up to a 256k texture; however, this is not used often in the game on individual characters, due to the difficulty of seeing it from a distance.|$|E

A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be very careful".|$|E
