The aim of the joint Nordic <b>screening</b> <b>studies</b> is to obtain a snapshot of the occurrence of emerging pollutants in the environment. A Nordic cooperation on <b>screening</b> <b>studies</b> is an advantage for increased representativity of the results since it is possible to include a larger number of samples in a larger area than normally in national studies. In addition, it is cost effective and makes it easy to compare results with neighbouring countries. The group has its own webpage, from where the reports can be downloaded...|$|R

50|$|Most {{studies of}} uterine malformations {{are based on}} populations {{of women who have}} {{experienced}} a pregnancy loss and thus do not address the issue of the prevalence in the general population. A <b>screening</b> <b>study</b> by Woelfer et al. of women without a history of reproductive problems found that about 5% of women had an arcuate uterus when they defined an arcuate uterus any fundal protrusion into the cavity that had an apical angle of more than 90 degrees. Accordingly, it was the most common uterine anomaly, followed by septate uterus (3%) and bicornuate uterus (0.5%).|$|E
5000|$|To {{show the}} {{frequent}} ability of microRNAs to alter DNA repair expression, Hatano et al. [...] performed a large <b>screening</b> <b>study,</b> in which 810 microRNAs were transfected into cells that were then subjected to ionizing radiation (IR). For 324 of these microRNAs, DNA repair was reduced (cells were killed more efficiently by IR) after transfection. For a further 75 microRNAs, DNA repair was increased, with less cell death after IR. This indicates that alterations in microRNAs may often down-regulate DNA repair, a likely important early step in progression to cancer.|$|E

Another finding displayed the prevalence of PAD, carotid artery stenosis (CAS) and AAA was higher not only with overall increased age, but {{for both men and}} women. Researchers noted that this association between age and PAD existed for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.|$|E
