40|$|Intoduction: Sterile gauze {{is one of}} {{the medical}} devices that are often used to prevent infection. Several things, one of them is {{materials}} for packaging, can affect the <b>sterility</b> <b>of</b> gauze. Parchment paper {{is one of the}} packaging materials for sterilization. The study was done to analyze the <b>sterility</b> <b>of</b> gauze packed with parchment paper one layer and three layers on the growth of microorganism. Method: This study was an experimental study with a quasi-experimental design. Samples were 60 gauze packed with one layer parchment paper and 60 gauze packed with three layers of parchment paper. The <b>sterility</b> <b>of</b> sterile gauze tested at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the <b>sterility</b> <b>of</b> gauze packed with 1 layer of parchment paper on the growth of microorganisms at 0, 2, 4 weeks (p = 0. 126). No significant difference in the <b>sterility</b> <b>of</b> sterile gauze packed with 3 layers of parchment paper at 0, 2, 4 weeks (p = 0. 675). There was a significant difference in the <b>sterility</b> <b>of</b> sterile gauze packed with parchment paper 1 layer and 3 layers on the growth of microorganisms (p = 0. 002). Conclusion There is a significant difference of sterile gauze packed with parchment paper 1 layer and 3 layers against the growth <b>of</b> microorganisms. The <b>sterility</b> <b>of</b> the packaged sterile gauze with a layer of parchment paper is better than the three layers...|$|R
