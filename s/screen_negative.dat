50|$|Development {{chemicals}} {{applied to}} an appropriate film can produce either a positive (showing the same densities and colors as the subject) or negative image (with dark highlights, light shadows, and, in principle, complementary colors). The first films were darkened by light: negative films. Later films that produce a positive image {{became known as}} reversal films; processed transparent film of this type can be projected onto a <b>screen.</b> <b>Negative</b> images need to be transferred onto photographic paper or other substrate which reverses the image again, producing a final positive image. Creating a positive image from a negative film can also be done by scanning the negative to create a computer file which can then be reversed by software.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{document}} {{current practice}} of communicating <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> results to pregnant women undergoing {{a test for}} Down's syndrome. SETTING: 169 British NHS hospital antenatal clinics currently offering multiple marker serum screening for Down's syndrome and giving results directly to women. METHODS: All 169 clinics were sent a letter asking about the method and form of communicating <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> results. RESULTS: In only 29 % of programmes were specific arrangements made to inform women of <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> results, and in 5 % these results were not given at all. <b>Screen</b> <b>negative</b> results were given as a verbal phrase in 44 % of programmes, as a risk figure in 16 % of programmes and as both in 40 % of programmes.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether glycemic control is different between subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for Celiac Disease (CD) compared to subjects who screened positive for CD among subjects with autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes. Also, this study investigated if the presence of specific beta cell autoantibodies, GAD 65, Islet cell antibodies or both, could predict the risk for positive CD screening. METHODS/PROCEDURES: A retrospective cohort study of an existing clinical care data was obtained from the Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) in Boston Medical Center (BMC) for the period between January 2000 and November 2015. The exposed cohort included those who screened positive for CD, while the non-exposed cohort included subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for CD. The following data was collected and included in the analysis: demographic variables, A 1 C levels, Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) events, diabetes-associated antibodies, CD screening tests, and CD biopsy results. Longitudinal data for each subject was obtained from the CDW. RESULTS: The prevalence of potential CD in this study was 8. 8 %, while the prevalence of biopsy confirmed CD was 4. 4 %. Mean A 1 C level for subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for TTG was 8. 9 % (CI 8. 3 - 9. 6), while mean A 1 C levels for subjects who screened positive for TTG was 7. 9 % (CI 6. 8 - 9. 0) after adjusting for confounders using the mixed-effect model. This difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, diabetes-associated antibodies did not predict the risk for positive TTG screening. CONCLUSION: The glycemic control for subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for CD was found to be similar to subjects who screened positive for CD. However, further studies with higher power and larger sample size are needed to confirm the findings of this study. 2017 - 11 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} The ODHIN trial found that training and support and financial reimbursement increased {{the proportion of}} patients that were screened and given advice for their heavy drinking in primary health care. However, {{the impact of these}} strategies on professional accuracy in delivering screening and brief advice is under-researched and is the focus of this paper. Method From 120 primary health-care units (24 in each jurisdiction: Catalonia, England, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden), 746 providers participated in the baseline and the 12 -week implementation periods. Accuracy was measured in two ways: correctness in completing and scoring the screening instrument, AUDIT-C; the proportion of <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> patients given advice, and the proportion of screen positive patients not given advice. Odds ratios of accuracy were calculated for type of profession, and for intervention group: training & support; financial reimbursement; and, internet-based counselling. Results. 32 of 36, 711 questionnaires were incorrectly completed, and 65 of 29, 641 <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> patients were falsely classified. At baseline, 27 % of <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> patients were given advice, and 22. 5 % screen positive patients were not given advice. These proportions halved during the 12 -week implementation period, unaffected by training. Financial reimbursement reduced the proportion of screen positive patients not given advice (OR = 0. 56, 95 % CI= 0. 31 to 0. 99, p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Although the use of AUDIT-C as a screening tool was accurate, a considerable proportion of risky drinkers did not receive advice, which was reduced with financial incentives...|$|E
40|$|The Objective of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that presenting risk information using numbers rather than words is a more effective way of communicating the residual risk inherent in a <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> test result. We used a randomised controlled trial in a large UK teaching hospital. Two hundred and twenty pregnant women who received negative results on serum screening for Down syndrome participated. Presentation of <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> test results were given either as a numerical probability (e. g. you have a 1 : 650 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome) or as a verbal probability (your chance of having a baby with Down syndrome is low). In both interventions the verbal anchor 'it is unlikely that your baby has Down syndrome' was used. Our aims were to measure the understanding of the residual risk in a <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> result, and anxiety. Immediately after receipt of the results, 97 % of those receiving their results in the form of a numerical probability and 91 % of those receiving their results in the form of a verbal probability correctly understood that their baby probably did not have Down syndrome (95 % CI for difference: 0 % to 12 %; p= 0. 04). All those who were incorrect believed that their baby definitely did not have Down syndrome. Subgroup analysis showed that this effect was confined to those with lower levels of education (i. e. those without a university degree), amongst whom understanding was poorer. There was no difference between intervention groups in understanding the results at four months. There were no differences between intervention groups in the levels of anxiety at one week or four months after receiving their results. In conclusion, communicating residual risks using numbers rather than words has a small beneficial effect of increasing awareness of residual risks without raising anxiety. Further work is needed to estimate the size of this effect in less well-informed and less highly educated populations. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

As such, the Traumatic Brain Injury- 4 (TBI- 4) was developed and implemented in a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mental health clinic. To provide information regarding both the predictive validity and clinical utility of the TBI- 4, the relationship between screening results and future suicide attempts was evaluated. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether a positive screen on the TBI- 4 was associated with increased risk for suicide attempt within one year post screening. Methods: The TBI- 4 was administered to 1, 097 Veterans at the time of mental health intake. Follow-up data regarding suicide attempts for the year post-mental health intake were obtained from Suicide Behavior Reports (SBRs) in Veteran electronic medical records (EMRs).

Objective: to test whether variations in definition of interval cancer rates (ICR) affect comparisons of international ICR, specific to a comparison of ICR in Norway and North Carolina (NC). Methods: An interval cancer (IC) {{was defined as a}} cancer diagnosed following a <b>negative</b> <b>screening</b> mammogram in a defined follow-up period. ICR was calculated for women ages 50 - 69, at subsequent screening in Norway and NC, during the time period 1996 - 2002. ICR was defined using three different denominators (<b>negative</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>negative</b> final assessments and all screens) and three different numerators (DCIS, invasive cancer and all cancers). ICR was then calculated with two methods: 1) number of ICs divided by the number of screens, and ICs divided by the number of women-years at risk for IC. Results: There were no differences in ICR depending on the definition used. In the 1 - 12 month follow up period ICR (based on number of screens) were: 0. 53, 0. 54, and 0. 54 for Norway; and 1. 20, 1. 25 and 1. 17 for NC, for <b>negative</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>negative</b> final assessment and all screens, respectively: The same trend was seen for 13 - 24 and 1 - 24 months follow-up.

The present study aimed to describe {{the magnitude of the}} association of depression and posttraumautic stress disorder (PTSD) with the presence of vulvodynia in a nonclinical population from southeastern Michigan. Methods: Baseline data from 1, 795 women participating in the Woman to Woman Health Study, a multiethnic population-based study, was used for this analysis. Validated screening questionnaires were conducted to assess vulvodynia, depression, and PTSD. Modified Poisson regression models with a robust variance estimation were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the association between vulvodynia status and two mental health conditions, depression and PTSD. Results: In the adjusted models, women who screened positive for depression had a 53 % higher prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR= 1. 53; 95 % CI: 1. 12, 2. 10) compared with women who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for depression. Women who screened positive for PTSD had more than a two-fold increase in the prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR= 2. 37; 95 % CI: 1. 07, 5. 25) compared with women who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for PTSD. Conclusions: The increased prevalence of vulvodynia among those screening positive for depression or PTSD suggests that these disorders may contribute to the likelihood of reporting vulvodynia.

40|$|A new anionic biosurfactant protein (SP 16) {{capable of}} tuning foaming {{behaviour}} by pH or salt has been designed. This biosurfactant exhibits unique foaming behaviour with high sensitivity to pH. A good level of foaming {{was observed at}} pH 2 but not at pH 3. A further increase by one pH unit to pH 4 restored good foaming. At pH 5 – 8, SP 16 again showed low foaming propensity, whereas the presence of salt (NaCl) was able to restore foaming again. Interfacial tension and circular dichroism investigations revealed the foaming control mechanism. The high negative charge (− 16. 6) at pH 6 and above restricted the ability of SP 16 to fold into an α-helical conformation and also restricted surface activity. For pH 5 (− 13. 6), even though SP 16 folds in bulk to give α-helical structure, the high charge inhibited adsorption at the air–water interface, resulting in a significant lag time of about 150 – 200 sec to achieve a decrease in interfacial tension. In contrast to its low foaming behaviour at pH 5 – 8, the presence of salt (NaCl) was found to effectively <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> charge, thus leading to its folding and a decrease of interfacial tension. This new design offers a new strategy to control foaming behaviour, and elaborates a clear link between charge, structure and interfacial activity for biosurfactants.

40|$|Background: ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) is {{gradually}} being acknowledged as a functionally impairing disorder across the lifespan, underscored by heritability. Nonetheless, lack of ADHD (adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) data from South Africa is alarming {{which could be}} due to either the unawareness of ADHD symptoms or underutilization of available screening measures. Undiagnosed ADHD may influence family- and working lives unpleasantly. Parenting a child with ADHD may intensify parental stress through functional impairment notwithstanding the diagnosis of ADHD. Methods: Eighty-one biological parents of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder were screened using self-reporting measurements. ADHD self-report scale (ASRS-V 1. 1) identified either positive or negative subgroups; the Weiss functional impairment rating scale (WFIR-S) for functional impairment and the Jerome driving questionnaire (JDQ) for risk-taking behaviour specifically driving. Results: Of the 39 (48 %) parents who experienced impairment in all seven areas of functioning, 23 (59 %) <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for ADHD, while 16 (41 %) screened positive. A significant association was found between parents who screened either positive or negative for ADHD and functional impairment across five of the seven individual categories namely family, work, self-concept, life-skills and social functioning. Conclusion: This study emphasized the high incidence of functional impairment in parents of ADHD children. Although a substantial number of parents <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for ADHD, they still reported impairment in functioning; probably due to undiagnosed ADHD with comorbid psychiatric disorders, and/or parental stress due to the complex behaviour of the child.

In the present study, ESBL-producing strains (17 Escherichia coli transconjugants) were studied to define "sensitive" interpretive criteria for the Etest ESBL screen. These criteria (reduction of the ceftazidime MIC by > 2 log 2 dilution steps {{in the presence of}} clavulanic acid) defined a group of 92 probable ESBL-positive organisms among the 225 tested strains of Klebsiella species and E. coli having suspicious antibiogram phenotypes. With a subset of 82 clinical strains, the Etest ESBL screen was more sensitive (100 %) than the disk approximation test (87 %) and was more convenient. The MICs of ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin at which 50 % of isolates are inhibited were 16 - to 128 -fold higher (coresistance) for the ESBL screen-positive group of strains than for the ESBL screen-negative group of strains. Some strains for which cephalosporin MICs were elevated and which were Etest ESBL <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> were also cefoxitin resistant, i. e., consistent with a chromosomally mediated AmpC resistance phenotype. The Etest ESBL screen test with the ceftazidime substrate appears to be a useful method for detecting or validating the presence of enteric bacilli potentially producing this type of beta-lactamase...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the impact of {{personality}} disorder (PD) on the health of people living in the community. The authors set out to examine the association between PD and general health, using a cross-sectional survey of a representative community sample in London, UK. A total of 1, 698 adults aged 16 years or over from 1, 075 randomly selected households were recruited and interviewed face-to-face by trained interviewers. Using multivariable logistic regression, the authors examined the cross-sectional association between PD screen status, as assessed by the Standardised Assessment of Personality-Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS), and self-rated health, adjusting for demographic and health covariates. Of the participants, 14. 5 % screened positively for PD. A greater proportion of those scoring positively for PD reported poor self-rated health, compared to <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> participants (41. 3 % versus 15. 0 %). This association was reduced, but remained significant, after adjustment for potential confounders (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) = 3. 99, 95 % CI [2. 93, 5. 42]; fully adjusted OR = 1. 53, 95 % CI [1. 02, 2. 29]. Of note, subthreshold symptoms of PD were significantly associated with poor self-rated health (unadjusted OR per unit SAPAS score increment = 1. 53, 95 % CI [1. 40, 1. 67]; fully adjusted OR = 1. 19, 95 % CI [1. 07, 1. 33]. Furthermore, people screening positive for PD {{were more likely to report}} multiple (three or more) long-standing illnesses. The authors conclude that in the general population, individuals who are at high risk for PD are independently at increased risk of poor general health...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to develop a Multi-dimensional Body Image Scale for Malaysian female adolescents. Data were collected among 328 female adolescents from a secondary school in Kuantan district, state of Pahang, Malaysia by using a self-administered questionnaire and anthropometric measurements. The self-administered questionnaire comprised multiple measures of body image, Eating Attitude Test (EAT- 26; Garner & Garfinkel, 1979) and Rosenberg Self-esteem Inventory (Rosenberg, 1965). The 152 items from selected multiple measures of body image were examined through factor analysis and for internal consistency. Correlations between Multi-dimensional Body Image Scale and body mass index (BMI), risk of eating disorders and self-esteem were assessed for construct validity. A seven factor model of a 62 -item Multi-dimensional Body Image Scale for Malaysian female adolescents with construct validity and good internal consistency was developed. The scale encompasses 1) preoccupation with thinness and dieting behavior, 2) appearance and body satisfaction, 3) body importance, 4) muscle increasing behavior, 5) extreme dieting behavior, 6) appearance importance, and 7) perception of size and shape dimensions. Besides, a multidimensional body image composite score was proposed to <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> body image risk in female adolescents. The result found body image was correlated with BMI, risk of eating disorders and self-esteem in female adolescents. In short, the present study supports a multi-dimensional concept for body image and provides a new insight into its multi-dimensionality in Malaysian female adolescents with preliminary validity and reliability of the scale. The Multi-dimensional Body Image Scale can be used to identify female adolescents who are potentially at risk of developing body image disturbance through future intervention programs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND : ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) is {{gradually}} being acknowledged as a functionally impairing disorder across the lifespan, underscored by heritability. Nonetheless, lack of ADHD (adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) data from South Africa is alarming {{which could be}} due to either the unawareness of ADHD symptoms or underutilisation of available screening measures. Undiagnosed ADHD may influence family- and working lives unpleasantly. Parenting a child with ADHD may intensify parental stress through functional impairment notwithstanding the diagnosis of ADHD. METHODS : Eighty-one biological parents of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder were screened using self-reporting measurements. ADHD self-report scale (ASRS-V 1. 1) identified either positive or negative subgroups; the Weiss functional impairment rating scale (WFIR-S) for functional impairment and the Jerome driving questionnaire (JDQ) for risk-taking behaviour specifically driving. RESULTS : Of the 39 (48 %) parents who experienced impairment in all seven areas of functioning, 23 (59 %) <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for ADHD, while 16 (41 %) screened positive. A significant association was found between parents who screened either positive or negative for ADHD and functional impairment across five of the seven individual categories namely family, work, self-concept, life-skills and social functioning. CONCLUSION : This study emphasised the high incidence of functional impairment in parents of ADHD children. Although a substantial number of parents <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for ADHD, they still reported impairment in functioning; probably due to undiagnosed ADHD with comorbid psychiatric disorders, and/or parental stress due to the complex behaviour of the child. Parents of children diagnosed with ADHD should be screened for functional impairment followed by referral for psychiatric assessment and parent management training to achieve better clinical outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>negative</b> <b>screening</b> on the {{investment}} universe {{as well as on}} financial performance. We come up with a novel identification process and as such depart from mainstream Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) literature by concentrating on individual firms’ conduct and studying a much wider range of issues. Firstly, we study the size and financial performance of fourteen potentially controversial issues: abortion, adult entertainment, alcohol, animal testing, contraceptives, controversial weapons, fur, gambling, genetic engineering, meat, nuclear power, pork, (embryonic) stem cells, and tobacco. We investigate an international sample of more than 1, 600 stocks for more than twenty years. We then analyze {{the impact of}} applying <b>negative</b> <b>screens</b> to a market portfolio. Our findings suggest that the choice for <b>negative</b> <b>screening</b> strategies does matter for the size of the investment universe as well as for risk-adjusted return performance. Investing in controversial stocks in many cases results in additional risk-adjusted returns, whereas excluding them may reduce financial performance. These findings suggest that there are opportunity costs to <b>negative</b> <b>screening...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Mammography {{screening}} {{increases the}} detec-tion of early-stage breast cancers. Therefore, implementing screening should reduce {{the percentage of}} women who are diagnosed with late-stage disease. However, despite high national mammography screening rates, late-stage breast cancers still occur, possibly because of failures in screening implementation. Methods: Using data from seven health care plans that included 1. 5 million women aged 50 years or older, we conducted retrospective reviews of chart and au-tomated data for 3 years before 1995 – 1999 diagnoses of late-stage (metastatic and/or tumor size> 3 cm; case sub-jects, n 1347) and early-stage breast cancers (control subjects, n 1347). We categorized the earliest screening mammogram during the period 13 – 36 months before diag-nosis as none (absence of <b>screening),</b> <b>negative</b> (absence o...|$|R
