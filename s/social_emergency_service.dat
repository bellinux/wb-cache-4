40|$|Abstract: Infrastructure {{forms the}} {{framework}} within which modern societies operate both at the physical and social level. It includes (amongst others) digital, green and <b>social</b> infrastructures, <b>emergency</b> <b>services</b> and food networks, water, energy, waste and transport. Infrastructure, by its very nature, locks in behaviours. The Liveable Cities research consortium aims to identify and test radical engineering interventions {{that will lead to}} future low carbon, resource secure cities in which societal wellbeing is prioritised, and these will necessarily influence the shape of infrastructure provision. This paper presents a discussion of what comprises a liveable city and how it might be achieved. It presents the City Design Framework, a technique for the analysis of city strategies that establishes a hierarchy of needs relevant to successfully achieving a liveable city. The framework supports changing perceptions of infrastructure since the necessary future changes have the potential to radically alter people’s lifestyle and wellbeing. Citation: Leach, J.

Į. Greitosios medicinos pagalbos (GMP) stoties ir privačios GMP stoties veikla. GMP paslaugų kokybės ir veiklos rodikliai gauti iš GMP kvietimo kortelių, duomenys apie diagnozių sutapimus ir ligonių stacionarizavimą gauti iš GMP siuntimų, o duomenys apie GMP finansinę veiklą Kauno rajone gauti iš finansinių įstaigų ataskaitų. Rezultatai. 2007 m. Kauno rajono tiek privati GMP, tiek valstybinė GMP iki 5 min. greitąją medicinos pagalbą suteikė dešimtadaliui ligonių, kai tuo tarpu pagalbą iki 15 min. reikšmingai didesnei daliai ligonių suteikė privati GMP, lyginant su valstybine GMP, atitinkamai 78, 2 proc. ir 43, 5 proc. Privačios GMP pervežtų į ligonines ir stacionarizuotų ligonių dalis buvo reikšmingai didesnė negu valstybinės GMP, atitinkamai 91, 9 proc. ir 54, 2 proc. Valstybinėje GMP dirbančių gydytojų nustatytų diagnozių nesutapimo procentas buvo reikšmingai didesnis negu privačios GMP dirbančių gydytojų, atitinkamai 6, 4 proc. ir 2, 8 proc. Valstybinė GMP vyko į ligonių pervežimus, nelaimingų atsitikimų vietas bei pas susirgusius asmenis namuose daug dažniau, lyginant su privačia GMP, tačiau pagal vienai GMP brigadai skirtus pervežimus bei pagal vienam etatui tenkančias suteiktas paslaugas privati GMP suteikė iš viso daugiau paslaugų ir vyko pas susirgusius pacientus į namus. Kilometražas, tenkantis vienai GMP paslaugai, taip pat buvo didesnis privačios GMP, lyginant su valstybine GMP teikiant visas paslaugas. Nustatyta, kad gydytojų ir kito GMP personalo, dirbančio valstybinėje GMP įstaigoje, atlyginimų vidurkis per mėnesį buvo reikšmingai didesnis negu dirbančiųjų privačioje GMP įstaigoje. Visos išlaidos 1 GMP paslaugai buvo mažesnės privačioje GMP įstaigoje, išskyrus ligonių pervežimus į kitas ligonines, lyginant su valstybine GMP įstaiga. Bendros išlaidos, tenkančios vienam etatui, o taip pat tenkančios vienam kilometrui kelio iki ligonio, taip buvo mažesnės privačioje GMP įstaigoje, lyginant su valstybine GMP įstaiga. Išvados. Greitosios medicinos pagalbos veiklos kokybės rodikliai bei pagalbos operatyvumas Kauno rajone buvo geresnis privačios GMP įstaigos, lyginant su valstybine GMP įstaiga. Aim of the study. To {{evaluate}} {{the activity of}} public and private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> stations in Kaunas district. Methods.

Results. In Kaunas district in 2007, public as well as private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> provided first medical aid until 5 minutes for one tenth of patients, while until 15 minutes private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> provided first medical aid for significantly bigger proportion of patients, respectively 78. 2 % and 43. 5 %. The proportion of patients who were transported to the hospital and who were hospitalized was significantly bigger of private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> than that of public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> respectively 91. 9 % and 54. 2 %. The proportion of wrong diagnoses in the public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> was significantly bigger than that in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> respectively 6. 4 % and 2. 8 %. The public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> provided patients transportation service, went to the places of accidents and to the ill patients at home more often comparing with private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> However, one prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> team and one staff of private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> provided more services in general and more often provided services for ill patients at home, than that of public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> Mileage for one prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> was bigger in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> while providing all services. Average monthly salary of physicians and other personnel of the public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> was significantly higher than that of personnel working in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> All expenses for one prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> were smaller in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> except patient’s transportation to the other hospitals, comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> General expenses, calculated for one staff and for one kilometer till the patients, were smaller in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> Conclusions.
