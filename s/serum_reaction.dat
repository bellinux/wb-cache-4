40|$|The three <b>serum</b> <b>{{reaction}}</b> tests-Takada 2 ̆ 7 s reaction, cobalt {{reaction and}} cadmium reaction-were performed {{in patients with}} diseases of the liver and bile duct, {{and the results of}} tests were correlated with the plasma protein pattern based on clinical as well as experimental findings. It was revealed that many of the patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver were positive for Takada 2 ̆ 7 s and cobalt reactions, and that an increase in the amount of gamma globulin was the main factor in the phenomenon and a decrease in the amount of albumin expedited it. Al fa and beta globulins, too, had an influence on the two reactions, which did not always occur in the same patient. Heterogenicity of the protein concerned in the reaction was experimentally established in Takada 2 ̆ 7 s reaction, but not in cobalt reaction. Unlike the two reactions described above, cadmium reaction had high positive rate among patients with malignant tumor, and low positive rate among patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. It was observed that al fa and beta glubulins expedited, and albumin and gamma globulin checked, the reaction. However, the fact that the positive rate of this reaction {{had little to do with}} these protein fractions would indicate that, besides protein, some other factor might concern in the reaction.

Comparing the above results with those described in Part II, where the injections were given at the period when WaR turned positive, the following results were obtained: 7) Concerning the 50, 000 U. and 100, 000 U. injected cases, the term needed for the <b>serum</b> <b>reaction</b> to turn negative was prolonged in the cases in which the injections were given at the period when precipitation turned positive, when compared with the cases in which injections were given at the period when WaR turned positive, therforee the time required for the absorption of local state and the disappearance of spirochaeta was also prolonged. 8) In the observation of 200, 000 U. injected cases: WaR turned negative in 42. 6 days after oculation (21. 3 days after inlection), Murata in 56 days (34. 6 days after injection), Kahn in 60. 6 days (39. 3 days after injection) in the cases in which injections were given at the period when WaR turned positive, and in the cases where injections were made at the period when precipitation turned positive, WaR turned negative in 11. 6 days after oculation (7 days after injection), Murata in 28. 0 days (18. 6 days after injection), Kahn in 46. 6 days (37. 3 days after injection), i. e., distinct reduction could be observed in the latter cases. 9) In 200, 000 U. injected cases, a remarkable and regular effect of penicillin could be observed when compared with other 2 groups, and especialy in the cases in which injections were given at the period when the precipitation turned positive the effect was more distinct. 10) In 50, 000 U. and 100, 000 U. injected cases no distinct and regular effect of penicillin could be observed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although rare, <b>serum</b> sickness-like <b>reactions</b> {{have been}} {{documented}} to occur following the administration of many antibiotics. Cefazolin, a first generation cephalosporin, is a commonly prescribed antibiotic which {{is considered to be}} generally safe and well tolerated. There have been no prior reports linking this drug with sickness-like reactions. We report a probable case of <b>serum</b> sickness-like <b>reaction</b> following a single dose of cefazolin. Case Presentation A 23 year old man with no significant past medical history was admitted to undergo a laparoscopic donor nephrectomy as part of a living-related renal transplant. One gram of intravenous cefazolin was administered perioperatively. The surgery was completed without complication and the remainder of his hospital course was uneventful. Ten days following discharge the patient developed fevers, painful and swollen joints, and a cutaneous eruption overlying his trunk and extremities. There was no evidence of systemic vasculitis. These clinical findings were most consistent with a <b>serum</b> sickness-like <b>reaction.</b> A brief course of corticosteroids and antihistaminergic therapy was initiated, and complete resolution of the patient's symptoms followed. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that this adverse drug event was probable. Conclusion <b>Serum</b> sickness-like <b>reaction</b> may be associated with cefazolin therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the report}} of the {{agglutination}} test with Streptococcus by Cecil in 1931 there appeared many reports dealing with the <b>serum</b> <b>reaction</b> involved in rheumatoid arthritis. Among these the modified form of sensitized sheep blood cell agglutination test as proposed by WAALER (1940) and ROSE (1948) had been for a long time the only method applied to the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. However, as this method had disadvantages of its complex manipulation and of being relatively sensitive, generally satisfactory results could not be obtained with it. Since then the latex agglutination test by PLATZ and SINGER (1957) was used in conjuction with the bentonite agglutination test by BOZIEVICH (1957). By the RA-test it means the test where agglutination is attained by the combined reaction of the human serum to be tested and the polystyrene latex granules bound to human gamma-globulin, and it is being widely used in daily clinical examinations. For the purpose to know the positive rate of this test in disesaes other than rheumatoid arthritis, we applied this test to the patients with various diseases both visiting our out-patient clinic and those hospitalized, and studied the results...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{sensitivity}} and specificity of two non-radioactive spot hybridization assays for hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA) using biotin and digoxygenin-labelled DNA probes were investigated in parallel in 122 serum samples from patients with chronic hepatitis B and 50 controls. The results were compared with an isotopic technique using a 32 P-labelled probe. HBV-DNA was detected in 56 (80 %) out of 70 hepatitis B "e " antigen (HBeAg) -positive cases and in 4 (8 %) out of 52 antibody to hepatitis B "e " antigen (anti-HBe) -positive cases using the digoxygenin or 32 P-labelled probes. No false positives were found with either method. Using the biotin-labelled probe, 16 % of sera gave discordant results, which {{were considered to be}} false positive. The time required for detection of serum HBV-DNA was 2 hours for the non-radioactive probes and 16 hours for the isotopic probes.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of the serum of rabbits following intradermal pneumococcus infections to precipitate {{in the presence of}} pneumococcus C polysaccharide has been studied during the resultant periods of active infection and during recovery. In rabbits infected with Type I, III, or VIII pneumococci, large hemorrhagic lesions are produced which frequently bring about death of the animals after a febrile illness of 3 to 4 days. Repeated precipitation tests with the sera of these animals have been uniformly and consistently negative, not only during the acute illness but in the recovery period as well. On the other hand, the sera of monkeys of the Macacus cynomolgos species actively ill with experimental Type III pneumonia have been shown to react in precipitation tests with the C substance. The <b>serum</b> <b>reaction</b> appears within the first 24 hours after infection, remains positive in high titer for 2 to 3 days during the acute illness, and disappears with the onset of recovery. The precipitation reaction with C also occurs with the sera of monkeys following intradermal and intraperitoneal infection with pneumococci. The results of precipitation tests of the serum of monkeys during experimental pneumonia are similar to those obtained with the sera of patients suffering from pneumococcus lobar pneumonia. From the results of these studies it would appear improbable that the demonstration of the serum precipitation phenomenon with C polysaccharide in monkeys, and possibly also in man, is conditioned by previous exposure to pneumococcus antigen...|$|E

40|$|Mice immunized with heat-inactivated, whole yeast-form cells (Y cells) of Candida albicans {{developed}} intense, specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. However, {{they were}} modestly protected against a lethal challenge by the fungus, and their sera did not confer passive protection upon nonimmunized animals. Surprisingly, this immune serum conferred an elevated degree of passive protection to normal and SCID mice when preadsorbed on whole C. albicans cells. After adsorption, no antibodies specific to mannoprotein (MP) -rich extracts or secretions were detected by indirect {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} and no <b>serum</b> <b>reaction</b> with the fungal cell surface was seen in immunofluorescence assays. However, this serum had totally preserved the level of other antibodies, in particular those reacting with β- 1, 3 and β- 1, 6 glucan (GG). The hypothesis that anti-GG antibodies contributed to the passive protection was suggested by the following circumstantial evidence: (i) mice immunized with C. albicans cells treated with dithiothreitol and protease (YDP cells), which exposed GG on their surfaces and generated anti-GG but not anti-MP antibodies, were substantially protected against a lethal fungus challenge; (ii) the sera, and their immunoglobulin fractions, of mice immunized with YDP cells transferred protection to nonimmune animals; and (iii) this passive protection was substantially abolished by preadsorption on GG but not on intact cells. Overall, our findings demonstrate that some anti-Candida antibodies can block the protective potential of immune serum, a potential to which anti-GG antibodies appear to contribute. Our observations may also help explain why subjects with elevated anti-Candida antibody titers, inclusive of anti-MP and anti-GG antibodies, remain nonetheless susceptible to invasive candidiasis...|$|E

Synthetic DNA fragments and human antibody constant region cDNA were used to construct two CMV promotor-based expression vectors for the antibody light and heavy chains, in which the variable region was connected directly to the constant region without an intron sequence. Completely assembled humanized antibody was successfully expressed in mammalian cells as IgG 1 kappa molecules and purified using protein A affinity column.

Hence the interrelationship between the several yeasts was examined by the writers by means of the reactions of agglutination, precipitin and complement fixation. The yeasts used were as follows: Endomyces fibuliger Lindner, Zygosaccharomyces Barkeri Saccardo-Sydow, Debaryomyces globosus Klecker, Saccharomyces sake Yabe (sake yeast), bottom beer yeast 2 ̆ 2 Asahi, 2 ̆ 2 Schizosaccharomyces octosporus Beijerinek and Torula C. Yeasts which are included in different genera according to the botanical classification, were clearly distinguished from each other by the agglutinin test.

40|$|Background: The {{possibility}} that a sub domain of a C clade HIV- 1 gp 120 could act as an effective immunogen was investigated. To do this, the outer domain (OD) of gp 120 (CN 54) was expressed and characterized in a construct marked by a re-introduced conformational epitope for MAb 2 G 12. The expressed sequence showed efficient epitope retention on the isolated ODCN 54 suggesting authentic folding. To facilitate purification and subsequent immunogenicity ODCN 54 was fused to the Fc domain of human IgGl. Mice were immunised with the resulting fusion proteins and also with gp 120 (CN 54) -Fc and gp 120 alone. Results: Fusion to Fc was found to stimulate antibody titre and Fc tagged ODCN 54 was substantially more immunogenic than non-tagged gp 120. Immunogenicity appeared the result of Fc facilitated antigen processing as immunisation with an Fc domain mutant that reduced binding to the FcR lead {{to a reduction in}} antibody titre when compared to the parental sequence. The breadth of the antibody response was assessed by <b>serum</b> <b>reaction</b> with five overlapping fragments of gp 120 (CN 54) expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria. A predominant anti-inner domain and anti-V 3 C 3 response was observed following immunisation with gp 120 (CN 54) -Fc and an anti-V 3 C 3 response to the ODCN 54 -Fc fusion. Conclusion: The outer domain of gp 120 (CN 54) is correctly folded following expression as a C terminal fusion protein. Immunogenicity is substantial when targeted to antigen presenting cells but shows V 3 dominance in the polyvalent response. The gp 120 outer domain has potential as a candidate vaccine component...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{generation}} of antibodies is impaired in newborns {{due to an}} immature immune system and reduced exposure to pathogens due to maternally derived antibodies and placental functions. During nursing, the immune system of newborns is challenged with multiple milk-derived proteins. Amongst them, caseins are the main constituent. In particular, human aS 1 -casein (CSN 1 S 1) was recently shown to possess immunomodulatory properties. We were thus interested to determine if auto-antibodies to CSN 1 S 1 are induced by breast-feeding and may be sustained into adulthood. Methods: 62 sera of healthy adult individuals who were (n = 37) or were not (n = 25) breast-fed against human CSN 1 S 1 were investigated by a new SD (surface display) -ELISA. For cross-checking, these sera were tested for anti Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies by a commercial ELISA. Results: IgG-antibodies were predominantly detected in individuals who had been nursed. At a cut-off value of 0. 4, the SDELISA identified individuals {{with a history of}} having been breast-fed with a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 92 %. Under these conditions, 35 out of 37 sera from healthy donors, who where breast-fed, reacted positively but only 5 sera of the 25 donors who were not breast-fed. The duration of breast-feeding was of no consequence to the antibody reaction as some healthy donors were only short term breast-fed (5 days minimum until 6 weeks maximum), but exhibited significant <b>serum</b> <b>reaction</b> against human CSN 1 S 1 nonetheless. Conclusion: We postulate that human CSN 1 S 1 is an autoantigen. The antigenicity is orally determined, caused by breastfeeding, and sustained into adulthood...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{possibility}} that a sub domain of a C clade HIV- 1 gp 120 could act as an effective immunogen was investigated. To do this, the outer domain (OD) of gp 120 CN 54 was expressed and characterized in a construct marked by a re-introduced conformational epitope for MAb 2 G 12. The expressed sequence showed efficient epitope retention on the isolated OD CN 54 suggesting authentic folding. To facilitate purification and subsequent immunogenicity OD CN 54 was fused to the Fc domain of human IgG 1. Mice were immunised with the resulting fusion proteins and also with gp 120 CN 54 -Fc and gp 120 alone. Results Fusion to Fc was found to stimulate antibody titre and Fc tagged OD CN 54 was substantially more immunogenic than non-tagged gp 120. Immunogenicity appeared the result of Fc facilitated antigen processing as immunisation with an Fc domain mutant that reduced binding to the FcR lead {{to a reduction in}} antibody titre when compared to the parental sequence. The breadth of the antibody response was assessed by <b>serum</b> <b>reaction</b> with five overlapping fragments of gp 120 CN 54 expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria.

5000|$|The {{reaction}} generally {{includes a}} constellation of fever; urticarial polycyclic wheals (a rash that can look similar to hives with small swellings that overlap each other [...] ) with central clearing on the trunk, extremities, face, and lateral borders of the hands and feet; oral edema without mucosal involvement; lymphadenopathy; arthralgias; myalgias; and mild proteinuria. Case reports have noted the absence of fever in <b>serum</b> sickness-like <b>reactions</b> to amoxicillin. Laboratory abnormalities include normal or mild decreases in serum C3, C4, and CH50 levels, and mild proteinuria.1,3-5 In contrast to true serum sickness, renal and hepatic involvement is rare.

40|$|The M antigen, {{a primary}} {{determinant}} of virulence in group A streptococci that is expressed biologically as resistance to phagocytosis, {{is known to}} undergo a variety of phenotypic changes both in vivo and in vitro. These changes are nonrandom and can occur at a high frequency. Using the previously described relationship between the <b>serum</b> opacity <b>reaction</b> (associated with certain strains) {{and the presence of}} the M antigen, the phenotypic instability of the M antigen was analyzed. The results support the conclusion that M protein synthesis and the <b>serum</b> opacity <b>reaction</b> are directly or indirectly controlled by the same gene or by genes which are linked and can segregate as a unit. Moreover, growth conditions and the curing agents rifampin and ethidium bromide had a discernible influence on the segregation of clones unable to exhibit serum opacity factor and to resist phagocytosis by human leukocytes. Serial transfer of stationary-phase cultures of four strains of group A streptococci significantly increased the number of colonies negative for the <b>serum</b> opacity <b>reaction</b> and the M antigen. For two of four strains both ethidium bromide and rifampin also increased the segregation of colonies with this phenotype. In light of these experiments and the necessary controls, the possible influence of plasmids or bacteriophage in regulating M protein synthesis is discussed...|$|R
