25|$|The {{basic concept}} of the mineral <b>sizer</b> {{is the use of}} two rotors with large teeth, on small {{diameter}} shafts, driven at a low speed by a direct high torque drive system. This design produces three major principles which all interact when breaking materials using <b>sizer</b> technology. The unique principles are the three-stage breaking action, the rotating screen effect, and the deep scroll tooth pattern.|$|E

40|$|Background. Is {{the use of}} {{intraoperative}} breast <b>sizers</b> {{beneficial for}} plastic surgeons or do they result in higher complication rates? Methods. This is a retrospective study of 416 consecutive cases of primary breast augmentation with silicone implants at the Plastic Surgery Service of Professor Ivo Pitanguy at the 38 th Infirmary Santa Casa Misericórdia Hospital, Rio De Janeiro, from January 2011 to March 2014. 212 cases (51 %) were carried out with use of intraoperative breast <b>sizers</b> with 204 cases (49 %) {{without the use of}} implant <b>sizers.</b> This study compares the outcome of cases that employed the use of intraoperative implant <b>sizers</b> versus those that did not in terms of infection, hematoma/seroma formation, and capsular contracture. Results. Of 416 primary breast augmentation cases, there were 5 cases of infection (1. 2 %), 4 cases of seroma (1 %), 3 cases of hematoma (0. 7 %), and 7 cases of capsular contracture (Baker’s Grade III/IV) (1. 7 %). Total complication rate limited to infection, seroma, hematoma, and capsular contracture was 1. 15 % (95 % CI 0. 96 – 1. 93 %). There was {{a significant difference in the}} scores for breast <b>sizers</b> (M = 4. 3, SD = 1. 4) and no breast <b>sizers</b> (M = 2. 3, SD = 0. 87) conditions, t(8) = 2. 79, p= 0. 018. The use of implant <b>sizers</b> was correlated with a higher complication rate. Conclusion. Good results could be obtained without the use of breast <b>sizers</b> in primary breast augmentation with use of a biodimensional tissue based planning system while eliminating risks of infection and reducing intraoperative time. Notwithstanding, in a residency program breast <b>sizers</b> can be an excellent training tool to shorten the learning curve in the novice surgeon...|$|R

25|$|A {{gridiron}} is a metal grate with {{parallel bars}} typically used for grilling meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It {{may also be}} two such grids, hinged to fold together, to securely hold food while grilling over an open flame. Gridironing is often performed outdoors, using charcoal (real wood or preformed briquettes), wood, or propane gas. The earliest gridiron was a combination hinged gridiron and spider co-invented in 1836 by Amasa and George <b>Sizer</b> of Meriden, Connecticut. U.S. Patent #78 was issued to them jointly on November 14, 1836. The next advancement in the gridiron was a steel wire one was invented and patented in 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins, of the New Haven Wire Goods Company, who received U.S. Patent #408,136 on July 30, 1889, for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. A new {{technique}} of implantation of high-density porous polyethylene nasal dorsal implants in Asians {{is described in}} this paper. Silicone <b>sizers,</b> which have smooth surfaces, were used to facilitate implantation of porous polyethylene implants in Asian patients. Materials and Methods. Twenty-three patients of Asian descent underwent dorsal augmentation rhinoplasty with open technique using high-density porous polyethylene implants. In all cases, silicone <b>sizers</b> were used to facilitate implantations of high-density porous polyethylene nasal dorsal implants. Patient selection criteria exclude patients with history of cocaine use, history of nasal or sinus disorders, previous nasal surgery, deviated septum, poor cartilage support, and thin skin. Results. No bleeding, infection, rejection, displacement, or extrusion was noted. One implant was removed because of a patient's dissatisfaction with the resulting tip height. Conclusion. The use of silicone <b>sizers</b> to facilitate implantations of high-density porous polyethylene nasal dorsal implants was safe and efficacious...|$|R

2500|$|Thus, Cln3 {{seems to}} be the size sensor in budding yeast, as it {{exhibits}} the necessary properties of a translational <b>sizer</b> and is the most upstream regulator of Start. A critical question remains, however, as to how its activity is rendered size dependent. As noted above, any translational size sensor should be at constant concentration, and thus constant activity, in the cytoplasm as cells grow. In order to detect its size, the cell must compare the absolute number of <b>sizer</b> molecules to some non-growing standard, with the genome the obvious choice for such a standard. It was originally thought that yeast accomplished this with Cln3 by localizing it (and its target, Whi5) to the nucleus: nuclear volume was assumed to scale with genome content, so that an increasing concentration of Cln3 in the nucleus could indicate increasing Cln3 molecules relative to the genome. However, the nucleus has recently been shown to grow during G1, irrespective of genome content, undermining this model. Recent experiments have suggested that Cln3 activity could be titrated directly against genomic DNA, through its DNA-bound interaction with SBF-Whi5 complexes. Finally, other models exist that do not rely on comparison of Cln3 levels to DNA. One posits a non-linear relationship between total translation rate and Cln3 translation rate caused by an Upstream open reading frame; [...] another suggests that the increase in Cln3 activity at the end of G1 relies on competition for the chaperone protein Ydj1, which otherwise holds Cln3 molecules in the Endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

2500|$|The {{model of}} budding yeast size control, {{in which a}} {{threshold}} size for Start entry is detected by a translational size sensor, required a [...] "sizer" [...] protein; the properties of Cln3 made it the prime candidate for that role {{from the time of}} its discovery. First, it was a critical Start activator, as G1 length varied inversely with Cln3 expression and activity levels. Second, it was expressed nearly constitutively throughout the cell cycle and in G1 in particular—unusual for cyclins, which (as their name suggests) oscillate in expression with the cell cycle. These two properties meant that Cln3 could serve as a Start activator that depended on total translation rate. Finally, Cln3 was also shown to be highly unstable, the third necessary property of a translational <b>sizer</b> (as discussed above).|$|E

2500|$|Lawrie had {{a number}} of criticisms, feeling the eagle's head and feet were more like those of a hawk, and that the stars between the eagle {{and the name of the}} country were so small as to be indistinguishable.

University of Chicago sociologists Fay-Cooper Cole and Mandel Sherman described how the small valley communities or hollows had existed [...] "without contact with law or government" [...] for centuries, which some analogized to a popular comic strip Lil Abner and his fictional community Dogpatch.
