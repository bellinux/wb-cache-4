40|$|Abstract This study {{compared}} 80 gay and <b>straight</b> Aus-tralian <b>males</b> on self report {{measures of}} body satisfaction, masculinity, femininity, narcissism, and reasons for exer-cising at gyms to explore {{factors related to}} excessive exercise. Gay males are less satisfied with their bodies compared to <b>straight</b> <b>males.</b> Improving appearance was more important for gay men, while fun was considered more important for straight men. Only sexual orientation and masculinity contributed independently to body satis-faction. <b>Straight</b> <b>males</b> who scored high on masculinity were most satisfied with their bodies, while gay males who scored low on masculinity were least satisfied with their bodies, irrespective of femininity and narcissism. Hours exercising per week and fun {{as a reason for}} exercising, significantly contributed to body satisfaction...|$|R

5000|$|Footage {{was shot}} to present {{potentially}} erotic encounters designed for a heterosexual woman and a gay man, but space restrictions led the producers to cut them, leaving only material geared for a <b>straight</b> <b>male.</b> Much press criticism was leveled at the product because of this limited orientation.|$|R

5000|$|Nina is {{the most}} nonchalant member of Aoi House. She is also {{seemingly}} the least concerned about having two <b>straight</b> <b>male</b> housemates, as she at times continues to walk around without her shirt on regardless {{of the fact that}} she now has two <b>straight</b> <b>male</b> housemates. She also makes a habit of smoking where she is not supposed to. She is also a member of the swim team and practices synchronized swimming. Adam Arnold stated that Nina {{is the most}} [...] "macho" [...] of the Aoi House girls, and she also has the smallest bust. Nina apparently works at Sandy's and Maria's bookstore in the epilogue, but since she is still a slacker, Helena and Victor seem to do her job for her. This attitude is most likely why they let Sanae drag off Nina from time to time.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{the truth}} is {{revealed}} that Sandy and Alex are not truly gay anime fans but two <b>straight</b> <b>males,</b> the girls have some fun with Sandy and Alex {{in an attempt to}} turn them into yaoi-lovers, or at least make them the lodge's token gay couple. Sandy and Alex learn that Morgan, who made the flyer, left a few important details off the flyer - the most important being that [...] "AOI House" [...] was really [...] "YAOI House," [...] a college yaoi-otaku club turned sorority using Greek letters to covertly express their hobby - the [...] "Y" [...] had fallen off the sign - and <b>straight</b> ("perverted") <b>male</b> roommates were not what the girls were looking for (at least at first). On top of all of this, Echiboo almost gets them into deep trouble (again) by escaping from his cage and crawling amongst a pile of Elle's panties. Elle was already dead-set against allowing two <b>straight</b> <b>males</b> to join [...] "Aoi House." [...] Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) for Sandy and Alex, Nina allows them to stay, while Jessica points out to an irate Elle that [...] "Aoi House" [...] needs members in order to keep their house as much as Sandy and Alex need lodging.|$|R

This custom can be motivated by reasons of potentially increased cleanliness and hygiene, heightened enjoyment during fellatio and analingus, and/or the desire to take on a more youthful appearance.|$|R
25|$|Upon seeing {{photographs}} of straight, gay, and bisexual people, participants correctly identified gay versus <b>straight</b> <b>males</b> and females at above-chance levels {{based solely on}} seeing a picture of their face, however, bisexual targets were only identified at chance.

25|$|Demographically, Nordling et al.'s (2006) {{study found}} no {{differences}} in age, but 43% of gay male respondents compared to 29% of <b>straight</b> <b>males</b> had university level education. The gay men also had higher incomes than the general population, and tended to work in white collar jobs while straight men tended toward blue collar ones. Because there were not enough female respondents (22), no conclusions could be drawn from them.|$|R
