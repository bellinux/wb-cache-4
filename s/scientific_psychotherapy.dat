5000|$|Borch-Jacobsen then reaffirmed that Sigmund Freud, {{after having}} started to use suggestive {{hypnotic}} psychotherapy on Hippolyte Bernheim in 1887 {{replaced it with}} the cathartic method in 1899, no longer using hypnosis {{as a means of}} direct suggestion, but to bring out suppressed feelings of patients' traumas. After practicing using free association in 1892, Freud totally abandoned hypnosis at the end of 1896. This is explained in the following manner by Chertok: [...] "" [...] ("In his opposition to hypnosis, Freud was known to have founded a <b>scientific</b> <b>psychotherapy,</b> destined, as such, to become the psychotherapy par excellence. The interpretation and the capture of consciousness thus becomes the fulcrum of the cure. The effectiveness of the new method certainly could not be discounted, but in it one can find it being channelled into transference, and by that, come to dominate the consciousness and put it to work. Such was the ambition of the Founder of Psychoanalysis Freud, and {{the turn of the century}} was once again filled with positivity"). It is precisely this posture of Freud's that the consciousness is [...] "dominated" [...] that was put into question by Borch-Jacobsen.|$|E

40|$|Expressive virtual {{audiences are}} used in <b>scientific</b> research, <b>psychotherapy,</b> and training. To create an {{expressive}} virtual audience, developers {{need to know how}} specific audience behaviors are associated with certain characteristics of an audience, such as attitude, and how well people can recognize these characteristics. To examine this, four studies were conducted on a virtual audience and its behavioral models: (I) a perception study of a virtual audience showed that people (n = 24) could perceive changes in some of the mood, personality, and attitude parameters of the virtual audience; (II) a design experiment whereby individuals (n = 24) constructed 23 different audience scenarios indicated that the understanding of audience styles was consistent across individuals, and the clustering of similar settings of the virtual audience parameters revealed five distinct generic audience styles; (III) a perception validation study of these five audience styles showed that people (n = 100) could differentiate between some of the styles, and the audience’s attentiveness was the most dominating audience characteristic that people perceived; (IV) the examination of the behavioral model of the virtual audience identified several typical audience behaviors for each style. We anticipate that future developers can use these findings to create distinct virtual audiences with recognizable behaviors...|$|R

This thesis - held in high regard by Wolfgang Metzger - shows that Gestalt theory is an appropriate framework to integrate the methods and merits of many other psychotherapeutic schools, especially the analytic and the humanistic ones. This work has appeared in 1994 in its third and enlarged edition under the title Gestalt Theorie und Psychotherapy.

Due to the theoretical analysis of psycho physiological theories, which methodologically substantiated the development of emotional and expressive sides of children’s speech by means of active music therapy and the interaction of speech and music as the related, mutually influencing at each other sign and semiotic kinds of activity are considered. It is noted that music makes an impact on a person as the rhythmic and emotiogenic irritant. The onto psychology as the modern direction of <b>scientific</b> psychology and <b>psychotherapy</b> which study the deep reasons of mental activity including ontologic aspects of human life is presented. The onto music therapy as the direction of active music therapy which include the rhythm, movement, action in singing, sound, dance that are born {{in direct contact with}} a person and aimed at removals of tension, creative potential increase, creativeness of the preschool child is shown. The stage-by-stage development of the emotional and expressive sides of speech by means of an onto music therapy directed on stabilization of a psycho emotional state, development of informative processes of the preschool age children is presented...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICTs) are devices, services and knowledge that reproduce, process and distribute information. Psychotherapy has {{been influenced by}} these technologies, {{and there is a}} tendency for their role to expand. Objective: To describe the current panorama of the <b>scientific</b> literature on <b>psychotherapy</b> and ICTs. Method: This is a systematic and descriptive review. Searches were run on the electronic databases Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (BVS), PsycINFO, Scopus, PePSIC, ScienceDirect and Index Psi, using the Boolean operator AND and the descriptors psychotherapy, computers, Internet, cell phones and social networks. Results: A considerable volume of empirical research was found, published recently in many different parts of the world, especially in the United States. There is very little Brazilian research on the subject. The majority of the studies identified assess the efficacy or describe the development of techniques and psychotherapies, via ICTs, for prevention, diagnosis or treatment of mental and behavioral disorders. The psychopathology most investigated in this area is depression and {{it was not possible to}} draw conclusions on a possible trend for research into the subject to increase. The technology most investigated was the Internet and cognitive-behavioral therapy was the most common theoretical approach in these studies. Conclusions:Systematic reviews of published studies can detect gaps in the research agenda within a specific field of knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Background The <b>scientific</b> {{recognition}} of <b>psychotherapy</b> by the German Advisory Board for Psychotherapy is mainly {{based on the}} evaluation of the empirical evidence of psychotherapeutic treatments. The aim of the <b>scientific</b> {{recognition of}} <b>psychotherapy</b> is to examine to which extend efficacy and effectiveness studies are based on scientific methods and research strategies. For this purpose, the German Advisory Board published the new guidelines for scientific evaluation and <b>scientific</b> recognition of <b>psychotherapy</b> (WBP, 2007, 2010). A key component of these guidelines is a catalogue of criteria, based on three dimensions, which evaluates the general scientific quality, the internal and the external validity of efficacy and effectiveness studies. Purpose The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the criteria of the internal validity dimension and of the general scientific quality dimension concerning their appropriateness to evaluate studies of long-term psychoanalytic treatments. In this regard, the criteria catalogue is viewed as an assessment measure, which has to prove itself in its practical application (cf. Leichsenring, 2008). This approach is relevant in the context of the modification of the statement concerning the scientific status of psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychotherapy: In 2008 the Scientific Advisory Board extended the scientific recognition of psychodynamic/psychoanalytic psychotherapy by also including psychoanalytic long-term treatments (> 100 sessions) (WBP, 2008 a). This modification is justified by the development and publication of the new guidelines mentioned above. Concurrently, long-term treatments as research object, in contrast to short-term treatments, are considered difficult to evaluate by principles of the RCT-methodology. Therefore, it is to assume that criteria of the internal validity dimension, which are based solely on the principles of the RCT-methodology, would be neither applicable nor appropriate to long-term psychotherapy studies. In that case the criteria would cause a discriminatory evaluation of these studies compared to short-term psychotherapy studies. Method First, an exhaustive review of the literature was done to collect all empirical evidence available for efficacy and effectiveness of psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychotherapy published between 1999 and 2009. The collected studies had to include adult clients with mood disorders or mixed samples of clients. In the second step, {{the evaluation of the}}se studies was conducted by using the criteria catalogue. To get an overall idea about the criteria, which might not be appropriate to evaluate long-term psychotherapy studies, long-term psychotherapy studies and short-term psychotherapy studies were systematically compared on each criterion (1 = “sufficient” to 3 = “insufficient”). When distributions showed more long-term psychotherapy studies with insufficient results in comparison to short-term psychotherapy studies, this was regarded as a preliminary indication of a potential discriminatory impact of the specified criterion. For those criteria a more refined analysis was performed to determine the exact reasons responsible for the unequal distributions regarding the long-term studies. This refined analysis contained both: 1) an intensive review of the long-term psychotherapy studies with poor results and 2) a review of the literature on evaluation research in general and psychotherapy research in particular. This procedure helps to identify whether “long-term psychotherapy” as research object caused the poor results on the criteria – in that case, the found criteria had to be regarded as discriminatory criteria concerning long-term psychotherapy studies. Otherwise, if it could be shown that the reasons responsible for the poor results do not plausibly interrelate with “long-term psychotherapy” as research object, the criteria were not regarded as discriminatory concerning long-term psychotherapy studies. Findings Both, the analyzed scientific quality criteria and the internal validity criteria reveal relatively few unequal distributions of the studies to the disadvantage of the long-term psychotherapy studies which required subsequent refined analyses. Moreover, the conducted refined analyses showed that just few of the criteria effectively have discriminatory impact. In total, three of the 12 criteria of the internal validity dimension could be disclosed as discriminatory concerning long-term psychotherapy studies. Further along it could be shown that the criteria catalogue lacks adequate criteria measuring internal validity of studies without control condition (one-group pretest posttest design) and also of comparative outcome studies comparing two (or more) alternative psychotherapy conditions. Conclusions The Scientific Advisory Board has been mainly successful in developing criteria that are adequate to measure the scientific quality and the internal validity of outcome studies investigating the efficacy or effectiveness of psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychotherapy. This is also true for psychoanalytic long-term psychotherapy (> 100 sessions). In this study a concept that emphasizes the complementary relationship of the internal and the external validity rather than an inverse relationship is assumed. Deriving from this concept, strategies are discussed that are suitable to assure the internal validity in both, one-group pretest posttest designs and comparative outcome studies. The integration of internal validity criteria concerning the last mentioned study designs could be a positive incentive for future implementations of efficacy and effectiveness studies...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of psychotherapy {{for the treatment}} of most mental disorders is empirically very convincingly documented; however, there are not enough therapists by far available globally to enable all people suffering from mental disorders to be adequately provided with psychotherapy. Aims and methods: Considerations are made regarding which illnesses, disorders and problems in general should be treated by means of psychotherapy, who should best conduct the treatment and in which way the dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapeutic approaches could be improved in spite of scarce resources. Results: The more severely pronounced a health problem is, the greater is normally the therapeutic benefit of a given intervention. This applies to psychotherapy as well; however, to date severely ill people in particular are often not treated with effective psychotherapeutic interventions. One of the reasons is that there are only few validated treatment protocols for multimorbid patients with both mental and physical illnesses. Another reason is that treatment of such patients requires specific medical knowledge as well as other special skills and experiences that not all psychotherapists have at their command. Conclusion: The indications for psychotherapy should always be made with a sense of proportion, taking into consideration the currently available scientific evidence and clinical experience. In the future, the training of psychotherapists, <b>scientific</b> investigations of <b>psychotherapies</b> and clinical service provision should increasingly concentrate on patients with severe mental disorders and/or with psychological and physical comorbidities...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we dispute what seems an obvious truism these days: that {{increasing}} {{the influence of}} <b>scientific</b> research on <b>psychotherapy</b> is a good thing. We begin with an exploration of two distinct capacities that contribute in significant ways to human flourishing: knowledge and love. We then argue that modern society rather onesidedly capitalizes on the growth of scientific knowledge. This has an important drawback because the dominant model of growth presupposed in scientific research is built {{on the idea of}} reducing the potentially disturbing influence of the subjective engagement of the scientist with the object of knowledge. This is ordinarily quite a fruitful idea that has, however, paradoxically bad effects in evidence-based therapy. This is the case, we argue, because in a scientifically informed therapy the therapist should, in some sense, try to be blind to the effects of his expertise on his clients’ expectations of his expertise. A scientific, disengaged perspective therefore frustrates the therapist’s need to invest in the formation of a charitable relationship with his clients. Next we argue that the popular prejudice against love ‐ that it is blind ‐ is not as plausible as it is considered to be. To be sure, love invites cognition to accept a subservient role, but, we argue, this has some advantages too. It encourages the lover to discern particularly positive and promising features of the object of his love, and this, we argue, is crucial to a successful therapy in two ways. On the one hand, the therapist needs to engage with these positive and promising features to succeed in building the needed charitable relationship with his clients. And on the other hand clients often go into therapy because they lack access to their own positive and promising features and are therefore unable to entertain a charitable relationship with themselves. We conclude that with respect to psychotherapy there might be good reason for contemporary society to capitalize on the growth of love, rather than the growth of knowledge...|$|R
