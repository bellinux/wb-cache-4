25|$|The mosque {{received}} its permanent certificate of occupancy on August 23 after the county completed its inspections {{of the new}} building. However, the litigation continued as the mosque's opponents sought {{to intervene in the}} federal case and the county continued its appeal to a higher state court against Chancellor Corlew's May decision. The litigation against the mosque's opening finally came to an end on June 2, 2014 when a bid by opponents to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court of the United States was rebuffed, with the court declining to take the case.

One positive outcome of the dispute, according to a <b>spokesperson</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Nashville-based <b>American</b> Center <b>for</b> Outreach, was that it had prompted local Muslims to build closer ties to local interfaith groups and become more engaged in the community, from which they had received a great deal of support.|$|R

50|$|Most North American {{retailers}} did {{not sign}} the accord. Companies like Gap Inc. and Walmart cited liability concerns. According to <b>spokespersons</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> retail industry, <b>American</b> courts, which allow class actions, contingent fees, {{and do not}} require losing plaintiffs to pay legal fees, might permit liability claims against retailers {{in the event of}} another disaster which might result in substantial enforceable judgments, in contrast to European courts which generally do not allow class actions, forbid contingent fees, and require losing plaintiffs to pay winning defendants' legal fees and costs. However, as John C. Coffee, professor of corporate law at Columbia Law School, pointed out, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. might apply thus foreclosing suits by Bangladesh workers under the Alien Tort Claims Act, but this seems unlikely. It is more likely that liability would be based on contract law.|$|R
