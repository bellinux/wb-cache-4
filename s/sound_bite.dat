5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E

The site also featured a daily weather report, where Lynch gives {{a brief description}} of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resides. Until June 2010, this weather report (usually no longer than 30seconds) was also being broadcast on his personal YouTube channel, David Lynch – Daily Weather Report. An absurd ringtone ("I like to kill deer") from the website was a common <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> on The Howard Stern Show in early 2006.|$|E

500|$|Mischief Makers {{received}} [...] "mixed or average reviews", {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic, and a [...] "Gold Hall of Fame" [...] score of 32/40 from Japanese magazine Famitsu. Critics praised the game's inventiveness, personality, [...] "variety", and boss fights, and criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low replay value, sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers {{disagreed with the}} game's originally poor reception, and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature [...] "Shake, shake!" [...] <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> as a highlight. Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game their silver award.|$|E

Video game journalists cited Mischief Makers as ripe for reissue either through the Nintendo eShop or in a sequel or franchise reboot. In 2009, GamesRadar called it [...] "possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64".|$|E
500|$|Many critics noted Several {{songs are}} built on the same formula of [...] "You're a Jerk", with Allmusic noting that, [...] "Dot Com," [...] "Colors," [...] "Turnt," [...] and [...] "So Dope" [...] (which the chorus is a <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> from the 1992 film Class Act) all have the cheesy drum machines, samples, and off-kilter lyric {{approach}} that make [...] "Jerk" [...] so good. The review also said [...] "R ballad [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] featuring smooth Auto-tuned vocals from Ray J, the B.A.S.S.-inspired [...] "Bunz", the slow jam [...] "New Girl," [...] and the rollicking [...] "Cashmere," [...] which bumps along like a New Jack rap jam, are nice diversions." [...] On the album split, The Los Angeles Times said, [...] "The album begins to lose circulation toward its end, when the pair lose their lambent wit in favor of mawkish lover-boy ballads better left to Sean Kingston albums." [...] Jeff Weiss of the newspaper used [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] as an example, noting that its sounds have [...] "a saccharine sappiness and contrived tone that feels {{at odds with the}} otherwise organic-sounding album." ...|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{commented on}} the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, [...] "Eminem's music {{contains}} more than {{its fair share of}} misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> to explain him away." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing [...] "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that [...] "the wife-killing jokes of [...] "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is [...] "sophomoric and uninspired" [...] at times, Eminem's [...] "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least {{a breath of fresh air}} in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas." [...] Mike Rubin of Spin noted that [...] "his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are." [...] Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that [...] "Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together." ...|$|E

The segment used the <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> of Strong saying the documents were compatible with how business was done but did not include a disclaimer that Strong was told to assume the documents were authentic.|$|E

2500|$|George Bush {{was widely}} seen as a [...] "pragmatic caretaker" [...] {{president}} who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts. Indeed, Bush's <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> where he refers {{to the issue of}} overarching purpose as [...] "the vision thing" [...] has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties. [...] "He does not say why he wants to be there", wrote columnist George Will, [...] "so the public does not know why it should care if he gets his way".|$|E
2500|$|Santer, {{desiring}} a quotable slogan for his administration, stated his Commissions aim {{would be}} [...] "to do less, {{but do it}} better" [...] (a slogan adopted and adapted by many since). Although just a <b>sound</b> <b>bite,</b> it touched a chord for some thinking the Community needed a rest after the new treaties and the euro, even if {{the nature of the}} Community itself requires movements and new projects to keep it busy. However, during 1998 the Commission began to lose authority due to management criticisms from the Parliament.|$|E

2500|$|Ros-Lehtinen {{has stirred}} {{controversy}} {{by calling for}} the assassination of Cuban Leader Fidel Castro. She appeared in a British documentary, which was [...] entitled 638 Ways to Kill Castro, saying: [...] "I welcome the opportunity of having anyone assassinate Fidel Castro and any leader who is oppressing the people." [...] After a 28-second clip began circulating on the Internet, she claimed the filmmakers spliced clips together to get the <b>sound</b> <b>bite.</b> Twenty-four hours after the controversy erupted, director Dollan Cannell sent unedited tapes of his interview with Ros-Lehtinen to reporters. The uncut version contradicted her response, showing she had twice welcomed an attempt on Castro's life. Although she attempted to distance herself from her denial, filmmaker Cannell requested an apology.|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 1999, {{after a year}} at WARW (now WIAD), Tracht made {{a comment}} about James Byrd, who was murdered in 1998 by being dragged behind a pickup truck by three men, two {{determined}} to be white supremacists. The day before, jurors had convicted John William King of Byrd's murder. Tracht had been playing a <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> of Lauryn Hill who had ten nominations at the 41st Grammy Awards. Tracht then stated, [...] "No wonder people drag them behind trucks." [...] After the comment, he immediately stated that he [...] "didn't mean nothin'." [...] This incident proved catastrophic to his radio career, igniting a firestorm of protest from listeners of all races, including Donnie Simpson, who savaged Tracht on his morning show on sister station WPGC-FM. Not only was Tracht quickly fired from WARW, but he also lost his position as a volunteer Deputy Sheriff in Falls Church, Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|To {{define their}} music, Pere Ubu {{coined the term}} avant-garage to reflect {{interest}} in both experimental avant-garde music (especially musique concrète) and raw, direct blues-influenced garage rock. Thomas has stated the term is [...] "a joke invented {{to have something to}} give journalists when they yelp for a neat <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> or [...] ". Their music has been called art-punk and post-punk. Their songs imagined 1950s and 1960s garage rock and surf music archetypes as seen in a distorting funhouse mirror, emphasising the music's angst, loneliness and lyrical paranoia. Sometimes sounding like a demented nursery rhyme sing-along, this already bizarre blend was overlaid with Ravenstine's ominous EML synthesizer effects and tape looped sounds of mundane conversation, ringing telephones or steam whistles. Their propulsive rhythmic pulse was similar to Krautrock, but Thomas's yelping, howling, desperate singing was and still is peculiar when compared to most other rock and roll singers.|$|E
