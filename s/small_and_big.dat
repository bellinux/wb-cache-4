5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>big,</b> in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E

25|$|Hold 'em is {{normally}} played using <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>big</b> blind bets— forced bets by two players. Antes (forced contributions by all players) {{may be used}} in addition to blinds, particularly in later stages of tournament play. A dealer button is used to represent the player in the dealer position; the dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, changing the position of the dealer and blinds. The small blind is posted by the player {{to the left of the}} dealer and is usually equal to half of the big blind. The big blind, posted by the player to the left of the small blind, is equal to the minimum bet. In tournament poker, the blind/ante structure periodically increases as the tournament progresses. After one round of betting is done, the next betting round will start by the person in the small blind.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Ranaut {{established}} {{herself in}} Hindi cinema when she featured alongside Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Haydon in the coming-of-age dramedy Queen; she also co-wrote the dialogues with Anvita Dutt Guptan. The film {{tells the story}} of Rani, a naive girl who embarks on her honeymoon alone after her fiancé calls off their wedding. Ranaut, who describes herself as [...] "independent and confident", reflected that the role was one of the toughest she had played, as the character's personality traits contrasted with her own. The film and Ranaut's performance received unanimous acclaim from critics. Devesh Sharma of Filmfare wrote that the fact that she [...] "flits from one aspect of her character to another without breaking stride shows her maturity as an actor. Her efforts make you clap for Rani's <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>big</b> victories, you root for her character to come up trumps and are glad about the glorious transformation at the end." [...] With a worldwide total of , the film also emerged as a box office hit. She won both the Filmfare Award and the National Film Award for Best Actress for the film. Ranaut followed Queen by playing an aggressive politician in the black comedy Revolver Rani and a medical intern in the political drama Ungli (both 2014).|$|E

2500|$|Many {{statistical}} methods seek {{to minimize the}} residual sum of squares, and these are called [...] "methods of least squares" [...] in contrast to Least absolute deviations. The latter gives equal weight to <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>big</b> errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also differentiable, which provides a handy property for doing regression. Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non-linear least squares. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares, which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) {{as a function of}} the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.|$|E
