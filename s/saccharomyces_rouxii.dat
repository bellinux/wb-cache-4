The fermentation of d-glucose- 6 -C 14 {{gave rise to}} d-arabitol labeled at C- 5; d-ribose of ribonucleic acid had the same isotope pattern. Crude extracts were able to reduce d-ribulose with reduced {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH 2) and d-xylulose with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH 2). These extracts also oxidized d-arabitol with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and xylitol with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. No reduction of d-ribulose- 5 -phosphate or d-xylulose- 5 -phosphate was observed. An enzyme which reduced d-xylulose with NADH 2 was purified 33 -fold and characterized as a xylitol (→ d-xylulose) dehydrogenase. Similarly, an enzyme reducing d-ribulose with NADPH 2 was purified 12 -fold and characterized as a d-arabitol (→ d-ribulose) dehydrogenase. Alkaline and acid phosphatases were purified 50 - and 40 -fold, respectively, and their specificities were determined. Only the acid phosphatase had detectable activity on d-ribulose- 5 -phosphate.

40|$|Resumo da comunicação apresentada sob forma de painel, " 18 th International Specialized Symposium on Yeasts : Yeast Nutrition and Natural Habitats", 1997, Bled, Eslovénia. Zygosaccharomyces bailii is a {{frequent}} food and beverage spoilage yeast, which is able to survive at low pH {{in the presence of}} weak organic acid preservatives. A collection of yeasts, isolated mostly from spoiled wines, was used in order to develop a differential medium for Z. bailii [...] The strains selected differed in their origin and resistance to preservatives, belonging to the species Pichia membranaefaciens, Pichia anomala, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Dekkera anomala, Dekkera bruxellensis, Debaryomyces hansenii, Saccharomycodes ludwigii, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kloeckera apiculata, Lodderomyces elongisporus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus, <b>Saccharomyces</b> bayanus, Zygosaccharomyces <b>rouxii,</b> Zygosaccharomyces florentinus and Z. bailii. The design of the culture media was based on the different ability of the various yeast species to grow in a mineral medium containing a single substrate (weak carboxylic acid) or mixed substrate (a sugar plus a weak carboxylic acid) as the only carbon and energy sources. When the assays were carried out in liquid medium with single substrate most of the strains displayed ability to utilize {{at least one of the}} several weak carboxylic acids tested. The nature of the acid and its concentration as well as the manipulation of the pH of the medium, associated to the incorporation of an acid-base indicator, allowed to select conditions where only Z. bailii strains gave rise to change in colour of the medium (positive response). However, these positive responses were only obtained after about 115 to 168 h. When the mixed substrate medium (weak acid plus sugar) was used, all the Z. bailii strains gave positive response after a considerably lower time (about 48 h) when compared with the single substrate medium for the same inoculum density and incubation conditions. Following these results the mixed substrate medium was tested for the other species using either microplate wells or solid medium. In both cases, only the Z. bailii strains gave positive response during the first 48 h of incubation. We concluded that such mixed substrate medium could be considered as a differential medium to distinguish Z. bailii from other dangerous yeast in food and beverages, with potential application.

Unlike the halophilic bacteria which also thrive at low water activity, partly because of a specific requirement for high concentrations of sodium chloride (Brown, 1964; Larsen, 1967) ~ the sugar-tolerant yeasts, with few exceptions, do not require low water activities but merely tolerate them. A variety of solutes can be used to adjust the water activity for these organisms. In natural habitats and in many experimental situations the solutes are commonly sugars, Tolerance of salts is also sometimes encountered (Onishi, 1963).

For cells grown in 0 and 60 % sucrose the optimum water activity (aw) values were 0. 97 and 0. 96, respectively. The optimum temperature for S. rouxii increased with a decreasing aw {{regardless of whether}} glucose or sucrose {{was used as the}} humectant.

Increasing the sorbate concentration (from 0. 03 to 0. 10 %) caused the growth of S. rouxii to become more inhibited between aws of greater than 0. 995 and 0. 82. S. rouxii did not grow when the sorbate level was 0. 12 % (wt/vol). At lower sorbate levels, the effect of sorbate on the growth of S. rouxii depended on the aw level.

This paper shows one possible method of breeding heterothallic haploid yeasts for industrial application. S. rouxii is highly salt-tolerant and {{plays an important role}} in shoyu and miso fermentation. Therefore, genetic improvements of the properties are of commercial importance. Since newly isolated S. rouxii could neither conjugate nor sporulate on sporulation media commonly used, a suitable medium for conjugation and sporulation of S. rouxii was firstly investigated. A 5 % NaCl Shoyu-koji extract agar was found to be most efficient. Next, we tried to get diploid strains by mass culture of two mating types on the conjugation medium, but several phenomena made this difficult: (i) zygotes quickly sporulated before budding; (ii) several zygotes showed terminal budding, but the buds could not grow into diploid cells, suggesting they would be heterocaryon; and (iii) a few zygotes lost their viability. After trying to isolate and cultivate a large number of zygotes in various combinations of crossing by micromanipulation, we fortunately recognized that large cells arose from some combinations. The analysis of ploidy suggested that the large cells would be diploid. Also, they showed sporulation of typical Saccharomyces, i. e., two to four spores in an unconjugated ascus. The diploid strains thus obtained were highly salt-tolerant and stable in liquid medium. Therefore, the procedure presented here would be effective for breeding salt-tolerant S. rouxii...|$|E

This enzyme was cryptic in cells from a 3 -day culture. A 2 -min treatment with 0. 1 volume of ethyl acetate in sodium acetate buffer (pH 6) gave complete expression of the enzyme, which was still retained by the cell. Ghosts were prepared by modifying membrane structure with small basic proteins in distilled water, and after washing they showed the full complement of enzymatic activity. The enzyme remained cryptic in osmotically protected spheroplasts; however, after lysis (by dilution) release, as well as expression, was effected. Mechanical disruption of fresh cells revealed and released all of the enzyme. Cells in early stationary phase had all of their β-fructofuranosidase in a cryptic state. Aging yielded fractional expression of activity; initially this was proportional to cell death, but later the degree of expression exceeded the death rate. Media from aged cultures or cell-free extracts of aged cells were not effective in revealing the cryptic enzyme of younger cells. S. rouxii β-fructofuranosidase has a different autolytic-release pattern from its counterpart in S. cerevisiae. Also, high concentrations of glucose do not repress the S. rouxii enzyme. The β-fructofuranosidase in young cells of S. rouxii must be enclosed by the protoplasmic membrane or a special vesicular structure.

A mutant was isolated that would not grow in 60 % glucose; although the regulation of d-arabitol dehydrogenase was altered in this strain, the production of d-arabitol was not eliminated. The activity of d-arabitol dehydrogenase followed the growth phases of the parent strain when the cells were preadapted to 30 % glucose. If the cells were adapting from 1 to 30 % glucose, a large increase in enzyme activity was detected before growth occurred. Protein synthesis was found to be involved in this increase in activity. There was an increased participation of the pentose phosphate pathway when the cells were grown in the presence of increasing glucose concentrations. The mutant strain had only an 11 % pentose phosphate pathway participation compared with 20 % for the parent strain in glucose. The results suggest that the active pentose phosphate pathway is involved in glucose tolerance by providing a plentiful supply of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate which is necessary for cell survival...|$|E
40|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} {{differences}} in intracellular composition between sugar-tolerant (osmophilic) and nontolerant species of yeast. One such factor was the difference in accumulation of those nonelectrolytes whose uptake was not dominated by vigorous metabolism. In such cases (lactose and glycerol), the sugar-tolerant species had a much lower capacity for the solute than did the nontolerant species. Sucrose uptake was consistently different between all sugar-tolerant strains {{on the one hand}} and all nontolerant strains on the other. The difference was attributable in part to metabolism of sucrose by the nontolerant yeasts. The major difference between the two types of yeast, however, was the presence of one or more polyhydric alcohols at high concentrations within each of the sugar-tolerant strains but none of the nontolerant strains. In most cases the major polyol was arabitol. The solute concentration (and, hence, water availability) of the growth medium affected both the amount of arabitol produced by <b>Saccharomyces</b> <b>rouxii</b> and the proportion retained by the yeast after brief washing with water at 0 C. When the yeast was suspended in a buffer at 30 C, the polyol leaked out at a slow, constant, reproducible rate. The polyene antibiotic amphotericin B caused rapid release of polyol by the yeast, the rate being proportional to amphotericin concentration. Contact of the yeast with glucose (1 mM) caused an extremely rapid ejection of polyol which lasted less than 40 s. Some implications of these results are discussed, as is the role of the polyol as a compatible solute in determining the water relations of the yeast...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on the {{processing}} of breadfruit and cassava co-fermented into gari analogue. The microbial load was determined and the microbes associated with the fermentation were identified. The shelf life of the co-fermented gari analogue samples was also determined. A portion of both mature cassava tubers and matured but unripe breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) was co-fermented (100 : 0, 0 : 100, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, and 60 : 40 Cassava: Breadfruit) to obtain gari analogue. The samples were evaluated for microbial loads (total viable, total {{yeast and mould count}} and total lactic acid bacteria counts). The products were subjected to sensory analyses using a 7 -point hedonic scale. Data obtained were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. The results showed that six bacteria species were isolated from the fermenting mash, Corynebacterium manihot, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species. Also isolated were Saccharomyces cerevisae, Saccharomyces fragilis, <b>Saccharomyces</b> <b>rouxii</b> and Geotricum candidum. Two moulds, Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus stolonifer, were found associated with co-fermented meals of cassava and breadfruit. The sensory attributes of 100 % breadfruit gari and co-processed gari samples were significantly different (p> 0. 05) from the control; the co-processed gari samples were however rated higher than the 100 % breadfruit in terms of overall acceptability. All the gari samples retain their quality attributes during storage for six weeks, except for the gari sample with 100 % breadfruit, which deteriorated after three weeks. This study established that 20 % of breadfruit co-fermented with cassava yields a novel food product that compares favourably with 100 % cassava gari in terms of microbial and sensory characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Cells of the {{osmotolerant yeast}} <b>Saccharomyces</b> <b>rouxii</b> were {{transformed}} to protoplasts in good yield (85 %) by digesting cell walls with snail-gut enzyme {{in the presence}} of 10 mM dithioerythritol, 0. 1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8), and 2. 0 M KCl. The requirement for 2. 0 M KCl compares with that for S. bisporus var. mellis (another osmotolerant species) and contrasts with the 0. 3 to 0. 8 M KCl concentrations used in the preparation of most yeast protoplasts. Short digestions (60 min or less) produced mostly spheroplasts; longer incubations (90 min or more) yielded mostly protoplasts as judged by electron micrographs. These protoplasts could be transferred to 1. 0 M KCl or 2. 0 M sorbitol without lysing, but lysis was pronounced in 0. 5 M KCl or 1. 0 M mannitol and complete in 0. 02 M KCl. Protoplasts were separated from isolated cell wall remnants and debris by centrifugation on a linear gradient of Ficoll 400 (35 to 17. 5 %, wt/vol) containing 2. 0 M KCl. Both crude and fractionated protoplast preparations contained vesicles which were identified with the periplasmic bodies of whole cells. Some of the periplasmic bodies were connected to protoplasts by fine pedicels; others appeared free. Independent degeneracy of periplasmic bodies was occasionally observed. β-Fructofuranosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) activity is cryptic (physically) in cells of S. rouxii in contrast to the expressed enzyme (periplasmic space) of other Saccharomyces species. This enzyme remains cryptic in protoplast preparations of S. rouxii but is expressed upon lysis. The same specific activities were found per unit cell or protoplast. The possible association of the cryptic enzyme with periplasmic bodies is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The osmotolerance of <b>Saccharomyces</b> <b>rouxii</b> 48 - 28 was {{confirmed}} with both NaCl- and KCl-fortified growth media, with more tolerance being exhibited for the potassium salt. Washed and buffered cells from unfortified medium were challenged {{with a variety}} of compounds (and also with physical treatments) that potentially would elicit membrane perturbations. The efficacy of these brief treatments was judged primarily by monitoring subsequent viability. Change in the degree of expression of β-fructofuranosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26), which is cryptic in young cells of S. rouxii, was a second criterion. There was a linear correlation between cell death and enzyme expression for treatments with polyenes, detergents, some organic solvents which did not denature the enzyme, and various freeze-thaw regimens in graded amounts of glycerol. The species is relatively insensitive to polyene antimycotics, the order of decreasing effect being filipin, nystatin, and amphotericin B. S. rouxii was found to be less sensitive to osmotic shock than is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but in neither species is β-fructofuranosidase released to the medium. The sensitivity of S. rouxii to ionic detergents, but not to nonionic detergents, was rationalized as being due to cell wall discrimination against larger micelles for the nonionic examples. This {{was confirmed}} by showing that protoplasts were sensitive to both classes. In cultures older than 5 days the normal agreement between colony-forming units and methylene blue exclusion (another test of viability) no longer held. Delayed fermentation of sucrose by S. rouxii, which is a diagnostic feature of the species, is explained by death of some cells, expression of their β-fructofuranosidase, and utilization of the monosaccharides by the surviving cells...|$|E
30|$|After {{selecting}} the appropriate ranges of medium components, {{the production of}} ethanol and arabitol was scaled up to 2.5 L bioreactor and the optimum aeration/agitation conditions were established. Oxygen {{is one of the}} important substrates for microbial metabolism. There were many reports indicating the necessity of adequate supply of oxygen for polyol production (Petrson et al. 1958; Hajny 1964; Escalante et al. 1990; Saha et al. 2007; Toyoda and Ohtaguchi 2011). In the present study, production of ethanol and arabitol was found to be maximum at lower rates of aeration and agitation. Drastic reduction of product yields and high biomass were observed when aeration was increased to 1 vvm. This could be due to the Pasteur effect, as indicated by Petrson et al. (1958) where higher levels of oxygen reduce the rate of fermentation. Several reports indicated that low levels of aeration and agitation are optimal for arabitol production (Petrson et al. 1958; Fonseca et al. 2007; Saha et al. 2007). Saha et al. (2007) studied the production of arabitol by Z. rouxii under different agitation rates and found that low agitation rates in the range 350 – 450 rpm were most conducive. But, in contrast to the above observation, Escalante et al. (1990) reported an increase in arabitol yield with increasing aeration and agitation speed. The partial anaerobic environment created by reduced agitation speed and low aeration rates resulted in maximum ethanol yield. When the initial substrate concentration was increased, the production of both ethanol and arabitol also increased. The increase in arabitol yield {{can be attributed to the}} osmotic stress caused by high sugar concentration. This is in agreement with earlier published report where D. nepalensis produced arabitol as a compatible solute along with glycerol to overcome hyperosmotic stress (Kumar and Gummadi 2011). This result also corresponds to the observations made by Morant et al. that arabitol production increased when Z. rouxii was cultivated in the presence of high glucose concentrations (Morant and Witter 1979). Similarly, Brown (1974) reported that the amount of arabitol produced by <b>Saccharomyces</b> <b>rouxii</b> was influenced by the solute concentration of the medium in which the organism was cultivated. But, in the case of Hansenula polymorpha, there was a reduction in arabitol production with increasing osmotic pressure (Escalante et al. 1990).|$|E
