5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which <b>salesmen</b> {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London <b>salesmen</b> to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is given}} Michael's client list as a going-away present, {{much to the}} shock and envy of the other <b>salesmen,</b> and after losing one, {{requests}} the help of Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to retain them. Vickers nearly ruins {{a relationship with a}} client but Andy gains enough confidence to salvage the sale. Along the way, Vickers reveals that he was not hired for his business experience, but because he helped prevent the theft of one of Sabre CEO Jo Bennett's dogs. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is antagonistic towards Michael, still bitter over Michael not recommending him for a manager position, despite Michael's attempts to reconcile. He initially expresses disdain for Michael's going-away present, a recommendation letter, but appears touched as he reads further. He also discovers a card challenging him to a paintball match, and the two play behind the building.|$|E

Second, we show that the core of a traveling <b>salesman</b> game is non-empty if the distance matrix is a symmetric Monge matrix, and also that a traveling <b>salesman</b> game is submodular (or concave) if the distance matrix is a Kalmanson matrix. These correspond {{to the fact that the}} Monge property and the Kalmanson property are polynomially solvable special cases of the traveling <b>salesman</b> problem...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the applications of the maximum-entropy principle as a heuristic for the multiple travelling <b>salesman</b> problem. This is a computationally complex problem which requires special treatment by conventional optimization techniques. Specific focus is given to developing a generalized framework for this problem that can be applied to any number of variants on the basic formulation. Additional consideration is given to the applications of this generalized framework to other variants on the travelling <b>salesman</b> problems such as the close enough travelling <b>salesman</b> problem. The heuristic framework developed here is shown to provide flexibility in addressing the multiple <b>salesman</b> variation on the travelling <b>salesman</b> problem as well as a several other variants on the travelling <b>salesman</b> problem. Additionally, this framework is shown to be effective in determining solutions to this class of problems, and it is especially effective for the close-enough travelling <b>salesman</b> problems which is particularly challenging for most conventional combinatorial algorithms. Concrete steps are presented by which to further extend and improve this framework to become both more widely applicable to variants on the travelling <b>salesman</b> problem, and more computationally efficient in solving such problems...|$|R

Any new algorithm or heuristic for the traveling <b>salesman</b> problem is empirically evaluated based on its performance on standard test instances, as well as on randomly generated instances.

In this paper, we report the results from an empirical investigation on the properties of randomly generated Euclidean traveling <b>salesman</b> problem. Our experiments focus on the properties of the edge lengths and the distribution of the tour lengths of all tours in instances for symmetric traveling <b>salesman</b> problems. ...|$|R

We analyze the approximation behavior of 2 OPT when used to approximately solve traveling <b>salesman</b> problem in bipartite graphs and prove that it achieves differential-approximation ratio bounded above by 1 / 2 also in this case.
