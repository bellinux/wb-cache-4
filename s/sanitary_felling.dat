5000|$|Circa 1967, a new, {{far more}} virulent strain arrived in Britain on a {{shipment}} of rock elm U. thomasii logs from North America, and this strain proved both highly contagious and lethal to European elms; more than 25 million trees {{have died in the}} UK alone, while France has lost over 90% of its elms. The disease is still migrating northwards through Scotland, reaching Edinburgh in the late 1970s, and Inverness in 2006. By 1990, very few mature elms were left in Britain or much of continental Europe. One of the most distinctive English countryside trees (See John Constable's painting Salisbury Cathedral from the South-West), the English elm U. procera Salisb., is particularly susceptible. Thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic, nearly all these trees, which often grew to more than 45 m high, are gone. The species still survives in hedgerows, as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts ("suckers"). These suckers rarely reach more than 5 m tall before succumbing to a new attack of the fungus. However, established hedges kept low by clipping have remained apparently healthy throughout the nearly 40 years since the onset of the disease in the UK.The largest concentrations of mature elms in Europe are now in Amsterdam and The Hague. In 2005, Amsterdam was declared the [...] "Elm City of Europe": the city’s streets and canals are lined with at least 75,000 elms, including several generations of research-elms (see below: Resistant trees). Some 30,000 of the 100,000 mature trees in The Hague are elms, planted because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds. Since the 1990s, a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms, and of sanitation felling, has reduced annual elm losses in The Hague from 7% to less than 1% (see below: Preventive treatment). The losses are made up by the planting of disease-resistant cultivars. The largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in England is in Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 15,000 still stand (2005 figures), several of which are estimated to be over 400 years old. Their survival is owing to the isolation of the area, between the English Channel and the South Downs, and the assiduous efforts of local authorities to identify and remove infected sections of trees immediately when they show symptoms of the disease. Empowered by the Dutch Elm Disease (Local Authorities) (Amendment) Order 1988, local authorities may order the destruction of any infected trees or timber, although in practice they usually do it themselves, successfully reducing the numbers of elm bark beetle Scolytus spp., the vector of elm disease. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>felling</b> has also, to date, preserved most of the 250,000 elms on the Isle of Man, where average temperature and wind speed inhibit the activity of the beetles, which need a temperature of at least 20 degrees to fly and a wind speed of less than five metres per second. [...] The largest concentration of mature elms in Scotland is in Edinburgh, where over 5000 remained in 2009 from some 35,000 in 1976. The city council gives the overall number of elms as 15,000 (2016). Edinburgh's Leith Links and Meadows have some of the highest concentrations of mature elms among U.K. parks (2014). A policy of <b>sanitary</b> <b>felling</b> has kept losses in the city to an average of 1000 a year. Elm was the most common tree in Paris from the 17th century; before the 1970s there were some 30,000 ormes parisiens. Today, only 1000 mature elms survive in the city, including examples in the large avenues (Avenue d'Italie, Avenue de Choisy, Boulevard Lefebvre, Boulevard de Grenelle, Boulevard Garibaldi) and two very old specimens, one in the garden of the Tuileries in front of the l'Orangerie and another in the Place Saint-Gervais in front of l'hôtel de ville de Paris. Losses are now being made up with disease-resistant cultivars, especially the Dutch-French research elm 'Nanguen' (...) , named after the city.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractKey messageCork oak {{decline is}} {{widespread}} {{in all its}} distribution range {{and seems to be}} triggered mainly by both mismanagement and unfavorable climatic factors. As a result, cork oak forests become susceptible to pest attack, which accelerates the onset of decline. Pest management strategies for this valuable and highly biodiverse ecosystem are examined in this review, taking into account the main insect pests and how their impact on cork oak forests is affected by climate change. While monitoring pests may provide the tools to predict the transition from endemic to epidemic insect populations, forestry practices (<b>sanitary</b> <b>felling),</b> biological control, and trapping {{are some of the most}} promising measures in protecting cork oak forests. ContextOver the last decades, cork oak (Quercus suber L.) decline has affected millions of trees throughout its distribution range. Cork oak is a typically Mediterranean species remarkably relevant for the biodiversity and landscape conservation of vast evergreen oak forests. Cork oak is also well known and highly valued for cork production. Climatic changes, management practices, and biotic factors, particularly plant pathogens and insect pests, play a decisive role in tree death and market devaluation of cork. AimsHere, we review the major insect pests possibly involved in cork oak decline, while discussing pest management strategies. MethodsA survey of the current literature was performed to identify major insect pests affecting cork oak trees, as well as to establish the most promising pest management strategies under climate change. ResultsMany authors seem to agree that the decline is triggered by both anthropogenic and abiotic factors, such as the mismanagement of cork oak forests and unfavorable climate (high temperatures and droughts). Consequently, trees become susceptible to pests and pathogens, which accelerate the onset of decline. ConclusionSince a further increase in temperatures and droughts is expected, developing adequate management strategies to adapt cork oak trees to climate change, while simultaneously preventing and reducing insect pest attacks, is of foremost importance in the effort to conserve these unique and highly diverse ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Climatic {{changes and}} bad {{environmental}} conditions {{may lead to}} forests vitality loss and even mortality. This {{is the reason why}} increased <b>sanitary</b> <b>felling</b> operations were performed in mixed oak forests in northern Serbia in 2013 in order to solve the severe dieback which affected some Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) stands, after the very dry years 2011 and 2012. Dendrochronological techniques were applied to both these oak species collected in a stand, to examine the impact of temperature, precipitation and ground water level on forest growth and investigate the potential causes of the dieback. Differences in tree-ring patterns between surviving and dead trees were not significant according to t-value (from 5. 68 to 14. 20) and Gleichläufigkeit coefficient (from 76 % to 82 %), this meaning no distinctive responses of the two ecologically different oak species. As for radial increment, pedunculate and Turkey oak trees showed a similar response to environmental variables in this mixed stand. The Simple Pearson’s correlation analysis, which was conducted, showed that among three basic environmental variables (the mean monthly air temperature, the monthly sum of precipitation and the mean monthly water level, proxy of ground water level), the water level of Danube river in May and the temperature in April were statistically related to the growth of the four tree groups: (i) pedunculate oak vital, (ii) pedunculate oak dead, (iii) Turkey oak vital and (iv) Turkey oak dead trees, for the period 1961 - 2010 (p< 0. 05, n= 60). Similar phenomena had already been observed in the Sava River basin for the growth of pure pedunculate oak forests. The long-term decline of the Danube River water level may be related to climate variations and to the changes of water management, river bed, as well as land-use. Together with the increase of temperature, this decline of the water level, and its potential unavailability in the soil, represents a serious challenge for the mixed oak forests silviculture in the Danube basin. </p...|$|E
40|$|With the {{participation}} of about 65 % in the total growing stock of conifers, silver fir {{is the most important}} and the best represented conifer species in Croatia. The increasing share of <b>sanitary</b> <b>felling</b> in the annual felling plans demands that special attention be paid to the health status of fir forests and the quantity of unplanned felling. This is the reason why dieback of silver fir in beech-fir forests in the Dinaric Alps is an acute and topical management-ecological problem. In the past 10 years, the share of total unplanned felling in the overall annual felling for fir has amounted to 57 %. Such a high share of unplanned yield (mainly snags) has had a negative effect on sustainable forest management. Determining the spatial distribution of damaged trees and snags, as well as their monitoring is one of the priorities of sustainable management. Hence, it is of utmost importance to detect less healthy stands and apply timely measures for the purpose of maintaining their vitality and productivity at an optimal level. Due to the seriously disturbed stand stability caused by forced canopy opening, which in turn affects the health condition and natural regeneration of the stand, it is necessary not only to detect snags but also determine the causes of dieback. According to the results of past research, increased tree dieback is associated with the impact of different site and stand characteristics (altitude, exposition, slope, soil, structure, etc.), as well as abiotic and biotic factors (fir needle moth, mistletoe); however, the real causes are yet to be discovered. It is difficult to make efficient snag inventories with standard field methods. For large areas, a remote sensing method (the application of CIR aerial photographs) is much more practical, more cost effective and more reliable. All research activities so far have proved that, in terms of accuracy, this method is equal to field working methods, while in terms of speed and objectivity it is far more efficient. Snag inventories by means of CIR aerial photography interpretation and GIS enable efficient enumeration (detection) and spatial distribution (mapping) of snags. The proposed method is highly important not only for the detection and monitoring of the occurrence, distribution and direction of dieback progress, but also for the detection of possible dieback causes, on the basis of which experts will prescribe adequate measures and treatments. The objective of CIR aerial photography interpretation is to determine the current situation and acquire an objective picture of forest condition (database) in as short a period as possible, while mapping on a color infrared digital orthophoto (DOP) is intended to provide the spatial distribution of snags for the surveyed area. An aerial survey of the Lika area with the CIR film (Forest Administration Gospić) was conducted in strips (Fig. 3). The coordinates of the start and finish points of aerial photogrammetric series in the associated zones of the Gauss-Krüger cartographic projection, as well as planned strip lengths, are given in the following survey (Table 1). A total of 88 aerial photographs were taken at an average scale of 1 : 6000 and longitudinal overlap of 60 %, which allows for the interpretation of individual trees in the stereomodel. As the total length of all the three strips amounted to 40, 243 m (40. 24 km), an area of 5, 548 ha was surveyed. Since aerial photography provided an insight into the condition of the stands in the investigated area, and since the results obtained by photointerpretation of CIR aerial photographs indicated acute fir damage (the average damaged tree is 61. 70 %), snag inventory (mapping) was undertaken. In the localities of fir forests, dieback was observed in the form of smaller or bigger groups of trees. Hence, areas of 1 ha (sample plots) were delineated on a random sample in the color infrared DOP (1 : 5000). All visible snags were then mapped in each area (Fig. 1). The central parts of the images were used to construct a DOP. The pixel size of each orthophoto is 0. 5 m. According to the spatial snag distribution, the number of snags (density) per strip ranged between 23 and 105 per ha (Fig. 2). Since the values were not similar for all the plots, all the identified snags were mapped in the color infrared DOP. A total of 17, 445 snags were mapped in the study area (Fig. 4). GIS was used to produce a cartographic presentation of spatial snag distribution along the survey strips. In order to produce a digital orthophoto, it was necessary to construct a digital relief model. Data for the DRM were obtained by vectorizing the contour lines from the associated sheets of the Basic Map of Croatia (BMC) of 1 : 5000 scale and topographic maps (TM 25) at a scale of 1 : 25000. Since individual tree mortality is a stochastic, rare and irregular event (Eid and Tuhus 2001) and since this is a karst terrain, slope variability in the study area is very high; therefore, it is not advisable {{to take into account the}} average slope in an area. As the same was also confirmed by the research of Antonić and Legović (1999), Pernar (1997), and Božić et al. (2004), the layers were generated from the DRM. Raster-GIS modeling provided the layers of slope and exposition. In this way, the values of altitude (Fig. 5), slope (Fig. 6) and exposition (Fig. 7) obtained by means of the DRM were assigned to every snag, in dependence of the location (position in space). An orthophoto and a digital relief model (DRM) were also entered into GIS as one of the layers, which enabled rapid spatial analysis and an efficient access to data (Fig. 8). Next, the obtained results were statistically analyzed and the data of spatial snag distribution and geomorphological features were processed. The most important result ensuing from the presented method of rapid snag inventory is the thematic maps, which present spatial snag distribution for the investigated area. Not only is field work very expensive and long-lasting (Boyle et al., 1998), but it is also extremely difficult in barely accessible terrains or on steep slopes. A method based on remote sensing (aerial or satellite images) considerably contributes to the solution of the afore mentioned problems and provides a more practical, less expensive and more reliable manner of enumerating dry trees and stands over large areas. In combination with GIS technology, the production of a map of spatial snag distribution takes 5 – 10 minutes per hectare of the inventoried area. Such maps provide an insight into the field condition and spatial snag distribution in a very short time. They can also be used as a basis for the calculation of mean snag density and for conducting a variety of analyses intended to predict efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects. Based on the results of statistical analysis, it can be concluded that the spatial distribution of snags is influenced by geomorphological features (terrain orientation, slope and altitude). Variance analysis (F= 278. 79; p< 0. 001) showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the spatial distribution of snags with regard to terrain orientation (exposition) and slope. According to the results, the number of snags increases in accordance with an increase in the slope on the north-eastern and northern exposition (Fig. 9). The Tukey HSD test proved that, in terms of slope, all terrain orientations are clearly differentiated in relation to the occurrence of snags, except the S and SE. This was expected, since {{the participation}} of fir in these expositions is lower. As for terrain orientation, there is also a statistically significant difference in terms of altitude (F= 102. 6; p< 0. 001). The results show that the number of snags in the E and NE exposition rises with an increase in altitude (Fig. 10). The results of statistical analysis should not be used to make one-sided conclusions based on the correlation between fir snag distribution and mezorelief features. Undoubtedly, however, the spatial distribution (location) of each single snag is conditioned by edaphic and micro-relief site characteristics (soil depth, skeletalness), i. e. total soil capacity for water retention in the rhizosphere zone. Pernar (2001) directly associates the productivity of fir stands with soil depth, while Bigler et al. (2004) use the increment of mature fir trees as a predictor of fir dieback. Research by Certini et al. (2000) also confirms soil depth as a direct and indirect (distribution and virulence of pathogenic fungus Heterobasidion annosum (Fries.) Bref.)) factor of fir tree mortality. Taking into account the obtained results, a rapid and economic snag inventory is a must both for the needs of forest management and protection and for the needs of other scientific disciplines. At the Fourth Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, held on 2 October 2003, it was proposed that dry trees should be used as a new indicator of biodiversity, or in other words, that snags should have special ecological significance for biodiversity within forest ecosystems. It is, therefore, predicted that snag inventories will be undertaken with increasing frequency. In accordance with this, the proposed method could become an irreplaceable tool and a complement to standard field method. In addition, it has versatile applications, including national, regional or local forests taxation, certification processes, studies of site quality for animal species which depend on dry trees; classification of older stands, etc. The obtained results not only provided the current forest condition (inventory), but also indicated potential (focal points) and purpose of aerial surveys. Aerial photographs provide a survey of the field condition in a short time period, as well as allow for the possibility of planning efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects and evaluating dieback probability and rate. The results of the analyses enable the study of particular environmental features and their effects on forest dieback, as well as indicate the direction of future multidisciplinary research involving complex analyses of all environmental features. The results of the research are applicable primarily in the field of forest management, protection and harvesting, but they can also provide a basis for interpretations of events occurring in other fields...|$|E

They can also be used as a basis for the calculation of mean snag density and for conducting a variety of analyses intended to predict efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects. Based on the results of statistical analysis, it can be concluded that the spatial distribution of snags is influenced by geomorphological features (terrain orientation, slope and altitude). Variance analysis (F= 278. 79; p< 0. 001) showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the spatial distribution of snags with regard to terrain orientation (exposition) and slope. According to the results, the number of snags increases in accordance with an increase in the slope on the north-eastern and northern exposition (Fig. 9). The Tukey HSD test proved that, in terms of slope, all terrain orientations are clearly differentiated in relation to the occurrence of snags, except the S and SE. This was expected, since {{the participation}} of fir in these expositions is lower. As for terrain orientation, there is also a statistically significant difference in terms of altitude (F= 102. 6; p< 0. 001). The results show that the number of snags in the E and NE exposition rises with an increase in altitude (Fig. 10). The results of statistical analysis should not be used to make one-sided conclusions based on the correlation between fir snag distribution and mezorelief features. Undoubtedly, however, the spatial distribution (location) of each single snag is conditioned by edaphic and micro-relief site characteristics (soil depth, skeletalness), i. e. total soil capacity for water retention in the rhizosphere zone. Pernar (2001) directly associates the productivity of fir stands with soil depth, while Bigler et al. (2004) use the increment of mature fir trees as a predictor of fir dieback. Research by Certini et al. (2000) also confirms soil depth as a direct and indirect (distribution and virulence of pathogenic fungus Heterobasidion annosum (Fries.) Bref.)) factor of fir tree mortality. Taking into account the obtained results, a rapid and economic snag inventory is a must both for the needs of forest management and protection and for the needs of other scientific disciplines. At the Fourth Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, held on 2 October 2003, it was proposed that dry trees should be used as a new indicator of biodiversity, or in other words, that snags should have special ecological significance for biodiversity within forest ecosystems. It is, therefore, predicted that snag inventories will be undertaken with increasing frequency. In accordance with this, the proposed method could become an irreplaceable tool and a complement to standard field method. In addition, it has versatile applications, including national, regional or local forests taxation, certification processes, studies of site quality for animal species which depend on dry trees; classification of older stands, etc. The obtained results not only provided the current forest condition (inventory), but also indicated potential (focal points) and purpose of aerial surveys. Aerial photographs provide a survey of the field condition in a short time period, as well as allow for the possibility of planning efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects and evaluating dieback probability and rate. The results of the analyses enable the study of particular environmental features and their effects on forest dieback, as well as indicate the direction of future multidisciplinary research involving complex analyses of all environmental features. The results of the research are applicable primarily in the field of forest management, protection and harvesting, but they can also provide a basis for interpretations of events occurring in other fields...|$|E
