40|$|During the {{concentration}} of sugarcane juice, there is continuous deposition of nonsugar impurities {{on the surface of}} evaporator units.

This paper describes studies on the apparent solubility product of calcium oxalate in the presence of sugar and calcium and magnesium ions at different temperatures and pH's. A solubility product model was obtained that states that the apparent solubility product of calcium oxalate decreases with increasing temperature and sugar concentration, but increases with increasing pH. The model was able to predict calcium oxalate solubility changes in raw sugarcane factory processes, indicating that the apparent solubility product of calcium oxalate declines rapidly through the evaporator set. The results also indicated that calcium oxalate solubility is increased in the presence of calcium and, in particular, magnesium ions...|$|E

40|$|The present review {{provides}} {{an understanding of}} principles of struvite crystallization and examines the techniques and processes experimented to date by researchers at laboratory, pilot, and fullscale to maximize phosphorus removal and reuse as struvite from wastewater effluents. Struvite is mainly known as a <b>scale</b> <b>deposit</b> causing concerns to wastewater companies. Indeed, struvite naturally occurs under the specific condition of pH and mixing energy in specific areas of wastewater treatment plants (e. g., pipes, heat exchangers) when concentrations of magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium approach an equimolar ratio 1 : 1 : 1. However, thanks to struvite composition and its fertilizing properties, the control of its precipitation could contribute to the reduction of phosphorus levels in effluents while simultaneously generate a valuable byproduct.

In this work, struvite solution was prepared by mixing NH 4 OH, MgCl 2 and H 3 PO 4 with the different purity grade (A and B) in the mol ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 in the stirred glass vessel tank with volume of 500 ml, and then stirred at 200 rpm for 70 minutes.

Isothermal precipitation experiments at in-situ temperatures showed a difference between the progress of both arsenic and iron oxidation and precipitation.

Such relatively rapid pseudo-homogeneous arsenite oxidation is too slow to efficiently retard the As(III) load already on the wellhead, but fast enough to prevent arsenic seepage into ground water aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Scale {{formation}} on surfaces can {{normally be}} divided into two distinct processes: a “deposition process” which refers to the process of heterogeneous nucleation and growth at the asperities of the surface in the bulk solution and an “adhesion process” which refers to the sticking of pre-existing crystals, which have nucleated in the bulk solution, and which build up as a layer on the surface. The presented work represents an experimental study of scaling tests to assess the effect of hydrodynamic conditions in a complex scaling environment, supersaturated with sulphate/carbonate-dominated brine solutions, on the stainless steel substrate coated with a range of commercially-available coatings. Due to the complexity of the brine solutions, the formed <b>scale</b> <b>deposits</b> are the product of the coprecipitation process. The morphology of the <b>scale</b> <b>deposits</b> along with the chemical composition of the surface <b>scale</b> <b>deposits</b> in different conditions was analysed and characterised. In addition, the effect of the surface energy and surface roughness on both processes have been studied. The thesis provides data that will assist in the understanding of the controlling parameters in scale formation in different conditions, and also describes what characteristics of the surface can make it a good anti-scaling surface for inorganic scale; however, the results have shown that merely one parameter cannot assure a surface as a good antifouling surface. Since most of the surface scaling studies have been focused on laboratory experiments and very little data are available to demonstrate such results are relevant and can be scaled-up to field environment, the current study focuses on correlating the systematic laboratory results with field trials. The current study shows that if properly selected, surface engineering offers great promise as an approach to prevent mineral scale deposition in the piping system of oilfields. ...|$|R

The selected area (Trench D) is well known for having produced, next to a wall, the remains of a heap of at least 15 red deer carcasses, on top of which had been placed a large cod, a gannet's wing along with part of agreater black-backed gull and a pair of antlers.

40|$|RLWI is an {{important}} part of Statoil’s goal of increasing the recovery factor from subsea wells from 42 % to 55 %. Subsea well intervention has traditionally been performed by expensive workover rigs which have made intervention for subsea wells less desirable than for platform wells. The introduction of RLWI has made subsea well intervention more desirable. To make it even more desirable, limitation and problems needs to be identified and improved. After investigating 68 RLWI operation performed for Statoil by the Island Offshore Alliance, the three problems with the highest frequency were identify to be; scale related, difficulties pulling the THCP and fish left in the hole. A HXT vs. VXT time analysis showed that RLWI operations takes about two days longer to perform on wells with HXT. The main reason for this difference is because a THCP needs to be pulled, which runs into difficulties 40 % of the time. A RLWI will always take longer time for HXT because the THCP needs to be pulled, but the time difference could be reduced by applying a proper THCP pulling procedure. An important part of improving the THCP pulling procedure is to improve the jarring operation. Drag force acting on the wireline by the sea current have the potential to reduce the sensitiveness of the jarring operation. The drag force can reached 1 380 N on the 7 / 32 ” braided line during worst case scenario, which creates a deflection of 23 m at 300 m water depth and a TS weight of 2 000 N. The drag force can be reduced by developing a wireline with higher specific weight, smoother surface and smaller diameter. Or the drag force can be eliminated by placing the wireline winch on the sea bottom. Oil field <b>scale</b> <b>deposit</b> is a big problem for many fields world wide as many fields are getting older. <b>Scale</b> <b>deposit</b> in the well is the reason for many intervention complications such as; high friction in the well, unable to install/RIH downhole equipment and stuck downhole valves and chokes. The introduction of the rotating PTA tractor has provided a cost efficient scale removal technique from electrical wireline. The technique has however two major disadvantages compared to CT and snubbing; the power available downhole is very limited and fluid circulation is impossible. Because of these limitations the technique can only remove relative short soft scale bridges due to the limitation in available downhole power, and the scale bridge cannot completely block the fluid because that makes it impossible to remove the debris. A new wireline called CC can however dramatically increase the available downhole power, but fluid circulation will be impossible to achieve with wireline. Whenever a fish is left in the well it must be investigated what went wrong to avoid the similar incidents in the future. Three cases have been looked into in this report where a fish was left in the hole: o Fish left in hole due too to small ID in the TFL completion solution, the TFL is not a very intervention friendly completion o Fish left in hole because of perforating in too high overbalance. If high overbalance is suspected the TS could be anchored in place to avoid it from being flushed up the well, or the well could be shut in prior to perforating. o Fish likely left in hole because of wrongly installed muleshoe in the tailpipe. The self aligned muleshoe has a spring loaded inner part which has a cushioning effect on the jarring operations, which makes it difficult to jar the TS free. Whenever a muleshoe is installed a caliper run should be run to see if it is properly installed. RLWI has limitations and disadvantages compared to CT and snubbing, but with the development of new techniques and equipment the RLWI clearly has a huge potential to increase the recovery factor for subsea wells. New equipment and techniques will also be needed to perform intervention in constantly deeper and more complex wells. </p...|$|E
