This work describes a Contextually Informed MultiModal Integrator, CIMMI, that fuses speech and symbolic gestures probabilistically and is informed by contextual knowledge in an assistive technology robotic application. Symbolic gestures are gestures that have semantic meaning, such as a wave gesture meaning ‘hello’. Contextual knowledge is used to resolve ambiguities associated with object and location words in a command, where it is defined as both conversational and <b>situational.</b> Conversational contextual <b>knowledge</b> uses the dialogue history to resolve ambiguities in the selected command. <b>Situational</b> contextual <b>knowledge</b> consists of the last known locations of the user, the robot and a list of objects that exist in the environment. The accuracy of the speech recognition system alone (53 %) was compared to using the speech with contextual knowledge, both conversational and situational, increasing the accuracy of the system to 72 %. The accuracy of the system increased again to 76 % with the addition of gestures as well. ...|$|R

40|$|You {{will never}} believe what {{happened}} at the party yesterday! Ellen kissed Ruben and Peter…. Suppose this is the last thing you read in your friend’s e-mail before your computer breaks down. If you have some prior knowledge regarding the situation described, you would be able to guess how the interrupted sentence could continue without great difficulty. For example, if you know that Ellen was secretly in love with both Peter and Ruben and you know she has a certain reputation, she may have kissed them both, but if you know she has a crush on Ruben, but definitely not on Peter, the remaining part of the sentence would more likely be something like (Ellen kissed Ruben and Peter) smiled his approval from a distance. The main question of the research presented in this dissertation is whether readers’ knowledge of a situation immediately affects the structural analysis (i. e. parse) of a sentence. This knowledge is called <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> and is provided by means of discourse context. More generally, the question is whether non-syntactic factors immediately affect the initial parse of a sentence or whether it is solely determined on the basis of syntax-based parsing preferences. Syntactic ambiguity, specifically, the NP-/S-coordination ambiguity, is used as a research tool. The aim is to demonstrate effects of <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> not only at the point of disambiguation, but also {{at the onset of the}} ambiguity. A second question is how <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> interacts with other, particularly syntactic factors. In order to investigate this question, the influence of <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> is not only investigated in isolation, but also in contrast to another factor, viz. subject-verb agreement. In particular, it is investigated which factor outweighs the other if both factors conflict. Results of a series of off-line experiments, self-paced reading experiments and an eye movement experiment are discussed. The results show that the parsing process is immediately affected by <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge,</b> a non-syntactic factor that is often even considered non-linguistic. Furthermore, it turns out that a syntactic constraint (in this case subject-verb agreement) eventually overrules the initial analysis of the critical sentence as determined by <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge.</b> On the basis of these results, parsing is argued to be a highly interactive, dynamic process that changes in response to the strength of various sources of information. This dissertation should be of interest to those interested in sentence processing and its interfaces with discourse representation...|$|E
40|$|The vision {{leading the}} {{development}} of a <b>Situational</b> Awareness <b>Knowledge</b> Portal to support the Canadian National Defence Command Center in monitoring and directing Strategic-level Operations is to provide each individual with a customized, mission-oriented knowledge desktop that gives access to the right information from multiple sources {{in the context of the}} work and contributes to the building and sharing of the “collective battlespace knowledge”. The approach lays on three intertwined fundamental concepts, namely Context, Ontology and Portfolio. The delimitation of the work into well-scoped portfolios allows, to a certain extent, to confine the knowledge handled.

40|$|Major {{difficulties}} for a novice physics problem solver are {{how to interpret}} new problems and how to combine information given in the problem with information already known. A domain expert, by contrast, has the knowledge {{to take full advantage}} of problem features at a glance. It takes a long period of practice to acquire such <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and it would be desirable for this to be taught more effectively. As a first step, this requires information on how <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> differs across individuals of different competence levels. Related research on mental models and problem representations does not give a direct view on the knowledge subjects have of situations before being confronted with the problem. To assess <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> more directly, we asked participants to respond to physics formulas (from the field of electrodynamics) by describing relevant problem situations. We compared physics problem descriptions by experts (n = 6) and by proficient (n = 6) and less proficient (n = 6) novices. We analyzed the situations that were described at the levels of words, sentences, and complete descriptions. Results indicate that competence is related to the structure of problem situations rather than the use of particular concepts, and that the differences in the use of multiple representations are more prominent than differences in the use of one specific kind of representation. Results also indicate that the differences between experts and novices are along different dimensions than the differences between more and less proficient novices. Implications for teaching are discussed. ([URL]...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} examining how accounting and accountability processes facilitate the sharing of different forms of knowledge in non-governmental organisation (NGO) contexts. The paper derives its primary insights from in-depth interviews with thirty NGO fieldworkers working and delivering development aid in Northern Ghana, Africa. We demonstrate how fieldworkers value both explicit, codifieable knowledge (referred to as ‘operational knowledge’) and contextualised, tacit knowledge (referred to as ‘situational knowledge’). The sharing of <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> in support of operational knowledge by fieldworkers within NGO-funder accounting and accountability processes is perceived as crucial for optimising the use of development aid. However, despite funder encouragement, fieldworkers refrain from sharing <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> within these processes. This {{is influenced by the}} perceived coercive nature of the accounting and accountability processes. These processes offer fieldworkers limited flexibility and create uncertainty by failing to inform them of the consequences arising from sharing operational and <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The findings develop prior work highlighting the tensions between global control and local flexibility in NGO-funder accounting and accountability processes. We show how the value attached to different types of knowledge influences how these tensions play out. The findings also challenge prior work suggesting that NGO fieldworkers attach little relevance to operational knowledge required by funders in accounting and accountability reports. Our analysis implies a need to develop more enabling NGO-funder accounting and accountability processes to enhance the effectiveness of development aid assistance. We argue that this will require greater fieldworker involvement in the development of performance measures, more frequent face-to-face funder-fieldworker interaction, and more timely feedback from funders to fieldworkers on how knowledge shared within accounting and accountability processes is used...|$|E

40|$|Most {{collective}} agroecological {{initiatives in}} Europe today are {{built around a}} plurality of knowledge systems. Going beyond the well-documented instrumental goals of this knowledge-plurality, this paper highlights another, perhaps less obvious objective: the pursuit of recognition and cognitive justice. The subordination of alternative farming practices, such as agroecology, to industrial high-input farming leads to the misrecognition of peasant communities. Challenging industrial agriculture hence requires both equality between different forms of doing farming and an active engagement with different ways of knowing farming. Cognitive justice, a concept originating in decolonial thought, encompasses not only the right of different practices to co-exist, but entails an active engagement across their knowledge-systems. Using an example of participatory maize breeding in France, the paper illustrates how peasant movements in Europe organize an 'agroecology of knowledges', a counter-hegemonic engagement with modern agronomic science, through the recovery and co-production of <b>situational,</b> environment-specific <b>knowledge,</b> and the reskilling of farmers. It aims not only at improving agricultural science, but also at rebuilding collective identities and reclaiming autonomy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Many {{innovations}} occur {{over long}} periods of time as complicated and dynamic processes. Ethnographies, which accompany innovation processes in real time, enable to focus on the process-accompanying aspects, like ruptures and change events, of such innovations. Though, such ethnographies require a great deal of (time) investment, and in most cases, an interpretation of such a process as an innovation is only possible at the end of this process, i. e., ex-post. Ex-post conducted studies, like qualitative interview studies, are not confronted with this problem. But, at the same time, they lack the <b>situational</b> detailed <b>knowledge</b> of the field to make statements about the innovation proceeding. Hence, for process accompanying investigations of innovations, I propose the methods of ethnographic panel: a mixed methods approach of multiple short-term field visits, during which, apart from participant observations, the ethnographer focuses particularly on qualitative interviews and conservations. In this paper, this approach will be described and afterwards illustrated by an example. Therefore, I draw on the concept of structural innovation. " (author's abstract...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{on the performance of}} two common tasks; category member generation under a free-emission procedure and the judgement of similarity between two items using rating scales. In both tasks, self-report protocols were used to identify the strategies that people seemed to be using to complete the tasks. The main goal was to identify the role of <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> in the organisation of semantic memory. Traditional models would not predict a role for <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> in either of the target tasks. In the category member generation studies (Chapter 2) participants frequently instantiated situations or perspectives to cue retrieval of category members for both taxonomic and ad hoc categories. Chapter 3 {{investigated the}} factors that determine subjective similarity: category type, typicality, context and presence or absence of self-report. The quantitative data analysis showed the need for careful qualifications to previous claims concerning the effect of context on similarity (Barsalou, 1982). Specifically, ad hoc category members were rated more similar with context only when judgements were made without self-report and when items were relatively typical. Self-report protocols showed that co-occurrence of items in a situation frequently entered into judgements of similarity. Chapter 4 investigated the role of events in determining the strength of this 'thematic ' similarity. Individual indices of association strength between the items and an event were shown to predict similarity ratings- thus confirming that thematic similarity is driven, at least partially, by the association of items to common settings. The findings lend empirical weight to theoretical positions that present memory for situational information {{as an integral part of}} conceptual knowledge. This approach may underpin a new direction for research into concepts in both normal and clinical adult populations. ...|$|E

While a good deal is known about concrete concepts such as chair or apple, concepts that are perceptually elusive, such as idea or freedom, remain a challenge for theories of conceptual knowledge. Past research has explained how these concepts are understood by focusing on how they differ from concrete concepts, suggesting they are primarily understood by their relations to other words. However, recent research recognizes {{that this is not a}} comprehensive view of their representation, and that it excludes much of people’s everyday experience. Accordingly, current theories of grounded cognition propose that real-world <b>situational</b> <b>knowledge</b> plays a key role in how people understand abstract concepts. Experiment 1 supports this idea by showing that short scenario descriptions prime abstract concepts in the absence of any word association. In Experiment 2, I grouped concepts according to whether they relate multiple aspects of a situation, or refer to internal states. The former shows significant priming but the latter does not.
