In the first four months of 2010, 2.7million passengers traveled through RDU. Growth was flat, compared to the <b>same</b> <b>period</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before, but these signs were positive, indicating that the decline was over. Also, after cutting service, carriers at RDU began to add (or re-add) new service to the schedule. In April 2010 Midwest Airlines resumed service from RDU, adding service to Milwaukee. This route ended when Midwest was acquired by Frontier Airlines. Southwest Airlines, which began service to RDU in June 1999, had also aggressively expanded at RDU, adding service to St. Louis in May, and replacing American Airlines as the largest carrier at RDU. JetBlue Airways also increased service to Boston in May 2010.|$|E

RITC opened in June 2014 [...] RITC links the airport to other transportation systems, including regional bus lines, shuttles, {{as well as the}} Amtrak and Metrolink rail services, and includes an elevated covered moving walkway to the terminal building. An adjacent multi-story parking structure also is planned on the site. Additionally, the airport was given $3.5 million in Metrolink funds for a bridge that would cross south of the RITC facility on Empire Avenue to the rail platform used by Metrolink and Amtrak. The RITC's overall cost was reported at $112 million and includes consolidating rental car facilities of at least nine different rental car brands. RITC also will serve as a command center for emergency operations. Reversing recent passenger declines, the airport reported the number of passengers in the first seven months of 2015 rose 2.4% compared with the <b>same</b> <b>period</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> ago.

The study unveiled that the seasonal change of the atmosphere carbon and primary production has the <b>same</b> <b>period.</b> In <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> the primary production and atmosphere carbon had two balance points: the points of May and October, during which the amount of atmosphere carbon decreased. As phytoplankton absorbed atmosphere carbon, When primary production in spring > 181. 60 (mg/m 2 d) ~ 297. 57 (mg/m 2 d) or 754. 74 (mg/m 2 d) ~ 1160. 13 (mg/m 2 d) in Sept. or 552. 94 (mg/m 2 d) ~ 890. 69 (mg/m 2 d) in Oct, the atmosphere carbon fell. Therefore, it is considered that from May to Oct. every year, phytoplankton growing in bloom controlled the increase of atmosphere carbon. From Dec. to next April, human discharging the carbon controlled its increase. The results supported the viewpoint shown by Yang (2010) : the variation in atmospheric carbon was determined by human discharge and phytoplankton growth. The result in this paper showed that the earth ecosystem kept {{the percentage of the}} decrease amount of atmospheric carbon to its amount taken up by phytoplankton as 1. 60 % ~ 0. 34 % and maintained the dynamic balance of carbon by emitted by human being into the atmosphere and absorption of phytoplankton to atmosphere carbon. Therefore, the ecosystem was considered to be of the great power and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{atmospheric}} CO 2 {{variations on}} various spatiotemporal scales were observed during ASCENDS flight campaigns. For example, around 10 -ppm CO 2 changes were found within free troposphere {{in a region}} of about 200 x 300 sq km over Iowa during a summer 2014 flight. Even over extended forests, about 2 -ppm CO 2 column variability was measured within about 500 -km distance. For winter times, especially over snow covered ground, relatively less horizontal CO 2 variability was observed, likely owing to minimal interactions between the atmosphere and land surface. Inter-annual variations of CO 2 drawdown over cornfields in the Mid-West {{were found to be}} larger than 5 ppm due to slight differences in the corn growing phase and meteorological conditions even in the <b>same</b> time <b>period</b> of <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Furthermore, considerable differences in atmospheric CO 2 profiles were found during winter and summer campaigns. In the winter CO 2 was found to decrease from about 400 ppm in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) to about 392 ppm above 10 km, while in the summer CO 2 increased from 386 ppm in the ABL to about 396 ppm in free troposphere.

40|$|The summer 2003 was {{abnormally}} hot, {{sunny and}} dry. The average temperatures from June to August {{were the highest}} ever recorded in the Belgian reference meteorological station of Uccle, but also in other countries of western and central Europe such as Portugal, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Many human activities were affected by these particular climatic conditions, among which agriculture. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) applied on ten-daily SPOT- VEGETATION imagery {{is one of the}} drought indicators which could serve for the localisation of drought affected areas in Belgium. In this paper preliminary results show that detection of dry events is possible using historical averages of NDWI. Relative NDWI images can be used to monitor the development of the summer drought. These images are computed by the weighted difference between the NDWI values during this summer and its value at the <b>same</b> <b>period</b> in <b>a</b> reference <b>year,</b> which corresponds to <b>a</b> normal <b>year</b> in terms of rainfall availability. Analysis of the relation between NDWI and NDVI behaviours show that the green biomass influences the NDWI value especially during the growing season. More accurate study has to be done to individualize the specific NDWI behaviour during dry events. In perspectives, index validation with meteorological parameters and with the Relative Soil Moisture Index, which is an output of the Belgian Crop Growth Monitoring System, will improve this study...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} spatial {{design guidelines}} for Aalto University Learning Center that {{could also be}} used as a platform for upgrading the existing facilities of the University. The work was driven by a vision of an ideal learning environment – a space that always meets the needs of its occupants and embraces constant transformation as an essential part of its nature. The concept of an “Ever-changing Space” was developed through observation, experimentation, and reflection. First, the background of a Learning Center initiative was revised to define the scope of the project. Second, change, openness, community and human senses were brought into focus and studied through the prism of architecture. Third, October through December 2011 the concept was prototyped at Aalto University Library, Töölö, as Aalto Hub Töölö project. Fourth, all acquired data was re-evaluated to define spatial design guidelines for Aalto University Learning Center. “Ever-changing Space” encourages pro-active user participation that ensures continuous natural development of the space and fosters the sense of community and ownership. It recommends providing tools for the occupants to quickly and independently modify the space as their needs change. Involving all senses is suggested as a technique to achieve fuller engagement {{of the people in the}} space. The project found a lot of supporters already during the prototyping phase. The statistics of Aalto University Library, Töölö, has shown increase in number of visitors by 12. 2 % in October, by 16. 6 % November and 14. 8 % in December 2011 compared to the <b>same</b> <b>period</b> previous <b>year.</b> <b>As</b> this thesis was being written, plans were made to launch a similar space in Aalto University Otaniemi campus...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in the current economic scene in Pakistan has been the sharp increase in the rate of inflation. The annual average rate of increase in the wholesale price index (WPI) during the first seven months (July-January 1994 - 95) of the current fiscal year has been about 19 percent as opposed to 11. 3 percent during the <b>same</b> <b>period</b> last <b>year.</b> <b>A</b> similar increase was also witnessed in the consumer price index (CPI) which accelerated to 13 percent as opposed to 11. 1 percent during the previous <b>period.</b> Such <b>a</b> sharp increase in prices in recent months has not only caused alarm in the academic circles but has equally disturbed the country’s chief executive, the Prime Minister. The recent surge of inflation is a matter of serious concern for a variety of reasons. First, Pakistan has been a low-inflation country as it has experienced price stability during the last three decades. The rate of inflation, as measured by an increase in the WPI, averaged 2. 6 percent during the 1960 s. The components of the WPI, i. e., food, raw materials, manufactures, and fuel and lubricants, also grew by an average rate ranging from 2. 0 to 3. 4 percent p. a. during then 1960 s (see Table 1 for relevant statistics). The rate of inflation crossed the single-digit threshold during the 1970 s. The WPI and its components increased at an annual average rate ranging from 12 to 18 percent. The double-digit inflation during the 1970 s has been the result of two major oil shocks, a massive devaluation of currency, and devastating floods destroying agricultural crops. Pakistan returned to the fold of the single-digit inflation during the 1980 s. The rate of inflation remained at the single-digit level during {{the first three years of}} the 1990 s with the exception of 1990 - 91, when the rate of inflation increased to 11. 7 percent as a result of the Gulf War. It is only during the outgoing fiscal year and in the current year that the rising inflation is posing a major threat to macroeconomic stability. ...|$|R
