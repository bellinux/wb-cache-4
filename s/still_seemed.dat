When the United States <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> uninterested in reciprocity, he threatened to forge more favorable export agreements with Australia or New Zealand. Congress feared that a treaty between Hawaii and Australia or New Zealand would result in annexation by one of those countries instead of the United States. Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii, he signed the treaty in September 1887.|$|E
25|$|Doctor Who had {{suspended}} {{production in}} 1989, and aside from charity specials had only resurfaced as an American-funded television movie in 1996, {{which did not}} garner enough ratings {{to go to a}} regular series. When Shalka was announced in July 2003 for planned broadcast in November, the possibility of Doctor Who returning to television screens <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> remote and BBC Worldwide were continuing to shop around for another possible movie deal. As a result, BBCi officially announced, with BBC approval, that the Doctor appearing in Shalka would be the Ninth Doctor. However, events rapidly overtook this.|$|E

But in A Short History of Shakespearean Criticism, Eastman finally concludes that, although much of what Hazlitt says about Shakespeare is not original, it [...] "is well enough said {{to find a place}} in the story." ...|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my {{hope to find}} {{appropriate}} child care for my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described {{to me as a}} technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement that her husband had handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from Democrats on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> quite possible.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} and animation were praised by critics. Kevin Gifford of 1UP {{stated that the}} cel-shaded graphics were [...] "perfect" [...] for the [...] "spooky" [...] theme of the game, and that the smooth animation resulted in the enemies appearing [...] "endearing". Ronan Jennings of Eurogamer was less impressed by the graphics, stating that the game [...] "never blew him away" [...] but always kept a high standard of creativity. However, Jennings did praise the animation and character designs. Reviewers of Game Revolution gave praise to the game's visuals, comparing them to be sharper and clearer to the visuals of Banjo-Kazooie. However, they noted that the character designs <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> [...] "tied down to the past", being more suited to the Nintendo 64 than to the Xbox.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of New Zealand's next game, against England in London, Gallaher had {{recovered}} from his injury enough to play. Between 40,000 and 80,000 saw the match. The All Blacks scored five tries (four by Duncan McGregor, playing at wing) to win 15–0. According to the England player Dai Gent, the victory {{would have been even}} greater had the match conditions been dry. [...] "One cannot help thinking that England might have picked a stronger side," [...] said Gallaher. [...] "From our experience, we did not think that this side was fully representative of the best men {{to be found in the}} country." [...] Observers noted that Gallaher <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> to be suffering from his leg injury during the match. New Zealand played three more matches in Englandwins over Cheltenham, Cheshire, and Yorkshirebefore travelling on to Wales.|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} {{created on}} May25 pronounced itself {{loyal to the}} deposed King of Spain FerdinandVII, but historians disagree on whether this was sincere or not. Since Mitre, many historians think that this professed loyalty was merely a political deception to gain autonomy. The Primera Junta did not pledge allegiance to the Council of Regency, which was still in operation, and in 1810 it <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> unlikely that Napoleon would be defeated and Ferdinand returned to the throne (which finally happened on December11, 1813, with the Treaty of Valençay). The purpose of such a deception {{would have been to}} gain time to strengthen the position of the patriotic cause and avoid reactions that may have led to a counter-revolution, by making it appear that monarchical authority was still respected and that no revolution had taken place. The ruse is known as the [...] "Mask of FerdinandVII". It was upheld by the Primera Junta, the Junta Grande and the First Triumvirate. The Assembly of YearXIII was intended to declare independence, but failed to do so because of other political conflicts between its members. However, it suppressed mention of FerdinandVII in official documents. Before the declaration of independence of 1816, the supreme directors considered other options, such as to negotiate with Spain or become a British protectorate.|$|E
500|$|Concerning {{the anniversary}} edition, Yudell and Desalle thought it strange that nothing worth adding had {{happened}} in 25 years: the book remained a primary text, and Wilson's failure to develop it weakened the edition's impact. The early chapters <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> a [...] "lucid and engaging" [...] introduction to population biology, {{but much of the}} rest seemed after 25 years to lack [...] "methodological breadth", given that it did not cover the new fields that had emerged; while barely mentioning the growing importance of phylogenetic systematics seemed [...] "curious". They pointed out that comparing human and [...] "animal" [...] social evolution [...] "is tantamount to making homology" [...] claims, but Wilson had said nothing about the need for a methodology to test behavioural homology. The reviewers were also troubled by Wilson's attitude to the debate, remaining [...] "contemptuous of his anti-sociobiological opposition" [...] and [...] "opprobrium towards Marxism" [...] (especially Gould and Lewontin). Yudell and Desalle noted the irony that Wilson despised Marxism but advocated an [...] "aggressive paradigm ... seeking to blaze an historical path towards the future" [...] (as Marxism did). They argued that by demonising his opponents in this way, Wilson created support for Sociobiology [...] "not necessarily sustainable by his data and methodologies." [...] He was still doing that 25 years on, stated the reviewers.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode {{a score of}} 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside [...] "Chuck Versus the Colonel", Season 3's [...] "Chuck Versus the Beard" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", Season 4's [...] "Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger", and Season 5's [...] "Chuck Versus the Kept Man" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Goodbye". Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck knows is that he just saw Sarah in a very scary light, and it's a great new dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal with the bad luck to crash into a store built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck flashed on Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan gets to be a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Borneo {{campaign}} was launched on 1 May 1945, with a brigade of the Australian 9th Division landing at Tarakan, {{on the eastern}} coast of Dutch Borneo. The American armed forces provided naval and air support to assist the landings, {{and in some cases}} the Australians were assisted by the advance landings of the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) and their local allies. This was followed by landings in Brunei and Labuan on 10 June. In early July, a raid was made by Mosquito aircraft on oil and petrol dumps near to the camp.

The War Cabinet were sceptical, and in his reply (9 October) Robertson, although he thought Haig’s memo “splendid”, cautioned that German Army morale <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> to be holding up well. He wrote to Haig in the same letter that “the Palestine thing will not come off”, and having heard from Lord Robert Cecil that Haig was dissatisfied with him, asked him to “let me do my own job in my own way” in standing up for proper principles of warfare against Lloyd George. He also commented that (Lloyd George) was [...] "out for my blood very much these days" [...] and claimed that [...] "Milner, Carson, Cecil, Curzon and Balfour, have each in turn expressly spoken to me separately about his intolerable conduct", that he hoped [...] "matters would come to a head" [...] at the next Cabinet as he was “sick of this d–d life”, that he would [...] "manage" [...] Lloyd George, and that Painleve's recent visit to London had been an attempt to [...] "carry him off his feet" [...] but that he [...] "had big feet!".|$|E
2500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Gârbea's main works is the reliance on intertextuality, as compliments to his predecessors in drama, novel and poetry. Speaking in 2009, Gârbea himself recalled his stylistic discovery of the 1980s: [...] "It <b>still</b> <b>seemed</b> to me that being a writer meant having visions and struggling to communicate them so that others may have them too. [...] I could not write prose, but I enjoyed writing drama because I had invented something very fun to do: old characters in new situations." [...] Poet and critic Octavian Soviany noted: [...] "Horia Gârbea is a dramatist who builds with a program in mind, placing his stake on the resources of parody and the intertextual play. The parodic here is given birth by the disabused conscience of a postmodern spirit, who knows that all books have been written and therefore only their 'rewriting' [...] is still possible". Commenting on the texts grouped within Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?, literary critic Mircea A. Diaconu placed the intertextual references (which often {{make a point of}} transgressing historical reality) in connection with William Shakespeare's phrase [...] "All the world's a stage", since [...] "everything is possible {{at the level of the}} text becoming reality". He praises the author for managing to preserve an [...] "absence that imposes", by not making his own intervention felt in the text. Diaconu admits that such an approach could be read as [...] "gratuitously bookish, [...] a line is more important than an event, a pun more important than a murder", but supports the notion that they all display an [...] "existential bearing", accounting for an [...] "intrinsic value." [...] He speaks of the technique as [...] "a vengeance of the theater" [...] on the traditional historical record: [...] "In essence, Horia Gârbea's theater emerges from the textual inconsistency of the world when faced with the consistency of history, or, better yet, from the inconsistency of history and the textual consistency of the world." ...|$|E
