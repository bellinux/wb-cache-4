Metzenbaum, a Democrat, in his 1988 bid for re-election, but McEwen found he lacked statewide support and would face a strong primary challenger in Cleveland mayor George V. Voinovich. He {{dropped out of the}} race in December. McEwen's name was floated in 1991 as a possible challenger in 1992 to Ohio's other senator, John Glenn, another Democrat, but McEwen did not enter the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by <b>Senator</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1990, Atwater {{suffered}} a seizure during a fundraising breakfast for <b>Senator</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm.</b> Doctors discovered a grade 3 astrocytoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, {{in his right}} parietal lobe. He underwent interstitial implant radiation – then a new treatment – at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, followed by conventional radiation therapy at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. The treatment left him paralyzed on his left side, robbed him of his tone discrimination, and swelled his face and body.|$|E

500|$|McCain became {{chairman}} of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 1995, and would hold that position into 1997. [...] McCain's visibility was increased by the 1995 publication of Robert Timberg's well-received The Nightingale's Song, a joint biography of five graduates from the Naval Academy who had served in Vietnam and whose subsequent public fame and problems illuminated the role of Vietnam and the military in American life. [...] At {{the start of the}} 1996 presidential election, McCain served as national campaign chairman for the highly unsuccessful Republican nomination effort of Texas <b>Senator</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm.</b> [...] After Gramm dropped out, McCain endorsed eventual nominee Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks. [...] McCain formed a close bond with Dole, based in part on their shared near-death war experiences; he nominated Dole at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was a key friend and advisor to Dole throughout his ultimately losing general election campaign.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{was head}} of the local chapter of the Young Conservatives of Texas during his time at Baylor University. In 1984, Paul took a {{semester}} off to aid his father's primary challenge to Republican <b>Senator</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm.</b> While attending Duke University School of Medicine, Paul volunteered for his father's 1988 Libertarian presidential campaign. In response to President Bush breaking his election promise to not , Paul founded the North Carolina Taxpayers Union in 1991. In 1994, Paul founded the anti-tax organization Kentucky Taxpayers United (KTU), and was chair of the organization from its inception. He has often cited his involvement with KTU as the foundation of his involvement with state politics. Described as [...] "ideological and conservative" [...] by the Lexington Herald-Leader, the group considered itself nonpartisan, examining Kentucky legislators' records on taxation and spending and encouraging politicians to publicly pledge to vote uniformly against tax increases. Paul managed his father's successful 1996 Congressional campaign, in which the elder Paul returned to the House after a twelve-year absence. The elder Paul defeated incumbent Democrat-turned-Republican Greg Laughlin in the Republican primary, despite Laughlin's support from the NRCC and Republican leaders such as Newt Gingrich and George W. Bush.|$|E
500|$|The coin {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the nation's senators. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press columnist Suzanne Gamboa, Republican <b>Senator</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> of Texas described United States currency as [...] "crummy". Gramm, {{who was one of}} the senators who voted for the bill containing the legislation that authorized it, praised the design of the Sacagawea dollar as being an improvement over the other coin designs then in production. Despite his praise of the design, Gramm condemned the Mint's approach to marketing the coin, stating that if the United States Mint were the Franklin Mint, they would be [...] "sued for deceptive advertisement." [...] He also noted his belief that the Mint had repeated the earlier mistakes of the Susan B. Anthony dollar by issuing a coin that was tailored to the requests of the vending machine industry rather than the average consumer. Texas Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison criticized both the Sacagawea design as well the coin's size in relation to the other coins in circulation at the time. Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation [...] "looks like play money." [...] Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999 the Congress enacted and President Clinton {{signed into}} law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, {{also known as the}} Financial Services Modernization Act. This law {{repealed}} the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933. A similar bill was introduced in 1998 by <b>Senator</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> but it was unable to complete the legislative process into law. Resistance to enacting the 1998 bill, as well as the subsequent 1999 bill, centered around the legislation's language which would expand the types of banking institutions of the time into other areas of service but would not be subject to CRA compliance in order to do so. The Senator also demanded full disclosure of any financial [...] "deals" [...] which community groups had with banks, accusing such groups of [...] "extortion".|$|E

25|$|Boll weevils was {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} political epithet by Democratic Party leaders, implying that the boll weevils were unreliable on key votes or not team players. Most of the boll weevils eventually retired from office, {{or in the case}} of some such as <b>Senators</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> and Richard Shelby, switched parties and joined the Republicans. Since 1988 the term boll weevils has fallen out of favor.|$|R

In addition, the bill required sex offenders who move to new locations to contact authorities; {{if they fail to}} do so they face fines and prison time.|$|R
2500|$|During the {{campaign}} Krueger charged that Hutchison was a [...] "country club Republican" [...] and {{insensitive to the}} feelings of minorities. In January, the Houston Chronicle reported that both Hutchison and Fields had promised to serve a maximum of two six-year terms in the Senate {{as part of her}} support for term-limit legislation for members of Congress. In April, the Dallas Morning News reported that Hutchison had repeated her pledge to serve only two terms in the U.S. Senate, if elected, and had also said term limits ought to cover all senators, including <b>Senator</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> (Republican), who had been elected in 1984 and re-elected in 1990. (He would stay in the Senate until 2002.) The term-limits legislation never passed, and Hutchison has said that she would not leave the Senate in the absence of such legislation, because doing so would unilaterally hurt Texas {{at the expense of other}} states in the seniority-driven institution.|$|E
2500|$|Former <b>Senator</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> was a {{co-chairman}} of the McCain campaign, and McCain's chief economic adviser. He {{stepped down from the}} campaign on July 18, 2008, about a week after he made remarks to The Washington Times about the nation's economic conditions. Gramm had said, [...] "You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession," [...] and [...] "We have sort of become a nation of whiners. You just hear this constant whining." [...] McCain had quickly repudiated Gramm's remarks, saying [...] "Phil Gramm doesn't speak for me, I speak for me. I strongly disagree." [...] When asked if Gramm was still in contention for the U.S. Treasury Secretary position as previously speculated, McCain had said, [...] "I think Senator Gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador of Belarus, though I'm not sure the citizens of Minsk would welcome that." [...] Gramm said upon leaving that he had become a distraction to the campaign.|$|E

Despite the perception that the district was more competitive than the one DeLay represented for his first 10 terms, the 22nd was considered a heavily Republican district. It gave Bush 64 {{percent of the vote in}} 2004. By most accounts, it was one of the few realistic chances for a Republican challenger to unseat a Democrat in what was forecast to be a bleak year for Republicans.|$|R

The International Union of Police Associations also opposed it, saying it would increase crime and cause illegal alien children to become both [...] "victims and criminals." [...] At the legislative level, Texas Republican <b>senators</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> and Kay Bailey Hutchison opposed the amendment. Five Republican senators publicly expressed disapproval by sending a letter to Presidential candidate Bob Dole calling the amendment [...] "highly controversial and ill-advised."
