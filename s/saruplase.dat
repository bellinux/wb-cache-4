40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{demonstrate}} the equivalence of <b>saruplase</b> and streptokinase in terms of 30 -day mortality. Background. The use of thrombolytic agents {{in the treatment of}} acute myocardial infarction is well established and has been shown to substantially reduce post-myocardial infarction mortality. Methods. Three thousand eighty-nine patients with symptoms compatible with those of acute myocardial infarction for < 6 h entered the study at a total of 104 centers and were randomized to receive streptokinase (1. 5 -MU infusion over 60 min) or <b>saruplase</b> (20 -mg bolus and 60 -mg infusion over 60 min). In the <b>saruplase</b> group, a bolus of heparin (5, 000 IU) was administered before <b>saruplase,</b> and a corresponding blinded double-dummy placebo bolus was administered before streptokinase. All patients received intravenous heparin infusions for ≥ 24 h starting 30 min {{after the end of the}} thrombolytic infusions; the infusions were titrated to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time at 1. 5 to 2. 5 times that of normal. Results. Death of any cause up to 30 days after randomization occurred in 88 (5. 7 %) of 1, 542 patients randomized to receive <b>saruplase</b> and 104 (6. 7 %) of 1, 547 patients randomized to receive streptokinase (odds ratio 0. 84, p < 0. 01 for equivalence). Hemorrhagic strokes occurred more often in patients receiving <b>saruplase</b> (0. 9 % vs. 0. 3 %), whereas thromboembolic strokes were more prevalent in the streptokinase-treated patients (0. 5 % vs. 1. 0 %). The rate of bleeding was similar in the two treatment groups (10. 4 % vs. 10. 9 %). Hypotension and cardiogenic shock occurred less frequently in the <b>saruplase</b> group. Reinfarction rates were similar. Conclusions. <b>Saruplase</b> is a clinically safe and effective thrombolytic medication. This profile ranks <b>saruplase</b> favorably among the currently available thrombolytic agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{recombinant}} bifunctional urokinase variant, M 23 (rscu-PA- 40 kDA/Hir), {{comprising the}} kringle and protease domain of single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator and a C-terminal fragment of hirudin in one single-chain molecule, was evaluated for its thrombin-inhibitory and fibrinolytic properties in vitro and in vivo. M 23 inhibited thrombin-activated coagulation of human blood and thrombin-induced aggregation of human platelet rich plasma in a concentration-dependent manner. The ADP-induced aggregation of human platelet rich plasma was not influenced by M 23. In contrast, recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (<b>saruplase)</b> inhibited neither blood coagulation nor platelet I ich plasma aggregation. M 23 and <b>saruplase</b> both lysed radiolabelled human thrombi immersed in human plasma (Chandler Loop system) with equal potency. However, {{there was a}} significantly lower systemic generation of plasmin (measured as consumption of alpha(2) -antiplasmin) by M 23 compared to <b>saruplase.</b> In anaesthetized non-heparinized rabbits, experimental femoral artery thrombosis was treated with intravenous bolus injections of M 23 or <b>saruplase</b> (6 mg/kg, each). Thrombolytic restoration of arterial blood perfusion was significantly higher in M 23 - than in saruplase-treated rabbits. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were decreased markedly in saruplase-treated animals, but remained at significantly higher levels in M 23 -treated rabbits. In conclusion, the bifunctional molecule, M 23, showed thrombin inhibitory and fibrinolytic properties in human in vitro systems and exerted superior thrombolytic effects to <b>saruplase</b> in rabbit femoral artery thrombosis. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that the fibrinolytic activity of M 23 is highly clot-specific...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction (AMI) the pharmacokinetics of <b>saruplase,</b> an unglycosylated, single chain, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA) by measuring urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) antigen and total u-PA activity, its conversion to active two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (tcu-PA) and evaluated its effect on haemostatic parameters. Twelve patients were studied during and after administration of 20 mg bolus plus 60 mg continuous 1 h i. v. infusion of <b>saruplase.</b> For u-PA antigen and total u-PA activity (expressed as protein equivalents), where 234 U corresponds to 1 microgram, respectively, steady state plasma concentrations were 2. 75 +/- 8. 3 and 2. 50 +/- 7. 0 micrograms/ml (mean +/- standard deviation) and were reached within 20 min, t 1 / 2 lambda 1 was 9. 1 +/- 1. 8 and 7. 8 +/- 1. 3 min, t 1 / 2 lambda 2 1. 2 +/- 0. 2 and 1. 9 +/- 0. 5 h, and the total clearance was 393 +/- 110 and 427 +/- 113 ml/min. Inactivation of <b>saruplase</b> in plasma was negligible. After 15 min, tcu-PA was detected in plasma. From {{the ratio of the}} areas under the curve of tcu-PA and total u-PA activities it was calculated that 28 +/- 9. 3 % of the <b>saruplase</b> dose is converted into active tcu-PA. Systemic plasminaemia occurs as shown by a decrease in alpha 2 -antiplasmin and fibrinogen and an increase in fibrinogen degradation products. Thrombin-antithrombin complex formation indicated activation of the clotting system. <b>Saruplase</b> is eliminated rapidly from plasma in AMI patients. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{recombinant}} unglycosylated {{single chain}} urokinase-type plasminogen activator <b>saruplase</b> is cleared {{for a large}} part by the liver. A large interindividual variation in <b>saruplase</b> concentration is found in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. The variable cardiac performance after an infarct may induce differences in liver blood flow that could explain the concentration diversity. This study was performed to investigate the relation between hepatic blood flow and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of <b>saruplase.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen AMI patients were enrolled in this open label study. Patients received a bolus injection of 20 mg <b>saruplase</b> followed by a one-hour infusion of 60 mg <b>saruplase.</b> Concurrently 36 mg intravenous indocyanine green (ICG) was given over 1 h to measure hepatic blood flow. Blood samples were taken at regular time intervals to measure plasma levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) antigen and activity, the two-chain form (tcu-PA) activity, indocyanine green, fibrinogen, fibrin and fibrin degradation products, alpha 2 -antiplasmin and thrombin antithrombin III complex. A correlation was seen between the clearance of ICG and both those of u-PA antigen (r = 0. 62; p < 0. 05) and u-PA activity (r = 0. 57; p < 0. 05). A negative correlation was seen between the area under the curve of tcu-PA activity and the areas under the effect curves of both fibrinogen and alpha 2 -antiplasmin (r = - 0. 84; p < 0. 01 and r = - 0. 65; p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Liver blood flow is an important determinant of the clearance of u-PA antigen and activity and reduction of flow in patients with heart failure will {{lead to an increase}} in plasma concentrations. High plasma concentrations of tcu-PA activity lead to increased systemic fibrinogenolysis. These results may be used to optimize <b>saruplase</b> treatment in patients with impaired cardiac function or after co-medication with drugs that affect liver blood flo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The Liquemin in Myocardial Infarction During Thrombolysis With <b>Saruplase</b> (LIMITS) {{study was}} instituted to {{evaluate}} and characterize {{the effect of a}} prethrombolytic heparin bolus (5, 000 IU) on the efficacy and safety of <b>saruplase</b> in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Background. Heparin has been used after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction to prevent reocclusion of the infarct-related artery. Methods. The study was designed as a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, multicenter trial. Patients were treated within 6 h of onset of symptoms with either a bolus of 5, 000 IU of heparin (Liquemin) (n = 56, HSH group) or placebo (n = 62, PSH group) before thrombolytic treatment with <b>saruplase</b> given as a 20 -mg bolus followed by an infusion of 60 mg over 60 min. Thirty minutes after completion of thrombolysis, an intravenous heparin infusion was administered for 5 days. Before coronary angiography was performed at 6 to 12 h after start of lysis, an additional bolus of 5, 000 IU heparin was given to all patients. End points studied were patency of the infarct-related artery, changes in the hemostatic system and bleeding complications. Results. In the HSH group (heparin—saruplase—heparin), 78. 6 % of patients had an open infarct-related vessel (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow grade 2 or 3) compared with 56. 5 % in the PSH group (placebo—saruplase—heparin) (intention-to-treat analysis, p = 0. 01). No significant difference was observed between the two groups with regard to changes in fibrinogen and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. A total of eight bleeding complications (14. 3 %) were observed in the HSH group and five (8. 1 %) in the PSH group; no cerebrovascular event occurred, and no allergic reaction was reported. A total of 12 patients died during the hospital stay, 3 in the HSH group (5. 4 %) and 9 in the PSH group (14. 5 %). Conclusions. In acute myocardial infarction, the administration of a heparin bolus before thrombolytic therapy with <b>saruplase</b> is associated with a significantly higher patency at angiography 6 to 12 h after the start of thrombolysis without any appreciable increase in risk of bleeding...|$|E
40|$|The {{thrombolytic}} {{efficacy of}} recombinant unglycosylated full length single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA, <b>saruplase),</b> applied either as single intravenous bolus or {{as a continuous}} infusion over 60 minutes, was studied in 5 randomized blinded groups of 5 dogs with combined copper coil induced coronary artery thrombosis and 125 I-fibrin labeled femoral vein clots. Infusion of 1 mg/kg recu-PA (group I) induced coronary recanalization in 4 of 5 dogs and 98 +/- 1 % (mean +/- SEM) venous clot lysis. Bolus injection of 1 mg/kg recu-PA (group II) caused reflow in 3 of 5 dogs and 88 +/- 5 percent venous clot lysis. Infusion of 0. 5 mg/kg rescu-PA (group III) achieved reflow in 3 of 5 dogs and 52 +/- 6 % venous clot lysis. Bolus injection of 0. 5 mg/kg rscu-PA (group IV) induced reflow in 4 of 5 dogs and 48 +/- 12 % venous clot lysis. Placebo infusion (group V) was associated with late recanalization in 1 of 5 dogs and 18 +/- 8 % venous clot lysis. Coronary artery reocclusion after reflow was not observed in groups I and II, but occurred in 2 of 3 animals in group III and in 3 of 4 animals in group IV (P =. 02). The time to reflow in responsive animals was 22 +/- 5 minutes with infusion of 0. 5 or 1 mg/kg rscu-PA and 14 +/- 1 minute with bolus injection of 0. 5 or 1 mg/kg (P =. 14). Depletion of fibrinogen and alpha 2 -antiplasmin to less than 25 % of baseline levels was observed in the 5 dogs given 1 mg/kg rscu-PA by bolus and in 3 of the 5 dogs given 1 mg/kg rscu-PA via infusion, but in none of the dogs that received 0. 5 mg/kg rscu-PA (P less than. 001). Plasma clearance rates were 170 +/- 44 and 230 +/- 30 mL/minute after bolus injection and 190 +/- 47 and 310 +/- 56 mL/minute during infusion of rscu-PA for the 1 mg/kg and 0. 5 mg/kg doses respectively. Thus, intravenous bolus injection of rscu-PA (<b>saruplase)</b> appears to be equipotent to an infusion over 60 minutes for both coronary and venous thrombolysis.

40|$|Background. Chimeric {{molecules}} {{comprising the}} A-chain of tissue-type plasminogen activa-tor (t-PA) and the catalytic domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) have intact enzymatic characteristics of u-PA, partial fibrin-binding properties of t-PA, and thrombolytic properties in animal models comparable with but not superior {{to those of}} single-chain u-PA (scu-PA). Deletion of the finger and growth factor domains (t-PA-AFE/scu-PA-e) in such chimeras further reduces their affinity for fibrin. Methods and Results. A detailed investigation of the thrombolytic potency and the pharmaco-kinetics of t-PA and u-PA chimeras was performed in quantitative animal models for thrombolysis.

Deletion of the finger and growth factor domains (t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e) in such chimeras further reduces their affinity for fibrin. METHODS AND RESULTS. A detailed investigation of the thrombolytic potency and the pharmacokinetics of t-PA and u-PA chimeras was performed in quantitative animal models for thrombolysis. In hamsters with pulmonary embolism, in rabbits with jugular vein thrombosis, and in baboons with femoral vein thrombosis, the thrombolytic potency (percent lysis per milligram of compound administered per kilogram of body weight) of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e {{was significantly higher than}} that of recombinant scu-PA (rscu-PA, <b>Saruplase)</b> as shown by a maximal rate of 720 +/- 170 % versus 45 +/- 5 % lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0. 01) in hamsters, 210 +/- 18 % versus 49 +/- 3 % lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0. 01) in rabbits, and 310 +/- 73 % versus 90 +/- 0. 3 % lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (p less than 0. 01) in baboons. However, the specific thrombolytic activity (percent lysis per microgram per milliliter steady-state plasma antigen level) of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e was not significantly different from that of rscu-PA in hamsters (210 +/- 57 % versus 160 +/- 27 % lysis per microgram per milliliter antigen level) and was lower than that of rscu-PA in rabbits (37 +/- 4 % versus 130 +/- 5 % lysis per microgram per milliliter antigen level; p less than 0. 01). In dogs with a combined femoral vein blood clot and a platelet-rich femoral arterial eversion graft thrombosis, 0. 25 mg/kg body wt bolus injections of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e produced significantly more venous clot lysis (90 +/- 5 %, n = 10) than 0. 25 mg/kg rscu-PA (26 +/- 3 %, n = 10) (p less than 0. 001) and, at the arterial side, more frequent (10 of 10 dogs versus three of 10 dogs) and more persistent (six of 10 dogs versus none of 10 dogs) recanalization (p = 0. 002). After bolus injection in hamsters, rabbits, or baboons, t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e had a fourfold to sixfold longer initial half-life than rscu-PA and a slower plasma clearance of sixfold in hamsters, 10 -fold in rabbits, and more than 10 -fold in baboons. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e has a markedly enhanced thrombolytic potency toward venous and arterial thrombi caused by a delayed in vivo clearance with relatively maintained specific thrombolytic activity. These properties suggest that the chimera may be clinically useful for thrombolytic therapy by bolus administration in patients with thromboembolic disease. status: publishe...|$|E
