5000|$|Cedrela odorata {{is a very}} {{important}} timber tree, producing a lightweight fragrant wood with very good resistance to termites and other wood-boring insects, and also rot-resistant outdoors. The wood is often sold under the name [...] "Spanish-cedar" [...] (like many trade names, confusing as it is neither <b>Spanish</b> nor a <b>cedar),</b> and is the traditional wood used for making cigar boxes, as well as being used for general outdoor and construction work, paneling and veneer wood. It is also used for the necks of classical guitars, as well as the linings (interior strips of wood that attach {{the top and bottom of}} the guitar to the sides). Some species are now CITES-listed, in particular Cedrela odorata. It is also grown as an ornamental tree, and has become naturalized in some areas in Africa, southeast Asia and Hawaii.

50|$|Cedrela odorata is {{the most}} commercially {{important}} and widely distributed species in the genus Cedrela. Known as <b>Spanish</b> <b>cedar</b> in English commerce, the aromatic wood is in high demand in the American tropics because it is naturally termite- and rot-resistant. An attractive, moderately lightweight wood (specific gravity 0.4), its primary use is in household articles used to store clothing. Cedro heartwood contains an aromatic and insect-repelling resin that {{is the source of}} its popular name, Spanish-cedar (it resembles the aroma of true cedars (Cedrus spp.) Cedro works easily and makes excellent plywood and veneer and would be more widely used if it could be successfully plantation grown. This plant is often used for honey production (beekeeping) and humidor construction. It is occasionally used for tops or veneers on some kinds of electric guitars. The wood is the traditional choice for making the neck of flamenco and classical guitars.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sculpture}} {{is of an}} undulating serpent {{with heads}} of each side. A single block of <b>Spanish</b> <b>cedar</b> wood forms the sculpture's base. The back side has been hollowed out, possibly to make the sculpture lighter. The back, once gilded, is not plain, and only the heads have decorations on both sides. The outer body of the two-headed snake is covered in a mosaic of turquoise, accented by red spiny oyster. Turquoise stones were broken in small, flat tesserae and adhered to the wooden body with pine resin. By using 2,000 small pieces, the flat pieces of stone {{give the impression of}} a faceted, curvilinear surface. The turquoise was cut and ground using stone tools.Some of the turqoise was imported to Mesoamerica from approximately 1,600 km to the northwest, from the Four Corners Region of the American Southwest where the Ancestral Pueblo people mined the stone.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{hardwoods}} {{currently used}} for exterior shutters, specifically <b>Spanish</b> <b>cedar,</b> Honduran mahogany and teak, {{are resistant to}} rot and decay, and far more durable than a softer wood like untreated pine. Because of the tannin in these woods they are also not prone to problems from insects. Pressure treatment with wood preservative makes pine, cedar {{and other types of}} wood suitable for exterior shutters. Non-functional exterior shutters can be constructed from wood, vinyl, fiberglass or other synthetic materials. Non-functional shutters can be simply screwed or bolted directly to the building, with spacers or other hardware to prevent water accumulating against the wall. Fiberglass, a material widely used for boat hulls, is not prone to rotting or twisting, is dimensionally stable and has low expansion and contraction. It is a reinforced plastic, unlike vinyl or PVC, so fiberglass shutters do not have a tendency to warp or sag. Its strength is comparable to aluminum; however, it does not suffer from corrosion and electrolysis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{level of}} {{humidity}} in which cigars are kept {{has a significant}} effect on their taste. It is believed that a cigar's flavor best evolves when stored at a relative humidity of approximately 65-70% and a temperature of 18 C. An ideal rate of humidity allows an even burning of the cigar. Conversely, dry cigars become fragile and burn faster while damp cigars burn unevenly and take on a heavy acidic flavor. Humidors together with their humidifiers are then used to serve this purpose. Without a humidor, within 2 to 3 days, cigars will quickly lose moisture and level up with the general humidity around them. A humidor's interior lining is typically constructed with three types of wood: <b>Spanish</b> <b>cedar,</b> American (or Canadian) red cedar, and Honduran mahogany. Other materials used for making or lining a humidor are , Tin ( [...] mainly seen in older early humidors) and Copper, used widely in the 1920s-1950s.|$|E
50|$|A new humidor {{requires}} seasoning {{and once}} seasoned {{needs to have}} its humidity maintained in some fashion. The inside of a humidor should be lined in dried <b>Spanish</b> <b>cedar</b> wood. The thicker the lining the better as it will provide the best environment for the cigars. The internal wood of a new humidor will not contain much moisture. The inside needs to be seasoned: allowing it to absorb moisture {{so that it can}} maintain the desired humidity level. There are many methods to season a humidor but the most common is to fill up a shot glass with distilled water, place it into the humidor, close it up, and let it sit for two weeks, checking on it every couple of days. Any method you use that consists of using water, you should use distilled water so that you are using something with the least amount of impurities. There are also seasoning packs that you can use from companies like Boveda if you choose to go that route instead of using water.|$|E

Strategies for future research are discussed, and we conclude that the best option for successful shoot borer management lies in using resistant planting stock in silvicultural or agroforestry systems to encourage natural biological control or otherwise minimize the abundance and adverse effects of shoot borers...|$|E
40|$|While {{the demand}} for big-leaf {{mahogany}} and <b>Spanish</b> <b>cedar</b> timber does not decline, the supply of these regionally important fine hardwood species has dwindled significantly. Plantations can help meet this demand, if the shoot borer is controlled through silvicultural techniques as well as selected seed sources. A participatory domestication program was implemented to improve germplasm quality and access in the Yucatan peninsula. Medium and short term strategies included the establishment of provenance/progeny trials, the conservation of a natural seed stand, and selection of urban seed trees. Five and two year data show significant differences between seed sources for growth and pest attack characteristics, indicating potential for genetic and economic gain. The process used for selection of seed trees in a 400 ha forest was simple and inexpensive, but also demonstrated that many trees may not be suitable for seed sources. The use and comparison of seed from urban trees is a useful educational tool in the domestication process. All of these efforts show {{the importance of a}} wide genetic base in reforestation programs.

40|$|Seedlings {{of three}} {{commercial}} native tree species were planted under heterogeneous light and nutrient conditions in primary rainforest, secondary forest, and open pasture in Los Tuxtlas (Veracruz, Mexico). Management consisted of weeding around seedlings, and watering {{during the dry}} period.

Using stepwise multiple linear regression, the combined effect of varying canopy openness, leaf nutrients, initial seedling height, and seed mass on the plant height {{at the end of}} the study were analysed. The effect of the light environment differed clearly between species: the fruit species Pouteria sapota (Jacquin) H. E.

40|$|<b>Spanish</b> <b>Cedar</b> (Cedrela odorata L.) is a {{globally}} important timber species {{which has}} been severely exploited in Mesoamerica for over 200 years. Using polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphisms, its chloroplast (cp) DNA phylogeography was studied in Mesoamerica with samples from 29 populations in six countries. Five haplotypes were characterized, phylogenetically grouped into three lineages (Northern, Central and Southern). Spatial analysis of ordered genetic distance confirmed deviation from a pattern of isolation by distance. The geographically proximate Northern and Central cpDNA lineages were genetically the most differentiated, with the Southern lineage appearing between them on a minimum spanning tree. However, populations possessing Southern lineage haplotypes occupy distinct moist habitats, in contrast to populations possessing Northern and Central lineage haplotypes which occupy drier and more seasonal habitats. Given the known colonization of the proto-Mesoamerican peninsula by South American flora and fauna prior {{to the formation of}} the Isthmus of Panama, it seems most likely that the observed population structure in C. odorata results from repeated colonization of Mesoamerica from South American source populations. Such a model would imply an ancient, pre-Isthmian colonization of a dry-adapted type (possessing the Northern lineage or a prototype thereof), with a secondary colonization via the land bridge. Following this, a more recent (possibly post-Pleistocene) expansion of moist-adapted types possessing the Southern lineage from the south fits the known vegetation history of the region...|$|E
40|$|In Latin America and the Caribbean, {{precious}} wood species like mahoganies (Swietenia spp.) and cedars (Cedrela spp.) {{are seriously}} injured by the mahogany shootborer, Hypsipyla grandella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larva, which bores {{into the main}} shoot of trees. In previous experiments focused on searching for a preventive method for managing this pest, a wood extract of bitterwood, Quassia amara L. ex Blom (Simaroubaceae) had been shown to cause phagodeterrence to larvae. Therefore, three fractions (water, methanol and diethyl ether) of a wood extract were tested for their phagodeterrence to larvae, by means of laboratory and greenhouse trials. Phagodeterrence was assessed by determining their effect on foliage consumption, mortality and signs of damage (number of orifices, sawdust piles, fallen shoots, number of tunnels and tunnel length) caused by larvae on <b>Spanish</b> <b>cedar</b> (C. odorata). Both the methanol and diethyl ether fractions caused phagodeterrence, by strongly reducing foliage consumption and signs of damage, while not causing larval mortality. The lowest concentration at which phagodeterrence was detected for the methanol fraction corresponded to 0. 0625 %, which is equivalent to a 1. 0 % of the bitterwood crude extract. However, results with the diethyl ether fraction were unsatisfactory, as none of the treatments differed from the solvent, possibly because of an adverse effect of the solvent on foliar tissues.
