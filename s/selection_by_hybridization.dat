Exploitation of the full potential of the current platforms requires a subset of the genome of medical interest to be isolated for targeted sequencing. To meet this need, a variety of methods have been developed {{in the last few years}} to carry out genome partitioning. Two recent strategies include capture by circularization (Porreca et al. 2007) and <b>selection</b> <b>by</b> <b>hybridization</b> (Albert et al. 2007; Hodges et al. 2007; Okou et al. 2007; Gnirke et al. 2009; Ng et al. 2009; Turner et al. 2009). With different strengths and weaknesses, nearly all of these strategies can be used to enrich megabase-scale target regions. These can be continuous genomic intervals or a full complement of protein-coding exons (Albert et al. 2007; Hodges et al. 2007; Okou et al. 2007; Bau et al. 2009; Gnirke et al. 2009; Ng et al. 2009; Turner et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{sequencing}} {{large numbers of}} random cDNAs in {{the human genome project}} has clearly shown value in gene discovery and mapping. We previously demonstrated a simple approach to rapidly identify musclespecific pig cDNAs for sequencing by strong hybridization to muscle cDNA probes. In this report, we sequenced additional muscle cDNAs, emphasizing clones that were not strongly expressed in muscle. Fewer clones matched known muscle-specific genes in the pig or other species, indicating <b>selection</b> <b>by</b> <b>hybridization</b> is most accurate for strongly hybridizing clones showing weak signals with non-muscle probes. Some muscle-specific clones, however, also were identified by sequencing the weakly hybridizing class of cDNAs. One of these was M 239, encoding muscle-specific desmin, which is an intermediate filament protein involved in holding muscle fibers together. As desmin may be an interesting candidate gene for muscle tenderness, the desmin gene (DES) was fully sequenced and mapped both physically and genetically. Pig desmin is highly conserved, being more than 97 % identical at the amino acid level to human and mouse desmin. Linkage of DES was observed for three loci already mapped to pig chromosome 15 (SSC 15), and physical mapping placed DES on SSC 15 q 23 - 26. This mapping information will be useful in further studies on the role of DES in muscle biology and muscle tenderness traits...|$|E

40|$|HLA-DR antigens are {{polymorphic}} cell surface glycoproteins {{involved in}} {{the control of the}} immune response in man. They consist of two subunits, the alpha and the beta chains. In addition, an invariant glycoprotein of Mr 33, 000 (DRp 33) is associated intracellularly with HLA-DR antigens. A cDNA clone for DRp 33, called 33 - 10, was isolated. Because no amino acid sequence has yet been determined for DRp 33 the identification of cDNA clone 33 - 10 was based on <b>selection</b> of mRNA <b>by</b> <b>hybridization,</b> subsequent translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with microsomes, and translation in microinjected Xenopus oocytes followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-DR antiserum. The translation products assembled with DR alpha and beta chains in oocytes coinjected with all three mRNAs. Assembly of DR alpha and beta chains was also observed in the absence of DRp 33 mRNA. Furthermore, when compared with DRp 33 immunoprecipitated from a human B-cell line, translation products of the hybrid-selected mRNA showed (i) identical migration in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, (ii) identical apparent molecular weight in the absence of N-linked glycosylation, and (iii) a very similar two-dimensional peptide map. Transcription of the DRp 33 gene into a mRNA 1, 400 nucleotides long was observed in B cells but was undetectable in T-cell lines and was very low in liver. Thus, DRp 33 appears to be coordinately expressed with DR alpha and beta chains.

To identify the consequences of hybridization between Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, we estimated multiple fitness components for F 1 hybrids and backcross progeny and used these to compare the relative fitness of parental species and their hybrids across two generations. We document many sources of intrinsic (developmental) and extrinsic (ecological) selection that dramatically increase the fitness costs of hybridization beyond the well-documented F 1 male sterility in this model system. Our results indicate that the cost of hybridization accrues over multiple generations and reinforcement in this system is driven <b>by</b> <b>selection</b> against <b>hybridization</b> above and beyond the cost of hybrid male sterility; we estimate a fitness loss of > 95 % relative to the parental species across two generations of hybridization.

For this purpose, 20 hybrids obtained from the crosses between five cytoplasmic male sterile lines with four fertility restorer lines were evaluated in a randomized complete blocks design with three replications in the Agricultural Research Station, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran in 2009. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences between the hybrids for most traits and therefore it was possible to estimate genetic variance components through line × tester method. Results showed that plant height, head diameter, 1000 -seeds weight and oil content were under the control of additive gene effects. Over dominance gene effects were observed for time of flower initiation, stem diameter and grain yield. This justifies the production of hybrid varieties. Male sterile line 52 and R 50 restorer line had a better general combining ability for seed yield. Hybrids 52 × R 26 and 222 × R 50 had the highest specific combining ability.

Southern blot analysis of restriction enzyme digested chicken spleen DNA suggested that all the isolated cDNA clones correspond to the same gene(s). Northern blot hybridization revealed that the vinculin-specific cDNA clones react with a single 6. 5 kb mRNA in total cellular RNA preparations of CEF, whole chicken embryos and chicken gizzard smooth muscle. Moreover, fractionation of CEF poly(A) + RNA by sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by translation in cell free system indicated that the mRNA coding for vinculin has a size of about 6. 0 - 7. 0 kb.
