40|$|Fumonisins (FBs) are {{the major}} mycotoxins {{produced}} by Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum, which are found worldwide in maize and maize products. FBs toxic dose and clinical signs of toxicity vary from one species to another. FBs toxicity is commonly linked to their ability on blocking <b>sphingolipids</b> <b>metabolism</b> in all animal species, including avian species. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} ducks exhibit higher sensitivity to FBs toxicity than turkeys, whereas, the accumulation of sphinganine (Sa) in tissues is more pronounced in turkeys than in ducks. The objectives of our works were to investigate the causes which lead to different toxicity between ducks and turkeys to FBs exposure. The following three hypotheses were investigated: i) Toxicokinetics of fumonisin B 2 in ducks and turkeys. ii) Ability of bird cells to protect themselves against high accumulation of free sphingolipids by increasing their catabolism (phosphorylation). iii) Other toxicity mechanisms of FBs rather than their alteration of <b>sphingolipids</b> <b>metabolism</b> (oxidative stress damage and inflammatory responses). The analysis of toxicokinetic parameters of fumonisin B 2 did not provide a significant difference between ducks and turkeys. The measurement of simultaneous toxicity of FBs in ducks and turkeys confirmed higher sensibility of ducks. Also the accumulation of Sphingasine- 1 -Phosphate (Sa 1 P) in the liver correlated with the amount of Sa but not parameters of hepatic toxicity. Moreover, this study revealed that the amount of Sa in the liver was strongly dependent on the amount of FBs. On the other hand, FBs had no effect on oxidative damages parameters in both species. Interestingly, FBs had mild inflammatory response effect in ducks but not in turkeys. Further investigation on the effects of FBs on ceramide metabolism and inflammatory processes would be necessary to understand the different toxicity between ducks and turkeys to FBs exposure...|$|R

40|$|The {{sphingomyelin}} pathway is an ubiquitous, evolutionary conserved {{signaling system}} which transduces an extracellular signal into the cell. During {{the past few}} years increasing evidence has shown that the sphingolipid ceramide may play a role as a second messenger in intracellular signal transduction. The ceramide generation via sphingomyelinase (SMase) is followed by three major cellular responses: cell growth arrest, induction of cell differentiation and/or induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether activation of SMases and generation of ceramide can be induced by UVB radiation in normal human keratinocytes. The present data show that exposure to UVB radiation results in rapid generation of ceramide. The ceramide accumulation starts 15 min after UV exposure and progressively increases up to 24 h. In vitro measurement of SMase activity following exposure to UVB evidences an activation of both neutral and acidic SMases. Moreover, UVB induces apoptosis in normal human keratinocytes as shown by TUNEL technique and FACS analysis. These data indicate that UVB induced ceramide generation and activation of both neutral and acidic SMases, suggesting that <b>sphingolipids</b> <b>metabolism</b> may be involved in the UVB signaling pathway.

40|$|Sphingolipid bioactivities in the {{respiratory}} airways and {{the roles of}} the proteins that handle them have been extensively investigated. Gas or inhaled particles or microorganisms come into contact with mucus components, epithelial cells, blood barrier, and immune surveillance within the airways. Lung structure and functionality rely on a complex interplay of polar and hydrophobic structures forming the surfactant layer and governing external-internal exchanges, such as glycerol-phospholipids sphingolipids and proteins. Sphingolipids act as important signaling mediators involved in the control of cell survival and stress response, as well as secreted molecules endowed with inflammation-regulatory activities. Most successful respiratory infection and injuries evolve in the alveolar compartment, the critical lung functional unit involved in gas exchange. <b>Sphingolipid</b> altered <b>metabolism</b> in this compartment is closely related to inflammatory reaction and ceramide increase, in particular, favors the switch to pathological hyperinflammation. This short review explores a few mechanisms underlying sphingolipid involvement in the healthy lung (surfactant production and endothelial barrier maintenance) and in a selection of lung pathologies in which the impact of <b>sphingolipid</b> synthesis and <b>metabolism</b> is most apparent, such as acute lung injury, or chronic pathologies such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|R
30|$|Lipidomics {{methods are}} widely used in {{identification}} and validation of disease-specific biomarkers, which are required more sensitive and specific to disease severity, duration, subtype, and response to therapy. The diversity of lipids in healthy and diseases requires reliable methodologies for qualitative and quantitative detection of lipidomic profiles. Lipidomics is developing rapidly with the improvement of a strong sensitivity and precision in those advanced technologies. It is expected {{that more and more}} lipid ligands can be discovered in coming studies. The study and analysis methods of lipidomics are mainly based on mass spectrometry, e.g. liquid-chromatography or matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging. Those methodologies have the ability to analyze a large of lipids with different physico-chemical properties, including polarity, solubility, and molecular weights [12]. For example lipid markers can be used in the diagnosis of non small cell lung cancer as a noninvasive biomarker. Biostatistical analysis on lipids can produce a highly sensitive and specifically predictive model to classify breast cancer patients between benign and malignant [13]. After comprehensive data analysis, lipid involved in glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and <b>sphingolipids</b> <b>metabolism</b> especially phosphatidylglycerol (34 : 0), sphingomyelin (42 : 2), ceramide (44 : 5), lysophosphatidylcholine (18 : 3), sphatidylcholine (18 : 2), phosphatidylethanolamine (O- 36 : 3), phosphatidylethanolamine (O- 38 : 3) and sphingomyelin (38 : 8) were significantly proposed to be a potential biomarkers in colorectal cancer and showed an excellent specificity between healthy controls and colorectal cancer patients [14].|$|R

40|$|Background: Thyroid hormones (THs) are key {{regulators}} {{of cardiac}} physiology {{as well as}} modulators of different cellular signals including the sphingomyelin/ceramide pathway. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of hyperthyroidism on the <b>metabolism</b> of <b>sphingolipids</b> in the muscle heart. Methods: Male Wistar rats were treated for 10 days with triiodothyronine (T 3) at a dose of 50 µg/ 100 g of body weight. Animals were then anaesthetized and samples of the left ventricle were excised. Results: We have demonstrated that prolonged, in vivo, T 3 treatment increased the content of sphinganine (SFA), sphingosine (SFO), ceramide (CER) and sphingomyelin (SM), but decreased the level of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) in cardiac muscle. Accordingly, the changes in sphingolipids content were accompanied by a lesser activity of neutral sphingomyelinase and without significant changes in ceramidases activity. Hyperthyroidism also induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) with subsequently increased expression of mitochondrial proteins: cytochrome c oxidase IV (COX IV), β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (β-HAD), carnityne palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) and nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&# 947; coactivator- 1 α (PGC 1 α). Conclusions: We conclude that prolonged T 3 treatment increases <b>sphingolipids</b> <b>metabolism</b> which is reflected by higher concentration of SFA and CER in heart muscle. Furthermore, hyperthyroidism-induced increase in heart sphingomyelin (SM) concentration might be one of the mechanisms underlying maintenance of CER at relatively low level by its conversion to SM together with decreased S 1 P content...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes related {{cognitive}} dysfunction (DACD), {{one of the}} chronic complications of diabetes, seriously {{affect the quality of}} life in patients and increase family burden. Although the initial stage of DACD can lead to metabolic alterations or potential pathological changes, DACD is difficult to diagnose accurately. Moreover, the details of the molecular mechanism of DACD remain somewhat elusive. To understand the pathophysiological changes that underpin the development and progression of DACD, we carried out a global analysis of metabolic alterations in response to DACD. The metabolic alterations associated with DACD were first investigated in humans, using plasma metabonomics based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis. The related pathway of each metabolite of interest was searched in database online. The network diagrams were established KEGGSOAP software package. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of metabolites. This is the first report of reliable biomarkers of DACD, which were identified using an integrated strategy. The identified biomarkers give new insights into the pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms of DACD. The disorders of <b>sphingolipids</b> <b>metabolism,</b> bile acids metabolism, and uric acid metabolism pathway were found in T 2 DM and DACD.

40|$|Sphingosine kinase (SphK) catalyzes the {{phosphorylation}} of sphingosine to sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), is a {{key enzyme}} controlling <b>sphingolipids</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Current study was aimed to investigate potential roles of SphK in regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and its metabolic actions. This thesis has provided evidence demonstrating the importance of SphK. The key findings are: (1) Insulin induces SphK activation in hepatocytes. (2) Insulin-stimulated Akt and Erk 1 / 2 phosphorylation was significantly attenuated by SphK inhibitor (SKI II). (3) Abrogated insulin-induced SphK activation by overexpressing of dominant negative SphK (SphKG 82 D) resulted in dramatic attenuation of insulin signaling, whereas overexpressing wild-type SphK (SphKwt) caused significant potentiation of insulin signaling. (4) siRNA-mediated knockdown of SphK 2 led to significant attenuation of insulin signaling (5) Down-regulating S 1 P receptor 3 (S 1 P 3) by siRNA strategy profoundly inhibited insulin and S 1 P-mediated Akt phosphorylation, suggesting the effect of SphK is specifically mediated by extracellular action of S 1 P on receptor of S 1 P 3. (6) Insulin-mediated suppression of glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expression were significantly attenuated by SphK 2 inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that insulin induces SphK 2 phosphorylation at Thr- 578, which may also necessary for nuclear translocation of the enzyme. In summary, this project has identified a novel regulatory role of SphK 2 in insulin signaling and glucose production in hepatocytes.

40|$|The sphingolipidome is {{the portion}} of the lipidome that {{encompasses}} all sphingoid bases and their derivatives. Whereas the most studied sphingoid base is sphingosine [(2 S, 3 R, 4 E) - 2 -aminooctadecene- 1, 3 -diol], mammals have dozens of structural variants, and hundreds of additional types have been found in other eukaryotic organisms and some bacteria and viruses.

40|$|Abstract The host {{response}} to infection and inflammation {{is associated with}} multiple alterations in lipid metabolism.

40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MS) is a prevalent {{and severe}} comorbidity observed in schizophrenia (SZ). The {{exact nature of}} this association is controversial and very often accredited {{to the effects of}} psychotropic medications and disease-induced life-style modifications, such as inactive lifestyle, poor dietary choices and smoking. However, drug therapy and disease-induced lifestyle factors are likely not the only factors contributing to the observed converging nature of these conditions, since an increased prevalence of MS is also observed in first episode and drug-naïve psychosis populations. MS and SZ share common intrinsic susceptibility factors and etiopathogenic mechanisms, which may change the way we approach clinical management of SZ patients. Among the most relevant common pathogenic pathways of SZ and MS are alterations in the <b>sphingolipids</b> (SLs) <b>metabolism</b> and SLs homeostasis. SLs have important structural functions as they participate in the formation of membrane lipid rafts. SLs also play physiological roles in cell differentiation, proliferation and inflammatory processes, which might be part of MS/SZ common pathophysiological processes. In this article we review a plausible mechanism to explain the link between MS and SZ through a disruption in SL homeostasis. Additionally, we provide insights on how this hypothesis can lead to the developing of new diagnostic/therapeutic technologies for SZ patients...|$|R
40|$|Leishmania parasites {{alternate}} between flagellated promastigotes in sand flies and nonflagellated amastigotes in mammals, causing {{a spectrum of}} serious diseases. To survive, they must resist the harsh conditions in phagocytes (including acidic pH, elevated temperature, and increased oxidative/nitrosative stress) and evade the immune response. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of <b>sphingolipid</b> (SL) <b>metabolism</b> in Leishmania virulence. In particular, we have generated a Leishmania major iscl− mutant which is deficient in SL degradation but grows normally as promastigotes in culture. Importantly, iscl− mutants cannot induce pathology in either immunocompetent or immunodeficient mice yet are able to persist at low levels. In this study, we investigated how the degradation of SLs might contribute to Leishmania infection. First, unlike wild-type (WT) L. major, iscl− mutants do not trigger polarized T cell responses in mice. Second, like WT parasites, iscl− mutants possess the ability to downregulate macrophage activation by suppressing the production of interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) and nitric oxide. Third, during the stationary phase, iscl− promastigotes were extremely vulnerable to acidic pH but not to other adverse conditions, such as elevated temperature and oxidative/nitrosative stress. In addition, inhibition of phagosomal acidification significantly improved iscl− survival in murine macrophages. Together, these findings indicate that SL degradation by Leishmania is essential for its adaption to the acidic environment in phagolysosomes but is not required for the suppression of host cell activation. Finally, our studies with iscl− mutant-infected mice suggest that having viable, persistent parasites {{is not sufficient to}} provide immunity against virulent Leishmania challenge...|$|R

Associated with these chemical changes of <b>sphingolipid</b> composition and <b>metabolism,</b> the following phenotypic changes were observed: (i) loss of the cobblestone appearance at cell density saturation and development of fibroblastic appearance with partial overlapping of cells; (ii) reduction of cell growth rate; (iii) enhanced production of lactic acid; (iv) enhanced rate of glucose transport; and (v) higher incidence of large colony formation with infiltrating appearance in soft agar. Cell morphology changes, lactate pruduction, and enhanced sugar uptake were reversed by co-culturing cells with gangliosides, particularly trisialogangliosides.

40|$|Background Growing {{evidence}} {{emphasizes the}} relevance of <b>sphingolipids</b> for <b>metabolism</b> and immunity of antigen-presenting cells (APC). APCs are key players in balancing tolerogenic and encephalitogenic responses in immunology. In contrast to the well-known prominent effects of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) on lymphocyte trafficking, modulatory effects on APCs have not been fully characterized. Methods Frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cell (DC) subtypes, monocytes, and T cell subsets in 35 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were evaluated prior and after undergoing fingolimod treatment for up to 24 months. Impact of fingolimod and S 1 P on maturation and activation profile, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and phagocytotic capacity was assessed in vitro and ex vivo. Modulation of DC-dependent programming of naïve CD 4 + T cells, as well as CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell proliferation, was also investigated in vitro and ex vivo. Results Fingolimod increased peripheral slanDC count—CD 1 + DC, and monocyte frequencies remained stable. While CD 4 + T cell count decreased, ratio of Treg/Th 17 significantly increased in fingolimod-treated patients over time. CD 83, CD 150, and HLADR were all inhibited, but CD 86 was upregulated in DCs after incubation {{in the presence of}} fingolimod. Fingolimod but not S 1 P was associated with reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from DCs and monocytes in vitro and ex vivo. Fingolimod also inhibited phagocytic capacity of slanDCs and monocytes. After fingolimod, slanDCs demonstrated reduced potential to induce interferon–gamma-expressing Th 1 or IL- 17 -expressing Th 17 cells and DC-dependent T cell proliferation in vitro and in fingolimod-treated patients. Conclusions We present the first evidence that S 1 P-directed therapies can act additionally as immunomodulators that decrease the pro-inflammatory capabilities of APCs, which is a crucial element in DC-dependent T cell activation and programming...|$|R
