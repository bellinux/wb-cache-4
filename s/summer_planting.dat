50|$|If {{the size}} of the {{planting}} program allows, {{there is little doubt that}} such scheduling would be advantageous in that it satisfies one, and commonly 2, of the factors essential for success: (1) the use of planting stock that is physiologically capable of responding to a growth environment at planting, and (2) planting when site factors favour tree survival and growth. The 3rd factor a good planting job, and although desirable in all plantings, is probably somewhat less critical in conventional spring plantings than at other times. If, however, a planting program cannot be completed in this way, there are other options: conventional fall planting with fresh-lifted stock; <b>summer</b> <b>planting</b> with fresh-lifted stock; and spring and <b>summer</b> <b>planting</b> with stored spring-lifted or fall-lifted stock.|$|E

Photorespiration was inhibited by high CO_ 2, but this effect was fully reversible with no after-effect of enrichment. Down regulation of photosynthesis in <b>summer</b> <b>plants,</b> consisting in a 25 % reduction in photosynthetic capacity and 25 % reduction in leaf area, appeared to be due to the enhancement by high CO_ 2 of limiting factors prevalent only at the high photosynthetic rates attained in <b>summer</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Conceptually and logistically, the {{simplest}} way of extending the conventional planting season is to extend lifting and planting of fresh stock through summer until the planting program has been competed. There is ample evidence that spruces may be planted successfully throughout the summer, not least the notable operational success of Marek (Personal communication, 1985, George T. Marek, R.P.F., Beardmore, Ontario, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources) in northwestern Ontario: [...] "the success of my plantations is primarily due to different strategies and cool storaging in Beardmore. I have planted all species from spring to late fall, throughout the summer on a large scale, without any difficulties". <b>Summer</b> <b>planting</b> has also been successful {{in a number of}} research studies with white spruce, e.g., Crossley 1956; Ackerman and Johnson 1962; Decie 1962 cited by Revel and Coates 1976; Burgar and Lyon 1968; Mullin 1971, 1974; Revel and Coates 1976. Success depends on minimizing stresses to planting stock at all stages from lifting through planting and on planting when site conditions are conducive to survival and growth.|$|E

The experiments were conducted in agricultural research farm, Isfahan University of Technology in the year 2000. The results showed that <b>summer</b> <b>planting</b> considerably and significantly reduced number of seedlings per unit area, days to 50 % flowering, and seed yield. However, maturity of the plants was delayed because of <b>summer</b> <b>planting.</b> According to overall average obtained for genotypes, seed yield was 1472 and 213 kg/ha {{in the first and}} second planting dates, respectively. There was a significant difference between genotypes for number of seedlings per unit area, days to 50 % flowering and maturity in both planting dates. However, genotypes were significantly different for seed yield in the first planting date. <b>Summer</b> <b>planting</b> also non-significantly reduced yield/plant, capsules/plant and 100 -seed weight and increased seeds/capsule. The differences between genotypes for these traits in both planting dates and for seeds/capsule in the first planting date were significant. The significant interaction between genotypes and planting dates on seeds/capsule and 100 -seed weight was because of increasing or decreasing levels of these traits in some genotypes when planting date was delayed. The results of regression analysis, correlation coefficients and path analysis showed that in both planting dates, capsules/plant followed by seeds/capsule and 100 -seed weight were the major components of yield/plant.

This crop is grown in summer time as a second crop in Isfahan province. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the agronomic characteristics of the safflower breeding lines which were isolated from local populations of Iran in early spring and <b>summer</b> <b>planting</b> dates. Seven genotypes were evaluated at two planting dates, early spring (16 March) and summer (21 June), using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 4 replications at the research farm of Isfahan University of Technology.

The average seed yield of genotypes was 2498 and 2845 kg/ha in spring and <b>summer</b> <b>planting</b> dates, respectively. In the first planting date, seed yield varied from 1876 Kg/ha, (for Kouseh genotype as check variety) to 2908 Kg/ha for E 2428 line (selected from Isfshan population).

In the second planting date the check variety (Kouseh population) had a seed yield of 2965 Kg/ha. In both first and second planting dates, genotypes of E 2428 and C 116 (selected line from Kouseh population) had the maximum oil content in the seed, (33. 9 % and 32. 3 %د respectively).

A field experiment was conducted in the summer of 2000 at the Agricultural Research Station, Isfahan University of Technology, using a randomized complete block design with a split plot layout and three replications. Main plots consisted of three row distances (30 cm flat and 45 and 60 cm on bed), and sub-plots included three planting densities (30, 40, and 50 plant m- 2). The experiment was planted in June 13 using local safflower variety of Isfahan, named Koseh. Leaf area index, number of heads per branch, number of seeds per head, 1000 -seed weight, seed yield per plant and harvest index were not significantly effected by row distance. Increase row distance significantly enhanced most developmental stages and increased number of branches per plant and per square meter, but significantly decreased number of heads per plant and per square meter and seed and petal yields. The highest seed and petal yields (3841 and 373 kg per ha, respectively) were obtained with 30 cm row distance. Plant density had no significant effect on number of branches per plant, number of seeds per head, 1000 -seed weight and seed yield per plant and per unit area. Plant density significantly enhanced most developmental stages and increased leaf area index, number of branches and number of heads per square meter, but significantly decreased number of heads per branch and per plant, petal yield and harvest index. The highest seed yield without petal clipping (4341 kg per ha) was obtained with 30 cm row distance and 50 plants m- 2 treatment.

The role of soil mounding and mulching {{for the establishment}} of C. glauca was investigated in a factorial experiment involving 2 levels of soil mounding (nil, 0. 15 m) and 4 mulch conditions (nil, hay, black plastic, white plastic), and in a second experiment involving bagasse, soil amendment with calcium, and the installation of a double ridge in the mound. The low soil mounding had little effect on plant survival or growth, or soil conductivity; however, mulching greatly influenced these parameters (e. g. about 2 years after a <b>summer</b> <b>planting,</b> tree survival, tree growth, and surface soil conductivity in a plastic mulch treatment was 566, 210, and 60 %, respectively, of values of the no-mulch treatment, with a mean tree height of about 3 m in the plastic mulch treatment).
