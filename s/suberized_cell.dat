40|$|Summary. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (Pch) {{is one of}} {{the main}} causal agents of {{tracheomycosis}} in grapevine. We characterize how this fungus affects the response of Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon to bark and xylem-tissue wounding after six weeks post-treatment. A histological investigation shows that, in xylem tissue, cell-wall modifications in response to wounding are related to suberin deposits rather than to lignin-induced wall thickening. The xylem response does not appear to be disturbed by Pch infection. Therefore, cell-wall modification strongly inhibits the development of wound-closure tissue (WCT) but does not prevent the differentiation of the necro-phylactic periderm. Hyphae localization in tissue surrounding the wound or inoculation sites indicates that Pch colonizes all cell types, such as vascular tissues, paratracheal parenchyma cells, fibers and rays. The results also suggest that efficient compartmentalization separating fascicular xylem portions is assured by thick <b>suberized</b> <b>cell</b> walls bordering the ray parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|Taro plants present high Ca absorption. There is {{evidence}} that the disorder "metsubure" is of nutritional origin being attributed to calcium deficiency. The metsubure is characterized by the corm apical bud suppression and a smooth lesion in the apex. This disorder reduces the taro corms value as food and hinders their utilization as a propagative material in commercial fields. In subterranean structures, Ca deficiency is believed to be more harmful to the vascular tissue cells since they have thicker walls than other tissue cells. Thus, this work aimed to characterize the anatomical changes in taro corms (Colocasia esculenta), cv. Chinese (BGH 5928) with "metsubure" symptoms. For this, corms with and without this symptom were obtained from plants grown in a greenhouse, in pots, containing soil. Corms presenting "metsubure" showed anatomical changes with damage in the vascular system which led to the suppression of apical bud formation, with detection of a wound periderm. In these corms, the periderm was thicker with compact and <b>suberized</b> <b>cell</b> layers; moreover parenchyma cells were larger with less starch accumulation as compared to corms without "metsubure" symptoms...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTPneumatophores of Mauritia vinifera Mart. were {{collected}} from six month-old plants maintained submerged in fresh water to induce pneumatophore formation. Twenty day-old pneumatophores had a quite prominent root cap. The epidermis was composed of hexagonal cells, tangentially distributed along the cylindric surface of the organ. In transverse section these pneumatophores had a simple epidermis over several layers of sclerified parenchyma, which covered an aerenchyma with large intercellular spaces. The endodermal cells had Casparian strips. The vascular cylinder was polyarch, with a pith and surrounded by a unisseriate pericycle. Anatomically the 4 monthold pneumatophores were similar to the younger ones, except {{for the absence of}} the epidermis. The epidermis is replaced by a protective tissue, whose lignified and <b>suberized</b> <b>cells</b> projected themselves outwards, giving it a filamentous aspect.

Large scale commercial utilization of cork has been only achieved with cork from Quercus suber. Another oak species, Quercus cerris, also contains substantial, albeit not continuous, regions of cork that are clearly {{visible to the naked}} eye but are so far considered as a waste material. Bark samples of Q. cerris var. cerris trees were collected from the Andırın province, Turkey. Cork portions were separated and their cellular structure was investigated with optical and electron scanning microscopy observations. The results were compared with Q. suber cork. Q. cerris cork has the typical features of cork tissues with a regular and radially aligned structure of <b>suberized</b> <b>cells</b> without intercellular voids, showing a ring structure and a distinction of earlycork and latecork cells. Solid volume fraction was estimated at 25 % (22 % in earlycork, 36 % in latecork). In Q. cerris cork cells are smaller, cell wall thickness and solid volume fraction are higher, and the tissue is less homogeneous with a higher content of lignified inclusions than in Q. suber cork. These factors will negatively influence quality in regard to density and mechanical properties associated to elasticity.

40|$|Storage {{temperature}} {{affects the}} rate {{and extent of}} wound-healing {{in a number of}} root and tuber crops. The effect of storage temperature on wound-healing in sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) roots, however, is largely unknown. Wound-healing of sugarbeet roots was investigated using surface-abraded roots stored at 6 and 12 °C for 28 d. Surface abrasions are common injuries of stored roots, and the storage temperatures used are typical of freshly harvested or rapidly cooled roots. Transpiration rate from the wounded surface and root weight loss were used to quantify wound healing. At 12 °C, transpiration rate from the wounded surface declined within 14 d and wounded roots lost weight at a rate similar to unwounded controls. At 6 °C, transpiration rate from the wounded surface did not decline in the 28 d after injury, and wounded roots lost 44 % more weight than controls after 28 d storage. Melanin formation, lignification, and suberization occurred more rapidly at 12 °C than at 6 °C, and a continuous layer of lignified and <b>suberized</b> <b>cells</b> developed at 12 °C, but not at 6 °C. Examination of enzyme activities involved in melanin, lignin, and suberin formation indicated that differences in melanin formation at 6 and 12 °C were related to differences in polyphenol oxidase activity, although no relationships between suberin or lignin formation and phenylalanine ammonia lyase or peroxidase activity were evident. Wound-induced respiration was initially greater at 12 °C than at 6 °C. However, with continued storage, respiration rate of wounded roots declined more rapidly at 12 °C, and over 28 d, the increase in respiration due to injury was 52 % greater in roots stored at 6 °C than in roots stored at 12 °C. The data indicate that storage at 6 °C severely slowed and impaired wound-healing of surface-abraded sugarbeet roots relative to roots stored at 12 °C and suggest that postharvest losses may be accelerated if freshly harvested roots are cooled too quickly...|$|R

ABA treatment resulted in a 3 -fold increase in the polymeric aliphatic components of suberin and a 4 -fold increase in the polymeric aromatic components. Hydrocarbons and fatty alcohols, two components characteristic of waxes associated with potato suberin, increased 9 - and 5 -fold, respectively, as a result of ABA treatment. Thus, the deposition of the polymeric aliphatics and aromatics as well as waxes, all of which have been postulated to be components of <b>suberized</b> <b>cell</b> walls, was markedly stimulated by ABA. ω-Hydroxy-fatty acid dehydrogenase which showed a rather high initial level of activity increased only 60 % due to ABA treatment.

Efforts are under-way to engineer improved varieties of the C 3 cereal crop rice by introducing NADP-malic enzyme C 4 photosynthesis using maize as a model system. However, several modifications to the rice leaf vasculature are potentially necessary, including the introduction of suberin lamellae into the bundle sheath cell walls. <b>Suberized</b> <b>cell</b> walls are ubiquitous in the root endodermis of all grasses, and developmental similarities are apparent between endodermis and bundle sheath cell walls. Nonetheless, there is considerable heterogeneity in sheath cell development and suberin composi-tion both within and between grass taxa.

Interspecies variation has confounded efforts to ascribe physiological differences specifically to the pres-ence or absence of suberin lamellae. Thus, specific perturbation of suberization within a uniform genetic background is needed, but, until recently, the genetic resources to manipulate suberin composition in the grasses were largely unavailable.

Although its root functions are thought to be very important for the enormous shoot growth, the morphological and anatomical studies are limited. This study investigates external and internal structures of sago roots with reference to their functions to distinguish two types of roots in each plant; i. e., large (about 6 - 11 mm diameter) and small (about 4 - 6 mm diameter) roots. Large roots were adventitious roots whose primordia were formed just inside the epidermis in the stem, emerged from the trunk surface and grew downward into the soil. Small roots were lateral roots whose primordia were formed on large roots running horizontally or on other small roots, grew not only downward and obliquely in both deep peat and mineral soils, but also right above in deep peat soils. Anatomical observations revealed that both large and small roots had the same internal structures containing epidermis, exodermis, <b>suberized</b> sclerenchyma. <b>cells,</b> cortex and stele, with only differences in their sizes or cell numbers.

40|$|In Florida, Meloidogyne christiei is a {{widespread}} root parasite of the turkey Oak (Quercus laevis) forming nodulelike galls, mainly by hyperplasia. Motile, vermiform juveniles infect lateral root tips {{at or near the}} apex. Upon penetration, nematodes appear to migrate through cortical parenchyma in a spiral manner to the phloem where feeding sites are initiated. Feeding sites are comprised of giant cells (hypertrophied phloem parenchyma) which contain granular cytoplasm and many unusual nuclei. Initially, the enlarged ovoid spherical multinucleolate nuclei have smooth envelopes. These nuclei elongate, aggregate, and their envelopes become lobed with age. Giant ce 11 cytoplasm commonly aggregates along the thickened walls which contain numerous pits. Sclerenchyma cells form where galls protrude from the root. Vascular tissue within galls appears disorganized. Young galls containing nematodes had one or two females, one or two males, a gelatinous matrix, and an average of 185 eggs and 52 juveniles. Matrix, eggs, and juveniles are located in a spiral duct which connects the female posterior to the rhizosphere. Duct development is initiated during nematode penetration and is associated with considerable cellular destruction. We hypothesize that the gelatinous matrix elicits the formation of periderm where cortical parenchyma cells had lined the duct.

Suberized cells form the periderm, the tissue that envelops secondary stems {{as part of}} the bark, and develop as the sealing tissue after wounding or leaf abscission. Suberin is a complex polyester built from poly-functional long-chain fatty acids (suberin acids) and glycerol. The suberin acids composition of a number of plant tissues and species is now established, but how the polyester macromolecule is assembled within the <b>suberized</b> <b>cell</b> walls is not known.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that Arabidopsis leaf cuticle thickness ranges from only 22 nm in leaf blades to 45 nm on petioles, causing the difficulty in cuticular membrane isolation. We report the use of polysaccharide hydrolases to isolate Arabidopsis cuticular membranes, suitable for depolymerization and subsequent compositional analysis. Although cutin characteristic omega-hydroxy acids (7 %) and mid-chain hydroxylated fatty acids (8 %) were detected, the discovery of alpha,omega-diacids (40 %) and 2 -hydroxy acids (14 %) as major depolymerization products reveals a so far novel monomer composition in Arabidopsis cutin, but with chemical analogy to root suberin. Histochemical and TEM analysis revealed that suberin depositions were localized to the cell walls in the endodermis of primary roots and the periderm of mature roots of Arabidopsis. Enzyme digested and solvent extracted root cell walls when subjected to suberin depolymerization conditions released omega-hydroxy acids (43 %) and alpha,omega-diacids (24 %) as major components together with carboxylic acids (9 %), alcohols (6 %) and 2 -hydroxyacids (0. 1 %).

30|$|In {{roots in}} which the xylem vessels are fully developed, the {{resistance}} to water transport occurs radially (Steudle and Peterson [1998]; Ruggiero et al. [2003]). Radial transport in roots crosses both the cell-to-cell pathway and the apoplastic pathway. The cell-to-cell route is composed of the symplastic (through the plasmodesmata) and the transcellular (involving crossing of membranes) paths. The apoplastic pathway is usually considered to have the least hydraulic resistance and is often {{considered to be the}} main route (Heinen et al. [2009]). However, the presence of lignified or <b>suberized</b> <b>cell</b> walls (casparian strips in root endodermis) which constitute apoplastic barriers forces water to cross cell membranes (Shimizu et al. [2005]). Several studies have attributed an important role to the cell-to-cell path. Water movement through cell membranes is facilitated by water channels, called “aquaporins” (AQPs) (Maurel [2007]). AQPs are integral membrane proteins that increase the permeability of membranes to water as well as other small molecules such as CO 2, glycerol and boron (Shimizu et al. [2005]; Chaumont et al. [2005]). AQP proteins contain thiol groups that are sensitive to HgCl 2 (Savage and Stroud [2007]). Assuming that mercurial inhibition of water transport occurs via the inhibition of AQPs, the strength of inhibition may indicate {{the extent to which the}} cell-to-cell (transcellular) water movement (involving water passing through membranes) is involved in the radial transport of water across the root. Therefore, to divide radial water transport in roots into cell-to-cell and apoplastic pathways, HgCl 2 has often been used as a specific AQP inhibitor in crops, herbs and trees (Maggio and Joly [1995]; Carvajal et al. [1996]; Tazawa et al. [1997]; Zhang and Tyerman [1999]; Wan and Zwiazek [1999]; North et al. [2004]; Kamaluddin and Zwiazek [2001]; Shimizu et al. [2005]; Sutka et al. [2011]).|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{pathological}} studies on watermelon wilt caused by Fusarium niveum, EFS., with special reference to the mcce by which the fungus gains {{the entrance to the}} healthy root, to bring on the wilting of watermelon. Fusarium niveum invades at first the root cap (fig. 1), and then into the primodial meristem, or directly attacks the primary meristem of the host plant (fig. 2, 3, 4). Then the fungus makes its way into the stele, penetrating through the meristematic tissue intercellulary and intracellulary (fig. 5, 6, 7). After the fungs gains its position in the stele, it progresses vigourously along the xylem elements, destructing the invaded tissues, for which any response of the host plant can not be found. In this way, finally, the wilting is resulted. When Fusarium niveum reaches the host tissue, e. g. root cap or protoderm or piliferous layer, the fungus penetrates the host tissue intercellulary; and no intracellular penetration through the living tissue is observed. The fungus which penetrated through young piliferous layer intercellulary into primary cortex (fig. 8, 9, 10), may be destructive to this parenchymatous tissue and may cause a blight of this region, but it cannot enter the stele to cause wilt of the host, in consequence of the premature suberization of the endodermis. As soon as the physiological function of the root hair is ended, the piliferous layer cells may produce the <b>suberized</b> exodermis <b>cells.</b> And by the protective action of the suberized exodermis the causal fungus is entirely refused. to enter inner tissue (fig. 11, 12). Although the fungus ma y invade the cortex of a root through a rapture produced by the emergence of a seondary root, it may not be allowed into the stele, {{because of the presence of}} the endodermis which is just suberized by the wound stimulus of the root tissue, owing to the emergence of the new root. Within sixteen hours, at 23 ℃, the fungus may penetrate the root cap and enter the meristematic tissue. The mode of infection of the host tissue by this fungus may well be called as 2 ̆ 2 Meristematic infection, 2 ̆ 2 because, its infection is successful only when the meristematic tissue is invaded. 本稿は西瓜の蔓割病 (麥凋病) の病理學的研究の一部をなすものであつて, 主として, 本病原菌が健全なる西瓜の根のどの部位より有效的に侵入するものであるかを探究したものである。本菌は西瓜の幼根の先端なる根冠を通過してその原始分裂組織に侵人し, 或は根冠の側方より直接初生分裂組織に侵入する。然る後根の心柱内に進んでこゝに繁殖し, つひに寄主をして特異なる麥凋と云ふ病徴を現はしむるのである。病原菌が根冠又は直接幼組織に侵入する際には最初その細胞間隙に潛入するのを常とするが既に幼組織内に侵入した菌絲は幼組織の細胞間を侵すのみならず容易に細胞膜を破壞して進むものである。初生永久組織に對しては, (A) 未だ根毛が充分に生え揃はない時分に於ては菌絲は根表皮細胞の中間膜を破つて内部に侵人し, 先づ細胞間隙に沿つて蔓延し, かくて根表皮に近き皮部組織より次第に内部へと組織を破壞しつゝ進むのである。然しながらかゝる侵害をなしたる病菌も, 皮部の内方の内皮層の早期栓質化の爲に阻止せられて心柱内へ侵入することは不可能である。(B) 根毛の充分に生え揃つた時よりその末期に至る時期に於ては病原菌は依然常に根表皮細胞の中間膜を侵して内部へ侵入せんとし, 直接根毛に侵入したものを發見しない。又根表皮の中間膜を破つて皮部を侵すに至つたものも, 前同樣内皮の栓質化の爲に心柱内へは侵入が出來ない, (C) 根毛の脱落したる後の組織に於ては, 根表皮の直下に發達して來た外皮の栓質化の爲に菌は全く阻止せられて皮部をも侵すことが出來ない。更に側根の發生によつて生じた皮部より根表皮に至る破壞溝に對して本菌が侵害することがあつても, 主根より側根に亘れる内皮の廣汎なる栓質化の爲に, それらの心柱内に侵入することは不可能である。即ち本菌は幼組織に對して侵入し得た場合にのみ, その侵入の目的を達して根の心柱内にその位置を占めることが出來るのであつて, 既に初生永久組織へと分化したる後に於ては, その寄主の皮部侵害は組織の局部的崩壞を結果するのみであつて麥凋病とは直接的交渉のないものである。本菌が寄主組織に侵入するのは極めて短時間であつて, 23 度の元に於ては 16 時間前後にして既に根冠部を通過して幼組織内に侵人し了つてゐるのである。著者は本菌が寄主の幼組織に侵入することによつて初めてその侵入の效果を塞げるものであることを指摘し, この侵入法を幼組織侵入とした...|$|R

40|$|Damping-off {{disease in}} pine seedling, caused by fungi and oomycetes (Fusarium, Alternaria, Botrytis, Phytophthora) and other species, {{is one of}} the most {{dangerous}} diseases in conifer nurseries and greenhouses worldwide. Alternaria alternata is a necrotrophic pathogen, which causes early blight in higher plants and results in massive economic losses in agro-industry as well as in forestry. Pine seedlings that lack strong lignificated and <b>suberized</b> <b>cell</b> walls at early stages of their growth are vulnerable to damping-off disease. So, triggering the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds, such as phytoalexins, anticipins and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, is the main defense strategy to confine pathogens at early stages of pine ontogenesis. Defensins and lipid transfer proteins are members of two PR-protein families (PR- 12 and PR- 14 respectively) and possess antimicrobial activities in vitro through contact toxicity, and the involvement in defense signalling. In this work, we describe the changes in the expression levels of four defensin genes and lipid transfer protein in Scots pine seedlings infected with A. alternata. The expression levels of PsDef 1 and PsDef 2 increased at 48 h. p. i. (hours post inoculation). The levels of PsDef 4 transcripts have increased after 6 and 24 hours. Notably, at 48 h. p. i., the level of PsDef 4 transcripts was decreased by 1. 2 times compared to control. The level of PsDef 3 transcripts was reduced at all three time points. On the other hand, the level of PsLTP 1 transcripts increased at 6 h and 48 h. p. i.; while at 24 h. p. i., it decreased by 20 % when compared to the control sample. Our results suggest that defensins and lipid transfer protein are involved in the defense response of young Scots pine to necrotrophic pathogen. Thus, those genes can be used as the molecular markers in forestry selection and development of the ecologically friendly remedies for coniferous seedlings cultivation in greenhouses and nurseries...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to study the heavy metal {{tolerance}} mechanism in Typha latifolia which was collected separately from a contaminated Pb/Zn mine site and a clean fresh water pond in Shaoguan County, Guangdong Province, China. Results of water and soil analyses indicated that the contaminated site was much more polluted with heavy metals. The uptake and accumulation of heavy metals was very high for Typha derived from the contaminated site {{and especially in the}} root portion (up to 500 μg/g of Zn and 1000 μg/g of Pb). Results from SEM-EDX analysis revealed that some heavy metals containing amorphous granules were identified in the outer cortical cells of the mature Typha root from the contaminated site. This formation may serve to minimize the transport of heavy metals to the upper sensitive parts of the plants. In TEM-EDX studies, results showed that the heavy metals (Zn, Pb & Fe) were localized in the apoplast of cortical cells of Typha adventitious root and particularly in the intercellular spaces. In addition, the formation of the mineral deposits inside the cortical cells as revealed by X-ray elemental mapping may also play a role in metal detoxification in Typha plants grown in mine site. In the LM study, however, it was observed that the endodermis of Typha adventitious root derived from mine site had a thicker <b>suberized</b> <b>cell</b> wall than the one derived from the clean site, suggesting that the thickened wall may act as a barrier to the radial transport of heavy metals into the stele. Moreover, results of Typha root tissue fractionation showed a large proportion (> 98 %) of the heavy metals (Zn, Fe and Pb) was accumulated in the cell wall fraction, further supporting the idea that the Typha root cell wall has a high intrinsic metal ions binding capacity and can act as an important storage site for heavy metals. Meanwhile, studies by gel filtration, paper chromatography and infrared spectroscopy indicated the presence of a glucose-Zn binding complex isolated from the cytoplasmic fraction of Typha root tissue. However, their role in relation to metal tolerance in Typha plants has not yet confirmed...|$|E
