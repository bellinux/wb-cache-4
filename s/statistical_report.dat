25|$|Pro-Jewish {{reforms were}} often not {{executed}} by local magistrates in the fragmented sultanate, however, {{and even if}} they were they reignited animosity toward the Jewish population. Thus, for example, the sultan Sulaiman (1795–1822) decreed that the Jews of Fez might wear shoes; but so many Jews were killed in the streets of that city {{as a result of the}} edict that they themselves asked the sultan to repeal it. According to a <b>statistical</b> <b>report</b> of the AIU, for the years 1864–80 no less than 307 Jews were murdered in the city and district of Morocco, which crimes, although brought to the attention of the magistracy upon every occasion, remained unpunished.|$|E
25|$|In the 1919 Cost Accounting Nicholson and Rohrbach again {{deal with}} the admittedly {{controversial}} {{question as to whether}} it is proper to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets should be so charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not at the mere calculation thereof for use in <b>statistical</b> <b>report</b> form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.140) an accounting procedure supposed to meet this objection.|$|E
