For the type of change is primarily considered to substitute non-flammable structural system for flammable structural system and one floor extension. These changes are the result of increases levels of fire safety and extension of the fire danger zone. The conclusion of this work is a preview of the differences in fire <b>safety</b> <b>solution</b> of the building for accommodation and the office building...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of fire risk in a production process and is based on the analysis of fire protection of the premises and the <b>safety</b> <b>solution</b> of the fire <b>safety</b> <b>solution</b> of the building and on assessment of a simulated fire alarm. In the theoretical part the author describes the difference between an extraordinary situation and a crisis situation, defines an emergency plan, and specifies a crisis situation of fire occurrence and the associated duties of the fire protection section in accordance with the legal framework of the Czech Republic. The practical part of the thesis evaluates the fire <b>safety</b> <b>solution</b> of the production plant, which forms the basis for defining the fire documentation in the risks of fire occurrence and the subsequent procedure to be taken in the event of actual fire occurrence. This part also describes simulation of a crisis situation involving a fire (on whose basis the efficiency of the aforesaid documentation will be verified), evaluates the current procedure to be taken in the event of fire occurrence, and proposes appropriate measures. The objective of the bachelor thesis was to evaluate the fire <b>safety</b> <b>solution</b> of the building under review, to describe any possible risks associated with fire occurrence and the subsequent determination of the procedure to be taken in the event of fire. The thesis is concluded with evaluation of the course of a simulated fire, and description of the defects revealed in the current fire regulations applying to the building, including their causes, together with the technical defects on whose basis supplementation of the fire <b>safety</b> <b>solution</b> of the building will be propose...|$|E
