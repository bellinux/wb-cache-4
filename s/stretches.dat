40|$|<b>Stretching</b> is a {{stimulation}} of muscle growth. <b>Stretching</b> for hours or days {{has an effect}} on muscle hypertrophy. However, differences of continuous <b>stretching</b> and repetitive <b>stretching</b> to affect muscle growth are not well known. To clarify the difference of continuous and repetitive <b>stretching</b> within a short duration, we investigated the gene expression of muscle-related genes on <b>stretched</b> skeletal muscles. We used 8 -week-old male Wistar rats () for this study. Animals medial gastrocnemius muscle was <b>stretched</b> continuously or repetitively for 15 [*]min daily and 4 times/week under anesthesia. After <b>stretching,</b> muscles were removed and total RNA was extracted. Then, reverse transcriptional quantitative real-time PCR was done to evaluate the mRNA expression of MyoD, myogenin, and embryonic myosin heavy chain (MyHC). Muscles, either <b>stretched</b> continuously or repetitively, increased mRNA expression of MyoD, myogenin, and embryonic MyHC more than unstretched muscles. Notably, repetitive <b>stretching</b> resulted in more substantial effects on embryonic MyHC gene expression than continuous <b>stretching.</b> In conclusion, passive <b>stretching</b> for a short duration within a week is effective in increasing myogenic factor expression, and repetitive <b>stretching</b> had more effects than continuous <b>stretching</b> for skeletal muscle on muscle growth. These findings are applicable in clinical muscle-strengthening therapy...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to establish whether the deleterious effects of passive <b>stretching</b> seen in laboratory settings would be manifest in a performance setting. Sixteen members (11 males, 5 females) of a Division I NCAA track athletics team performed electronically timed 20 m sprints with and without prior <b>stretching</b> of the legs. The experiment was done as part of each athlete’s Monday work-out programme. Four different <b>stretch</b> protocols were used, with each protocol completed on a different day.

The four <b>stretching</b> protocols were no-stretch of either leg (NS), both legs <b>stretched</b> (BS), forward leg in the starting position <b>stretched</b> (FS) and rear leg in the starting position <b>stretched</b> (RS). Three <b>stretching</b> exercises (hamstring <b>stretch,</b> quadriceps <b>stretch,</b> calf <b>stretch)</b> were used for the BS, FS and RS protocols. Each <b>stretching</b> exercise was performed four times, and each time the <b>stretch</b> was maintained for 30 s.

The athletes were randomly allocated into two groups: static <b>stretching</b> or dynamic <b>stretching.</b> All of them underwent an initial evaluation and were submitted to the first intervention. They were evaluated once again and at the end of 12 training sessions. The results analyzed using ANOVA showed that there was a significant decrease in agility time after dynamic <b>stretching</b> against no <b>stretching</b> in the acute phase; but, there were no significant differences between dynamic <b>stretching</b> and no <b>stretching</b> in the chronic phase. In addition, there was no a significant difference between no <b>stretching</b> and static <b>stretching</b> in the acute phase; while, There was a significant decrease in agility time after no <b>stretching</b> against static <b>stretching</b> in the chronic phase. It was concluded that acute dynamic <b>stretching</b> as part of a warm-up may decrease agility time performance, whereas static <b>stretching</b> seems to increase agility time performance.

40|$|Background: A warm-up is {{important}} part of preparation for sprinting. There is popularity of doing <b>stretching</b> as part of warm up before athletic activity.
