25|$|Methylcellulose (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E

If the different blocks of the copolymer have different properties, they can form micelles with one type of block on the inside and one type on the outside. For example, in water the hydrophobic blocks of a copolymer could end up on the inside of a micelle, with hydrophilic blocks on the outside. Additionally, a change in pH could cause micelles to swap their inner and outer molecules depending on the properties of the polymers involved.Responses other than simply swelling and deswelling with a change in pH are possible as well. Researchers have created polymers that undergo a <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> (from a solution to a gel) with a change in pH, but which also change from being a stiff gel to a soft gel for certain pH values.|$|E

Firstly, the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> line and the cloud point line are determined independently {{as a function of the}} concentration of agarose as well as the concentration of methanol in the mixed solvent by the quasi-equilibrium cooling of the solutions. Then the spinodal line is determined by quenching the solutions below the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> line. We find that the spinodal line appears below the cloud point line and both lines are entirely buried below the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> line in the aqueous agarose system. The concentration fluctuations are, therefore, frozen into the polymer network of agarose gel that promotes the opacity of the resultant gel. The structure of agarose gel is observed by the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging technique that reveals that the density fluctuations are grown up to micrometer scale in space. The phase separation boundary is found to shift to the higher temperature region than the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> line when the concentration of methanol in the mixed solvent is increased. The results indicate that the position of the phase separation boundary in relative to the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> line varies with the quality of solvent.

For extensive characterization of the water-polymer interaction and microstructure change during <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition,</b> we propose a rapid and nondestructive method based on monitoring water mobility through low field NMR (LF-NMR), and this was applied to chitosan/beta-glycerophosphate (CS/GP) hydrogels. The spin-spin relaxation time (T- 2) that depicted water mobility was measured by LF-NMR within 90 s. The T- 2 component corresponding to water protons trapped in polymer networks (T- 21) was very sensitive to <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition.</b> A remarkable decrease of T- 21 value indicated obvious variations of water mobility when CS/GP was heated, and a turning point was observed on the T- 21 -time curve. The gel point associated with this turning point could be easily determined by fitting the T- 21 -time curves to a bilinear regression model, and the results showed good accuracy and repeatability owing to the nondestructive nature of LF-NMR. Variations in water components and microstructure of CS/GP caused by water migration after solidification were also analyzed by monitoring dynamic changes of T- 2.

40|$|In a coagulating system, a <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> {{occurs when}} a single giant {{particle}} (a gel) arises under certain conditions and begins to consume the mass of smaller but higher populated fraction (the sol). This single giant particle (also known as a runaway particle) is detached from the continuous spectrum. Since the kinetic collection equation (KCE) only models {{the evolution of the}} continuous size of the spectrum, as the largest particle continue to grow by accretion of smaller ones, the liquid water content predicted by the KCE will decrease. In this paper, the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> is proposed as the mechanism that forms the large droplets that are needed to trigger warm rain development in cumulus clouds. By using a collection kernel enhanced by turbulence and a stochastic simulation method, the formation of a runaway droplet is modeled through the turbulent collection process. The model results show that the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> (also called gelation) leads to the formation of a droplet with mass comparable to the mass of the initial system. The time when the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> occurs is estimated with a Monte Carlo method when the parameter &rho; (the ratio of the standard deviation for the largest droplet mass over all the realizations to the averaged value) reaches its maximum value. Moreover, we show that without turbulence, the <b>sol-gel</b> <b>transition</b> will not occur. In the context of theoretical cloud microphysics, gelation can be interpreted as the formation of the "lucky droplet" that grows at a much faster rate {{than the rest of the}} droplet population and subsequently becomes the embryo for raindrops...|$|E

Poloxamer 407 gels are pseudoplastic and viscoelastic materials, which have an elastic modulus (G'), characteristic of the solid, and a viscous modulus (G''), characteristic of the liquid material.

Polymer gelation can occur through polymer-ionic molecule complexation in our model. For polymer-polymer cross-links through the ionic molecules, three types of solutions for nBI are obtained, depending on the equilibrium constant of single-ion binding.
