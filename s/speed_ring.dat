40|$|The {{growth of}} {{electromagnetic}} ion cyclotron waves (EMIC) {{due to a}} ring distribution of Hydrogen ions is examined. Though these distributions are more commonly implicated in the generation of equatorial noise, their potential for exciting EMIC waves is considered here. It is shown that since the ring distribution is non-monotonic in perpendicular velocity, the amplification achieved by this instability is greater than bi-Maxwellian distributions for typical anisotropies, because the waves can maintain resonance over a much longer part of its trajectory. For <b>ring</b> <b>speeds</b> V_R close to the Alfven speed V_A, the growth rate is maximum at parallel propagation but is much larger at oblique angles compared with a bi-Maxwellian, and can have a second peak approximately at kperp c/omegaPH V_R/V_A ~ 2. 3 for <b>ring</b> <b>speeds</b> about the parallel thermal speed. Strong wave gain is achieved for moderate <b>ring</b> <b>speeds</b> V_R~V_A. The analysis suggests that EMIC wave activity should be closely associated with equatorial noise...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Since the {{application}} of pneumatic planters for seeds with different physical properties is growing, {{it is essential to}} evaluation the performance of these machines to improve the operating parameters under different pressures and forward speeds. To evaluate the performance of precision vacuum seeders numerous procedures of laboratory and field have been developed and their feed mechanism evaluation is of great importance. The use of instrumentation is essential in laboratory procedures. Many systems have been designed, using instrumentation, to be able to monitor seed falling trajectory and as a result, in those systems the precise place of falling seed in the seed bed could be determined. In this study, the uniformity of seed spacing of a seed drill was determined using of high speed camera with a frame rate of 480 frames s- 1. So that, the uniformity of planting was statistically significant {{under the influence of the}} speed of seed metering rollers (Karayel et al., 2006). Singh et al. (2005) studied the effects of disk rotation speed, vacuum pressure and shape of seed entrance hole on planting spacing uniformity using uniformity indices under laboratory and field conditions. They reported miss index values were reduced as the pressure was increased but they were increased with increasing of the speed. The multiple indices on the other hand were low at higher speed but they were increased as the pressure was increased. Ground speed was affected by changes in engine speed and gear selection, both of which effect on amount of fan rotation speed for different pressures. The aim of this study was to identify and determine the effects of forward speed and optimum vacuum pressure amount of the pneumatic seeder. Materials and Methods: The pneumatic planter (Unissem) was mounted on a tractor (MF 399) and passed over the soil bin. Thus, the acquired data would be more reliable and practical. To do so, the tractor was equipped with electronic devices for online measurement of various parameters, including: the actual forward speed, wheel sleep percent, drawbar pull, motor RPM, and fuel consumption. Wheel drive of the seed metering mechanism was equipped with Rotary Encoder model S 48 - 8 - 0360 ZT (TK 1) to determine the seed disk rotation. For more precise vacuum pressure monitoring, a Vacuum Transmitter model BT 10 - 210 was used to measure relative pressure from 0 mbar to - 1000 mbar. Investigation of seed falling trajectories was conducted using the AVI video acquisition system consisted of CCD (charge-coupled device) camera (Fuji F 660 EXR) capable of capturing images with a constant speed of 320 frames per second and a spatial resolution of 320 × 240 pixels. All data were transmitted to a data logger and displayed online on the PC's screen. For optimization of the factors affecting the performance of the pneumatic planter, the experiments were conducted with: two ranges of forward speeds [3 to 4 km h- 1, and 6 to 8 km h- 1; three levels of vacuum pressure [- 2. 5 kPa, - 3. 5 kPa and - 4. 5 kPa]; and two types of seed [cucumber and watermelon], keeping a three-factor factorial experimental design. The tests were replicated three times. The uniformity of seed spacing was measured with indicators described by kachman and smith (1995) which are defined as: I_miss=N_ 1 /N× 100 										(1) I_mul=N_ 2 /N× 100 										 (2) I_qf= 100 -(I_mul+I_miss) 									(3) P=s_d/x_ref 											 (4) Which for planting distance of 45 cm, N 1 is number of spacing > 1. 5 Xref; N 2 is number of spacing ≤ 0. 5 Xref and N is total number of measured spacings, Sd is standard deviation of the spacing more than half but not more than 1. 5 times, the set spacings Xref, Imiss is the miss index, Imul is the multiple index, quality of feed index Iq is the percentage of spacings that are more than half but not more than 1. 5 times, the set planting distance and P is error index. Results and Discussion: According to the studies on both watermelon and cucumber, the ‘quality of feed index’ value in forward <b>speed</b> <b>rang</b> of 6 to 8 km h- 1 was less than one in forward <b>speed</b> <b>rang</b> of 3 to 4 km h- 1. Also, the ‘error index’ value in forward <b>speed</b> <b>rang</b> 3 to 4 km h- 1 was little rather than forward <b>speed</b> <b>rang</b> of 6 to 8 km h- 1, but it was desirable. For watermelon and cucumber seeds, the ‘quality of feed index’ were the maximum with mean of 97...|$|R

First, the lens' maximum aperture (smallest f-stop number) must set against the film speed scale on the FT's shutter <b>speed</b> <b>ring.</b> Then, the [...] "meter coupling pin" [...] on the ring surrounding the FT's lens mount flange must pushed {{all the way to the}} right and the lens' aperture ring must be preset to f/5.6 to line up the [...] "meter coupling shoe" [...] with the pin for mounting. Note that the lens maximum aperture had to be reset every time the lens was changed. This was very inconvenient compared to some other SLRs of the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{the effects}} of coupled {{hydromechanical}} (consolidation) processes associated with shield tunneling excavation in soft clays are investigated with {{particular attention to the}} prediction of ground movements at the ground surface. A series of 2 d FE analyses have been carried out in parametric form in order to investigate {{the effects of}} tunnel excavation velocity relative to the soil consolidation rate and the hydraulic boundary conditions at the tunnel boundary. The shield advancement process has been simulated with a simplified procedure incorporating both volume loss and ovalization of the tunnel section. In order to investigate the relative importance of soil consolidation during the excavation process, different characteristic times for the tunnel face advancement and for the consolidation process around the tunnel have been considered, for the two limiting conditions of fully permeable liner and impervious liner. The potential damage induced by the tunnel excavation on existing structures, based on computed ground surface distortions and horizontal deformations, has been found to vary significantly with time during the consolidation process.

Today, the development of power semiconductors {{has resulted in the}} utilization of inverter circuits for {{variable speed}} control of induction motor. This project is to develop the application of inverter which can control the speed of induction motor by using PI controller. Inverters are circuit that convert DC to AC. The function of inverter is to create an AC voltage by using a DC voltage source, the voltage source that used DC voltage commonly batteries. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique is considered as one solution for harmonic reduction and increasing the motor efficiency. Previous study regarding the performance on the traditional Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) inverter is carried out and {{it was found that the}} performance is not ideal.

North Carolina State University and the U. S.

40|$|Abstract: Physical {{models and}} fast {{computational}} programs aim {{to improve the}} design and performance of turbocharger (TC) rotordynamics. Most commercial automotive TCs incorporate floating ring bearings (FRBs) owing to their low cost and reduced power losses. However, persistent subsynchronous motions afflict this type of rotor/bearing system, albeit reaching limit cycles that enable their continuous operation. FRBs comprise two fluid films in series and are prone to show one or two subsynchronous instabilities over extended speed ranges of operation. A flow model for prediction of FRB forced response is detailed here. The model incorporates a lumped-parameter thermal energy balance for estimation of the lubricant viscosity and thermal growth of the rotor, bearing and floating ring. The FRB model, fully integrated into a non-linear rotordynamics computational program, predicts the floating <b>ring</b> <b>speed,</b> journal and <b>ring</b> eccentricities, power loss and the rotordynamic force coefficients of {{the inner and outer}} films {{as a function of the}} load applied at a given rotor speed. Knowledge of the actual load conditions, static and dynamic, and the changes in operating clearance and effective lubricant viscosity are most important for accurate estimation of a TC dynamic forced response. Predictions for the exit lubricant temperature, power losses and floating <b>ring</b> <b>speeds</b> agree well with measurements obtained in an automotive turbocharger test rig. The rotordynamic stability characteristics of the test TC are also highlighted...|$|R
