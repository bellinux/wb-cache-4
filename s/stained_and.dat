5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous {{cell carcinoma}}, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.|$|E
5|$|There is {{absolutely}} no doubt that before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau, still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.|$|E

50|$|Methyl blue is a {{chemical}} compound with the molecular formula C37H27N3Na2O9S3. It {{is used as}} a <b>stain</b> in histology, <b>and</b> <b>stains</b> collagen blue in tissue sections. It can be used in some differential staining techniques such as Mallorys connective tissue <b>stain</b> <b>and</b> Gömöri trichrome <b>stain,</b> <b>and</b> can be used to mediate electron transfer in microbial fuel cells. Fungal cell walls are also stained by methyl blue.|$|R

The area of fibrosis after Masson’s <b>staining</b> <b>and</b> Sirius Red <b>staining,</b> <b>and</b> α-SMA+ area {{were analyzed using}} the WinROOF image processing software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). At least 10 digitized images of the renal cortex were analyzed for each sample, and the percentage area of positive staining per field was evaluated. Images were taken under a microscope (BX 51, Olympus) with a CCD camera (DP 70, Olympus).|$|R
25|$|Diagnosis {{depends on}} finding {{characteristic}} worm eggs on microscopic {{examination of the}} stools, although this is not possible in early infection. Early signs of infection in most dogs include limbular limping and anal itching. The eggs are oval or elliptical, measuring 60µm by 40µm, colorless, not bile <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> with a thin transparent hyaline shell membrane. When released by the worm in the intestine, the egg contains an unsegmented ovum. During its passage down the intestine, the ovum develops and thus the eggs passed in feces have a segmented ovum, usually with 4 to 8 blastomeres.|$|E
25|$|Located on the Piazza del Popolo, {{the main}} church (or Chiesa Madre) of Santa Maria della Misericordia (Our Lady of Mercy) was {{completed}} in 1603 and contains great works of religious art, statuary, and stucco. The church has the second tallest bell tower in the area after the SS. Annunziata in Sulmona and is visible for miles. The facade {{of the church is}} designed in a sedate style typical of late-16th-century Architecture known as Mannerism. This is evidenced by a Classical triangular pediment over {{the central part of the}} facade and the side doors. The portal over the main door resembles the Renaissance style of the portals of Churches and Palaces in Rome from the mid-16th century. The original 17th-century main door, which was beautifully carved in wood by a local artisan, has been moved indoors for conservation and replaced by plain wooden doors. There is a restoration project underway to clean the facade of the church which has become <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> darkened with time.|$|E
25|$|A modern beginner's bassoon is {{generally}} made of maple, with medium-hardness types such as sycamore maple and sugar maple preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of {{materials such as}} polypropylene and ebonite, primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons {{were made in the}} past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected {{at the bottom of the}} instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> varnished. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or ivory. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.|$|E

500|$|The East Building {{was honored}} on 30 May 1978, {{two days before}} its public unveiling, with a black-tie party {{attended}} by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. Ada Louise Huxtable wrote in The New York Times that Pei's building was [...] "a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture". The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> worn {{from the hands of}} visitors.|$|E
500|$|The Office of the President {{is located}} in McMillan Hall, which is the oldest {{building}} on campus, dating to 1793. Prior to 1912, the Office of the President was located in Old Main, taking the two rooms {{on either side of}} that building's main entrance.

500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in 1992 in two limited editions—Deluxe and Small—by Kevin Begos Jr. Publishing, New York City. The deluxe edition came in a 16 by 21½-inch (41cm × 55cm) metal mesh case sheathed in Kevlar (a polymer used to make bulletproof vests) and designed {{to look like a}} buried relic. Inside is a book of 93 ragged and charred pages sewn by hand and bound in <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> singed linen by Karl Foulkes; the book gives the impression of having survived a fire; it was described by Peter Schwenger as [...] "a black box recovered from some unspecified disaster." [...] The edition includes pages of DNA sequences set in double columns of 42 lines each like the Gutenberg Bible, and copperplate aquatint etchings by Ashbaugh editioned by Peter Pettingill on Fabriano Tiepolo paper. The monochromatic etchings depict stylised chromosomes, a hallmark of Ashbaugh's work, accompanied by imagery of a pistol, camera or in some instances simple line drawings—all allusions to Gibson's contribution.|$|E

500|$|After Vrana had {{returned}} to the castle, a pasha was chosen to have a conference with Vrana bringing him many rich presents. The pasha tried to convince the count that Murad would be a more suitable master than Skanderbeg was, and that the siege was almost over, but Vrana refused to surrender. As a result, a fresh Ottoman assault began. Meanwhile, Murad sent an envoy trying to convince Skanderbeg to capitulate by offering 10,000 crowns annually. Skanderbeg also refused replying: [...] "Nay if Murad did divide with me and make me co-partner with all his empire, I would never suffer the name of Albania to be <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> blemished with this blot of disgrace and infamy." [...] The assault continued, and the Albanian positions seemed desperate. On October 14, Skanderbeg offered Krujë to the Venetians, threatening to capitulate the fortress to the Turks if they did not accept it. After Murad lifted the siege on October 26, because of the arriving winter, the Venetians replied to Skanderbeg's offer rejecting it and offered to help Skanderbeg to harmonize his relationship with Ottomans.|$|E
500|$|Despite his unusual diet, Tarrare was {{slim and}} of average height. At {{the age of}} 17, he weighed only [...] (...) [...] He was {{described}} as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth, in which his teeth were heavily <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> on which the lips were almost invisible. When he had not eaten, his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist. When full, his abdomen would distend [...] "like a huge balloon". The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth. His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily, constantly suffering from foul body odour; he was described as stinking [...] "to {{such a degree that}} he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces". This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten; his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot, a visible vapour would rise from his body, and he would become lethargic, during which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions. He suffered from chronic diarrhoea, which was said to be [...] "fetid beyond all conception". Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight. Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him, other than an apparently apathetic temperament with [...] "a complete lack of force and ideas".|$|E
500|$|Aspects of Nelson's {{life and}} career were controversial, both during his {{lifetime}} and after his death. His affair with Emma Hamilton was widely remarked upon and disapproved of, {{to the extent that}} Emma was denied permission to attend Nelson's funeral and was subsequently ignored by the government, which awarded money and titles to Nelson's legitimate family. Nelson's actions during the reoccupation of Naples have also been the subject of debate: his approval of the wave of reprisals against the Jacobins who had surrendered under the terms agreed by Cardinal Ruffo, and his personal intervention in securing the execution of Caracciolo, are considered by some biographers, such as Robert Southey, to have been a shameful breach of honour. Prominent contemporary politician Charles James Fox was among those who attacked Nelson for his actions at Naples, declaring in the House of Commons I wish that the atrocities of which we hear so much and which I abhor as much as any man, were indeed unexampled. I fear that they do not belong exclusively to the French– Naples for instance has been what is called [...] "delivered", and yet, if I am rightly informed, it has been <b>stained</b> <b>and</b> polluted by murders so ferocious, and by cruelties of every kind so abhorrent, that the heart shudders at the recital... demanded that a British officer should be brought forward, and to him they capitulated. They made terms with him under the sanction of the British name. Before they sailed their property was confiscated, numbers were thrown into dungeons, and some of them, I understand, notwithstanding the British guarantee, were actually executed. Other pro-republican writers produced books and pamphlets decrying the events in Naples as atrocities. Later assessments, including one by Andrew Lambert, have stressed that the armistice had not been authorised by the King of Naples, and that the retribution meted out by the Neapolitans was not unusual for the time. Lambert also suggests that Nelson in fact acted {{to put an end to}} the bloodshed, using his ships and men to restore order in the city.|$|E
