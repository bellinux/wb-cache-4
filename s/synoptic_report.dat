40|$|Abstract Background <b>Synoptic</b> <b>reporting,</b> {{either as}} part of the {{pathology}} report or replacing some free text component incorporates standardized data elements in the form of checklists for pathology reporting. This ensures the pathologists make note of these findings in their reports, thereby improving the quality and uniformity of information in the pathology reports. Methods The purpose of this project is to develop the entire set of elements in the synoptic templates or "worksheets" for hematologic and lymphoid neoplasms using the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Checklists. The CAP checklists' content was supplemented with the most updated classification scheme (WHO classification), specimen details, staging as well as information on various ancillary techniques such as cytochemical studies, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics including Fluorescent In-situ Hybridization (FISH) studies and genotyping. We have used a digital <b>synoptic</b> <b>reporting</b> system {{as part of}} an existing laboratory information system (LIS), CoPathPlus, from Cerner DHT, Inc. The synoptic elements are presented as discrete data points, so that a data element such as tumor type is assigned from the synoptic value dictionary under the value of tumor type, allowing the user to search for just those cases that have that value point populated. Results These synoptic worksheets are implemented for use in our LIS. The data is stored as discrete data elements appear as an accession summary within the final pathology report. In addition, the synoptic data can be exported to research databases for linking pathological details on banked tissues. Conclusion <b>Synoptic</b> <b>reporting</b> provides a structured method for entering the diagnostic as well as prognostic information for a particular pathology specimen or sample, thereby reducing transcription services and reducing specimen turnaround time. Furthermore, it provides accurate and consistent diagnostic information dictated by pathologists as a basis for appropriate therapeutic modalities. Using <b>synoptic</b> <b>reports,</b> consistent data elements with minimized typographical and transcription errors can be generated and placed in the LIS relational database, enabling quicker access to desired information and improved communication for appropriate cancer management. The templates will also eventually serve as a conduit for capturing and storing data in the virtual biorepository for translational research. Such uniformity of data lends itself to subsequent ease of data viewing and extraction, as demonstrated by rapid production of standardized, high-quality data from the hemopoietic and lymphoid neoplasm specimens. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is an important imaging modality for pre-operative staging and surgical planning of rectal cancer, to date {{there has been little}} investigation on the completeness and overall quality of MRI reports. This is important because optimal patient care depends {{on the quality of the}} MRI report and clear communication of these reports to treating physicians. Previous work has shown that the use of <b>synoptic</b> pathology <b>reports</b> improves the quality of pathology reports and communication between physicians. Methods The aims of this project are to develop a <b>synoptic</b> MRI <b>report</b> for rectal cancer and determine the enablers and barriers toward the implementation of a <b>synoptic</b> MRI <b>report</b> for rectal cancer in the clinical setting. A three-step Delphi process with an expert panel will extract the key criteria for the MRI report to guide pre-operative chemoradiation and surgical planning following a review of the literature, and a synoptic template will be developed. Furthermore, standardized qualitative research methods will be used to conduct interviews with radiologists to determine the enablers and barriers to the implementation and sustainability of the <b>synoptic</b> MRI <b>report</b> in the clinic setting. Conclusion <b>Synoptic</b> MRI <b>reports</b> for rectal cancer are currently not used in North America and may improve the overall quality of MRI report and communication between physicians. This may, in turn, lead to improved patient care and outcomes for rectal cancer patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Recommendations for the {{pathology}} reporting {{of breast cancer}} were released in Australia to ensure detailed communication of important prognostic features and good patient management. An audit of the reporting of invasive breast cancer in Queensland was conducted to determine how well these guidelines were utilised in 2004. Methods: A random sample of reports was audited for inclusion of recommended criteria. The proportion of reports meeting each of the criteria was determined and compared across whether the report was in a <b>synoptic</b> <b>report</b> template or in a free text format. Comparison was made with published data from prior {{to the release of}} the recommendations. Results: Of the 419 reports in the sample, at least 90 % of reports included lesion size, histological type, histological grade, lymph node involvement, margins of excision, lymphovascular invasion, and changes in adjacent breast tissue individually, and 74 % included all seven of these essential criteria. Synoptic reports accounted for 76 % of the sample and {{were significantly more likely to}} have documented grade (p < 0. 001), quadrant (p = 0. 003), calcification (p < 0. 001), lymphovascular invasion (p < 0. 001), changes in non-neoplastic breast (p < 0. 001) and ductal carcinoma in situ criteria (p < 0. 001) compared with free text report format. The most notable improvements since the implementation of the recommendations were in documentation of adjacent breast tissue (92 % versus 49 %) and lymphovascular invasion (97 % versus 54 %). Conclusion: Breast cancer reporting in Queensland has improved since the implementation of the recommendations, however further improvements would likely be seen if there is more widespread utilisation of a <b>synoptic</b> <b>report</b> format.

40|$|Context: The College of American Pathologists (CAP) {{requires}} synoptic {{reporting of}} all tumor excisions. Objective: To compare {{the performance of}} different methods of generating synoptic reports. Methods: Completeness, amendment rates, rate of timely ordering of ancillary studies (KRAS in T 4 /N 1 colon carcinoma), and structured data file extraction were compared for four different <b>synoptic</b> <b>report</b> generating methods. Results: Use of the printed tumor protocols directly from the CAP website had the lowest completeness (84 %) and highest amendment (1. 8 %) rates. Reformatting these protocols was associated with higher completeness (94 %, P < 0. 001) and reduced amendment (1 %, P = 0. 20) rates. Extraction into a structured data file was successful 93 % of the time. Word-based macros improved completeness (98 % vs. 94 %, P < 0. 001) but not amendment rates (1. 5 %). KRAS was ordered before sign out 89 % of the time. In contrast, a web-based product with a reminder flag when items were missing, an embedded flag for data extraction, and a reminder to order KRAS when appropriate resulted in improved completeness (100 %, P = 0. 005), amendment rates (0. 3 %, P = 0. 03), KRAS ordering before sign out (100 %, P = 0. 23), and structured data extraction (100 %, P < 0. 001) without reducing the speed (P = 0. 34) or accuracy (P = 1. 00) of data extraction by the reader. Conclusion: Completeness, amendment rates, ancillary test ordering rates, and data extraction rates vary significantly with the method used to construct the <b>synoptic</b> <b>report.</b> A web-based method compares favorably with all other methods examined and does not reduce reader usability...|$|E

40|$|Background: Different {{methods have}} been {{described}} for data extraction from pathology reports {{with varying degrees of}} success. Here a technique for directly extracting data from relational database is described. Methods: Our department uses synoptic reports modified from College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Protocol Templates to report most of our cancer diagnoses. Choosing the melanoma of skin <b>synoptic</b> <b>report</b> as an example, R scripting language extended with RODBC package was used to query the pathology information system database. Reports containing melanoma of skin <b>synoptic</b> <b>report</b> in the past 4 and a half years were retrieved and individual data elements were extracted. Using the retrieved list of the cases, the database was queried a second time to retrieve/extract the lymph node staging information in the subsequent reports from the same patients. Results: 426 synoptic reports corresponding to unique lesions of melanoma of skin were retrieved, and data elements of interest were extracted into an R data frame. The distribution of Breslow depth of melanomas grouped by year is used as an example of intra-report data extraction and analysis. When the new pN staging information was present in the subsequent reports, 82 % (77 / 94) was precisely retrieved (pN 0, pN 1, pN 2 and pN 3). Additional 15 % (14 / 94) was retrieved with certain ambiguity (positive or knowing there was an update). The specificity was 100 % for both. The relationship between Breslow depth and lymph node status was graphed as an example of lesion-specific multi-report data extraction and analysis. Conclusions: R extended with RODBC package is a simple and versatile approach well-suited for the above tasks. The success or failure of the retrieval and extraction depended largely on whether the reports were formatted and whether the contents of the elements were consistently phrased. This approach can be easily modified and adopted for other pathology information systems that use relational database for data management...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPublished climatologies of marine-fog frequencies are in disagreement for common areas, although {{the nature and}} magnitude of errors are difficult to assess since actual frequencies for specific locations may be derived only from observations at Ocean Stations. The usual methods of computing fog frequencies, on a seasonal or monthly basis, are percent-of-reports-with-fog and number-of-fog-days. This study presents a method of synthesizing the elements of surface-ship synoptic reports into a computerized scheme {{for the purpose of}} deriving frequencies of marine fog occurrence. The program, based on a liberal interpretation of reporting guidelines in the Synoptic Code Manual, utilizes 16 combinations of present and past weather, and visibility, to identify fog in the reports.

40|$|Pathology {{reporting}} is evolving {{from a traditional}} narrative report to a more structured <b>synoptic</b> <b>report.</b> Narrative reporting can cause misinterpretation {{due to lack of}} information and structure. In this systematic review, we evaluate the impact of synoptic reporting on completeness of pathology reports and quality of pathology evaluation for solid tumours. Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases were systematically searched to identify studies describing the effect of synoptic reporting implementation on completeness of reporting and quality of pathology evaluation of solid malignant tumours. Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies, except one, reported an increased overall completeness of pathology reports after introduction of synoptic reporting (SR). Most frequently studied cancers were breast (n = 9) and colorectal cancer (n = 16). For breast cancer, narrative reports adequately described 'tumour type' and 'nodal status'. Synoptic reporting resulted in improved description of 'resection margins', 'DCIS size', 'location' and 'presence of calcifications'. For colorectal cancer, narrative reports adequately reported 'tumour type', 'invasion depth', 'lymph node counts' and 'nodal status'. Synoptic reporting resulted in increased reporting of 'circumferential margin', 'resection margin', 'perineural invasion' and 'lymphovascular invasion'. In addition, increased numbers of reported lymph nodes were found in synoptic reports. Narrative reports of other cancer types described the traditional parameters adequately, whereas for 'resection margins' and '(lympho) vascular/perineural invasion', implementation of synoptic reporting was necessary. Synoptic reporting results in improved reporting of clinical relevant data.

40|$|Imaging in {{rectal cancer}} has {{a vital role}} in staging disease, and in {{selecting}} and optimizing treatment planning. High-resolution MRI (HR-MRI) is the recommended method of first choice for local staging of rectal cancer for both primary staging and for restaging after preoperative chemoradiation (CT-RT). HR-MRI helps decide between upfront surgery and preoperative CT-RT. It provides high accuracy for prediction of circumferential resection margin at surgery, T category, and nodal status in that order. MRI also helps assess resectability after preoperative CT-RT and decide between sphincter saving or more radical surgery. Accurate technique is crucial for obtaining high-resolution images in the appropriate planes for correct staging. The phased array external coil has replaced the endorectal coil that is no longer recommended. Non-fat suppressed 2 D T 2 -weighted (T 2 W) sequences in orthogonal planes to the tumor are sufficient for primary staging. Contrast-enhanced MRI is considered inappropriate for both primary staging and restaging. Diffusion-weighted sequence may be of value in restaging. Multidetector CT cannot replace MRI in local staging, but has an important role for evaluating distant metastases. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) has a limited role in the initial staging of rectal cancer and is reserved for cases with resectable metastatic disease before contemplating surgery. This article briefly reviews the comprehensive role of imaging in rectal cancer, describes the role of MRI in local staging in detail, discusses the optimal MRI technique, and provides a <b>synoptic</b> <b>report</b> for both primary staging and restaging after CT-RT in routine practice...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{surgical}} pathology report remains {{the primary source}} for information to guide the treatment of patients with cancer. Failure to report critical elements in a cancer report is an increasing problem in pathology because of the heightened complexity of these reports and number of elements that are important for patient care. The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (ACS-CoC) {{in concert with the}} College of American Pathologists (CAP) developed checklists that contain all of the scientifically validated data elements that are to be reported for cancer specimens. Most institutions do not as of yet have pathology information systems in which CAP checklists are embedded into the laboratory information system (LIS). Entering the required elements often requires extensive text editing, secretarial support and deletion of extraneous elements that can be an arduous task. Materials and Methods: We sought to develop a web-based system that was available throughout the workstations in our department and was capable of generating synoptic reports based on the CAP guidelines. The program was written in a manner that allowed automatic generation of the web-based checklists through a parsing algorithm. Results: Multiple web-based <b>synoptic</b> <b>report</b> generators have been developed to encompass required elements of cancer synoptic reports as required by the ACS-CoC/ CAP. In addition, utilizing the same program, report generators for certain molecular tests (KRAS mutation) and FISH studies (UroVysion tm) have also been developed. The output of these reports can be cut-and-pasted into any text-based anatomic pathology LIS. In addition, the elements can be compiled in a database.

A straightforward system of grading is presented to gauge the extent of medial degeneration and <b>synoptic</b> <b>reporting</b> tables are provided. Herein we present a standardized nomenclature that is accessible to general pathologists and useful for future publications describing these entitie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{dominant}} {{method of}} reporting findings from diagnostic and surgical procedures is the narrative report. In cancer care, this report inconsistently provides the information required {{to understand the}} cancer and make informed patient care decisions. Another method of reporting, the <b>synoptic</b> <b>report,</b> captures specific data items in a structured manner and contains only items critical for patient care. Research demonstrates that synoptic reports vastly {{improve the quality of}} reporting. However, synoptic reporting represents a complex innovation in cancer care, with implementation and use requiring fundamental shifts in physician behaviour and practice, and support from the organization and larger system. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the key interpersonal, organizational, and system-level factors that influence the implementation and use of synoptic reporting in cancer care. Methods This study involves three initiatives in Nova Scotia, Canada, that have implemented synoptic reporting within their departments/programs. Case study methodology will be used to study these initiatives (the cases) in-depth, explore which factors were barriers or facilitators of implementation and use, examine relationships amongst factors, and uncover which factors appear to be similar and distinct across cases. The cases were selected as they converge and differ with respect to factors that are likely to influence the implementation and use of an innovation in practice. Data will be collected through in-depth interviews, document analysis, observation of training sessions, and examination/use of the synoptic reporting tools. An audit will be performed to determine/quantify use. Analysis will involve production of a case record/history for each case, in-depth analysis of each case, and cross-case analysis, where findings will be compared and contrasted across cases to develop theoretically informed, generalisable knowledge that can be applied to other settings/contexts. Ethical approval was granted for this study. Discussion This study will contribute to our knowledge base on the multi-level factors, and the relationships amongst factors in specific contexts, that influence implementation and use of innovations such as synoptic reporting in healthcare. Such knowledge is critical to improving our understanding of implementation processes in clinical settings, and to helping researchers, clinicians, and managers/administrators develop and implement ways to more effectively integrate innovations into routine clinical care. </p...|$|E
5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across {{a particular area}} at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in <b>synoptic</b> <b>reports</b> sent by professionally trained observers.|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} Gordon {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, which developed a circulation north of Panama early on November6. It gradually organized, becoming Tropical Depression Twelve on November8 offshore eastern Nicaragua. Proximity to land prevented strengthening, and early on November10 it made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough turned the depression to the northeast, and late on November10 it intensified into Tropical Storm Gordon after reaching open waters. The circulation of the cyclone was initially very broad, covering much of the western Caribbean Sea, and wind shear prevented significant strengthening. Early on November 13, Gordon struck Jamaica near Kingston as a minimal tropical storm, and later that day made landfall near Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Around the time of Gordon crossing Jamaica, an upper-level trough spawned a low-level disturbance over the central Bahamas. From surface <b>synoptic</b> <b>reports,</b> the National Hurricane Center estimates Tropical Storm Gordon rapidly crossed Cuba and became the dominant system between Cuba and the Bahamas, but other meteorologists believe Gordon dissipated and that a second cyclone became the dominant system. The resultant storm north of Cuba became much larger, spreading rain across much of Florida.|$|R
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, this {{rule of thumb}} came into being, {{developed}} by R. H. Kraft. [...] It was noted from rainfall amounts (in imperial units) reported by the first order rainfall network in the United States that the storm total rainfall fit a simple equation: [...] 100 divided by the speed of motion in knots. [...] This rule works, even in other countries, {{as long as a}} tropical cyclone is moving and only the first order or synoptic station network (with observations spaced about [...] apart) are used to derive storm totals. [...] Canada uses {{a modified version of the}} Kraft rule which divides the results by a factor of two, which takes into account the lower sea surface temperatures seen around Atlantic Canada and the prevalence of systems undergoing vertical wind shear at their northerly latitudes. [...] The main problem with this rule is that the rainfall observing network is denser than either the <b>synoptic</b> <b>reporting</b> network or the first order station networks, which means the absolute maximum is likely to be underestimated. [...] Another problem is that it does not take the size of the tropical cyclone or topography into account.|$|R
40|$|Networks of {{data are}} {{simulated}} by interpolating height and wind from a hypothetically “correct ” analysis at a uniform array of points. The interpolated values {{are added to}} random numbers whose statistics are typical of nonsystematic errors of observation, and are then regarded as genuine data. Such artificially constructed “data ” for several networks of different densities are analyzed independently. The differences between these analyses and the hypothetically “correct ” analysis are taken to {{be representative of the}} initial analysis error under conditions of varying station density. Numerical forecasts computed from the different analyses are compared with the forecast made from the “correct” initial data. Several such comparisons indicate that initial analysis errors do not grow to an important degree so long as the spacing between <b>synoptic</b> <b>reports</b> confines error fields to a scale smaller than that of the synoptic disturbances. However, with data spacing comparable with that over existing regions of poor data coverage, initial errors are amplified two-fold in a 48 -hr. forecast interval. Further experiments, in which the data are analyzed objectively to eliminate inconsistencies of analysis, are carried out. 1. INTRODUCTION data and analysis problem at length- and shown bas ho...|$|R
40|$|The SNOMED CT Clinical Terminology {{has been}} made {{available}} to the Australian health commu-nity as the clinical terminology to be used to standardise the collection of clinical data. Reference Sets are a mechanism to identify a specific subset of SNOMED CT concepts relevant to a particular medical domain. They also provide alternate organisation or navigation hierarchies. As such, they attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} a general-purpose reference terminology and an interface termi-nology. In this paper we describe the process of building a Reference Set that can be used to describe colonic pathologies and how that Reference Set can be used as an interface terminology in a spe-cific software system. Ideally the Reference Set will be generally useful for other applications, such as to support <b>synoptic</b> <b>reporting.</b> This would also help to meet the aim of recording clinical infor-mation in a standard vocabulary. The process described uses the Reference Set Editor in the Snapper Platform from the Australian e-Health Research Centre (AEHRC), which already supports the building of SNOMED CT extensions through a reverse mapping module.
