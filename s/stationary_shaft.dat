50|$|The NSU Delphin III {{streamliner}} motorcycle set {{the motorcycle}} land speed record in 1956. Wilhelm Herz rode {{the machine to}} 211.4 mph at Bonneville Speedway in Utah, to break 200 mph (320 km/h) for the first time. Its fairing, designed in a wind tunnel at University of Stuttgart (then Stuttgart Technical College), gave it a drag coefficient of 0.19. The same engine powered Herz to a 1951 world speed record, with a less efficient frame/fairing, the Delphin I. The engine used an unusual rotary supercharger related to NSU's eventual development of the Wankel engine.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{practical}} applications of rolling objects {{is the use of}} rolling-element bearings, such as ball bearings, in rotating devices. Made of metal, the rolling elements are usually encased between two rings that can rotate independently of each other. In most mechanisms, the inner ring is attached to a <b>stationary</b> <b>shaft</b> (or axle). Thus, while the inner ring is stationary, the outer ring is free to move with very little friction. This is the basis for which almost all motors (such as those found in ceiling fans, cars, drills, etc.) rely on to operate.

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{behaviors of}} the rotating composite shafts containing randomly oriented reinforcements are studied in this paper. The Mori-Tanaka mean-field theory is adopted here {{to account for the}} interaction at the finite concentrations of reinforcements in the composite material. The effective elastic moduli of the composite material are expressed {{as a function of the}} phase properties, volume fraction, orientation angles of its constituents. The finite element model of the rotating continuous fiber-reinforced composite shafts derived previously by authors is extended here to the case that contains the fiber inclusions by taking these effective elastic moduli into account. Based on this model, the natural frequencies of the <b>stationary</b> <b>shafts,</b> and the whirling speeds as well as the critical speeds of the rotating shafts are investigated. The results reveal that the content and the orientation of reinforcements have great influence on the dynamic characteristics of the composite shafts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{possible}} {{design for}} a more compact gas turbine engine uses contra-rotating high pressure (HP) and intermediate pressure (IP) turbine discs. Cooling air for the IP turbine stages is taken from the compressor and transferred to the turbine stage via holes in the drive shaft. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} discharge coefficient characteristics of the holes in this rotating shaft, and, in particular, to ascertain whether the sense of rotation of the shaft with respect to the discs affected these significantly. This paper reports mostly on experimental measurements of the discharge coefficients. Some CFD modelling of this flow was carried out and this has helped to explain the experimental work. The experimental results show the effects on the discharge coefficient of rotational speed, flow rate, and co- and contra-rotations of the shaft relative to the discs. The measured values of the discharge coefficient are compared with established experimental data for non-rotating holes {{in the presence of a}} cross-flow. For <b>stationary</b> <b>shaft</b> and discs, co-rotation of the shaft and discs and differential rotation with the disc speed less than the shaft (in the same rotational direction), the discharge coefficients are in reasonable agreement with these data.

40|$|Abstract––In {{this paper}} my {{effective}} {{approach is to}} harness electrical energy from the highways by means of Vertical axis wind turbine. The smart wind mill consists of a <b>stationary</b> <b>shaft</b> which is mounted on the ball bearing {{on the top and}} bottom end of the shaft. The curvy darrieus blades are connected to the two ends of the bearing which is able to rotate on its own axis. In highways the vehicles moving on two different directions makes the wind turbine to rotate more effectively on its own axis in only one direction i. e. clockwise direction. The dynamo is connected to the either upper part or lower part of the wind turbine which works on Fleming’s left hand rule of electromagnetic induction. The smart wind turbine is able to rotate more effectively as a result large amount of electricity is generated by more number of Vehicles passing by. In highways both at day as well as at night times vehicles will be moving at very high speed. So it is possible to get good efficiency as output. When the wind power gets increased certainly the number of rotations gets increased and we can get high output as electricity. Wind power is an alternate to fossil fuel which is plentiful, renewable widely distributed resource. Clean energy produces no greenhouse gases during its operation and requires little land. By this method the overall cost per unit of energy produced is less than the cost of new coal, natural gas and its installation. So the implementation can be made easier than any other methods.

40|$|In this study, {{we aim to}} {{investigate}} the feasibility to use MPTs (Magnetostrictive Patch Transducers) for torsional vibration measurement in solid ferromagnetic cylinders. MPTs consisting of thin magnetostrictive patches, permanent magnets and a solenoid coil {{have been widely used}} for elastic wave transduction in the ultrasound frequency range [1] but they have been seldom used for sonic-frequency range vibration measurement, in spite of their unique wireless transduction characteristics. While a MPT was used in Ref. [2] to perform torsional modal testing in a hollow cylinder or a pipe having relatively small torsional rigidity, no investigation has been reported yet on the use of MPTs in “solid” “ferromagnetic” shafts, common torsional power carrying elements in machines. While we will be mainly focused here on the torsional wave measurement in <b>stationary</b> <b>shafts,</b> the MPT-based torsional measurement can be also applied to rotating shafts. Because the torsional rigidities of solid shafts are much larger than those of hollow cylinders of the same radii, it is important to find optimal MPT configurations, such as the optimal number of rectangular patches to be installed around the surface of a solid shaft. Thereby, we performed numerical investigations and accordingly designed a series of experiments for torsional vibration testing in steel shafts. The actual modal testing experiments with the designed MPTs were found to predict the torsional Eigen-frequencies and Eigen-modes that agree well with the theoretical predictions. Also the relation between the measured vibration signals from MPTs and those from strain gages was checked experimentally and in fact, the experimental result favorably agreed with the theoretical prediction. Potential applications of the MPT-based torsional vibration measurement technique in rotating solid shafts for structural health monitoring are also briefly discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A screw is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the outside. [...] The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads {{on the inside of the}} hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In screw mechanisms, either the screw shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a <b>stationary</b> screw <b>shaft.</b> [...] Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.|$|R

40|$|The {{effective}} use of active magnetic bearings for vibration control in turbomachinery depends on {{an understanding of the}} forces available from a magnetic bearing actuator. The purpose of this project was to characterize the forces as functions shaft position. Both numerical and experimental studies were done to determine the characteristics of the forces exerted on a <b>stationary</b> <b>shaft</b> by a magnetic bearing actuator. The numerical studies were based on finite element computations and included both linear and nonlinear magnetization functions. Measurements of the force versus position of a nonrotating shaft were made using two separate measurement rigs, one based on strain gage measurement of forces, the other based on deflections of a calibrated beam. The general trends of the measured principal forces agree with the predictions of the theory while the magnitudes of forces are somewhat smaller than those predicted. Other aspects of theory are not confirmed by the measurements. The measured forces in the normal direction are larger than those predicted by theory when the rotor has a normal eccentricity. Over the ranges of position examined, the data indicate an approximately linear relationship between the normal eccentricity of the shaft and the ratio of normal to principal force. The constant of proportionality seems to be larger at lower currents, but for all cases examined its value is between 0. 14 and 0. 17. The nonlinear theory predicts the existence of normal forces, but has not predicted such a large constant of proportionality for the ratio. The type of coupling illustrated by these measurements would not tend to cause whirl, because the coupling coefficients have the same sign, unlike the case of a fluid film bearing, where the normal stiffness coefficients often have opposite signs. They might, however, tend to cause other self-excited behavior. This possibility must be considered when designing magnetic bearings for flexible rotor applications, such as gas turbines and other turbomachinery...|$|E

40|$|Metal mesh foil {{bearings}} (MMFBs) are {{a promising}} low cost gas bearing technology for support of high speed oil-free microturbomachinery. Elimination of complex oil lubrication and sealing system by installing MMFBs in oil free rotating machinery offer distinctive advantages such as reduced system overall weight, enhanced reliability at high rotational speeds and extreme temperatures, and extended maintenance intervals compared to conventional turbo machines. MMFBs for oil-free turbomachinery must demonstrate adequate load capacity, reliable rotordynamic performance, and low frictional losses {{in a high}} temperature environment. The thesis presents the measurements of MMFB break-away torque, rotor lift off and touchdown speeds, temperature at increasing static load conditions, and identified stiffness and equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The experiments, conducted in a test rig driven by an automotive turbocharger turbine, demonstrate the airborne operation (hydrodynamic gas film) of the floating test MMFB with little frictional loses at increasing loads. The measured drag torque peaks when the rotor starts and stops, and drops significantly once the bearing is airborne. The estimated rotor speed for lift-off increases linearly with increasing applied loads. During continuous operation, the MMFB temperature measured {{at one end of}} the back surface of the top foil increases both with rotor speed and static load. Nonetheless, the temperature rise is only nominal ensuring reliable bearing performance. Application of a sacrificial layer of solid lubricant on the top foil surface aids to reduce the rotor break-away torque. The measurements give confidence on this simple bearing technology for ready application into oil-free turbomachinery. Impact loads delivered (with a soft tip) to the test bearing, while resting on the (<b>stationary)</b> drive <b>shaft,</b> evidence a system with large damping and a structural stiffness that increases with frequency (max. 200 Hz). The system equivalent viscous damping ratio decreases from ~ 0. 7 to 0. 2 as the frequency increases. In general, the viscous damping in a metal mesh structure is of structural type and inversely proportional to the frequency and amplitude of bearing motion relative to the shaft. Impact load tests, conducted while the shaft rotates at 50 krpm, show that the bearing direct stiffness is lower (~ 25 % at 200 Hz) than the bearing structural stiffness identified from impact load tests without shaft rotation. However, the identified equivalent viscous damping coefficients from tests with and without shaft rotation are nearly identical. The orbits of bearing motion relative to the rotating shaft show subsynchronous motion amplitudes and also backward synchronous whirl. The subsynchronous vibration amplitudes are locked at a frequency, nearly identical to a rotor natural frequency. A backward synchronous whirl occurs while the rotor speed is between any two natural frequencies, arising due to bearing stiffness asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|Aero-engines {{incorporate}} various bearing {{chambers and}} these typically contain bearings, seals, rotating <b>shafts,</b> <b>stationary</b> walls and struts, and sometimes gears. Oil is supplied for lubrication and cooling and is removed (scavenged) from the sump {{region of the}} chamber (note that {{in some parts of}} the world the entire bearing chamber is referred to as the sump). Depending on the location and function of the bearing chamber, the sump region may be deep or shallow. Effective oil removal is essential as unnecessary working of the oil can lead to excessive heat generation and reduced overall efficiency. Therefore the design of the scavenge region in a bearing chamber, as well as the ability to assess its performance is very important. Previous work, much of which was conducted at the University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems (UTC) suggests that oil often does not flow cleanly into the off-take due to a combination of several factors: oil momentum, windage, three-dimensional air flow that blocks the off-take flow or transports oil away from the off-take, and pooling because of separated air flow that acts on the oil once oil momentum is dissipated. Experimental research at the UTC found that scavenge performance is highly affected by the sump geometry, especially its depth. Variations of shallow sumps, although some are better than the others, cannot offer the same level of performance as a deep one. However space limitation in an engine often only allows for a shallow sump. This paper presents some experimental exploration on new design ideas. They are in the form of various inserts and attachments that were designed to improve scavenge performance of a shallow sump. These “custom” sumps were tested on the UTC’s scavenge test facility at various flow settings (wall film/flying droplets, liquid flow rates, scavenge ratios, shaft speeds). The residence volumes were measured and compared to a baseline configuration with reduction in residence volume desirable. The inserts tested were a Grille Cover, a Stepped Spillway, a Perforated Plate and a Porous Insert.
