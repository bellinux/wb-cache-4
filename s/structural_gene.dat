25|$|In {{molecular}} biology, {{the presence}} of amylase can serve as an additional method of selecting for successful integration of a reporter construct in addition to antibiotic resistance. As reporter genes are flanked by homologous regions of the <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> for amylase, successful integration will disrupt the amylase gene and prevent starch degradation, which is easily detectable through iodine staining.|$|E
50|$|The <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> {{sequence}} of HPIVs is as follows: 3′-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5′ (the protein prefixes and further details are {{outlined in the}} table below).|$|E
50|$|A <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> is a {{gene that}} codes for any RNA or protein product other than a {{regulatory}} factor (i.e. regulatory protein). A term derived from the lac operon, structural genes are typically viewed as those containing sequences of DNA corresponding to the amino acids of a protein that will be produced, as long as said protein does not function to regulate gene expression. <b>Structural</b> <b>gene</b> products include enzymes and structural proteins. Also encoded by structural genes are non-coding RNAs, such as rRNAs and tRNAs (but excluding any regulatory miRNAs and siRNAs).|$|E
50|$|The lac operon {{consists}} of three <b>structural</b> <b>genes,</b> and a promoter, a terminator, regulator, and an operator. The three <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> are: lacZ, lacY, and lacA.|$|R
40|$|The light-harvesting II (LHII) <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> coding for the (B 800 -B 850 complex) β- and α-polypeptides {{have been}} cloned and the {{nucleotide}} and deduced polypeptide sequences have been determined. This completes the sequencing of all seven <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> coding for the structural polypeptides of the photosynthetic apparatus that bind the pigments and cofactors {{participating in the}} primary light reactions of photosynthesis. Unlike the <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> coding for the reaction center L, M, and H subunits and the light-harvesting I (LHI) (B 870 complex) structural polypeptides, the LHII <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> are not within the 46 -kilobase photosynthetic gene cluster carried by the R-prime plasmid pRPS 404. Identical organization of the β and α <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> for both LHI and LHII and sequence homologies between the two β-polypeptides and between the two α-polypeptides suggests that both complexes arose by gene duplication from a single ancestral light-harvesting complex and that the putative bacteriochlorophyll binding sequence Ala-X-X-X-His has been absolutely conserved...|$|R
30|$|Electrophoretic {{analysis}} of protein provides {{information concerning the}} <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> and their regulatory systems that control the biosynthetic pathways of that protein. Each polypeptide band represents the final products of transcriptional events occurring due to active <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> (Sadia et al. 2009).|$|R
50|$|More recently, microRNAs {{were found}} to be {{produced}} from the internal transcribed spacers of rRNA genes. Thus an internal component of a <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> is, in fact, regulatory. Binding sites for microRNAs were also detected within coding sequences of genes. Typically interfering RNAs target the 3’UTR, but inclusion of binding sites within the sequence of the protein itself allows the transcripts of these proteins to effectively regulate the microRNAs within the cell. This interaction was demonstrated to have an effect on expression, and thus again a <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> contains a regulatory component.|$|E
50|$|In eukaryotes, {{structural}} {{genes are}} not sequentially placed. Each gene is instead composed of coding exons and interspersed non-coding introns. Regulatory sequences are typically found in non-coding regions {{upstream and downstream}} from the gene. <b>Structural</b> <b>gene</b> mRNAs must be spliced prior to translation to remove intronic sequences. This in turn lends itself to the eukaryotic phenomenon of alternative splicing, in which a single mRNA from a single <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> can produce several different proteins based on which exons are included. Despite the complexity of this process, {{it is estimated that}} up to 94% of human genes are spliced in some way. Furthermore, different splicing patterns occur in difference tissue types.|$|E
50|$|Virtually all colicins {{are carried}} on {{plasmids}}. The two general classes of colicinogenic plasmids are large, low-copy-number plasmids, and small, high-copy-number plasmids. The larger plasmids carry other genes, {{as well as}} the colicin operon. The colicin operons are generally organized with several major genes. These include an immunity gene, a colicin <b>structural</b> <b>gene,</b> and a bacteriocin release protein (BRP), or lysis, gene. The immunity gene is often produced constitutively, while the BRP is generally produced only as a read-through of the stop codon on the colicin <b>structural</b> <b>gene.</b> The colicin itself is repressed by the SOS response and may be regulated in other ways, as well.|$|E
50|$|In prokaryotes, <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> {{of related}} {{function}} are typically adjacent {{to one another}} on a single strand of DNA, forming an operon. This permits simpler regulation of gene expression, as a single regulatory factor can affect transcription of all associated genes. This is best illustrated by the well-studied lac operon, in which three <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> (lacZ, lacY, and lacA) are all regulated by a single promoter and a single operator. Prokaryotic <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> are transcribed into a polycistronic mRNA and subsequently translated.|$|R
50|$|The genome is ~7.5 kilobases {{in length}} with a G+C content of ~35%. Two <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> are present: L1 and L2. The non <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> are {{found on the}} {{opposite}} strand. The L1 gene encodes a protein with 506 residues and the L2 encodes a protein with 470 residues. The two non <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> T (742 amino acid residues) and t (224 amino acid residues). The structural proteisn resemble those of the pappiloma viruses while the T and t antigens resemble those of the polyoma viruses.|$|R
50|$|As {{far back}} as 1974, DNA {{sequence}} similarity was recognized as a valuable tool for determining relationships among taxa. <b>Structural</b> <b>genes</b> in general are more highly conserved due to functional constraint, and so can prove useful in examinations of more disparate taxa. Original analyses enriched samples for <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> via hybridization to mRNA.|$|R
50|$|However, {{increasing}} {{discoveries of}} gene regulation suggest greater complexity. <b>Structural</b> <b>gene</b> expression is regulated by numerous factors including epigenetics (e.g. methylation), RNAi, and more. Regulatory and structural genes can be epigenetically regulated identically, so not all regulation is coded for by “regulatory genes”.|$|E
50|$|In Herpes simplex virus, the <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> {{sequence}} {{responsible for}} virulence {{was found in}} two locations in the genome despite only one location actually producing the viral gene product. This was hypothesized {{to serve as a}} potential mechanism for strains to regain virulence if lost through mutation.|$|E
50|$|The ara operon is {{regulated}} by the AraC protein. If arabinose is absent, the dimer AraC protein represses the <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> by binding to araI1 and araO2 and the DNA forms a loop. The loop prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter of the ara operon, thereby blocking transcription.|$|E

50|$|HutP (Histidine {{utilizing}} Protein) {{is one of}} the anti-terminator proteins of Bacillus subtilis, {{which is}} responsible for regulating the expression of the hut <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> of this organism in response to changes in the intracellular levels of L-histidine and divalent metal ions. In the hut operon, HutP is located just downstream from the promoter, while the five other subsequent <b>structural</b> <b>genes,</b> hutH, hutU, hutI, hutG and hutM, are positioned far downstream from the promoter. In the presence of L-histidine and divalent metal ions, HutP binds to the nascent hut mRNA leader transcript. This allows the anti-terminator to form, thereby preventing the formation of the terminator and permitting transcriptional read-through into the hut <b>structural</b> <b>genes.</b> In the absence of L-histidine and divalent metal ions or both, HutP does not bind to the hut mRNA, thus allowing the formation of a stem loop terminator structure within the nucleotide sequence located between the hutP and <b>structural</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mercury(II) reductase, {{commonly}} known as MerA, is encoded in a <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> found on the mer loci or as transposon 501 (Tn501). It shares the same promoter region as mercury transport class proteins, such as MerP and MerT, and regulatory factor MerD. MerA transcription is regulated by both MerR and MerD.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{regulatory}} and accessory proteins have many functions. These viral proteins control and influence viral gene expressions in the viral genome, including viral <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> transcription rates. Viral {{regulatory and}} accessory proteins also influence and adjust cellular {{functions of the}} host cell, such as the regulation of genes, and apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{numerous}} alterations {{associated with}} partial albinism in the fowl {{are difficult to}} explain merely considering C locus only the <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> of tyrosinase. This locus may provide broader regulatory function instead. In {{the opinion of the}} scientists, it may exist additional physiological functions for melanin/functional tyrosinase that are not involved with pigmentation.|$|E
40|$|Strains of Rhizobium forming nitrogen-fixing symbioses {{with common}} bean were {{systematically}} examined {{for the presence}} of the uptake hydrogenase (hup) <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> and expression of uptake hydrogenase (Hup) activity. DNA with homology to the hup <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> of Bradyrhizobium japonicum was present in 100 of 248 strains examined. EcoRI fragments with molecular sizes of approximately 20. 0 and 2. 2 kb hybridized with an internal SacI fragment, which contains part of both bradyrhizobial hup <b>structural</b> <b>genes.</b> The DNA with homology to the hup genes was located on pSym of one of the bean rhizobia. Hup activity was observed in bean symbioses with 13 of 30 strains containing DNA homologous with the hup <b>structural</b> <b>genes.</b> However, the Hup activity was not sufficient to eliminate hydrogen evolution from the nodules. Varying the host plant with two of the Hup+ strains indicated that expression of Hup activity was host regulated, as has been reported with soybean, pea, and cowpea strains...|$|R
50|$|MerR binds to an {{operator}} in the <b>structural</b> mer <b>gene</b> promoter called MerO. This binding causes the DNA of the mer loci to bend to where RNA polymerase {{can not read}} the region. However, Hg2+ can bind to MerR and allosterically change {{the shape of the}} DNA, so that RNA polymerase can read the promoter region of the <b>structural</b> <b>genes.</b> Since both promoter regions overlap when apoMerR is bound to MerO, the change in DNA conformation causes neither the <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> nor the regulatory genes to be read. This makes MerR a negative autoregulator.|$|R
40|$|The protein {{products}} encoded by the Escherichia coli deoR and cytR <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> {{have been identified}} based on results obtained from E. coli maxicells harboring (i) recombinant plasmids carrying wild-type deoR and cytR genes, (ii) deletion derivatives of the deoR+ and cytR+ plasmids, (iii) plasmids containing site-specific mutations in the deoR and cytR <b>structural</b> <b>genes,</b> and (iv) plasmids which have transposon Tn 1000 inserted into the deoR and cytR <b>structural</b> <b>genes.</b> Analysis of the protein profiles obtained from all the maxicell experiments demonstrated that the deoR gene encodes a protein with a subunit molecular weight of 30, 500 and that {{the product of the}} cytR gene is a protein with a subunit molecular weight of 37, 000...|$|R

50|$|Various end-points are {{possible}} {{indicators of the}} triggering of the SOS system; activation of the RecA protein, cleavage of the LexA repressor, expression {{of any of the}} SOS genes, etc. One of the simplest assays consists of monitoring the expression of an SOS gene by means of fusion with lacZ, the <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> for E. coli β-galactosidase.|$|E
50|$|For example, Yersinia pestis (the bubonic plague) {{was found}} to carry several {{virulence}} and inflammation-related structural genes on plasmids. Likewise, the <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> responsible for tetanus {{was determined to be}} carried on a plasmid as well. Diphtheria is caused by a bacterium, but only after that bacterium has been infected by a bacteriophage carrying the structural genes for the toxin.|$|E
40|$|All of the <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> for 3 -chlorobenzoate {{degradation}} {{are clustered}} in a 4. 2 -kilobase (kb) region of plasmid pAC 25 (or pAC 27) in Pseudomonas putida. An approximate 10 -kb DNA segment containing three <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> for chlorocatechol metabolism present on plasmid pJP 4 in Alcaligenes eutrophus shows homology with the above 4. 2 -kb region of pAC 27. In {{spite of the}} detectable sequence homology in the <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> present on both plasmids, the regulation of their expression seems quite different; unlike pAC 27, structural rearrangements are prerequisite for efficient expression of the 3 -chlorobenzoate genes on plasmid pJP 4. Structural features such as stem-loop structures present on plasmid pJP 4 are most likely the starting materials for such rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of a 2. 2 kb region downstream of the hydrogenase <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> in Bradyrhizobium japonicum was determined. Four genes encoding predicted polypeptides of 27. 8 (HupC), 21. 4 (HupD), 10. 6 (HupF) and 15. 8 (HupG) kDa were identified, {{of which the}} first three probably {{belong to the same}} operon as the hup <b>structural</b> <b>genes,</b> hupS and hupL. HupC is homologous to the hydrophobic polypeptides with four potential transmembrane regions that are encoded by open reading frames following the hydrogenase <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> in Rhodobacter capsulatus, Escherichia coli, Azotobacter vinelandii, Wolinella succinogenes, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Alcaligenes eutrophus. Also HupD, HupF and HupG are homologous to genes involved in processing, maturation, functioning and regulation of hydrogenase activity in various hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{isolation}} of the DNA fragments containing <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> at the beginning, in the middle {{and at the end of}} the coding strand is described. It involves mechanical or enzymatic shearing, exonuclease treatment, hybridization with mRNA and subsequent retention of DNA-mRNA complex on poly(U) -Sepharose. Hybridization of the DNA fragments with mRNA takes place with high specificity and isolated material is enriched in <b>structural</b> <b>genes.</b> Applications of this method for gene isolation are discussed...|$|R
50|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), the {{transcriptional}} {{regulation of}} the INO1 gene encoding inositol-3-phosphate synthase has been studied in detail and its expression is sensitive to the availability of phospholipid precursors as well as growth phase. The {{regulation of the}} <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> encoding 1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase has also been analyzed {{at the transcriptional level}} in the aquatic angiosperm, Spirodela polyrrhiza (Giant duckweed) and the halophyte, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (Common ice plant).|$|E
50|$|The {{identification}} of the genetic basis for the causative agent of a disease {{can be an important}} component of understanding its effects and spread. Location and content of structural genes can elucidate the evolution of virulence, as well as provide necessary information for treatment. Likewise understanding the specific changes in <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> sequences underlying a gain or loss of virulence aids in understanding the mechanism by which diseases affect their hosts.|$|E
50|$|Gene {{prediction}} {{is closely related}} to the so-called 'target search problem' investigating how DNA-binding proteins (transcription factors) locate specific binding sites within the genome. Many aspects of <b>structural</b> <b>gene</b> prediction are based on current understanding of underlying biochemical processes in the cell such as gene transcription, translation, protein-protein interactions and regulation processes, which are subject of active research in the various omics fields such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more generally structural and functional genomics.|$|E
40|$|Aerobic and {{anaerobic}} L-fucose utilization by Escherichia coli {{involves an}} inducible trunk pathway mediated by a permease, an isomerase, a kinase, and an aldolase. Tn 5 insertion mutants of a parental strain expressing this pathway constitutively {{were used to}} map {{the positions of the}} <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> by transduction. Results from this and previous studies show that all of the <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> of the L-fucose trunk pathway map between eno and argA at minute 60. 2 of the chromosome...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} for a nucleolus in {{the expression of}} <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> of nuclear viruses was examined by means of experiments in which the nucleolus or {{other parts of the}} nucleus was inactivated by a microbean of unltraviolet light. These experiments showed that the expression of such genes is not dependent on cucleolar function. This conclusion is discussed in the light of previous experiments in which similar inactiviation of nucleolus was shown to prevent the expression of cellular <b>structural</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Five <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> coding for the {{reaction}} center (RC) L, M, and H subunits {{and the two}} light-harvesting (LH) I polypeptides, B 870 α and B 870 β, have been mapped on two restriction fragments from the R-prime plasmid pRPS 404. It has been recently shown that enhanced near-infrared fluorescence mutants of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata typically lack RC or LH I polypeptides and that these lesions are marker-rescued by two restriction fragments from the R-prime plasmid: the 7. 5 -kilobase-pair EcoRI F fragment and the 4. 75 -kilobase-pair BamHI C-EcoRI fragment. We have now determined the nucleotide sequence of two restriction fragments and {{have found that the}} BamHI C-EcoRI B fragment carries the <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> for the RC L and M subunits and both LH I polypeptides. Forty kilobase pairs away from this locus, the BamHI F fragment (within the EcoRI F fragment) carries the RC H subunit. The <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> on the BamHI C-EcoRI B fragment are probably transcribed as part of a polycistronic mRNA. All of the <b>structural</b> <b>genes</b> begin with a consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence and separate AUG start codons, indicating that the structural polypeptides are not cleaved from larger precursor polypeptides...|$|R
