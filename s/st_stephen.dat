5|$|King <b>St</b> <b>Stephen</b> {{has been}} a popular theme in Hungarian poetry {{since the end of}} the 13th century.

Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989.|$|E
