The sulfonamide group forms a unique polar interaction with the enzyme.

This study introduces airborne laser scanner (ALS) data and the k-NN classifier data analysis technique applicable to the site quality assessment of mature forests. Both the echo height and the intensity value percentiles of different echo types of ALS data were used in the analysis. The data are of 274 mature forest stands of different sizes, belonging to five forest <b>site</b> <b>types,</b> varying from very fertile to poor forests, in Koli National Park, eastern Finland. The k-NN classifier was applied with values of k varying from 1 to 5. The best overall classification accuracy achieved for all the forest <b>site</b> <b>types</b> and for a single type, were 58 % and 73 %, respectively. The conclusion is that when conducting large-scale forest inventories ALS-data based analysis would be a useful technology for the identification of mature boreal <b>site</b> <b>types.</b> However, the technique could still be improved and further studies are needed to ensure its applicability under different local conditions and with data representing earlier stages of stand development...|$|R

40|$|Development of a cartographic mdel for {{the forest}} <b>site</b> <b>types</b> {{delineation}} in the Belgian Ardenne. The paper presents an original method dealing with the forest <b>site</b> <b>types</b> delineation. The suggested method consists in integrating a typological key in a GIS aiming at producing a thematic map that describes forest <b>site</b> <b>types.</b> Data used are the soil map of Belgium (digitized at the scale 1 : 20, 000) and a digital elevation model built from a topographic map (scale 1 : 10, 000). The typological key is mainly based on the methodology used by Thill et al. (1988) in the <b>site</b> <b>types</b> system for central Ardenne, the potential vegetation map of Sougnez and Dethioux (1975) and the ecoregion map of Delvaux and Galoux (1962). In that respect, <b>site</b> <b>types</b> are {{closely linked to the}} soil map and the phytosociological classification. So, they can be connected to the afforestation guide and different phytosociological and autecological studies concerning forest species. It is then possible to map the potential habitats or the site potentialities related to tree species. The key is valid for the Ardenne ecoregion located in Southern Belgium (elevation higher than 300 m). It has to be validated through an intensive use in the field, taking into account its imprecision linked to the types of collected data, chieffly those being digitized. The integration of such a tool in a SIG can be considered as an original way in terms of integrated forest management or forest sites description {{in the context of the}} project ""Natura 2000 "" launched by the European Union.

40|$|Aims : Given the {{significance}} of the herbaceous understorey layer for temperate forest ecosystem biodiversity and functioning, {{it is important to have}} a thorough understanding of its dynamics in response to environmental change. However, site-specific factors such as soil type may cause differential temporal herb layer changes within a single study area under comparable external pressure. Surprisingly, relatively few studies have examined herb layer changes on different <b>site</b> <b>types</b> within the same forest complex. The aim of this study is to determine the temporal differences in herb vegetation and to compare these for two differing <b>site</b> <b>types</b> in the same forest complex. Location Ancient broad-leaved woodlands traditionally managed as coppice with standards in South Belgium, an area with secondary deposits and a mild temperate climate. Methods : In 2008 we re-inventoried 43 vegetation recordings from 1953 to 1954 in forests on two <b>site</b> <b>types</b> (acid and neutral forests). First, we described differences in soil pH, litter and overstorey characteristics between the sites. Next, multivariate analysis, Ellenberg indicator value and CSR signature were used to determine differences in herb layer diversity and composition between both the two survey times and the two <b>site</b> <b>types.</b> Finally, we analysed temporal differences in individual species abundances and frequencies. Results : The two <b>site</b> <b>types</b> clearly differed with respect to soil, litter and overstorey characteristics. Temporal changes between the surveys were mostly highly significant on the neutral sites and mostly not significant on the acid sites. On both <b>site</b> <b>types,</b> the species pool size declined. On the neutral site, the mean plot species richness also declined. Based on the plant-derived characteristics (Ellenberg indicator values) of the plots, light availability decreased and nitrogen availability significantly increased on the neutral sites. Conclusion : Input of eutrophying deposits and management changes are seen as key drivers of herb layer changes in the study area over the last half-century. However, our study suggests that site characteristics such as parent material and soil pH should also be considered. Together with the key drivers, incorporating differences in site characteristics may improve our understanding of temporal shifts in herb layer vegetation in response to environmental change...|$|R

50|$|Coxsackievirus B4 {{is one of}} the six serotypes {{found in}} Group B and is a {{positive}} sense, single-stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus. Its genome is linear and is 7,293 nucleotides in length with both a 5’ and 3’ untranslated region and encodes its own 3’ poly-A tail. The 5’ untranslated region contains an internal ribosomal entry <b>site</b> (<b>Type</b> I IRES). Covalently bonded to the 5’ UTR is the viral protein VPg which aids in viral entry and replication. 2A and 3C are viral proteinases which aid in the cleavage of the polyprotein encoded for by the genome. 3D is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). 2B, 2C, and 3A are core viral proteins. The genome also codes for 4 capsid proteins, VP4, VP1, VP2, and VP3 that form an icosahedral capsid for the viral particles that is about 30 nm. VP1-VP3 are responsible for the outer surface of the virion, while VP4 is imbedded within the capsid. Altogether, the polyprotein encoded for by the coxsackievirus genome is almost 2,200 amino acids in length, and is eventually cleaved by the 2A and 3C proteinases as well as by host cell proteinases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Models for {{exposure}} assessment of high frequency electromagnetic fields from mobile phone base stations need the technical {{data of the}} base stations as input. One of these parameters, the Equivalent Radiated Power (ERP), is a time-varying quantity, depending on communication traffic. In order to determine temporal averages of the exposure, corresponding averages of the ERP have to be available. These can be determined as duty factors, the ratios of the time-averaged power to the maximum output power according to the transmitter setting. We determine duty factors for UMTS from the data of 37 base stations in the Swisscom network.
