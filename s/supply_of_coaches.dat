50|$|Initially the coach, {{horses and}} driver were all {{supplied}} by contractors. There was strong {{competition for the}} contracts as they provided a fixed regular income on top of which the companies could charge fares for the passengers. By {{the beginning of the}} 19th century the Post Office had their own fleet of coaches with black and scarlet livery. The early coaches were poorly built, but in 1787 the Post Office adopted John Besant's improved and patented design, after which Besant, with his partner John Vidler, enjoyed a monopoly on the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches,</b> and a virtual monopoly on their upkeep and servicing.|$|E
50|$|The {{golden age}} of the stagecoach was during the Regency period, from 1800 to 1830. The era saw great {{improvements}} {{in the design of}} the coaches, notably by John Besant in 1792 and 1795. His coach had a greatly improved turning capacity and braking system, and a novel feature that prevented the wheels from falling off while the coach was in motion. Besant, with his partner John Vidler, enjoyed a monopoly on the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches,</b> and a virtual monopoly on their upkeep and servicing for the following few decades. Obadiah Elliott registered the first patent for a spring-suspension vehicle. Each wheel had two durable steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs attached to the axles. Within a decade, most British horse carriages were equipped with springs; wooden springs in the case of light one-horse vehicles to avoid taxation, and steel springs in larger vehicles. These were often made of low-carbon steel and usually took the form of multiple layer leaf springs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{principle}} of oxygen consumption, relationship between heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire and ventilation factor is studied. The peak heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is estimated under four typical ventilation conditions: one window, two windows, four windows and all windows <b>of</b> the fire <b>coach</b> are opened, respectively. Results were compared with the predictions by traditional empirical formulas for flashover in confined space. A suitable calculation method for forecasting the heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is presented. CFD means were also applied to simulate and analyze the impact of the ventilation factor on the burning characteristics <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire. The results indicate that the calculation method can predict the heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire well. The peak heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is proportional to the ventilation factor. The calculation results are 6. 3 MW, 8. 4 MW, 12. 6 MW and 39. 7 MW and simulation results are 6. 5 MW, 9. 9 MW, 14. 8 MW and 39 MW respectively under different ventilation conditions in this study.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this paper are twofold. First, we argue that the rationalistic assumptions on which dominant conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>coaching</b> process rest are rather unrealistic.

Second, we tentatively offer the alternative metaphor of ‘orchestration’, derived from research on the management of complex change, as one starting point for developing a more realistic conception <b>of</b> <b>coaching.</b> We assert that this way <b>of</b> thinking about <b>coaching</b> has greater potential {{as a basis for}} future research and theorising, with the longer-term aim of informing efforts to improve the practice <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> and <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> education...|$|R

30|$|While the {{published}} research tends to focus heavily on individual level outcomes, the importance <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> for groups and teams has been asserted previously (Arakawa and Greenberg 2007). Despite these assertions, the impact <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> {{at the level}} of the group, team, organisation or system has largely been ignored. The limited research that does exist in this area has focused mostly on return for investment (Feggetter 2007; McGovern et al. 2001; Palmer 2003). The impact <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> for leadership development on broader organisational measures such as collaboration, communication flow, relationships and the wellbeing of others in a system, has been left empirically untested. If the wellbeing of organisational members is of any importance, this focus must shift. Focusing on the broader organisational impacts <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> may provide a deeper understanding <b>of</b> <b>coaching,</b> at both the individual and organisational levels, and give greater clarity on the role <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> in the process of effective organisational change.|$|R
