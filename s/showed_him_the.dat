5|$|In April 1827, the American naturalist {{and bird}} painter John James Audubon came to Britain {{to find a}} {{suitable}} printer for his enormous Birds of America. Bewick, still lively at age 74, <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> woodcut he was working on, a dog afraid of tree stumps that seem in the dark to be devilish figures, and gave Audubon {{a copy of his}} Quadrupeds for his children.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig had asked her to type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{sought the}} {{abolition}} of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians, which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and had defied the Government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. Chamberlain's first step in the direction of abolition was the Rating and Valuation Act 1925, which greatly reduced the number of authorities which administered rates, as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment. Despite policy differences Chamberlain continued to work with Churchill, who <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical The World Crisis. Churchill confided that he would have wished for two more years to revise the manuscript; Chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done the job in two hours—with a pair of scissors.|$|E

5|$|Director John Lasseter's first {{experience}} with computer animation was during his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation, when two of his friends <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> lightcycle scene from Tron. It was an eye-opening experience which awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated animation. Lasseter tried to pitch The Brave Little Toaster as a fully computer-animated film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired. He {{then went on to}} work at Lucasfilm and later as a founding member of Pixar, which was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs in 1986. At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the Pixar Image Computer's capabilities, and Tin Toy (1988) —a short story told {{from the perspective of a}} toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys— would go on to claim the 1988 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first computer-generated film to do so.|$|E
5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> papers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of the opening against a {{world-class}} player was at Berlin in April 1918, a double round-robin tournament with four players: Akiba Rubinstein, Carl Schlechter, Jacques Mieses and Milan Vidmar. Vidmar had to play Black {{in the first round}} against Rubinstein, then ranked the fourth best player in the world with a very positional style. At a loss for what to play, he sought advice from his friend Abonyi, who <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> Budapest Gambit and the main ideas the Hungarian players had found. Vidmar followed Abonyi's advice and beat Rubinstein convincingly in just 24 moves. This victory so heartened Vidmar that he {{went on to win the}} tournament, while Rubinstein was so demoralised by this defeat that he lost another game against Mieses and drew a third one against Schlechter in the same opening.|$|E

5|$|Crossing into Afghanistan, {{the group}} found fresh water in an {{irrigation}} channel by a deserted hamlet. Albeit teeming with leeches, the water saved the group from dying of thirst. Marching {{for another two}} days, they reached the vicinity of Herat, where they made contact with Afghan authorities. Unsure what reception awaited them, von Hentig sent Barkatullah, an Islamic scholar of some fame, to advise the governor that the expedition had arrived and was bearing the Kaiser's message and gifts for the Emir. The governor sent a grand welcome, with noblemen bearing cloths and gifts, a caravan of servants, and a column of hundred armed escorts. The expedition was invited into the city as guests of the Afghan government. With von Hentig in the lead in his Cuirassiers uniform, they entered Herat on 24 August, in a procession welcomed by Turkish troops. They were housed at the Emir's provincial palace. They were officially met by the governor {{a few days later}} when, according to British agents, von Hentig <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> Turkish Sultan's proclamation of jihad and announced the Kaiser's promise to recognise Afghan sovereignty and provide German assistance. The Kaiser also promised to grant territory to Afghanistan as far north as Samarkand in Russian Turkestan and as far into India as Bombay.|$|E

25|$|In summer 1837, Chebyshev {{passed the}} {{registration}} examinations and, in September of that year, began his mathematical {{studies at the}} second philosophical department of Moscow University. His teachers included N.D. Brashman, N.E. Zernov and D.M. Perevoshchikov of whom {{it seems clear that}} Brashman had the greatest influence on Chebyshev. Brashman instructed him in practical mechanics and probably <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> work of French engineer J.V. Poncelet.|$|E

These photographs would become the core of Harlem on My Mind—and the feature of the exhibit that critics routinely praised as the show's biggest revelation. As art historian Sharon Patton observed, VanDerZee not only documented the Harlem Renaissance, but also helped create it.|$|E
25|$|To {{translate}} the golden plates, Smith enlisted {{the assistance of}} Martin Harris, a wealthy Palmyra landowner who acted as Smith's scribe. To translate, Smith used seer stones (one set of which Smith called the Urim and Thummim), and Smith said the stones <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> translation. Translation ceased, however, when Harris lost 116 manuscript pages of uncopied text. Translation resumed in earnest when Smith was joined in May 1829 by a Smith family associate named Oliver Cowdery. Translation was completed {{near the end of}} July 1829, and the resulting manuscript was published as the Book of Mormon on March 26, 1830, in Palmyra.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Thunberg also profited from his teachings himself. As a former medical student he was mainly {{interested}} in medical knowledge, and the Japanese <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> practice of acupuncture. The co-operation of Thunberg {{and the local}} physicians even led to a knowledge fusion which brought about a new acupuncture point called shakutaku. The discovery of shakutaku {{was a result of}} Thunberg's anatomic knowledge and the Japanese' traditional medicine of neuronic moxibustion. Yet, he likewise brought back knowledge on Japan's religion and societal structure, thus boosting an increasing interest into Japan, an early cultural form of Japonism.|$|E

25|$|The {{early history}} of the LDS Church is shared with other {{denominations}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, who all regard Joseph Smith as the founder of their religious tradition. Smith gained a small following in the late 1820s as he was dictating the Book of Mormon, which he said was a translation of words found on the Golden Plates that had been buried {{near his home in}} western New York by an indigenous American prophet. Smith said he had been in contact with an angel Moroni, who <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> plates' location and had been grooming him for a role as a religious leader.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} a sail or balloon tip {{modification}} of Ronald Bradley's simple portex tubing method came about from Swan's observation from the Laguna Beach CA shore of sail boats on the water on a relatively calm day. Boats with conventional slot sails were still; one with a spinnaker {{was able to make}} reasonable headway. The concept of using thermodilution to measure cardiac output was originally the idea of Arnost Fronek. As a former colleague of Fronek, Ganz added the thermistor modification after Swan <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> initial balloon design, which was fabricated by Edwards Laboratories, which had previously contracted with Swan as a consultant.|$|E
25|$|Coincidentally, one of Marie's defense lawyers, Maître Paillet, {{was also}} the lawyer of the renowned {{toxicologist}} Mathieu Orfila, who was the acknowledged expert of the Marsh test in France. He realized that as the case hinged largely on the tests made by the Brive doctors, Paillet wrote to Orfila and <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> test results. Orfila then submitted an affidavit stating that the tests were conducted so ignorantly that they meant nothing. As soon as the Brive doctors testified that arsenic was present in Lafarge's body, Paillet read the affidavit aloud, told the court about the Marsh test, and demanded that Orfila be called.|$|E

25|$|The {{deciding}} {{game for}} the Group F runners-up place, Croatia vs. Australia, saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly issue three yellow cards to Croatian Josip Šimunić before sending him off. Šimunić was shown a yellow card by Poll in the 61st minute for a foul on Australian Harry Kewell. In the 90th minute, Poll held up a yellow card in front of Šimunić for a foul, but did not follow it with a red card, as is required upon a second yellow card. In the 93rd minute, after Poll had blown the final whistle, Šimunić approached Poll angrily {{and gave him a}} push. Poll thus issued Šimunić with a 3rd yellow card and also <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> red card.|$|E
25|$|On 2 October Hindenburg {{told the}} Kaiser’s Crown Council that Germany {{could no longer}} win a {{military}} victory, and the following day a new government was formed under Prince Max, which approached President Wilson for peace based on the Fourteen Points. When Haig met Foch on 6 October, Foch <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> newspaper reports of this and {{told him it was}} {{a direct result of the}} BEF breach of the Hindenburg Line at its strongest point, although the almost simultaneous capitulation of Bulgaria was also a factor and discussions would continue for a month until the ceasefire on 11 November. At the meeting Haig again asked for US divisions for his sector, and was told this was not going to happen.|$|E
25|$|That evening, the CIA {{notified}} the Department of State and at 8:30pm EDT, Bundy chose {{to wait until}} the next morning to tell the President. McNamara was briefed at midnight. The next morning, Bundy met with Kennedy and <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> U-2 photographs and briefed him on the CIA's analysis of the images. At 6:30pm EDT, Kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisors, in a group he formally named the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) after the fact on October 22 by the National Security Action Memorandum 196. Without informing the members of EXCOMM, President Kennedy tape recorded all of their proceedings, and Sheldon M. Stern, head of the Kennedy library transcribed some of them.|$|E
