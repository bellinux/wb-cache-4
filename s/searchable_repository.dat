40|$|Abstract: Finding and {{accessing}} suitable {{information in}} the open and distributed environments of current Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) is a crucial task. Catalogues provide <b>searchable</b> <b>repositories</b> of information descriptions, but the mechanisms to support the tasks of discovery and retrieval are still insufficient. Problems of semantic heterogeneity caused by synonyms and homonyms can arise during free-text search in catalogues. Moreover, once a suitable Web Feature Service (WFS) is found and accessed, the property names of a feature are often difficult to interpret. This paper introduces an architecture for ontology-based discovery and retrieval of geographic information that solves semantic heterogeneity problems of current query capabilities. Based on a (real-world) scenario from the area of flood management, the application of our approach shows that the information requestor can be efficiently supported. ...|$|R

The access to billions of binary relations among named entities would enable new search paradigms and alternative methods for presenting the search results. A first concrete step towards building large <b>searchable</b> <b>repositories</b> of factual knowledge is to derive such knowledge automatically at large scale from textual documents. Generalized contextual extraction patterns allow for fast iterative progression towards extracting one million facts of a given type (e. g., Person-BornIn-Year) from 100 million Web documents of arbitrary quality. The extraction starts from as few as 10 seed facts, requires no additional input knowledge or annotated text, and emphasizes scale and coverage by avoiding the use of syntactic parsers, named entity recognizers, gazetteers, and similar text processing tools and resources...|$|R

The Iraq Local Governance Program (LGP III), a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded project implemented by RTI International, originally developed this library to clarify the relationship between the federal government and local governments of Iraq. The LGP III Law Library Team worked to compile an extensive law library, gathering Arabic copies of ministerial directives that have been enacted into law (statutes), administrative directives, administrative regulation, executive orders, and court cases relevant to the sub national government in Iraq, and then uploading the documents to the website. Selected English translations were added that met the translation quality standards of the Law Library Team. The library is currently being maintained by volunteers.|$|E

40|$|Musical {{documents}} {{may contain}} heterogeneous {{information such as}} music symbols, text, staff lines, ornaments, annotations, and editorial data. Before any attempt at automatically recognizing the information on scores, it is usually necessary to detect and classify each constituent layer of information into different categories. The greatest obstacle of this classification process is the high heterogeneity among music collections, which {{makes it difficult to}} propose methods that can be generalizable to a broad range of sources. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning framework that focuses on extracting the different layers within musical documents by categorizing the image at pixel level. The main advantage of our approach is that it can be used regardless of the type of document provided, as long as training data is available. We illustrate some of the capabilities of the framework by showing examples of common tasks that are frequently performed on images of musical documents, for which our approach has shown promising performance. We believe our framework will allow the development of generalizable and scalable automatic music recognition systems from document images, thus facilitating the creation of large-scale browsable and <b>searchable</b> <b>repositories</b> of music documents...|$|R

Identification of functionally important binding {{regions of the}} protein is facilitated by structural similarity scores mapped to the query protein structure. PDB structures that have been aligned with a query protein may be rapidly retrieved from the ProBiS-Database, which is thus able to generate hypotheses concerning the roles of uncharacterized proteins. Presented with uncharacterized protein structure, ProBiS-Database can discern relationships between such a query protein and other better known proteins in the PDB. Fast access and a user-friendly graphical interface promote easy exploration of this database of over 420 million local structural alignments.

40|$|Translating {{knowledge}} of the genome into clinical applications will require the construction of large <b>searchable</b> <b>repositories</b> of phenotypic and genotypic information. These collections of DNA and biological information call for the sustained involvement {{of large numbers of}} research participants, and raise a host of difficult legal and ethical issues. Historically, the commercial value of medical records, bioinformation, and gene patents emerged after the regulatory structures of bioethics came into place. For some bioethicists and policy-makers, the norm of ‘benefit sharing’ has become a necessary corrective for a system seen to facilitate the appropriation of a valuable resource from research participants. While benefit sharing should be applauded insofar as it attempts to submit relations of biocapital to new claims of distributive justice, the project is likely to fail both as a normative and practical matter without greater attention to issues of procedural justice: in particular, the constitution of distributive agency over resources for genomic research. Governance mechanisms in human subjects research are often justified as protections of research subjects from potential harms, but they also tacitly order the power to make distributive decisions over valuable collections of informational, genetic, and social capital. Benefit sharing as a discourse tends to settle political questions of distributive agency—the power to make distributive choices—in ways that exclude research participants from governing the resources they help to create. The notion of ‘partnership governance’ presents a productive avenue for achieving a normative shift from ‘benefit sharing,’ a distributive value, to ‘power sharing,’ a procedural one. If implemented, partnership governance would empower participants to exert a share in distributive decision-making in return for contributing to the economic and social capital of the project. But it would also assign research participants with correlative obligations to other capital partners such as funders and researchers, and duties to uphold the charitable missions of biobanks. Legal principles and forms from within charitable trust law and corporate governance could help achieve ‘partnership governance,’ and address obvious challenges such as agency gaps and collective action problems...|$|R
