5000|$|It is very {{different}} from the hand lay-up process. The difference comes from the application of the fibre and resin material to the mould. <b>Spray-up</b> is an open-moulding composites fabrication process where resin and reinforcements are sprayed onto a reusable mould. The resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously [...] "chopped" [...] in a combined stream from a chopper gun. Workers roll out the <b>spray-up</b> to compact the laminate. Wood, foam, or other core material may then be added, and a secondary <b>spray-up</b> layer embeds the core between the laminates. The part is then cured, cooled, and removed from the mould.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process is}} not {{suitable}} for parts where dimensional accuracy and process repeatability are prime concerns. The <b>spray-up</b> process {{does not provide a}} good surface finish or dimensional control on both or all the sides of the product.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spray-Up</b> {{also known}} as chop method of {{creating}} fiberglass objects by spraying short strands of glass out of a pneumatic gun. This method is used often when {{one side of the}} finished product is not seen, or when large quantities of a product must be made cheaply and quickly without regards to strength. Corvette fenders and boat dinghies are commonly manufactured this way.|$|E
50|$|In {{the liquid}} state, {{unsaturated}} polyester resins may be processed by numerous methods, including Hand Layup, vacuum bag molding, and <b>spray-up</b> and compression molded Sheet Molding Compound (SMC). They {{can also be}} B-staged after application to chopped reinforcement and continuous reinforcement, to form pre-pregs. Solid molding compounds {{in the form of}} pellets or granules are also used in processes such as compression and transfer molding.|$|E
50|$|Core Molding Technologies {{specializes in}} large-format moldings and {{provides}} fiberglass processes, such as compression molding process (SMC, GMT), <b>spray-up,</b> hand lay-up, resin transfer molding (RTM), and reaction injection molding (RIM). Core Molding Technologies mainly produced fiber reinforced plastics and plastic composites such as shielding, vehicle roofs, hoods and so on. Besides, {{it also provides}} services for manufacturing and product development, such as custom material formulations, composite mold construction, design for manufacturability and so on.Next Generation Product Released: Core Molding Technologies' Featherlite® SMC Production Reaches 10,000,000 lbs.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{reinforcement}} {{material for}} this process is glass-fibre rovings, which are chopped to a length of 10 to 40 mm and then applied on the mould. For improved mechanical properties, a combination of fabric and chopped fibre layers is used. The most common material type is E-glass, but carbon and Kevlar rovings can also be used. Continuous strand mat, fabric, and various types of core materials are embedded by hand whenever required. The weight fraction of reinforcement in this process is typically 20 to 40% of the total weight of the part. The most common resin system used for the <b>spray-up</b> process is general purpose or DCDP polyester; isophthalic polyesters and vinylesters are also sometimes used. Fast-reacting resins with a pot life of 30 to 40 minutes are typical. The resin often contains {{a significant amount of}} filler. The most common fillers are calcium carbonates and aluminium trihydrates. In filled resin systems, fillers replace some of the reinforcements; 5 to 25% filler is used by weight.|$|E
50|$|Short fiber {{reinforced}} composites {{are used}} increasingly as a structural material {{because they provide}} superior mechanical properties and can be easily produced by the rapid, low-cost injection molding process, by extrusion and with <b>spray-up</b> technique. An important issue for short fiber thermoplastic composites is void formation and growth during production processes. It {{has been shown that}} voids tend to nucleate at fiber ends, and their content depends on processing conditions, fiber concentration, and fiber length. For example, in an injection molding process bubble growth is suppressed by cooling the material under pressure. Density measurements confirm a much lower void content (-1%) in the injection-molded samples in comparison with the extrudates. Another factor playing an important role in void formation is the cooling rate. While the melt is cooled external surface layers solidify first. These layers restrain the contraction of material within the melt. This leads to internal voiding. As a result, slower cooling rates decrease void content in the composite. Finally, {{it is interesting to note}} that in an extruded structure, longer fibers result in higher void contents. This unexpected behaviour is due to the overcoming of other factors like viscosity, extrusion pressure and shear rate, which make the analysis on this phenomenon very complicated.|$|E
40|$|Open {{contact molding}} {{processes}} in one-sided molds, such as <b>spray-up</b> or hand lay-up, {{are still the}} most commonly used processes for manufacturing fiberglass composite products. In this way, structures with good load-bearing capability are usually obtained, although defects may be also present in the laminate, often including non-uniform impregnation and insufficient dimensional control...|$|E
30|$|There are {{two basic}} {{processes}} for molding: hand layup method and <b>spray-up</b> method. The hand layup process {{is one of the}} oldest and simplest methods of fabrication. The process is most common in aramid fiber marine construction (Aiello et al. 2007). In hand layup method, liquid resin is placed along with aramid fiber beside finished surface. Chemical reaction of the resin hardens the material to a strong light weight product.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of polyester/fiberglass composites were studied. The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate the possibility of reusing the wastes taken from <b>spray-up</b> processing of Paraíba state Industries as reinforcement in polyester matrix composites. Composites with 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 wt. (%) of recycled fiberglass were prepared by compression molding and compared with polyester/ virgin glass fiber composites. The {{mechanical properties}} and water sorption behavior were evaluated. The results showed that fiberglass wastes are promising to be reused in polyester resin composites. The impact strength was excellent. It can be concluded that the reusing of the fiberglass wastes is viable...|$|E
40|$|Open {{contact molding}} {{processes}} in one-sided molds, such as <b>spray-up</b> or hand lay-up, {{are still the}} most commonly used processes for manufacturing fiberglass composite products. In this way, structures with good load-bearing capability are usually obtained, although defects may be also present in the laminate, often in-cluding non-uniform impregnation and insufficient di-mensional control. In cases when these defects have a reduced impact on the performance of the composite obtained, the low cost of manufacturing justifies the use of an open contact molding process. In adhesive joints, additional factors, such as adhesive characteristics, may also affect load-bearing capability. Some adhesives pro-vide an efficient bonding only when their thickness is small [1], while in some cases joint strength increase...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to enable large part or high volume manufacturing processes to make consumer or industrial products from a cork reinforced polymer composite, similar to current applications of glass reinforced polyester. The low initial investment and high flexibility of the spray lay-up process make it an attractive candidate to study. A spray lay-up apparatus was successfully constructed and employed in manufacturing parts from a hybrid material composed of granulated cork, chopped glass strand, and a polyester matrix. The material was tested for tensile and flexural properties following relevant ASTM standards. The material was found to have a tensile strength of 4. 4 MPa and tensile modulus of 850 MPa. The flexural strength and modulus were 9 MPa and 830 MPa, respectively. Adding a fiberglass skin to the cork hybrid significantly improved its flexural strength. Additionally, a small turbine blade prototype was created as a proof of concept. It is recommended that further work focus on optimizing the hybrid material's properties, re-designing and optimizing the apparatus used for the <b>spray-up</b> process, and demonstrating material viability by manufacturing a cross section of a large turbine blade. by Benjamin J.
