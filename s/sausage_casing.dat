5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no <b>sausage</b> <b>casing</b> used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the dish, which is standard in both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi kitchens. The basic ingredients of cholent are meat, potatoes, beans and barley. Sephardi-style hamin uses rice instead of beans and barley, and chicken instead of beef. A traditional Sephardi addition is whole eggs in the shell (huevos haminados), which turn brown overnight. [...] Ashkenazi cholent often contains kishke (a <b>sausage</b> <b>casing)</b> or helzel (a chicken neck skin stuffed with a flour-based mixture). Slow overnight cooking allows the flavors of the various ingredients to permeate and produces the characteristic taste of cholent.|$|E
5000|$|Holding devices: Holding {{devices in}} the field of sausage {{production}} are used for automatic sausage linking. A holding device comprises a rotating linking nozzle and an appropriate <b>sausage</b> <b>casing</b> brake. The movement of the linking nozzle is achieved by a drive integrated into the vacuum filler. The <b>sausage</b> <b>casing</b> brake ensures that the sausage casings are extracted evenly, thus creating equal portions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ripening}} process of fermented sausages {{is affected by}} diameter and type of <b>sausage</b> <b>casings,</b> and depends on changes in the microflora, important from hygienic and technological aspects. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the bacteriological status sausages which were stuffed in artificial collagen <b>sausage</b> <b>casings</b> of different diameters (35 mm and 60 mm) during ripening and drying. The sausage stuffing was the same, as was the uncontrolled ripening conditions. In bigger diameter sausages, significantly higher average total bacterial count, enterobacteria and lactic acid bacteria counts were found than in smaller diameter sausages...|$|R

50|$|Michael Flomen {{was born}} in Montreal, Quebec to his father, Eddy Flomen, {{who worked in the}} natural <b>sausage</b> <b>casing</b> {{business}} and his mother, Dorothy Flomen (née Gendreau). Flomen had a workshop in his youth where he built flying model airplanes and eventually underwater camera housings for his film equipment. Flomen inherited his film and photography equipment from his father Eddy who had aspirations to work as a photographer in the early 1940s. Eddy chose not to pursue photography after the passing of his own father and began to work in the <b>sausage</b> <b>casing</b> business in order to provide for his family. From 1969-1971 Flomen attended Darrow School located on the site of an historic Shaker village in the Taconic Mountains, west of the central Berkshires in New Lebanon, New York.|$|E
5000|$|Fresh smoked {{sausages}} {{are fresh}} sausages that are smoked and cured. They do not normally require refrigeration {{and do not}} require any further cooking before eating. Examples include Mettwurst and Teewurst which are meat preparations packed in <b>sausage</b> <b>casing</b> but squeezed out of it (just like any other spread from a tube).|$|E
50|$|Casing, <b>sausage</b> <b>casing,</b> or sausage skin is the {{material}} that encloses the filling of a sausage. Casings are divided into two categories, natural and artificial. Artificial casings, such as collagen, cellulose, plastic, and extruded casings, are relatively new to the field, mainly borne of market demand during the technological advances of the early 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Nylon 6 and nylon 12 food {{packaging}} materials used as <b>sausage</b> <b>casings</b> are typically exposed to fatty food {{on one side}} and boiling water on the other during the cooking process. To simulate the migration behaviour under these conditions, a special migration cell was constructed and filled with olive oil {{on one side of the}} polymer and water on the other to find out what amounts of the migrants will transfer to either side and phase at 100 degreesC. Results show that when a nylon 6 film is exposed to the conditions as described above, total mass transfer of the monomer-caprolactam-into the water phase occurs after 2 h at 100 degreesC. Nylon 12 <b>sausage</b> <b>casings</b> release similar amounts of their monomer-laurolactam-into both the aqueous and oil phase. An existing computer migration model was adapted to simulate the situation of simultaneous two-sided migration applying previously determined diffusion and partitioning coefficients. The suitability of the model was confirmed by experimental data...|$|R
50|$|It is {{primarily}} created in foods by protein hydrolysis by adding hydrochloric acid at high temperature {{to speed up}} the breakdown of proteins into amino acids. Under these conditions, chloride can react with the glycerol backbone of lipids to produce 3-MCPD. 3-MCPD can also occur in foods which have been in contact with materials containing epichlorohydrin-based wet-strength resins which are used in the production of some tea bags and <b>sausage</b> <b>casings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bracell {{produces}} both specialty-grade and rayon-grade dissolving {{wood pulp}} from its subsidiary in Brazil, Bahia Specialty Cellulose (BSC) [...] using wood resources grown {{from its own}} eucalyptus plantations.

50|$|By {{changing}} the hole plate {{it is also}} possible to produce breadcrumbs or fill <b>sausage</b> <b>casing.</b> After the drop from the retainer, it is possible to change the hole plate. By removing the fixing screw the grinder can be disassembled completely for cleaning. Besides the domestic manually or motor operated grinders, there are also grinders for butchery (table- or shop-grinders for example) and for the food industry. Some large machines are able to produce several tons per hour.|$|E
5000|$|Clippers: Clippers for the {{production}} of portioned sausages are used in conjunction with vacuum fillers. The filling product is taken from the vacuum filler and through a filling pipe connected to the clipper and an appropriate <b>sausage</b> <b>casing</b> brake, where it is portioned into appropriate casings. The portion is then sealed by the clipper with the aid of metal clips. Sometimes, loops for hanging the portions are also attached simultaneously. Strings of sausages as well as individual portions can be produced.|$|E

Plaschkes attended Bishop Wordsworth's School, where William Golding was amongst his teachers; many of his contemporaries have claimed that he was in fact the inspiration for the sensitive, overweight character of Piggy in Golding's Lord of the Flies, a claim which Golding never confirmed or denied.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>sausage</b> <b>casings</b> {{were made}} of the cleaned intestines, or stomachs {{in the case of}} haggis and other {{traditional}} puddings. Today, however, natural casings are often replaced by collagen, cellulose, or even plastic casings, {{especially in the case of}} industrially manufactured sausages. Some forms of sausage, such as sliced sausage, are prepared without a casing. Additionally, luncheon meat and sausage meat are now available without casings in tin cans and jars.|$|R
5000|$|Except for heart, tongue (beef), liver (chicken, beef, or pork), and {{intestines}} used {{as natural}} <b>sausage</b> <b>casings,</b> organ meats {{consumed in the}} U.S. tend to be regional or ethnic specialities; for example, tripe as menudo or mondongo among Latinos and Hispanos, chitterlings in the Southern United States, scrapple on the Eastern Seaboard, fried-brain sandwiches in the Midwest, and beef testicles called Rocky Mountain oysters or [...] "prairie oysters" [...] in the west.|$|R
50|$|Natural <b>sausage</b> <b>casings</b> {{are made}} from the sub-mucosa, a layer of the {{intestine}} that consists mainly of naturally occurring collagen. This {{should not be confused}} with collagen casings, which are artificially processed from collagen derived from the skins of cattle. Natural casings are derived from the intestinal tract of farmed animals, are edible and bear a close resemblance to the original intestine after processing. The outer fat and the inner mucosa lining are removed during processing.|$|R
5000|$|Saumagen is a German dish {{popular in}} the Palatinate. The name means [...] "sow's stomach". The dish {{is similar to a}} sausage in that it {{consists}} of a stuffed casing; however, the stomach itself is integral to the dish. It isn't as thin as a typical <b>sausage</b> <b>casing</b> (intestines or artificial casing). Rather it is meat-like, being a strong muscular organ, and when the dish is finished by being pan-fried or roasted in the oven, it becomes crisp. The dish is somewhat similar to the Scottish haggis, although the stuffing is quite different.|$|E

50|$|Several {{varieties}} of usban exist, and the {{herbs and spices}} used can vary but typically include cayenne pepper, black pepper, turmeric and cinnamon, as well as dried mint, parsley and dill. This is added to spring onion, tomato, vegetable oil and rice. The mixture is stuffed into sheep's intestines or commercial <b>sausage</b> <b>casings</b> and then tied off at the ends using thread. The sausages cook for an hour in a pot and are then browned in a frying pan or oven.|$|R
50|$|The {{domestic}} pig is mostly used for its meat, pork. Other food products made from pigs include pork <b>sausage</b> (<b>casings</b> {{made from the}} intestines), bacon, gammon, ham and pork scratchings (cracklings or rinds). The head of a pig {{can be used to}} make a preserved jelly called head cheese (sometimes known as brawn). Liver, chitterlings, blood (for blood pudding or black pudding), and other offal from pigs are also widely used for food. In some religions, such as Judaism and Islam, pork is a taboo food.|$|R
