25|$|The {{spouting}} flames {{from the}} Flame Barge {{are reduced to}} a low sputter, and the Earth Globe appears and moves towards {{the center of the}} lagoon accompanied with water effects emanating from the fountain barges. As the Earth cools, it changes from hot white to red to blue. Images appear on the Globe of countries, famous landmarks, objects, and people. The exterior buildings of the countries around the lagoon are illuminated followed by laser lights, <b>spot</b> <b>lights,</b> and more fireworks in the center lagoon. Since the buildings of the Morocco Pavilion are replicas of buildings that have great religious significance, the lights on the pavilion do not light up during IllumiNations. In order to keep symmetry, the Norway Pavilion does not light up either. The scene includes high-launch fireworks.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} single, Chisuga {{appeared}} on several {{radio stations in}} Japan including Rajira Sunday and Hiroshi Kamiya's All Night radio show through Nippon Broadcasting System. She also held a live event to promote the single in Osaka, Japan, May 2015. Then throughout early-mid May 2016, Chisuga visited the Japanese music store Animate in cities Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Sannomiya, and Osaka, and signed autographs. She then followed up by visiting stores Namba Shop and Akiba Sofmap in Japan. On July 9, Chisuga will perform [...] "Ai no Uta (Words of Love)" [...] for the first time, {{in order to promote}} the single. An accompanying music video was directed by Nozomi Tanaka. It was shot in an aquarium, and included Chisuga sitting down and observing several fishes. Along with this, she was surrounded by several glow lights and <b>spot</b> <b>lights.</b> It was released on YouTube by Victor Entertainment, Chisuga's parent label, and premiered through Japanese music television on April 8, 2016.|$|E

2500|$|In {{additive}} color mixing, the total light present {{is simply the}} sum of individual light sources. For example, coincident blue and red spotlights on a surface will make a purple, brighter than either of the spotlights alone. Additive mixing of coincident <b>spot</b> <b>lights</b> was applied in the experiments used to derive the CIE 1931 [...] colorspace. The original monochromatic primaries of the (arbitrary) wavelengths of 435.8nm (violet), 546.1nm (green) and 700nm (red) were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work.|$|E
2500|$|Moving head {{fixtures}} {{are often}} divided into spot, wash lights and beam lights. They vary in use and functions, but many companies offer profile and wash {{versions of the}} same model of light. Profile lights generally contain features like gobos and prisms, whereas wash lights have simpler optics and a wider beam aperture resulting in wider beam angle, which may be altered by internal lenses or “frost effects”. Wash lights {{are more likely to have}} CMY colour mixing although it is common for high-end <b>spot</b> <b>lights</b> to have such features too.|$|E
2500|$|Possibly {{the best}} known special edition was the [...] "Tomb Raider" [...] of 2000, built to commemorate Land Rover's role in the first film of that franchise. The Tomb Raider was {{designed}} {{to look like an}} off-road expedition vehicle. Painted dark metallic grey with special badging and details, the Tomb Raider came equipped with a roof rack and roof rack support system (looking similar to a roll-cage), additional <b>spot</b> <b>lights,</b> winch, bull-bar and raised air-intake. They were available either as a 90 or a 110 double cab, with standard Td5 engines. The Defender actually used in the film (now on display at the Motor Heritage Centre, Gaydon) was a highly modified 110 HCPU with a specially fitted and tuned V8 petrol engine and a non-standard interior.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most famous}} escapee was the Boer {{prisoner}} of war Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne who was {{serving a life sentence}} for [...] "conspiracy against the British government and on (the charge of) espionage.". On the night of 25 June 1902, Duquesne slipped out of his tent, worked his way over a barbed-wire fence, swam 1.5 miles (2.4km) past patrol boats and bright <b>spot</b> <b>lights,</b> through storm-wracked, using the distant Gibbs Hill Lighthouse for navigation until he arrived ashore on the main island. From there he escaped to the port of St. George's and a week later, he stowed away on a boat heading to Baltimore, Maryland. He settled in the US and later became a spy for Germany in both World Wars. He claimed to be responsible for the 1916 death of Lord Herbert Kitchener in the sinking of HMS Hampshire, the head of the British Army who had also commanded British forces in South Africa during the second Boer War, but this had resulted from a mine. In 1942, Col. Duquesne was arrested by the FBI for leading the Duquesne Spy Ring, which still to this day the largest espionage case {{in the history of the}} United States.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{automated}} light calibration pipeline for free-form acquisition of shape and reflectance of objects using common off-the-shelf illuminators, such as LED lights, {{that can be}} placed arbitrarily close to the objects. We acquire multiple digital photographs of the studied object shot from a stationary camera. In each photograph, a light is freely positioned around the object in order to cover {{a wide variety of}} illumination directions. While common free-form acquisition approaches are based on the simplifying assumptions that the light sources are either sufficiently far from the object that all incoming light can be modeled using parallel rays, or that lights are local points emitting uniformly in space, we use the more realistic model of a scene lit by a moving local <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> with exponential fall-off depending on the cosine of the angle between the <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> optical axis and the illumination direction, raised {{to the power of the}} spot exponent. We recover all <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> parameters using a multipass numerical method. First, light positions are determined using standard methods used in photometric stereo approaches. Then, we exploit measures taken on a Lambertian reference planar object to recover the <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> exponent and the per-image <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> optical axis; we minimize the difference between the observed reflectance and the reflectance synthesized by using the near-field Lambertian equation. The optimization is performed in two passes, first generating a starting solution and then refining it using a Levenberg-Marquardt iterative minimizer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method based on an error analysis performed on analytical datasets, as well as on real-world experiments.

50|$|The {{music video}} of the song (directed by Marc Webb) begins with lead singer/guitarist, Claudio Sanchez, in a cabin in the woods. He is shown setting up alarms and booby traps such as trip wires and <b>spot</b> <b>lights</b> outside the cabin and {{constructing}} a fence to surround the cabin. All the while he sees fellow band members Travis Stever, Michael Todd, and Josh Eppard, only to suddenly close his eyes and then they are gone. Claudio is then shown sitting in a store room surrounded by shelves of canned food, batteries, and bottled water, eating Campbell's soup from the can.
