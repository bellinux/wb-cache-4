40|$|The {{results from}} several reviews have been {{presented}} and the aspects of road safety associated with intelligent transport systems (ITS) applications have been addressed. The attempt {{is to make a}} state-of-the-art regarding effects <b>on</b> <b>accidents</b> by categorising systems according to levels of evaluations methods that have been applied. These categories are effects on behaviour, effects <b>on</b> <b>accidents</b> by proxy/surrogate methods, accident studies from real traffic, effects <b>on</b> <b>accident</b> types and finally by meta-analysis where weighted estimates of effects <b>on</b> <b>accidents</b> can be calculated. Thirty-three IT systems including driver assistance systems/advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle information systems, in-vehicle data-collection systems and road telematics have been listed. Effects based on meta-analysis are estimated for 11 systems, and single accident studies are found for an additional 2 systems. For the remaining 20 systems, no studies from real road traffic have been identified. Effects <b>on</b> <b>accidents</b> of antilocking brake systems and electronic stability control (ESC) are presented in more detail according to their effects <b>on</b> certain <b>accident</b> types. ESC appears to be very efficient in reducing the number of accidents. Behavioural adaptations to ITS are considered and discussed, especially in terms of compensation mechanisms. Four hypotheses regarding prediction of effects <b>on</b> <b>accidents</b> are stated according to whether systems increase or decrease 'windows of opportunities' by calling upon a driver behaviour model where emotions play a central role. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007...|$|R
40|$|The Netherlands Railways NS {{intends to}} {{increase}} the maximum speed of trains on certain railway sections from 140 to 160 km/h. Higher speeds mean a greater chance <b>on</b> <b>accidents,</b> in particular of collisions with traffic on level crossings, but also a greater chance on derailments of trains. It is intended to avoid this risk by taking compensating measures, especially regarding the safety of level crossings. In this context, {{the policy of the}} NS is that unprotected level crossings or crossings with automatic flashing light installations (AKI's) will not occur on future 160 km/h railway sections anymore. They will be replaced by automatic half-sized barriers (AHOB's) or by multi-level intersections. AHOB's are considered to be safer than unprotected level crossings and AKI's. Compared with AHOB's, multi-level intersections are safer, but more expensive. The Dutch Council for Traffic Safety has ordered SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research to investigate how much these additional costs can be justified by higher <b>savings</b> <b>on</b> damage caused by accidents and favourable side-effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this traffic safety investigation was to find critical road sections using Post- and Pre-accident analysis approaches. The Post-accident approach analyzes the effect of road geometric characteristics <b>on</b> <b>accident</b> rate. The study was based <b>on</b> <b>accident</b> and road maintenance data in Western Sweden. A total of 2912 accidents from 2000 to 2005 on 1615 km median-separated roads was collected and combined with road characteristics (Speed, carriageway width, AADT, vertical and horizontal alignments, superelevation) for analysis (Post-accident approach). The statistical analysis showed that road characteristics have great effect <b>on</b> <b>accident</b> ratio (A...|$|R
