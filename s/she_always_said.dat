25|$|Princess Galyani Vadhana was {{interested}} in history and archaeology for many years. She thought these fields to be the foundations of other subjects and believed in applying reasoning to support historical ideas. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that her thoughts were not always correct and she would accept new data if supported by reason and evidences.|$|E
2500|$|Dana recounting her family's {{reaction}} to her marrying a white man: [...] "I think my aunt accepts {{the idea of}} my marrying you because any children we have will be light. Lighter than I am, anyway. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> I {{was a little too}} ‘highly visible’ ...She doesn’t care much for white people but she prefers light-skinned blacks. Figure that out. Anyway, she ‘forgives’ me for you. But my uncle doesn’t. he’s sort of taken this personally...it’s as though I’ve rejected him...he was more hurt than mad. Honestly hurt….he wants me to marry someone like him—someone who looks like him. A black man." [...] (Kindred, p. 111) ...|$|E
60|$|Amy. Yes, sir; <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> she {{believed}} you were alive, {{because she thought}} she should have heard something of you {{if you had been}} dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure {{of their}} approval. Father {{will do what}} mother says, and <b>she</b> has <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> would never {{interfere}} with me in--in--such a thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That <b>she</b> <b>always</b> does,' <b>said</b> Jane. 'On Friday we had {{an uproar}} in the schoolroom about her hemming, and on Saturday she tumbled into a wet ditch, and tore her bonnet in the brambles; on Sunday, she twisted her ancles {{together}} at church.' ...|$|R
60|$|Matilda {{heard and}} understood. 'So that's your big idea, is it, my little man,' {{she said to}} herself. <b>She</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> of Hadrian {{that he had no}} proper respect for anybody or anything, that he was sly and common. She went down to the kitchen for a sotto voce confab with Emmie.|$|R
60|$|They spoke much {{during those}} {{days of the}} coming parting, and <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that she could bear it if she saw him go away more of a man than he had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am ready}} for any thing," [...] <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> with a {{resolute}} air {{after one of}} these visits; but, when the time seemed to have come she was not so ready as she fancied.|$|E
60|$|ELLIE [dropping her hands]. How strange! that my mother, {{who knew}} {{nothing at all}} about business, should have been quite right about you! <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> not before papa, of course, but to us children--that you were just that sort of man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes. I say, 'gentleman,' {{although}} he's in {{the variety}} profession. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> said," [...] <b>said</b> Sol, quietly looking at Rand, [...] "that she'd never marry OUT of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is what <b>she</b> <b>always</b> was," [...] <b>said</b> Norman, {{anxious to}} silence him; [...] "but it is {{unreasonable}} {{to think of}} it. She is all but engaged to Sir Henry Walkinghame." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Dame Catherine {{stated that}} she {{supported}} a New Zealand republic [...] "in principle" [...] {{and when she}} was Governor-General, had discussed the issue of republicanism with the Queen: [...] "She is quite sanguine about these things. <b>She</b> has <b>always</b> <b>said</b> it is a decision for New Zealand to make, and 'whatever decision New Zealand makes, of course we would accept it'." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus Baptista had sense {{enough to}} see the retributive {{fairness}} of this issue. For some time, whenever conversation arose between her and Heddegan, which was not often, <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said,</b> 'I am miserable, and you know it. Yet I don't wish things to be otherwise.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yep. She went loco. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> {{the heat}} of the cooking would get her, and it did. Pulled a gun on me one day and ran away with some Siwashes in a canoe. Caught a blow up the coast and all hands drowned.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Secretly Wendy sympathised {{with them}} a little, but she was far too loyal a {{housewife}} to listen to any complaints against father. 'Father knows best,' <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said,</b> whatever her private opinion must be. Her private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.|$|E
60|$|The displeasure of {{the former}} lady was in no measure abated by this communication; in which, indeed, she {{affected}} to take very little interest. She pleaded her religious duties, and her want of knowledge of secular affairs, if she should chance to mistake the usages of the world; yet <b>she</b> had <b>always,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> understood, that the guardians of the young and beautiful of her own sex were chosen from the more mature of the other.|$|R
6000|$|The {{event at}} the Rectory was {{expected}} every moment. The Rector, who practically never suffered, disliked the thought and sight of others' suffering. Up to this day, indeed, there had been none to dislike, for in answer to inquiries his wife had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> [...] "No, dear, no; I'm all right--really, it's nothing." [...] And <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> it smiling, even when her smiling lips were white. But this morning in trying to say it she had failed to smile. Her eyes had lost their hopelessly hopeful shining, and sharply between her teeth she said: [...] "Send for Dr. Wilson, Russell." ...|$|R
50|$|On 4 November 2015, Wolff {{announced}} on the BBC {{that she was}} retiring from Formula One racing, citing that <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> would go when {{she felt that she}} could go no further; she felt that she had gone {{as far as she could}} go, but expressed intentions to help other women in motor racing. However, she stated that she would compete in the 2015 Race of Champions at the end of November for Scotland with former F1 driver David Coulthard and would subsequently retire from all forms of motorsport.|$|R
60|$|Ethel and her able assistants {{were happy}} with excitement. Upon the now {{demoralized}} stage they were receiving congratulations from throngs of friends. Ethel stood like a delighted child between {{her father and}} the rector, when Mrs. Sanderson approached to utter the pretty things <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> so well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew Suzette {{would do}} that!" [...] said Louise. [...] "Before that letter came out <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> {{that her father}} never did what the papers said. But that cut the ground from under her feet, and such a girl could have no peace till she had given up everything--everything!" ...|$|E
60|$|She was repeating {{a remark}} {{that she had}} made at Lympne, that <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> her {{children}} needed opportunities, as other people needed air, when she was abruptly arrested by the entry of Helen. They hung on a pause, Helen perhaps surprised by Kipps' weekday magnificence. Then she advanced with outstretched hand.|$|E
2500|$|Gomes {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the Portuguese government's reluctance to comply with the European Parliament Commission investigation into the CIA flights, leading to tensions with Foreign Minister Luís Amado, a member of her party. She said she had no doubt that illegal flights were frequently permitted during the Durão Barroso (2002–2004) and Santana Lopes (2004–2005) governments, and that [...] "during the [...] government of José Sócrates, 24 flights which passed through Portuguese territory" [...] are documented. She expressed satisfaction {{with the opening of the}} investigation, but emphasized that <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> a parliamentary inquiry would also be necessary.|$|R
6000|$|Tommy {{looked at}} him curiously for a minute, {{as though he were}} about to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her {{intention}} of marrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire had given her the chance--and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was out for money. <b>She</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> so. Why blame her because she had been true to her creed? ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Nupkins was {{a majestic}} female {{in a pink}} gauze turban and a light brown wig. Miss Nupkins possessed all her mamma's haughtiness without the turban, and all her ill-nature without the wig; and {{whenever}} the exercise of these two amiable qualities involved mother and daughter in some unpleasant dilemma, as they not infrequently did, they both concurred in laying the blame {{on the shoulders of}} Mr. Nupkins. Accordingly, when Mr. Nupkins sought Mrs. Nupkins, and detailed the communication which had been made by Mr. Pickwick, Mrs. Nupkins suddenly recollected that <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> expected something of the kind; that <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> it would be so; that her advice was never taken; that she really did not know what Mr. Nupkins supposed she was; and so forth.|$|R
60|$|When the Princess saw {{all these}} things, and remembered what had happened, she, too, {{fell into the}} deepest sadness, which {{surprised}} and alarmed the whole Court, and the Queen more than anyone else. A hundred times she asked Bellissima if anything was the matter with her; but <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that there was nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Things {{have changed}} {{a great deal}} since I was a curate," [...] said the Vicar presently. [...] "In my young days the mourners used always {{to be given a}} pair of black gloves and a piece of black silk for their hats. Poor Louisa used to make the silk into dresses. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that twelve {{funerals}} gave her a new dress." ...|$|E
6000|$|DON JUAN. Yes; {{but even}} my coxcombry pleased. Well, I {{found that when}} I had touched a woman's imagination, she {{would allow me to}} persuade myself that she loved me; but when my suit was granted she never said [...] "I am happy: my love is satisfied": <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said,</b> first, [...] "At last, the {{barriers}} are down," [...] and second, [...] "When will you come again?" ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{came to my}} mother's bedside she was {{wandering}} and I {{saw that}} she could not live long. In a little while, however, her mind cleared so that she knew me and tears of joy ran down her pale cheeks because I had returned before she died. She reminded me that <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> would find a grave in Ethiopia, and asked to be buried and not kept above ground in crystal, as was the custom there. Then she said that she had been dreaming of my father and of me; also that she did not think that I need fret myself overmuch about Amada, since she was sure that before long I should kiss her on the lips.|$|R
50|$|After the Houston show, Jane Howze from Culture Map Houston gave a {{positive}} review, believing that The Truth About Love show {{was poised to}} be 2013's concert of the year. <b>She</b> added:I have <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that Chris Martin, frontman of Coldplay is the hardest working entertainer around, but I’m reconsidering, and now I’m giving Pink the nod. A Pink concert {{is a little like}} a Cirque du Soleil performance. There is so much happening on stage—the songs, the dancing and of course the acrobatics—it is a feast for the senses.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not easy}} to know how to answer; Albinia was scornful of the sofa-cover, and yet it was hard to lay hold of a {{tangible}} subject on which to show Lucy her error, except in the concealment, which, by her own showing, she had lamented the whole time. <b>She</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> no, but, unluckily, her noes were of the kind that might easily be made to mean yes, and she evidently had been led on partly by her own heart, partly by the force of the stronger will, though her better principles had filled her with scruples and misgivings at every stage. She had been often on the point of telling all, and asking forgiveness; and here it painfully crossed Albinia, that if she herself had been less hurried, and less disposed to take everything for granted, a little tenderness might have led to a voluntary confession.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE (to DR. JONATHAN). If I was a man, I'd {{have been}} a doctor, like you. Sick people don't bother me, I give myself to 'em. Before mother died, when she was sick, <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> I'd ought to {{have been a}} nurse. (A pause.) Well, I guess I'll go along. The foreman only give me a couple of days off to see the old home town.|$|E
6000|$|That night, for {{the first}} time, she {{mentioned}} her father's name in her prayers. She never forgot to do so afterwards. <b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "bless mother--and father," [...] with an instinctive pause between the two names--a pause which indicated new realization of the tragedy which had sundered them. And the tone in which she said [...] "father" [...] was softer and more tender than the one which voiced [...] "mother." ...|$|E
60|$|The only clever thing Mrs. Clibborn {{had done}} in her life was to {{acknowledge}} to old age at thirty, and then she did not mean it. It {{had been one of}} her methods in flirtation, covering all excesses under a maternal aspect. She must have told hundreds of young officers that she was old enough to be their mother; and <b>she</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> it looking plaintively at the ceiling, when they squeezed her hand.|$|E
6000|$|Margaret flushed up. [...] "Oh, no, I cannot!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>always</b> timid, and {{slightly}} defective in moral courage. She looked so nervous and {{shaken by the}} bare idea of a remonstrance with Flora, that Ethel could not press her; and, though convinced that her representation would be useless, she owned that her conscience would rest better after she had spoken. [...] "But there is Flora, walking in the garden with Norman," [...] she said. [...] "No doubt he is doing it." ...|$|R
500|$|By 1564 Dudley had {{realised}} {{that his}} chances of becoming Elizabeth's consort were small. At {{the same time he}} could not [...] "consider ... without great repugnance", as he said, that she chose another husband. Confronted with other marriage projects, Elizabeth continued to say that she still would very much like to marry him. Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid-1560s and later. To remove this threat to Habsburg and Valois suitors, between 1565 and 1578, four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester, as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects. These he had and would continue to sabotage. In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry, recalling that <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> so since <b>she</b> was eight years old; but he still was hopeful—she had also assured him he would be her choice in case she changed her mind (and married an Englishman).|$|R
6000|$|This took {{something}} more than a week, which could not all be spent in Mrs. Lander's company, much as she wished it. There were hours which he gave to going about in a gondola with Clementina, whom he forbade to be always at the invalid's side. He tried to reassure her as to Mrs. Lander's health, when he found her rather mute and absent, while they drifted in the silvery sun of the late April weather, just beginning to be warm, but not warm enough yet for the tent of the open gondola. He asked her about Mrs. Lander's family, and Clementina could only tell him that <b>she</b> had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> had none. She told him the story of her own relation to her, and he said, [...] "Yes, I heard something of that from Miss Milray." [...] After a moment of silence, during which he looked curiously into the girl's eyes, [...] "Do you think you can bear a little more care, Miss Claxon?" ...|$|R
