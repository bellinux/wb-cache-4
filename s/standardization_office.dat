40|$|Networks in {{the area}} of factory automation, named field-buses, have been {{developed}} to fulfill real-time requirements. However, they can only cover areas such as factory halls or buildings. This paper describes a model for a internetworking unit connecting field-buses via ATM networks, in order to break these limits. A remote bridge is used to span longer distances between field-bus components in a separated field-bus. The second version of a bridge acts like a multiport bridge connecting several independent field-buses. The emphasis is laid on the investigation to the quality of service requirements the transport channel provided by the ATM network has to meet. By means of the wide spread field-bus PROFIBUS, standardized by the German <b>standardization</b> <b>office,</b> the implications for real-time applications and the system behavior are considered. 1 INTRODUCTION Communication networks are used for very different purposes.

40|$|International audienceInnovation must be {{supported}} by a mindset shift, and cannot be reduced to innovation labs or creativity rooms with fancy furniture, writable walls, adding innovation as a company value, or launching innovation challenges. Those will generate buzz, not a sustainable innovation mindset. Culture is something you need to support, enable, and maintain. In 90 's; quality culture has been spread in the whole industry value chain through ISO 9001 standards. This set of standards has defined what quality means, which are the core principles and how to structure the quality system. ISO 9001 has been embraced and deployed across many organizations, this standard proved to be instrumental in quality culture dissemination. Innovation management needs the same visibility and the same culture development in today's organization. The future ISO standards on innovation management (ISO 50500 series) is presented in this paper, and their expected impact on building an innovation culture is motivated. ISO 50500 series stems from the 2013 ISO Technical committee on innovation management that has been created under the impulsion of AFNOR (French <b>standardization</b> <b>office).</b> The scope of this technical committee has been approved by its members in 2014 : " Standardization of terminology tools and methods and interactions between relevant parties to enable innovation.

40|$|Wireless Trondheim is {{a company}} {{offering}} city-wide Wi-Fi network in Trondheim, seeking new ways to utilize the Wi-Fi network {{to increase the number}} of services offered, and also increasing the profits and total revenues. Payment cards are very popular in Norway, and merchants such as cafés or restaurants, or merchants at temporary events, may want to use wireless payment terminal in order to provide a convenient and easy way for customers to pay for their purchases. This thesis will address the technical and commercial potential of using payment terminal within Wireless Trondheim's Wi-Fi network. A study of the technical potential of using payment terminals within Wireless Trondheim's Wi-Fi network reveals two companies importing and configuring payment terminals in Norway, and that currently two terminals exist with Wi-Fi support. However, the security related to using terminals with Wi-Fi is not yet approved by the Banks' <b>Standardization</b> <b>Office,</b> which means that it is not possible to use payment terminals with Wi-Fi until the security has been approved. The test of a payment terminal in Wireless Trondheim's Wi-Fi network was not possible to conduct for the same security reasons. Among the two existing payment terminals with Wi-Fi, only one is available in Norway. This terminal is produced by Banksys and is called Xentissimo, and supports both GPRS, GSM and Wi-Fi. Ingenico 7810 is the other existing payment terminal with Wi-Fi, but this terminal does not have any other wireless communication option. A cost comparison of the different wireless payment access alternatives from the perspective of a merchant shows that Netcom GPRS is currently the cheapest alternative. Telenor GPRS is the second cheapest alternatives for low estimates of number of terminals and transactions for a typical café in Trondheim, while Ventelo broadband Point of Sale is the second cheapest alternative for a similar high estimate. Based on this comparison, a competitive and attractive price for the service offered by Wireless Trondheim has been determined and used to calculate revenues in the business model proposal. The business model proposal provided in this study is based on the high level elements of Osterwalder's Business Model Ontology. The model explains how Wireless Trondheim, in cooperation with the local branches of banks, can offer wireless access to payment terminals using Wireless Trondheim's Wi-Fi network. The chosen target customers for this service are cafés, restaurants and merchants at temporary events in the city of Trondheim, and the cooperation with the banks has been chosen in order to utilize the bank's existing distribution channels towards these target customers. The business and technical risks that this business model face are identified and described. Net present value calculations of the business model show negative results in the pessimistic and realistic scenario of market share, while the optimistic scenario gives a small positive net present value. These results suggest that the Wi-Fi connection offered by Wireless Trondheim is not cost-effective compared to Netcom GPRS, and that the business model proposed in this thesis does not have a commercial potential with the current customer estimates. However, if the Wi-Fi coverage increases and the number of potential customer increases substantially, it could be interesting to pursue this business model proposal further. An interesting possibility could also be a combination of offering payment access to terminals and Internet connection to merchants. The number of potential customers would then in that case be considerably larger, as the target customers would include most merchants in Trondheim, and not only be limited to restaurants, cafés and merchants at temporary events. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{small number}} of general visual {{attributes}} have been recognized as essential in describing image quality. These include micro-uniformity, macro-uniformity, colour rendition, text and line quality, gloss, sharpness, and spatial adjacency or temporal adjacency attributes. The multiple-part International Standard discussed here was initiated by the INCITS W 1 committee on the <b>standardization</b> of <b>office</b> equipment to address the need for unambiguously documented procedures and methods, which are widely applicable over the multiple printing technologies employed in office applications, for the appearance-based evaluation of these visually significant image quality attributes of printed image quality. 1, 2 The resulting proposed International Standard, for which ISO/IEC WD 19751 - 1 3 presents an overview and an outline of the overall procedure and common methods, {{is based on a}} proposal that was predicated on the idea that image quality could be described by a small set of broad-based attributes. 4 Five ad hoc teams were established (now six since a sharpness team {{is in the process of}} being formed) to generate standards for one or more of these image quality attributes.

40|$|Almost 7 {{million square}} meters {{of office space}} in The Netherlands is vacant today. Conversion into housing is an often named solution, but is hardly ever put into {{practice}} because of financial and technical difficulties (location aspects not taken into account). On the other hand, <b>standardization</b> in <b>office</b> design {{can be seen as}} an opportunity in making conversion on a large scale more viable: if office buildings are similar in construction, façade systems, dimensions and materialization, modular prefab architecture could offer a solution. If the office structure is considered as a support that needs a new (prefab) infill, this could contribute in making conversion projects time- and cost effective and therefore more feasible. This research aims to explore the difficulties and opportunities that are presented in the building characteristics of the vacant office stock of today, to help define a conversion concept. The result is the design of a prefabricated dwelling unit that {{has the potential to be}} deployed in ten percent of the current vacant office stock in The Netherlands. For the final design project, the conversion concept is applied in the redesign of a vacant office building in Rotterdam, Boompjes 60 - 68. ExplorelabArchitectureArchitectur...|$|R
