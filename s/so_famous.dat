25|$|Piracy in {{the ranks}} of the Muslim pirates of Barbary was also a way to find employment, after King James I {{formally}} proclaimed an end to privateering in June 1603.

He wrote Alfred Hitchcock's movie, Lifeboat (1944), and the film, A Medal for Benny (1945), with screenwriter Jack Wagner about paisanos from Tortilla Flat going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of Lifeboat, because he believed {{the final version of the}} film had racist undertones. In 1944, suffering from homesickness for his Pacific Grove/Monterey life of the 1930s, he wrote Cannery Row (1945), which became <b>so</b> <b>famous</b> that Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, the location of the book, was renamed Cannery Row in 1958.|$|E
25|$|This {{account is}} not about {{presenting}} the life of Hrothgar, but in presenting how Harald Fairhair was descended from kings and heroes in Scandinavian legend. The only reason for assuming that Hróarr {{is the same as}} Hrothgar, the Scylding, is that only Hrothgar would be a personage of old <b>so</b> <b>famous</b> so as not to need any further identification than his name. However, the Skjöldunga saga tells that a Valdar disputed that Rörek, the cousin of Halga succeeded Hroðulf (Hrólfr Kraki) as the king of the Daner. After the war, Rörek took Zealand, while Valdar took Skåne. If based on the same tradition as Hversu Noregr byggdist, Valdar had the right to claim the throne being the son of the former king Hrothgar.|$|E

25|$|It {{was about}} this time that the quartet of the Rue du Vieux Colombier, <b>so</b> <b>famous</b> in French {{literary}} history, was formed. It consisted of La Fontaine, Racine, Boileau and Molière, the last of whom was almost {{of the same age}} as La Fontaine, the other two considerably younger. Chapelain was also a kind of outsider in the coterie. There are many anecdotes, some pretty obviously apocryphal, about these meetings. The most characteristic is perhaps that which asserts that a copy of Chapelain's unlucky Pucelle always lay on the table, a certain number of lines of which was the appointed punishment for offences against the company. The coterie furnished under feigned names the personages of La Fontaine's version of the Cupid and Psyche story, which, however, with Adonis, was not printed till 1669.|$|E

25|$|In 1831 the Admiralty issued {{orders for}} Victory {{to be broken}} up and her timbers reused in other vessels. A public outcry against the {{destruction}} of <b>so</b> <b>famous</b> a ship led to the order being held in abeyance and Victory was left, largely forgotten, at a Portsmouth mooring. Admiralty officially designated the ageing vessel as a ship's tender for the Port admirals flagship , and permitted civilian visitors to come aboard for tours. The ship briefly returned to the public gaze on 18 July 1833 when the queen in waiting, Princess Victoria, and her mother, the Duchess of Kent, made a visit to her quarterdeck to meet with veterans of the Trafalgar campaign. This generated a surge {{of interest in the}} vessel, and an increase in civilian visitor numbers to between 10,000 and 12,000 a year. Victoria returned for a second visit on 21 October 1844, creating a further burst of interest that lifted annual visitors to more than 22,000.|$|E
