40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{reducing}} {{carbon dioxide}} is being demanded in terms of preventing global warming. Lightening autobodies {{is one of the}} most practical ways to conduct it, for which converting the body sheets from conventional steel to Al-Mg-Si alloy is effective. Although the Al-Mg-Si alloys have the advantage that they have hardenability during paint baking and do not cause <b>stretcher</b> <b>strain</b> patterns, poor formability is a crucial drawback. Bendability {{is one of the most}} important properties related to formability. However, there has been no assessing method having both speediness and quantitative reproducibility. In this study, we have developed a assessing method based on the electric resistance decrease arising from the decrease in conducting section when cracks are formed by bending. Bendability was assessed by electrical resistance change as well as by crack density on the tension surface measured with an SEM. It was found that the new method have far greater speediness with the same quantitative reproducibility than the crack measurement method...|$|E
40|$|Deep drawing process, {{although}} deceptively simple, {{involves a}} complex interplay between material properties, die geometry and process variables. Theprocess optimisation {{is at the}} same time often affected by visual and design demands of a final product. The annealed low carbon steels used for tinplate rings, often undergo the strain hardening with extended yield point (yield point elongation) that results in surface defects of the formed part-the so-called <b>stretcher</b> <b>strains</b> (connected with Lueders 2 ̆ 7 bands phenomenon). This paper presents the finite element analysis of tinplate rings with ABAQUS program in order to analyse the phenomenon of the <b>stretcher</b> <b>strains</b> on an industrial case study. Numerical results were compared with the measured deformation of the stamped part. Finally the geometrical part optimisation was implemented in order to reduce the area with <b>stretcher</b> <b>strains</b> to a technologically attainable minimum...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium alloys {{are being}} {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry {{as a means of}} light-weighting the vehicle body to reduce emissions. The forming characteristics of aluminium alloys, however, differ from those of conventional deep-drawing quality materials, and the drive to reduce vehicle development times has led to reliance on simulation of forming operations to establish feasibility in the early design stages. It is known that friction has a major influence on the forming characteristics of a material and changes as the material plastically deforms and surface roughness increases, causing a transition from hydrodynamic to a mixed friction regime where metal to metal contact is increased. In the simulation environment however, friction is usually assumed to be constant. The development of higher strength alloys requiring higher forming forces suggest that a constant friction value may not always be a valid assumption. In this paper the friction behaviour of three commercially available automotive aluminium grades are compared, at different levels of strain, using a strip draw test. The results show that for a material with a standard mill finish friction is anisotropic, remaining so even at relatively high strains and the anisotropy is independent of the direction of strain. The friction coefficient increases with the level of strain but the use of solid wax lubricants helps to overcome this maintaining a uniform friction at strains up to 10 %. For aluminium with an EDT finish the roughening effects due to plastic strain are completely overcome and again a constant friction value is valid. In some alloys the formation of <b>stretcher</b> <b>strains</b> also help to reduce the metal to metal contact promoting hydrodynamic friction and a constant friction coefficient at lower strains...|$|R
40|$|The {{injection}} stretch {{blow moulding}} (ISBM) {{process is the}} main method used to mass-produce polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles for the carbonated soft drink and the mineral water industries. At present researchers have been developing numerical simulations of the process {{with the aim of}} gaining {{a better understanding of the}} process and ultimately optimize the design of new containers more efficiently. However, one of the drawbacks for these simulations is the lack of knowledge on the biaxial stress-strain behaviour of PET at processing conditions relevant to ISBM and the effect of biaxial stretching on the final properties. The main objective ofthis study was to understand and. characterize the biaxial behaviour of PET and quantify how biaxial stretching under different processing conditions influenced the final mechanical and structural properties. The results were. implemented within a numerical simulation with the aim of accurately predicting both the thickness and modulus distribution in the final container. Initially, a comprehensive stu:dy of the biaxial defonnation behaviour of three different grades of PET was carried out at conditions applicable to the ISBM process using the Queen's Biaxial <b>Stretcher.</b> The stress <b>strain</b> data generated from these biaxial tests was used to generate material constants for the Buckley-Jones-Adams material model. A new procedure for generating the constants was developed using the mathematical package MATLABÃ‚Â®. This semi-automated procedure was found more efficient than the original manual procedure by Buckley et al. Post-stretching analysis was carried out by using tensile and DSC methods. The modulus development of PET was found to be strongly dependent on the stretching temperature, strain rate, stretch ratio, and defonnation mode. Among those parameters, stretch ratio and defonnation mode play the most important role. A two dimensional ISBM simulation of a 1 litre PET bottle was developed for the prediction of thickness and modulus distributions. The comparison of the numerical results with the experimental measurement showed a satisfactory prediction ofbottle thickness and modulus in the side wall region.
