The analyst will want to know if the company being analyzed is likely to have manipulated or managed the financial <b>statement</b> <b>numbers,</b> which numbers in the financial statements are most likely to have been managed, and the magnitude of the management. For several decades researchers have been documenting the manipulation or management of financial <b>statement</b> <b>numbers.</b> They have documented various management devices and a host of contexts that provide incentive to manage. Yet, this review reveals that an individual analyst, working to understand a single company, has little to guide him or her in assessing the probability that the firm under consideration has managed financial <b>statement</b> <b>numbers,</b> which numbers may have been managed, and to what extent they may have been managed. While much work has been done and many papers published, the hard work of making the research useful to the financial statement user remains to be done. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Frege makes a {{distinction}} between particular numerical statements such as 1+1=2, and general statements such as a+b=b+a. The latter are <b>statements</b> true of <b>numbers</b> {{just as well as}} the former. Therefore, it is necessary to ask for a definition of the concept of number itself. Frege investigates the possibility that number is determined in external things. He demonstrates how numbers function in natural language just as adjectives. [...] "This desk has 5 drawers" [...] is similar in form to [...] "This desk has green drawers". The drawers being green is an objective fact, grounded in the external world. But {{this is not the case}} with 5. Frege argues that each drawer is on its own green, but not every drawer is 5. Frege urges us to remember that from this it does not follow that numbers may be subjective. Indeed, numbers are similar to colors at least in that both are wholly objective. Frege tells us that we can convert <b>number</b> <b>statements</b> where <b>number</b> words appear adjectivally (e.g., 'there are four horses') into <b>statements</b> where <b>number</b> terms appear as singular terms ('the number of horses is four'). Frege recommends such translations because he takes numbers to be objects. It makes no sense to ask whether any objects fall under 4. After Frege gives some reasons for thinking that numbers are objects, he concludes that <b>statements</b> of <b>numbers</b> are assertions about concepts.|$|R
