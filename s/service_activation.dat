40|$|The <b>Activation</b> <b>service</b> {{which is}} {{currently}} being delivered by the Department of Social Protection in Ireland is a tool for the delivery of labour market government policy in Ireland. Academic researchers are now starting {{to focus on the}} delivery of this service. However, because the <b>Activation</b> <b>service</b> is a relatively new concept in Ireland, research has been limited and the effectiveness and value to clients of the Department of Social Protection remain insufficiently explored. This dissertation examines customer service research which has recently concluded regarding the <b>Activation</b> <b>service</b> which is being delivered by the Intreo Office in the Department of Social Protection in Edenderry, Co Offaly. This Intreo office paradigm was setup in December 2015 and the researcher unveils various findings regarding the current Activation supports that clients are receiving to assist them to return to paid employment. In addition, the survey has been extended to include other clients who provide training supports. The researcher also delivers findings regarding feedback from clients in relation to Government policy regarding the pathway to work programme. The research methodology undertaken with the clients of the <b>Activation</b> <b>service</b> is underpinned by a mixed method research design which entailed a multiple choice survey and an opportunity to give an open response regarding the pathway to work programme. However, in-depth interviews with clients who provide training supports are more focused on a qualitative data response so that any referral gaps can be identified. The researcher also delivers findings regarding the expectations of clients regarding competencies of a Case Officer who delivers the <b>Activation</b> <b>service</b> to the clients. The outcome of the researchers endeavour is to present to policy makers with recommended improvements for the delivery of the <b>Activation</b> <b>service</b> and act as a reference point for future research which will be of assistance to academics and practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Grid {{applications}} are, {{by their}} nature, wide-area distributed applications. This WAN aspect of Grid applications makes {{the use of}} conventional monitoring and instrumentation tools (such as top, gprof, LSF Monitor, etc) impractical for verification that the application is running correctly and efficiently. To be effective, monitoring data must be "end-to-end", meaning that all components between the Grid application endpoints must be monitored. Instrumented applications can generate {{a large amount of}} monitoring data, so typically the instrumentation is off by default. For jobs running on a Grid, {{there needs to be a}} general mechanism to remotely activate the instrumentation in running jobs. The NetLogger Toolkit <b>Activation</b> <b>Service</b> provides this mechanism. To demonstrate this, we have instrumented the ATLAS Athena Framework with NetLogger to generate monitoring events. We then use a GMA-based <b>activation</b> <b>service</b> to control NetLogger's trigger mechanism. The NetLogger trigger mechanism allows one to easily start, stop, or change the logging level of a running program by modifying a trigger file.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis explores {{possibilities of}} using social <b>activation</b> <b>services</b> in the South Bohemian Region. Social <b>activation</b> <b>services</b> are {{the social services}} that are embodied in the Act No. 108 / 2006 Coll., on Social Services, and they are provided {{to people in the}} senior age or to people with disabilities. These services are very important and necessary for the mentioned persons, because through these services the people can get actively involved into the society. In the theoretical part there are explained important concepts relating to the issue of the seniors and persons with disabilities. Further there is also a description of the Act No. 108 / 2006 Coll., on Social Services and an overview of the provided social services. A content analysis of relevant documents was used to work out the thesis. The research part was carried out by an interviewing method, a technique of a semi-structured interview. In total 11 facilities providing social <b>activation</b> <b>services</b> for seniors and persons with disabilities in the South Bohemian Region took part in the research. The interview consisted of 10 questions. The aim was to explore the possibilities and the use of social <b>activation</b> <b>services</b> for seniors and persons with disabilities in the South Bohemian Region. The research results show that a current capacity of the registered social service of the social <b>activation</b> <b>service</b> for seniors and persons with disabilities meets the needs of users of the South Bohemian Region. The bachelor thesis can be used for providers and users dealing with this issue. Findings from the research part of the bachelor thesis could be a basis for a processing of community plans of social services of municipalities with extended powers in the South Bohemian Region and the Medium-Term Plan for the Development of Social Services of the South Bohemian Region...|$|R

40|$|Background-Few {{studies have}} {{discussed}} the emergency call and prehospital care as a continuous process to decrease the prehospital and in-hospital delays for acute stroke. To identify features associated with early hospital arrival (Methods and Results-This was a 2 -year prospective observational study. All stroke patients who were transported to the hospital by emergency medical services and received recanalization therapy were recruited for the study. For a sample of 308 patients, the stroke code was activated in 206 (67 %) and high priority was used in 258 (84 %) of the emergency calls. Emergency medical services transported 285 (93 %) of the patients using the stroke code and 269 (87 %) using high priority. In the univariate analysis, the most dominant predictors of early hospital arrival were transport using stroke code (P= 0. 001) and high priority (P= 0. 002) and onset-to-call (P 23. 5 minutes) for both early and late-arriving patients. Conclusions-Fast emergency medical <b>services</b> <b>activation</b> and ambulance transport promoted early hospital arrival and treatment. Although patient-dependent delays still dominate the prehospital process, it should be ensured that the minutes on the scene are well spent...|$|R
