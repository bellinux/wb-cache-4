5|$|As Yonah's illness, the Black <b>Scrawl,</b> is terminal, Nier {{sets out}} {{to look for a}} cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, Grimoire Weiss, which {{suggests}} that the two team up to use Weiss' magic and to find a cure for Yonah's disease. In their search, they encounter Kainé, a hot-tempered and foul-mouthed swordswoman; and Emil, a blindfolded boy whose eyes petrify anyone they see. After journeying for a time, the village is attacked by a giant shade; the battle culminates in Yonah being carried away by a master Shade that suddenly appears—the Shadowlord—who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Drakengard series, and follows the fifth ending of the first game, the events of which have left the planet Earth {{in a state of}} decay. Set over one thousand years after this, the game puts the player in control of the titular protagonist Nier, as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black <b>Scrawl,</b> to which his daughter Yonah has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kainé and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and understand the nature of the creatures known as Shades that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various video game genres, occasionally switching between them and the main role-playing-based gameplay.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early and mid-1980s {{there were a}} number of {{groundbreaking}} female punk and rock musicians who later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included Siouxsie Sioux, Poly Styrene, The Slits, Au Pairs, The Raincoats, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde, The Runaways/Joan Jett, The B-52's, LiLiPUT, Lydia Lunch, Exene Cervenka, Kim Gordon, Ut, Neo Boys, Bush Tetras, Y Pants, ESG, Chalk Circle, Fifth Column, Frightwig, X-Ray Spex, <b>Scrawl,</b> and Anti-Scrunti Faction. The 1980s also featured a number of female folk singers from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate.|$|E
25|$|Clutch size is {{typically}} three eggs, {{although it is}} two {{in some of the}} smaller species and only one egg for the swallow-tailed gull. Within colonies, birds synchronise their laying, with synchronisation being higher in larger colonies, although after a certain point, this levels off. The eggs of gulls are usually dark tan to brown or dark olive with dark splotches and <b>scrawl</b> markings, and are well camouflaged. Both sexes incubate the eggs, with incubation bouts lasting between one and four hours during the day and one parent incubating through the night. Research on various bird species including the gull suggests that females form pair bonds with other females to obtain alloparental care for their dependent offspring, a behavior seen in other animal species, like the elephants, wolves, and the fathead minnow.|$|E

500|$|During the Jordanian {{rule of the}} Old City, {{a ceramic}} street sign in Arabic and English was affixed to the stones of the ancient wall. Attached [...] up, it {{was made up of}} eight {{separate}} ceramic tiles and said Al Buraq Road in Arabic at the top with the English [...] "Al-Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd" [...] below. When Israeli soldiers arrived at the wall in June 1967, one attempted to <b>scrawl</b> Hebrew lettering on it. The Jerusalem Post reported that on June 8, Ben-Gurion went to the wall and [...] "looked with distaste" [...] at the road sign; [...] "this is not right, it should come down" [...] and he proceeded to dismantle it.|$|E
500|$|The {{watershed}} {{was first}} settled by the Dutch {{and was the}} site of Philipse Manor Hall, seat of Philipsburg Manor. The land was owned by Frederick Philipse I and subsequent generations until the family lost it {{at the end of the}} American Revolution. The land along the river was later divided into multiple towns. Industry in Yonkers developed along the Saw Mill, so polluting the river by the end of the 19th century that a local poet called it a [...] "snake-like yellow <b>scrawl</b> of scum". [...] In the 1920s, the last half-mile (800 m) of the stream was routed into tunnels and culverts under downtown Yonkers, a process partially reversed in the early 21st century when it became the first major New York waterway to be daylighted.|$|E

500|$|In the 1839 election, an {{unrelated}} issue came up that finally gave Morton a victory. [...] The Whig legislature had {{passed a bill}} promoted by temperance activists that banned the sale of liquor in quantities less than this effectively outlawed service over a bar. [...] The bill was {{seen by many as}} an instance of class elitism by the Whigs. [...] The vote was so close that a recount was performed, and ballots were carefully scrutinized. [...] One ballot counted for Morton contained the <b>scrawl</b> [...] "Maccus Mattoon"; despite efforts by Whig partisans to deny that the writer intended to vote for Morton, no person with that name was found anywhere in the state. [...] Everett graciously refused to persist in contesting the balloting, and Morton was certified the winner with 51,034 votes (exactly half those cast) to 50,725 for Everett (with another 307 votes being scattered).|$|E
500|$|Ima Hogg later recounted that [...] "my {{grandfather}} Stinson lived {{fifteen miles}} [...] from Mineola and news traveled slowly. When {{he learned of}} his granddaughter's name he came trotting to town {{as fast as he}} could to protest but it was too late. The christening had taken place, and Ima I was to remain." [...] During her childhood, Hogg's elder brother William often came home from school with a bloody nose, the result of defending, as she later recalled, [...] "my good name". Throughout her adult years, Hogg signed her name in a <b>scrawl</b> that left her first name illegible. Her personal stationery was usually printed [...] "Miss Hogg" [...] or [...] "I. Hogg", and she often had her stationery order placed in her secretary's name to avoid questions. Hogg did not use a nickname until several months before her death, when she began calling herself [...] "Imogene". Her last passport was issued to [...] "Ima Imogene Hogg".|$|E
500|$|However, {{a couple}} of days after the station opened, there were some {{problems}} in and around the station, which multiple news outlets criticized. An escalator broke down on September 14, just a day after the station's opening. In an unrelated September 16 incident, a straphanger got injured while walking up another escalator at the 34th Street station. Earlier that day, the New York Post reported on signal problems in the brand-new tunnels around the station, while riders complained about the delays on Twitter and Reddit. A Wall Street Journal commentator remarked that [...] "it's only a matter of months (make that weeks) before the gleaming station ... is pockmarked with chewing-gum spots, urban <b>scrawl</b> and litter." [...] Overall, however, the station received positive acclaim during its first few days of service. In an article in several newspapers distributed by NYC Community Media, Lenore Skenazy writes that many riders have praised the station's design, its cleanliness, and its climate-controlled platforms, and noted herself that the station looked and felt [...] "as uplifting as a cathedral".|$|E

500|$|Nier is {{intended}} to be set over 1000 years after the events of Drakengards fifth ending. In this scenario, the game's protagonists Caim and Angelus travel across a dimensional boundary to fight a monstrous beast. After winning the battle and killing the monster, they are shot down by a fighter jet and killed; their introduction of magic to the world leads to magical research that results in the Black <b>Scrawl.</b> According to Yoko, after the dark story of Drakengard, Yoko focused on more positive themes of friendship and combined effort. Much of the game was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the War on Terror. Yoko took from it the idea of a terrible event where both sides believed they were doing the right thing, and wanted to show the player multiple perspectives of the same events. The term [...] "Replicant" [...] was borrowed by Yoko from the 1982 science fiction movie Blade Runner, although Yoko did not cite a particular source for Nier's name, passing it off as a codename that persisted through development.|$|E
500|$|Prior to its release, {{band members}} promised a much darker and heavier album than Slipknot, and many sources praised the band for {{achieving}} this – effectively fulfilling their promises. During {{an interview in}} 2008, percussionist Shawn Crahan retrospectively evaluated their time creating the album, proclaiming that they owe their overtly darker sound to their state of mind during that period: [...] "When we did Iowa, we hated each other. We hated the world; the world hated us." [...] Iowa, unlike its predecessor, saw Robinson capturing the band's technicality {{as opposed to the}} raw energy for which Slipknot is known. The band was also praised for its use of an extended line-up consisting of additional percussionists and electronics. NME stated that [...] "every possible space is covered in <b>scrawl</b> and cymbals: guitars, percussion, electronic squall, subhuman screaming." [...] Although Iowa is widely regarded as the band's heaviest album to date, some tracks do include melody, most apparent in [...] "Everything Ends", [...] "My Plague" [...] and [...] "Left Behind". On the album's thirteenth anniversary, Revolver looked back on the album as [...] "their most extreme album yet". They compared several songs, namely [...] "Disasterpiece," [...] "People = Shit" [...] and [...] "The Heretic Anthem" [...] as more death metal-influenced than most of the [...] that the album contained. While the album does have elements of hip hop music, Iowa has less hip hop elements than Slipknot's self-titled album, focusing more on elements of genres such as death metal and thrash metal.|$|E

However, this was in direct contradiction from what he said several months before, at which time he said he doubted that the two writings were authored by the same person. He was quoted as saying there were [...] "a few superficial similarities and a great many dissimilarities." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 12 May 2008, {{the design}} of the Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Badges changed to what you see above.

[...] As with the new design, these badges {{incorporated}} the Minutemen prominently in the center surrounded by the words [...] "ARMY NATIONAL GUARD RECRUITING AND RETENTION." [...] Previous versions of these badges used to have to words [...] "ARMY NATIONAL GUARD RECRUITER" [...] but remained basically unchanged since their introduction in the mid 1970s.
