Both channels maintained <b>separate</b> <b>graphics,</b> music packages and announcing teams until 1995, when all sports presentations on PRISM and SportsChannel Philadelphia adopted a uniform on-air appearance and began using the same announcers.|$|R
50|$|WWAY {{launched}} a thirty-minute weeknight newscast on WWAY-DT2 beginning January 6, 2014 called Cape Fear CW Primetime News at 10. It features a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> package {{from the main}} shows seen on WWAY. It is the first competition to Fox affiliate WSFX-TV which has a well-established nightly newscast at 10 p.m. produced by NBC outlet WECT.|$|R

50|$|On most laptops a {{graphical}} {{processing unit}} (GPU) is {{integrated into the}} CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the Core i-series of mobile processors in 2010, and similar APU processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the system chipset, while higher end machines had a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> processor. In the past, laptops lacking a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving 3D graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors {{in the past few}} years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. Nvidia Optimus is an example of this sort of system of switchable graphics.|$|R
50|$|The Voodoo2 {{introduced}} Scan-Line Interleave (SLI), {{in which}} two Voodoo2 boards were connected together, each drawing half the scan lines of the screen. SLI increased the maximum resolution supported to 1024×768. Because of the high cost and inconvenience of using three <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> cards (two Voodoo 2 SLI plus the general purpose 2D graphics adapter), the Voodoo2 SLI scheme had minimal effect on total market share and was not a financial success.|$|R
5000|$|Alongside {{the launch}} of The CW, WVIR began {{producing}} a new nightly prime time newscast on WVIR-DT2 (now WVIR-DT3). Competing with a show already airing on Class A Fox affiliate WAHU-CD (produced by CBS affiliate WCAV), this was originally known as CW 29 News at 10 and featured a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> package and news music theme. Eventually, the broadcast was renamed NBC 29 News at 10 and began mirroring programs seen on the main channel.|$|R
5000|$|When WBOC-DT2 {{became a}} FOX affiliate, the main channel began {{producing}} local news weeknights at 5 for a half-hour (known as WBOC News at 5 on FOX21) {{and every night}} at 10 also for thirty minutes (called WBOC News at 10 on FOX21). Both shows air from a secondary set and feature a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> package. Weekday mornings at 6, this station simulcasts the second hour of the main channel's weekday morning show.|$|R
50|$|AutoCAD is a {{commercial}} computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application. Developed and marketed by Autodesk, AutoCAD was first released in December 1982 as a desktop app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers. Prior {{to the introduction}} of AutoCAD, most commercial CAD programs ran on mainframe computers or minicomputers, with each CAD operator (user) working at a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> terminal. Since 2010, AutoCAD was released as a mobile- and web app as well, marketed as AutoCAD 360.|$|R
50|$|After {{becoming}} locally owned-and-operated, WGGB's news department underwent significant changes. Several prominent on-air personnel resigned or were laid-off. The station debuted a {{brand new}} set, graphics theme, and music package on April 24, 2008. On September 8, WGGB-DT2 added a 10 p.m. newscast known as Fox 6 News at 10; this half-hour newscast originally featured a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> package and music theme from the main WGGB broadcasts. Eventually, it was expanded to weekends and became known as ABC 40 First on Fox.|$|R

50|$|However, ABC used a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> package (incorporating the network's own logo) {{during its}} {{coverage}} of {{the final round of}} the Scripps National Spelling Bee, which were similar to the older-styled ESPN graphics but with a yellow base. In 2008, though, it utilized the newer yellow and red ESPN graphics which had been used on other recent telecasts, but with the ABC logo. These graphics were used through 2010. In 2011, the Bee was moved off of network TV and the telecast began to be produced by Scripps Television, which uses its own graphics.|$|R
50|$|The PERQ was {{a popular}} early {{graphical}} workstation; therefore, it helped spawn many early third-party applications that {{took advantage of the}} graphical user interface and bitmapped graphics. Intran (around 1982) produced a pioneering graphical program suite called MetaForm, which consisted of the <b>separate</b> <b>Graphics</b> Builder, Font Builder, Form Builder, and File Manager programs. The PERQ also served as a dedicated platform for several pioneering hypertext programs, such as ZOG, KMS, and Guide. DP ("Drawing Package"), a CAD system used for creating circuit diagrams on the PERQ, was written by Dario Giuse at CMU.|$|R
25|$|While the Mac Mini G4 {{contained}} a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> processor, all {{revisions of the}} Intel-based Mac Mini contain integrated GPUs, except in the 2011 version where the 2.5GHz model contains a separate AMD Radeon GPU. In Apple's early marketing of the Mac Mini G4, it touted {{the superiority of the}} use of a discrete ATI Radeon 9200 32MB graphics card over the integrated graphics included in many budget PCs. The Intel GMA that was built into the Mac Mini was criticized for producing stuttering video, despite supporting hardware accelerated H.264 video playback, and disappointing frame rates in graphics-intensive 3D games.|$|R

The score bar, which is similar in design to the SNF version, is also seen {{at the bottom of}} the screen, with the NBC/NFL Network co-branding on the left side of the bar. However, the timeout indicators on NBC's TNF score bar are stacked to the right of the team's abbreviations, as opposed to underneath them on the network's own SNF score bar.|$|R

The two maintain primary weeknight personalities (such as news anchors) that only appear on one channel. On weekends, KIFI offers its own early evening newscast at 5 while KIDK follows at 5:30. The two television outlets simulcast together at 10 although the broadcast can be delayed or preempted on one channel due to network obligations. The CBS affiliate continues airing a nightly prime time newscast at 9 on sister station KXPI (now produced by KIFI).

50|$|The VT101 and VT102 were cost-reduced, non-expandable {{follow-on}} versions. The VT101 {{was essentially}} a base-model VT100, while the VT102 came standard with the AVO and serial printer port options pre-installed. The VT105 contained a simple graphics subsystem known as waveform graphics which was mostly compatible with same system in the earlier VT55. This system allowed two mathematical functions to be drawn to the screen {{on top of the}} normal text display, allowing text and graphics to be mixed to produce charts and similar output. The VT125 added an implementation of the byte-efficient Remote Graphic Instruction Set, ReGIS, which used custom ANSI codes to send the graphics commands to the terminal, rather than requiring the terminal to be set to a <b>separate</b> <b>graphics</b> mode like the VT105.|$|R
