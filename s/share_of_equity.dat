Although the NEP managed to create a class of Malay millionaires, it was charged that this was mainly due to cronyism, benefiting only the politically connected. Some agreed, but argued against taking action; one PAS politician stated: [...] "The Malays do not want justice to affect their interests." [...] Other commentators have suggested that {{although most of the}} benefits under the NEP accrued to the politically connected, the government intended for them to [...] "trickle down to the Malay masses", and also for the Malay nouveau riche to provide [...] "entrepreneurial role models" [...] for other Malays.|$|E

This significantly exceeded the government target of 30%, which had been set by the NEP. However, the figures were disputed by the government, which used par value instead of market value to calculate equity, did not consider any portion of government-linked companies to be Malay-owned, and looked at all 600,000 registered companies instead of just the publicly listed ones. Critics argued, however, that the usage of par value was antiquated and did not reflect the true value of the equity owned.|$|E

50|$|A capital {{structure}} arbitrageur seeks {{to profit from}} differential pricing of various instruments issued by one corporation. Consider, for example, traditional bonds, and convertible bonds.

The value of the whole instrument should be {{the value of the}} traditional bonds plus the extra value of the option feature.

5000|$|The {{financing}} relied {{extensively on}} the anticipated cash flow and debt with a low <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> Mark Dumol estimated that out of US$7 billion of investments only US$200 million, or less than 3 percent, had to be financed through equity. Since the service area was split in two and the foreign partners would shoulder much of the equity, local firms became very interested to participate when they were told of this arrangement: [...] "Can you imagine having a significant share in a company that provided water to Metro Manila for only USD 10 million?", Dumol asked. It remains unclear how this low amount has been calculated, since it implicitly assumes that the foreign partner comes up with 90 percent of the equity and the local partner {{would come up with}} an unusually low 10 percent of the equity.|$|E
5000|$|An equity {{security}} is a <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> interest in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The {{most common form of}} equity interest is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder of an equity is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment. In bankruptcy, they share only in the residual interest of the issuer after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. However, equity generally entitles the holder to a pro rata portion of control of the company, meaning that a holder of a majority of the equity is usually entitled to control the issuer. Equity also enjoys the right to profits and capital gain, whereas holders of debt securities receive only interest and repayment of principal regardless of how well the issuer performs financially. Furthermore, debt securities do not have voting rights outside of bankruptcy. In other words, equity holders are entitled to the [...] "upside" [...] of the business and to control the business.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} in-roads {{commercial}} banks have made into equity underwriting over 1990 - 2002. While banks end the period handling upwards of 25 % of equity underwriting, this increase results almost exclusively from acquisitions of investment banks with an already established market <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> underwriting. We find a significant {{decline in the}} market <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> underwriting that banks acquired in the post-merger period, a decline that is larger than that experienced by independent investment banks of comparable reputation. Banks lose market share because they originate fewer IPOs and their IPOs have a lower incidence of follow-on SEOs compared to independent investment banks. Following the merger, banks experience a large fall off {{in their ability to}} retain follow-on SEOs and are less successful in winning SEO mandates when an issuer switches from its IPO underwriter. Overall, the findings suggest it has been difficult for banks to achieve scope economies in equity underwriting. Equity issuance Investment banking Scope expansion...|$|E
