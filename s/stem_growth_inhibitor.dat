40|$|Confluent African {{green monkey}} kidney (BSC- 1) cells secrete a protein (Mr {{approximately}} equal to 24, 000) that inhibits DNA synthesis {{and growth of}} the same cells.

We have called this protein "inhibitor-inducible protein" (IIP 48). The maximal increase in rate of labeling of IIP 48 due to treatment with the <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitor</b> averages 12 -fold over the control. IIP 48 is an N-glycosidically linked glycoprotein, and it is not a major intracellular protein. This protein is maximally induced within 4 to 6 hr of adding the <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitor</b> to the cells.

As empirical, correlative studies cannot disentangle {{the interactive effects}} of climatic variables on tree growth, we used a tree growth model (IBTREE) to unravel the climate effects on different physiological pathways and in turn on <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> variation. We parameterized the model for canopy trees of Toona ciliata (Meliaceae) from a Thai monsoon forest and compared predicted and measured variation from a tree-ring study over a 30 -year period. We used historical climatic variation of minimum and maximum day temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in different combinations to estimate the contribution of each climate factor in explaining the inter-annual variation in <b>stem</b> <b>growth.</b> Running the model with only variation in maximum temperature and rainfall yielded <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> patterns that explained almost 70 % of the observed inter-annual variation in <b>stem</b> <b>growth.</b> Our results show that maximum temperature had a strong negative effect on the <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> by increasing respiration, reducing stomatal conductance and thus mitigating a higher transpiration demand, and – to a lesser extent – by directly reducing photosynthesis. Although <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> was rather weakly sensitive to rain, <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> variation responded strongly and positively to rainfall variation owing to the strong inter-annual fluctuations in rainfall. Minimum temperature and atmospheric CO 2 concentration did not significantly contribute to explaining the inter-annual variation in <b>stem</b> <b>growth.</b> Our innovative approach – combining a simulation model with historical data on tree-ring growth and climate – allowed disentangling the effects of strongly correlated climate variables on growth through different physiological pathways.

The onset of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizae {{during the middle of}} the summer wet period preceded increases in stem extension rate and stem phosphorus concentration. Based on previous studies of effects of environmental factors on photosynthesis, climatic condi-tions were more favorable for photosynthesis at AJ than at SRZ and ZTJ, as indicated by the amount of summer rainfall, the amount of light, and the moderate air temperatures that pre-vailed during the fall and winter seasons.

Fertilized trees had significantly greater stem biomass, stem nitrogen concentra-tion ([N]) and growth rate than unfertilized trees. Stem respira-tion (Rt) was significantly greater in fertilized trees when ex-pressed on a per unit surface area (Rt,a, µmol CO 2 m– 2 s– 1), sap-wood volume (Rt,v, µmol CO 2 m– 3 s– 1), or mass (Rt,w, nmol CO 2 g– 1 s– 1) basis; however, {{there was no difference between}} treat-ments when expressed as a function of stem N content (Rt,n, µmol CO 2 (mol N) – 1 s– 1). Irrigation had no significant effect on Rt or annual <b>stem</b> <b>growth.</b> Daily total respiration (Rd, mol CO 2 m– 2 day– 1) and <b>stem</b> diameter <b>growth</b> both had a seasonal bi-modal pattern with peaks in early spring and midsummer. Stem [N] declined significantly during the growing season. <b>Stem</b> <b>growth</b> rate and [N] explained 75 % of the seasonal variation in temperature-normalized Rt,a. The mature tissue method was used to partition total stem respiration (Rt) into maintenance (Rm) and growth (Rg) com-ponents. There was a linear correlation between winter Rt,v, a measure of basal Rm, and sapwood N content; however, Rt,v per unit N was greater in January before diameter growth started than in the following December after growth ceased, indicating that Rt,v declined as stem diameter increased. Con-sequently, estimates of annual maintenance respiration (RM) based on January data were 44 % higher than estimates based on December data.

40|$|Field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is {{a species}} {{with a cold}} {{requirement}} for the initiation of reproductive development (thermoinduction). Work in this laboratory {{has been focused on}} elucidating the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the bolting or rapid stem elongation response that is an intricate part of reproductive development in this species. In the present paper the cellular basis for thermo-induced <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> was determined. Evidence is presented indicating that bolting results from the production of new cells that elongate to their original length before thermoinduction. This increase in cell division occurs in the pith and cortex approximately 0. 5 to 5. 0 millimeters below the stem apex. For at least the early stages of thermo-induced <b>stem</b> <b>growth,</b> enhanced cell elongation {{does not appear to be}} a factor because average lengths of pith cells from stems of thermo-induced plants were similar or less than noninduced controls. In addition, both the amount of increase in the production of new pith cells and <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> were positively correlated with the length of the cold treatment. Two other lines of evidence are presented corroborating previous assertions (JD Metzger [1985] Plant Physiol 78 : 8 - 13) that gibberellins mediate thermo-induced <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> in field pennycress. First, treatment of noninduced plants with gibberellin A 3 completely mimicked the effects of a 4 -week cold treatment on mitotic activity in the pith and cortex. Second, very little increase in the production of new cells was observed in the pith and cortex of thermo-induced plants of a gibberellin-deficient dwarf mutant of field pennycress.

40|$|The {{periodic}} {{production of}} large seed crops by trees (masting) and its interaction with stern growth {{has long been}} the objective of tree physiology research. However, very {{little is known about the}} effects of masting on stern growth and total net primary productivity (NPP) at the stand scale. This study was conducted in an old-growth, mixed deciduous forest dominated by Fagus sylvatica (L.) and covers the period from 2003 to 2007, which comprised wet, dry and regular years as well as two masts of Fagus and one mast of the co-dominant tree species Fraxinus excelsior (L.) and Acer pseudoplatanus (L.). We combined analyses of weather conditions and <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> at the tree level (inter- and intra-annual) with fruit, stem and leaf production, and estimates of total NPP at the stand level. Finally, we compared the annual demand of carbon for biomass production with net canopy assimilation (NCA), derived from eddy covariance flux measurements, chamber measurements and modelling. Annual <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> of Fagus was most favoured by warm periods in spring and that of Fraxinus by high precipitation in June. For <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> of Acer and for fruit production, no significant relationships with mean weather conditions were found. Intra-annual <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> of all species was strongly reduced when the relative plant-available water in soil dropped below a threshold of about 60 % between May and July. The inter-annual variations of NCA, total NPP and leaf NPP at the stand level were low (mean values 1313, 662 and 168 g C m(- 2) year(- 1), respectively), while wood and fruit production varied more and contrarily (wood: 169 - 241 g C m(- 2) year(- 1); fruits: 21 - 142 g C m(- 2) year(- 1)). In all years, an annual surplus of newly assimilated carbon was calculated (on average 100 g C m(- 2) year(- 1)). The results suggest that <b>stem</b> <b>growth</b> is generally not limited by insufficient carbon resources; only in mast years a short-term carbon shortage may occur in spring.
