25|$|Another {{facet of}} this {{controversy}} is {{the effectiveness of}} the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling. Gifted Education is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for. Many lower-achieving districts and schools must make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities. As a result, gifted students at these <b>schools</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> served, or not served effectively.|$|E

At the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for example, after considering socioeconomic class, students at private schools underperformed those at state schools. One has, however, to be careful interpreting that data: {{it may be that}} such students do not underperform because they attend a private school, but that they attend a private school because they underperform. Some private Realschulen and Gymnasien have lower entry requirements than public Realschulen and Gymnasien.|$|E
25|$|Newark, New Jersey elected School Board {{member and}} former Deputy Mayor Alturrick Kenney and Milwaukee, Wisconsin Teachers Union President Bob Peterson responded to Hastings {{by saying that}} unelected school boards are not democratic. They added that elected school boards are {{necessary}} to slow-down the process of privatization of public schools, and that unelected school boards work to expand privately managed charter schools. Kenney and Peterson also said privately run charter <b>schools</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> run democratically, have relatively little accountability, and the data does not show charter schools outperform public schools.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} these arguments are flawed, ignores history and more laws will {{do more harm than}} good. According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - <b>schools</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices.|$|E
