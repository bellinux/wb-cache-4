5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} <b>subjective</b> <b>and</b> objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

5|$|Monet's use {{of colored}} shadows arose from color {{theories}} that were {{popular in the}} 19th century. German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832) published {{one of the first}} modern descriptions of colored shadows in his Theory of Colours (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by Isaac Newton (16431727) in his treatise on Opticks (1704). Goethe raised questions about <b>subjective</b> <b>and</b> objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul (17861889) expanded on Goethe's theory with The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839). Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the art world. It is generally thought that Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work. Georges Seurat (18591891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division, a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist Ogden Rood (18311902).|$|E
5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was <b>subjective,</b> <b>and</b> so was {{not open to}} review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary {{to the rule of law}} and all powers had legal limits.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the <b>subjective</b> <b>and</b> behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E

A face-to-face, population-based survey was conducted in Hong Kong (N = 1147). Information on health conditions and traumatic life events was obtained, and participants completed measures of <b>subjective</b> physical <b>and</b> mental health, depression, and resilience. Smoking and drinking were not significant mediators of the relationship between life events and both objective <b>and</b> <b>subjective</b> health.

Our results indicate that psychological factors rather than biological are important mediators of the relationship between life events exposure and health. Our findings provide evidence that depressive symptomatology has a mediating role only in the case of specific potentially traumatic life events and that resilience is only a critical factor in the face of exposure to multiple traumatic events, rather than single events.

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, weather {{prediction}} was entirely <b>subjective</b> <b>and</b> based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the three components of the flow velocity vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics, these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Previous {{studies of}} older European populations have {{established}} that disability and morbidity vary with indicators of socio-economic position (SEP). We undertook a systematic narrative {{review of the}} literature to ascertain to what extent there is evidence of similar inequalities in the <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> well-being of older people in Europe. Method: Relevant original research articles were searched for using Medline, Global Health, Embase, Social Policy and Practice, Cinahl, Web of Science and IBSS. We included studies of SEP <b>and</b> indicators of <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> well-being (self-rated health; life satisfaction; quality of life) conducted since 1991 using population based samples of older people in Europe and published 1995 - 2013. Results: A total of 71 studies were identified. Poorer SEP was associated with poorer <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> well-being. Associations varied somewhat depending on the SEP measure <b>and</b> <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> well-being outcome used. Associations were weaker when social support and health related behaviours were adjusted for suggesting that these factors mediate the relationship between SEP <b>and</b> <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> well-being. Associations tended to be weaker in the oldest age groups. The patterns of associations by gender were not consistent and tended to diminish after adjusting for indicators of health and life circumstances.

However, no research has yet focused on the mechanisms through which a youthful subjective age {{could be related to}} higher life satisfaction. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the mediating role of resources, such as <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> memory self-efficacy, in the relation between <b>subjective</b> age <b>and</b> life satisfaction among older adults. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 250 older individuals aged from 60 to 77 years who completed measures of subjective age, subjective health, memory self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. RESULTS: Path analysis revealed that subjective age was positively related to both <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> memory self-efficacy, <b>and</b> that <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> memory self-efficacy were both positively related to life satisfaction. Bootstrap procedures further indicated that subjective age has significant total and specific indirect contribution to life satisfaction through <b>subjective</b> health <b>and</b> memory self-efficacy.

25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both <b>subjective</b> <b>and</b> objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both <b>subjective</b> <b>and</b> objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E
