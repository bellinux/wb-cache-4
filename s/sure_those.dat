The only diagnoses that can be validated through large enough brain studies are those on serious brain damages and neurodegenerative diseases that destroy most of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|When announcing their {{condemnation}} of Cosby, many universities used {{the opportunity to}} voice strong no-tolerance policies of sexual violence of any kind. Brown University said Cosby's alleged actions were [...] "particularly troubling as our university community continues to confront the very real challenges of sexual violence on our campus and in society at large". In Baylor University's statement announcing Cosby's rescinded degree, it added, [...] "Through the efforts of our Title IX Office, we are encouraging victims to report acts of interpersonal and sexual violence, and making <b>sure</b> <b>those</b> suffering {{from the effects of}} such acts are provided the necessary support and services to feel safe and be academically successful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker {{revealed}} that Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad were composing {{the music for}} Luke Cage, with [...] "a '90s hip-hop vibe". Coker had contacted Younge and Muhammad separately, asking if {{they would like to}} work together on the series, not knowing that the pair were already working together on an album. Younge and Muhammad composed the score as if they were creating 13 albums, one for each episode, with the music inspired by Wu-Tang Clan, Ennio Morricone, and Muhammad's group A Tribe Called Quest. Muhammad felt that the music was [...] "about getting that hip-hop foundation and making <b>sure</b> <b>those</b> drums were as big as day", while Younge said, [...] "we wanted to make something great. Not just for black people or minorities, just something great that just happens to be based on our culture." [...] The duo composed around twenty minutes of music for each episode, composing the entire season's score in nine months.|$|E

2500|$|RTÉ {{journalist}} Philip Boucher-Hayes said {{other media}} sources had misreported his words {{in order to}} erroneously claim that nuns had deliberately starved children to death: [...] "Today on BBC TV I said malnutrition was listed as cause of death at other mother-and-baby homes. Several outlets [...] now quoting me as [...] source for the unsupportable claim that ‘nuns starved 800 babies to death’ before dumping them in a septic tank. So just in case this needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah <b>sure,</b> <b>those</b> were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And I think that that is an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Indigenous {{feminism}} is set {{apart from other}} Indigenous rights movements, such as Indigenous liberation theory, because those theories have [...] "not been attentive to the gendered ways in which colonial oppression and racism function for men and women, or to the inherent and adopted sexisms that some communities manifest." [...] There are some within Indigenous communities who choose not to identify as feminist and therefore {{distance themselves from the}} mainstream feminism. There are many reasons for this choice, however, Kim Anderson argues that ifWestern {{feminism is}} unpalatable because it is about rights rather than responsibilities, then we should all take responsibility seriously and ask if we are being responsible to all members of our societies. If we are to reject equality in favour of difference, then we need to make <b>sure</b> <b>those</b> differences are embedded in systems that empower all members. If we see feminism as being too invested in Western liberalism and individual autonomy, then we need to ensure that our collectivist approaches serve everyone in the collective. And if we want to embrace essential elements of womanhood that have been problematic for Western feminists [...] then we have to ensure that these concepts don't get stuck in literal or patriarchal interpretations.|$|E
