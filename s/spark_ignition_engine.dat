40|$|Performance of the <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> may be {{increased}} by changing the geometrical compression ratio according {{to the amount of}} charging in cylinders. The designed geometrical compression ratio can be realized as an effective compression ratio under the full load and full open throttle conditions since the effective compression ratio changes with the amount of charging into the cylinder in <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> So, this condition of the <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> forces designers to change their geometrical compression ratio according to the amount of charging into the cylinder for improvement of performance and fuel economy. In order to improve the combustion efficiency, fuel economy, power output, exhaust emissions at partial loads, compression ratio must {{be increased}}; but, under high load and low speed conditions to prevent probable knock and hard running the compression ratio must be decreased gradually. In this paper, relation of the performance parameters to compression ratio such as power, torque, specific fuel consumption, cylindir pressure, exhaust gas temperature, combustion chamber surface area/volume ratio, thermal efficiency, spark timing etc. in <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> have been investigated and using of engines with variable compression ratio is suggested to fuel economy and more clear environment...|$|R

50|$|In a <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine,</b> {{a mixture}} is ignited by an {{electric}} spark from {{a spark plug}} — the timing of which is very precisely controlled. Almost all gasoline engines are of this type.

40|$|Exhaust unburnt {{hydrocarbons}} (HC) in <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> arisefrom {{a number of}} sources, includingflame quenching {{at the entrance of}} crevice volumes and at the combustion chamber wall, absorption and desorption of fuel vapour into oil layers on the cylinder wall, partial burning and misfring. All sources other than partial burning and misfiring are in close proximity to the wall surjiies of the combustion chamber. The significance of this observation is that unburnt NC emissionsfrom <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> may be reduced at their sources of production using in-cylinder catalysts on the surfaces of the combustion chamber wall. This paper examines in detail a novel approach to reduce exhaust HC emissions using an in-cylinder catalyst on the combustion chamber walls, in particular, the surfaces of the crevice volumes.

50|$|Efficiency is {{increased}} {{by having the}} same effective compression ratio and a larger expansion ratio. This allows more work to be extracted from the expanding gases as they are expanded to almost atmospheric pressure. In an ordinary <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine</b> {{at the end of}} the expansion stroke of a wide open throttle cycle, the gases are at around five atmospheres when the exhaust valve opens. Because the stroke is limited to that of the compression, still some work could be extracted from the gas. Delaying the closing of the intake valve in the Miller cycle in effect shortens the compression stroke compared to the expansion stroke. This allows the gases to be expanded to atmospheric pressure, increasing the efficiency of the cycle.|$|E
50|$|A Hesselman {{engine is}} {{basically}} a spark-ignition engine, converted to run on heavier petroleum products such as oil, kerosene or diesel oil. The fuel is injected into the combustion chamber using an injection pump. Because of the engine's low compression the fuel must be ignited by a spark plug, unlike the diesel engine, where the fuel ignites spontaneously by the heat generated by the high compression ratio. Hesselman engines were often started on gasoline and then switched to diesel or kerosene when at working temperature. Clearing the heavy oil for the next start was achieved by switching back to gasoline before stopping. It is the first <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine</b> for automotive use with direct injection of fuel into the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine,</b> the Miller cycle yields an {{additional}} benefit. The intake air is first compressed by the supercharger and then cooled by an intercooler. This lower intake charge temperature, {{combined with the}} lower compression of the intake stroke, yields a lower final charge temperature than would be obtained by simply increasing the compression of the piston. This allows ignition timing to be advanced beyond what is normally allowed {{before the onset of}} detonation, thus increasing the overall efficiency still further. An additional advantage of the lower final charge temperature is that the emission of NOx in diesel engines is decreased, which is an important design parameter in large diesel engines on board ships and power plants.|$|E

5000|$|Technically a {{glow plug}} engine is fairly {{similar to a}} diesel engine and hot bulb engine in that it uses {{internal}} heat to ignite the fuel, but since the ignition timing is not controlled by fuel injection (as in an ordinary diesel engine), or electrically (as in a <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine),</b> it must be adjusted by changing fuel/air mixture and plug/coil design (usually through adjusting various inlets and controls on the engine itself.)

This [...] "configuration" [...] can also be adjusted by using varying plug designs for a more exact thermal control.

50|$|Exhaust from a <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine</b> {{consists}} of the following: nitrogen 70 to 75% (by volume), water vapor 10 to 12%, carbon dioxide 10 to 13.5%, hydrogen 0.5 to 2%, oxygen 0.2 to 2%, carbon monoxide: 0.1 to 6%, unburnt hydrocarbons and partial oxidation products (e.g. aldehydes) 0.5 to 1%, nitrogen monoxide 0.01 to 0.4%, nitrous oxide <100 ppm, sulfur dioxide 15 to 60 ppm, traces of other compounds such as fuel additives and lubricants, also halogen and metallic compounds, and other particles. Carbon monoxide is highly toxic, and can cause carbon monoxide poisoning, so {{it is important to}} avoid any build-up of the gas in a confined space. Catalytic converters can reduce toxic emissions, but not completely eliminate them. Also, resulting greenhouse gas emissions, chiefly carbon dioxide, from the widespread use of engines in the modern industrialized world is contributing to the global greenhouse effect - a primary concern regarding global warming.|$|E

40|$|The main {{scope of}} the present PhD {{dissertation}} was {{the development of an}} advanced thermodynamic simulation model of the closed part of the operating cycle of homogeneous charge <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> for the prediction of performance and nitric oxide emissions. In addition, exergy analysis of the cylinder charge was applied in order to quantify the destruction and loss of exergy (availability) taking place inside the combustion chamber. The combination of simulation model and exergy analysis was applied to the interesting case of <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> operation on gaseous biofuels. Finally, a special model was developed in order to study the effect of the geometry of conventional combustion chambers of <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> on the geometric characteristics of the propagating flame front, influencing the rate of combustion and the rate of heat loss through the cylinder walls. The main results of the present PhD dissertation are the following: • The advanced simulation model predicts correctly the effect of operating and fuel parameters on the performance (cylinder pressure, mass fraction burned) and nitric oxide emissions of <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> • The use of a multi-zone model for the description of the thermodynamic state of the cylinder charge improves significantly the accuracy of nitric oxide emissions predictions comparatively to the use of a two-zone model. • The advanced simulation model reproduces qualitatively in a correct manner the mechanism of temperature and nitric oxide concentration stratification developed throughout the burned gas during combustion. • During the closed part of the operating cycle of <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines,</b> destruction of availability takes place only throughout the combustion phase. • The degree of reversibility of the combustion process is determined mainly by the combustion temperatures. • The addition of hydrogen in biogas results in the acceleration of the flame development process, as indicated both by the reduction of the flame-development angle and the increase of the rate of combustion, the flame front propagation speed and the combustion velocities during the early stages of combustion. • The high mass diffusivity of hydrogen, combined with the positively stretched flames of <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines,</b> results in the enhancement of the burning intensity due to flame stretch effects. • The addition of hydrogen in biogas results in combustion irreversibilities reduction. • Increase {{in the area of the}} flame front is achieved for bowl-in-piston combustion chambers and combustion chambers with centre ignition, with the effect of spark plug position predominating over that of combustion chamber shape. • Combustion chambers with centre ignition result in combustion duration reduction. ...|$|R

50|$|The Helical Camshaft {{would allow}} both the Atkinson Cycle and LIVC {{to be applied}} simultaneously. The high CR would allow even greater amount of LIVC to be used at idle thus further {{reducing}} pumping losses and improving efficiency. The resulting engine would have a fuel economy very similar to (or better than) a diesel - and it could run on the cheaper LPG fuel. It would also be lighter in weight and cheaper to make than a diesel. A car fitted with such an engine {{would appear to be}} a much simpler and cheaper alternative to a “hybrid” car. (But a hybrid fitted with a Helical Camshaft/Atkinson/LIVC engine would be more economical still). One of the more recent “fashionable” areas of engine research at present is the Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (or HCCI) engine. It amounts to running a <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine</b> at light or part load in a similar fashion to a diesel engine. HCCI requires the compression pressure to be very quickly and accurately altered so that the more-or-less controlled compression ignition doesn’t suddenly blossom into full-blown detonation. One of the main strengths of the Helical Camshaft is that it can do exactly that. However, {{it would seem that the}} easily controlled LIVC (with or without Atkinson high CR effects) is a much simpler way to control an engine than the decidedly risky HCCI process - and it is doubtful that HCCI is more fuel-efficient than LIVC, etc.|$|E
50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine</b> or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|E
