He was present {{at the rear of the}} Tom Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E

25|$|While Zaharias {{missed the}} cut in the 1938 PGA Tour event, later, as she became more experienced, she made the cut in every PGA Tour event she entered. In January 1945, Zaharias played in three PGA tournaments. She shot 76–76 {{to qualify for the}} Los Angeles Open. She then shot 76–81 to make the two-day cut in the tournament itself, but missed the three-day cut after a 79, making her the first (and {{currently}} only) woman in history to make the cut in a regular PGA Tour event. She continued her cut streak at the Phoenix Open, where she shot 77–72–75–80, finishing in 33rd place. At the Tucson Open, she qualified by shooting 74–81 and then shot a 307 in the tournament and finished tied for 42nd.

500|$|Minor {{characters}} include The Cowboy (Monty Montgomery, credited as Lafayette Montgomery), the Castigliani Brothers (Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti) and Mr. Roque (Michael J. Anderson), all of {{whom are}} somehow involved in pressuring Adam to cast Camilla Rhodes in his film. These characters represent the death of creativity for film scholars, and they portray a [...] "vision of the industry as a closed hierarchical system in which the ultimate source of power remains hidden behind a series of representatives". Ann Miller portrays Coco, the landlady who welcomes Betty to her wonderful new apartment. Coco, {{in the first part of}} the film, represents the old guard in Hollywood, who welcomes and protects Betty. In the second part of the film, however, she appears as Adam's mother, who impatiently chastises Diane for being late to the party and barely pays attention to Diane's embarrassed tale of how <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> acting.|$|E

500|$|Naz {{is one of}} {{four main}} {{characters}} from series two of EastEnders: E20, created by its team of thirteen writers, along with Asher, Sol and Stevie. Newcomer Emaa Hussen was cast in the role, and said: [...] "It's a really exciting place to start my career. I'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders, {{which is one of the}} reasons I wanted to do the show." [...] Hussen said she was offered the part as the producers saw something [...] "authentic and real" [...] in her and that she could play the character how they wanted, and said she is similar to the character in some ways, adding that she enjoyed playing a strong character and felt like Naz as soon as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> cotume. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved.

500|$|After {{roles in}} the comedy-drama Postcards from the Edge (1990) and the comedy-fantasy Defending Your Life (1991), Streep starred with Goldie Hawn in farcical black comedy, Death Becomes Her (1992), with Bruce Willis as their co-star. Streep persuaded writer David Koepp to rewrite several of the scenes, {{particularly}} {{the one in which}} her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was [...] "unrealistically male" [...] in its conception. The seven-month shoot was the longest of Streep's career, during which <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> character by [...] "thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time". Due to Streep's allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although Streep believed that they made her look nearer 70. Longworth considers Death Becomes Her to have been [...] "the most physical performance Streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling". Although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1million in just five days, Streep's contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics. [...] Times Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's [...] "wicked-witch routine" [...] but dismissed the film as [...] "She-Devil with a make-over" [...] and one which [...] "hates women".|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, in an {{interview}} with MTV News, Canadian rapper Drake praised Rihanna's then-upcoming fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). During the same interview, he revealed that they have collaborated on a track that didn't make the final cut on the album, [...] "the record we have is great. It's a special record, so for it not to make it, I know something had to click. It's all good. I think the project's gonna be great no matter what." [...] Talking for the same publication, Tor Erik Hermansen of Norwegian production duo StarGate recalled that during an event Rihanna met with Drake backstage and asked him to record a verse on her song, [...] "She's calling me up saying, 'Where are the files?' That's one thing you don't hear often from artists on her level." [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake, while the production was done by StarGate. In {{an interview}} for HitQuarters, Hale explained that <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the project that's to a phone call she received from Dean. She also elaborated that her work on the song was mostly lyrical, while Dean and StarGate did most of the music.

I began with a class ring that I {{remember}} reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very conservative time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex—which is very bad of course—and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having... babies out of wedlock isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him the best she could, but {{he turned out to}} be a very strange boy. [...] lots of odd jobs and one of those jobs was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, which is the way that <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> trouble. From that point on, Pamela became very psychotic and puritanical in her attitudes as she was determined to kill all of the immoral camp counselors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson's {{parents were}} both devout Christians {{and the whole}} family {{was active in the}} Union Baptist Church [...] in South Philadelphia.

In that role she got to perform solos and duets, often with her aunt Mary. Marian was also taken by her aunt to concerts at local churches, the YMCA, benefit concerts, and other community music events throughout the city. Anderson credited her aunt's influence as the reason she pursued a singing career. Beginning as young as six, her aunt arranged for Marian to sing for local functions where she was often paid 25 or 50 cents for singing a few songs. As <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> her early teens, Marian began to make as much as four or five dollars for singing; a considerable amount of money for the early 20th century. At the age of 10, Marian joined the People's Chorus under the direction of singer Emma Azalia Hackley, where she was often given solos.|$|E
