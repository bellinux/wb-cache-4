[...] Commonly {{referred}} to as Elo/ELO in game chat, the rank points you earn from match wins will go up and <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> improve, so will the skill of your opponents.

500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we {{wanted to do was to}} make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{wrote to}} Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, {{and that he}} {{occupied}} [...] "very much {{the same position as}} John Brown used to". Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to listen to {{what they had to say}} but was very angry, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E
