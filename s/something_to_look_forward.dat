5|$|Narayan's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} making India {{accessible to the}} outside world through his literature. He is {{regarded as one of the}} three leading English language Indian fiction writers, along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to his audience in a manner that was both believable and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar to the reader as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan's 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of Malgudi Days.|$|E
5|$|In The King of Fighters XIII, Iori's {{gameplay}} mechanics were {{modified to}} {{be a close}} range fighter. Despite losing his flaming techniques, he was given brutal moves using his nails to emphasize his character's ferociousness. His strongest technique in the game, , is a new move that focuses on violent combos {{and serves as a}} reference to the character's ending from The King of Fighters '96 in which he brutally murders his teammates. Iori's 10th color scheme in the game matches his classic outfit's scheme, and during development of the game, details were added to increase the similarities. The ending of the character {{at the end of the}} game was also pointed by developers as <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to. His version, featuring his classic techniques, was designed with the intention of not surpassing the current Iori so that players would choose the fighting style they prefer in the game. This was further emphasized in the console version of The King of Fighters XIII where Iori had his moveset adjusted for better balancing by not using flaming techniques.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{characters}} that could {{appear in the}} season, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "The idea of some familiar faces with some new faces is <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to. I also think finding some new Marvel characters to pull into the universe would be cool. Fans seem to respond when there are characters from the Marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] He later explained that the series {{has the opportunity to}} explore the Inhumans outside of the Royal Family (who are the major focus of the comics, television series and previously planned film). The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics. The change was due to 20th Century Fox controlling the film and television rights to the majority of Marvel's X-Men and mutant characters.|$|E

500|$|Bourque {{has been}} {{involved}} in many charitable endeavours both in Calgary and Lac La Biche. He says this lifestyle was tough growing up, which is why he started the Bourque Buddies charity to help Metis children have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to and work towards. “You see the effects of stuff that goes on in small towns or even in reserves and it’s a tough life for a lot of those kids,” Bourque says. He started the Rene Bourque Hockey Fund with the goal of providing hockey equipment to underprivileged kids, and has appeared as a spokesman for Native Americans in sport at youth symposiums. His fund led to the donation of 50 sets of equipment to underprivileged children in Northern Alberta during the 2008–09 season, and over 100 sets in 2010–11. [...] Also in 2010–11, he started a program called [...] "Bourque's Buddies" [...] that rewards kids from the Tsuu T'ina Nation who have made positive contributions in their schools with tickets to Flames games.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 December Satono Diamond was matched against older {{opposition}} {{when he was}} one {{of sixteen}} horses invited to contest the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama. He was made the 2.6/1 favourite ahead of the four-year-old Kitasan Black and the 2015 winner Gold Actor. The other runners included Sounds of Earth (second in 2015), Cheval Grand (Hanshin Daishoten, Copa Republica Argentina), Marialite (Queen Elizabeth II Cup, Takarazuka Kinen) and Mikki Queen (Yushun Himba, Shuka Sho). Satono Diamond raced in mid-division on the outside as the Maltese Apogee set the pace from Kitasan Black. He moved up to third place entering the straight before producing a late burst of acceleration to overtake Kitasan Black well inside the last 100 metres and win by a neck with Gold Actor half a length away in third place. Lemaire said [...] "He is such an easy ride. He makes my job so easy. He was a little slow to react on the last turn. But he was so strong in front of goal. He has such a big heart", whilst Ikee commented [...] "It’s a huge relief. He’ll be able to take it up a notch or two next season. He should really come into his own by the fall. He just beat the best horses in all of Japan as a 3-year-old, which is great and gives us <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to next year." ...|$|E

5000|$|Variety {{welcomed the}} change in format and also commented: [...] "This was the sixth 'Christmas Sing with Bing. and the Yuletide Eve special is {{well on its way}} to {{becoming}} an institution which is all for the best since Crosby has that special sense of hominess and belonging that adds an extra kind of warmth to a season when the Christmas song-fests tend to lose their individuality. The 'Sing with Bing’ remains <b>something</b> special, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> each year…Far too many commercials for Insurance Company of North America and pretty hard sell at that. 'Sing with Bing’ being almost an institution it seems about time the commercial aspect of it be accorded appropriately similar treatment." ...|$|R

[...] "The sing-song-y nature of bridge and chorus give the song some bite and make it the kind of song that should've always followed up 'Need You Now,'" [...] says Bjorke. [...] "'Bartender' starts a new and exciting chapter in Lady Antebellum's career and gives us <b>something</b> <b>to</b> really <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> with their follow-up to last year's Golden." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix placed [...] "Bartender" [...] at #4 (of 21) on the website's Top Summer Songs of 2014, writing that [...] "the upbeat melody and the time-honored tradition of drinking to forget, {{not to mention the}} banjo at the end, make this tune too much fun to be a downer." ...|$|R
60|$|In one way, or rather, in two, however, I was lucky. The {{first was}} the {{complete}} absence of wind which must have raised waves that might have swamped me and would at any rate have wetted the rifle. The second {{was that there was}} no fear of my losing my path for in the mouth of the cave I could see the glow of the fires which burned {{on either side of the}} Motombo's seat. They served the same purpose to me as did the lamp of the lady called Hero to her lover Leander when he swam the Hellespont to pay her clandestine visits at night. But he had <b>something</b> pleasant <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to,</b> whereas I----! Still, there was another point in common between us. Hero, if I remember right, was a priestess of the Greek goddess of love, whereas the party who waited me was also in a religious line of business. Only, as I firmly believe, he was a priest of the devil.|$|R
60|$|This speech {{established}} Powell as {{a champion}} of Mrs Anthony. Nothing more bearing on the question was ever said before him. He did not care for the steward's black looks; Franklin, never conversational even at the best of times and avoiding now the only topic near his heart, addressed him only on matters of duty. And for that, too, Powell cared very little. The woes of the apoplectic mate had begun to bore him long before. Yet he felt lonely a bit at times. Therefore the little intercourse with Mrs Anthony either in one dog-watch or the other was <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to.</b> The captain did not mind it. That was evident from his manner. One night he inquired (they were then alone on the poop) what they had been talking about that evening? Powell had to confess that it was about the ship. Mrs Anthony had been asking him questions.|$|R

40|$|The {{lake was}} unusually calm that {{particular}} June day, when my Mother and Father started on their daily fishing trip.

6000|$|... "Surely I have, my son. Fifteen {{years ago}} I had a {{hogshead}} {{of the finest}} vintage in the neighborhood bricked up in my cellar. I had an inscription placed on the wall by which, should I be taken suddenly, my successor may know of the store that awaits him. At present you would not find the inscription did you search for it; for when those troubles began I filled up the letters in the stone with mortar, and gave the wall two or three coats of whitewash. I did not choose to run any risk of my grand wine going down the throats of thirsty French soldiers. It would {{be an act of}} sacrilege. When matters are settled, and we are at peace again, I will pick out the mortar from the letters; but not till then. I have often reflected since how short sighted it was not to have stowed away another hogshead for my own consumption. It would have been <b>something</b> <b>to</b> have <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> in my declining years." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was an intoxicating trip altogether; the {{exceeding}} {{sense of}} satisfaction that follows a good dinner added largely to the enjoyment; the having <b>something</b> especial <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> and muse about, like the approaching grandeurs of Meiringen, sharpened the zest. Smoking was never so good before, solid comfort was never solider; we lay back against the thick cushions silent, meditative, steeped in felicity. * * * * * * * * I rubbed my eyes, opened them, and started. I had been dreaming I was at sea, {{and it was a}} thrilling surprise to wake up and find land all around me. It took me a couple seconds to [...] "come to," [...] as you may say; then I took in the situation. The horses were drinking at a trough in the edge of a town, the driver was taking beer, Harris was snoring at my side, the courier, with folded arms and bowed head, was sleeping on the box, two dozen barefooted and bareheaded children were gathered about the carriage, with their hands crossed behind, gazing up with serious and innocent admiration at the dozing tourists baking there in the sun. Several small girls held night-capped babies nearly as big as themselves in their arms, and even these fat babies seemed to take a sort of sluggish interest in us.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Rudolph, do {{you think}} a woman any less {{beautiful}} or interesting because she is a fully developed physical being,--because her muscles have been rounded and matured into strength, so that she can meet the inevitable emergencies of life without feeling them to be distressing hardships? If there be a competent, well-trained servant to sweep and dust the parlor, and keep all the machinery of the house in motion, she may very properly select her work out of the family, in some form of benevolent helpfulness; but when the inevitable evil hour comes, which is likely to come first or last in every American household, is a woman any less an elegant woman because her love of neatness, order, and beauty leads her to make vigorous personal exertions to keep her own home undefiled? For my part, I think a disorderly, ill-kept home, a sordid, uninviting table, has driven more husbands from domestic life than the unattractiveness of any overworked woman. So long as a woman makes her home harmonious and orderly, so long as the hour of assembling around the family table is <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> as a comfort and a refreshment, a man cannot see that the good house fairy, who by some magic keeps everything so delightfully, has either a wrinkle or a gray hair." ...|$|R
