2500|$|When the Decision Dispatcher {{has made}} a {{decision}} as to what units will actually be assigned to the incident, unless the supervisor intervenes, he or she pushes the [...] "release" [...] button and the alarm is routed to the assigned companies, both in their respective firehouses and to the individual mobile data terminals (MDT) of each company's apparatus when {{it is in the}} field, depending on where the Starfire computer shows them to be situated. If a company/unit in a firehouse does not acknowledge the run within 30 seconds, the computer will notify the Voice Alarm Dispatcher (VAD), who will call that unit via radio in their firehouse by the dedicated intercom system. One minute after the alarm is released, it will appear on the computer screen of the radio dispatcher (Radio), who will announce the alarm and the response two times and ask for acknowledgment from any companies assigned who have not done so by radio, voice alarm or MDT. The radio dispatcher has a <b>special</b> <b>keyboard</b> called the Status Entry Panel (SEP), which is used to update the status of units based on information received by radio.|$|E

Switching from using a mouse to using a stylus pen with graphic tablet or a trackpad can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.|$|R

25|$|Because of {{the unusual}} {{character}} set, many programmers use <b>special</b> <b>keyboards</b> with APL keytops to write APL code. Although {{there are various}} ways to write APL code using only ASCII characters, in practice it is almost never done. (This may be thought to support Iverson's thesis about notation {{as a tool of}} thought.) Most if not all modern implementations use standard <b>keyboard</b> layouts, with <b>special</b> mappings or input method editors to access non-ASCII characters. Historically, the APL font has been distinctive, with uppercase italic alphabetic characters and upright numerals and symbols. Most vendors continue to display the APL character set in a custom font.|$|R
5000|$|Dvorak {{encoding}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of typing on a non-Dvorak keyboard using the Dvorak layout, for instance when using a software driver {{to compensate for}} the lack of rerouting of signals in the keyboard.

This at a time when 10-character-per-second teleprinters were the norm. In 1960, the first system, PLATO I, operated on the local ILLIAC I computer.

25|$|In {{defense of}} the APL community, APL {{requires}} less coding to type in, and keyboard mappings become memorized over time. Also, <b>special</b> APL <b>keyboards</b> are manufactured and in use today, as are freely available downloadable fonts for operating system platforms such as Microsoft Windows. The reported productivity gains assume that one will spend enough time working in APL to make memorization of the symbols, their semantics, and keyboard mappings worthwhile.|$|R
50|$|Computers, however, work differently. The {{dead key}} {{temporarily}} changes the mapping of the keyboard {{for the next}} keystroke, which activates a <b>special</b> <b>keyboard</b> mode rather than actually generating a modifier character. Instead of the normal letter, a precomposed variant, with the appropriate diacritic, is generated. Each combination of a diacritic and a base letter must be specified in the character set and must be supported by the font in use.|$|E

It was installed at Indiana Place Chapel, Boston, Massachusetts and remained in use for fifteen years. Poole patented a <b>special</b> <b>keyboard</b> to be used with his extended tuning system in 1868.|$|E

50|$|OTs may {{prescribe}} {{special equipment}} for children at school {{to make them}} more comfortable. Desks and chairs of a proper height for children are very important. The desk may have the ability to tilt into a comfortable position for writing. Pencils and pens with larger, softer grips {{can be used to make}} writing easier and less painful. <b>Special</b> <b>keyboards</b> may be prescribed to keep a child’s arms in a position that will reduce strain on joints when using a computer. OTs can work with teachers to educate them about a child’s condition, limitations and ways they can help make school a positive experience for the child. Recommendations might include two sets of textbooks, one for home one for school, to prevent carrying a heavy load of books. Additional recommendations may involve a reduced amount of writing and typing, sitting on a chair instead of the floor, extra time to move between classes, an elevator key for schools that have elevators but restrict them to students with health problems, providing a student note-taker, and extra time to complete assignments.|$|R

50|$|Another {{feature of}} the library {{building}} is the Deal Carillon located in the building's bell tower. The Deal Carillon is an array of 14 bells, ranging in weight from 350 to 3,000 pounds. The bells were cast by the McShane Bell Foundry, {{one of the oldest}} foundries in the United States. They are also inscribed with psalms and excerpts from Alfred, Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam. The Deal Carillon has the special McShane Chime Ringer system, which enables the Carillon to be played as a musical instrument by using a <b>special</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E
30|$|Finally, in our {{previous}} work we introduced a fully functional text entry prototype for Android devices in which the standard touch modality {{could be used in}} combination with Pitch and Roll movements [11]. We used the concept of discrete tilts for input primitives, as well as a <b>special</b> QWERTY-based <b>keyboard</b> layout and an original input scheme for character selection. The prototype was successfully tested on four devices from both smartphone and tablet class. This proposed text entry method inspired us to develop two additional tilt-based solutions that are described in detail in the following, together with the original one, and comparatively analyzed using predictive modeling.|$|R
50|$|Editing {{of pages}} was {{possible}} {{in one of}} two ways, either directly by creating or amending pages using <b>special</b> editing <b>keyboards</b> whilst connected online to the main Update Computer, or by creating pages offline and updating them in bulk to the main Update Computer. Bulk update required that pages be created offline by the use of editing terminals which could store pages, or by micro-computers such as that provided by Apple or Acorn. The pages were then transmitted to the UDC online in bulk via a special dialup port and protocol, or sent via magnetic tape to the Update Centre (UDC) where they were uploaded by Network Operations (NOC) staff.|$|R
50|$|The Epson QX-10 is a {{microcomputer}} running CP/M or TPM-III (CP/M-80 compatible) {{which was}} introduced in 1983. It {{was based on a}} Zilog Z80 microprocessor, running at 4 MHz, provided up to 256 KB of RAM organized in four switchable banks, and included a separate graphics processor chip (µPD7220) manufactured by NEC to provide advanced graphics capabilities. In the USA, two versions were launched; a basic CP/M configuration with 64 KB RAM and the HASCI configuration with 256 KB RAM and the <b>special</b> HASCI <b>keyboard</b> to be used with the bundled application suite, called Valdocs. The European and Japanese versions were like the CP/M configurations. TPM-III was used for Valdocs and some copy protected programs like Logo Professor.|$|R
