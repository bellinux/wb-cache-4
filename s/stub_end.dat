5|$|There {{has been}} {{scrutiny}} about the <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> at Exit 6A for Route 138 {{that was to}} be a part of an extension of the freeway for its final five miles (8km) from Route 138 to the Brielle Circle. Some of the right-of-way that was acquired in the 1960s for the Route 35 freeway were transformed into a multi-use trail for bicycles and other vehicles to link the Wall Township Municipal Complex to the existing Edgar Felix Bikeway that runs from Manasquan to Allaire State Park. In 2001, the Brielle Circle was replaced with a new four-approach interchange between Route 35, Route 34 and Route 70, but the project included no hint of the Route 18 Extension. NJDOT is in planning to create a Park & Ride at the southern terminus of the Route 18 freeway. It will be placed along the four lane right of way just south of Route 138. Residents are in opposition to this proposal for fear of loitering and vandalism that may accompany the parking lot.|$|E

South of Dyre Avenue station, the southbound track moves over to the local position and the southbound express track begins.|$|E
25|$|On {{its eastern}} end, NY5S was {{gradually}} truncated {{to its current}} terminus in Rotterdam as portions of I-890 was built over the former routing of NY5S between Rotterdam and Schenectady. The first cutback occurred in the early 1970s following the completion of I-890 between downtown Schenectady and exit4. The freeway was completed between the New York State Thruway (I-90) and Schenectady in the mid-1970s, resulting in the truncation of NY5S to I-890 exit2. It was truncated to its current eastern terminus at I-890 (now NY890) in the late 1980s after a reconfiguration of the interchange between the Thruway and I-890 resulted in the removal of River Road between I-890 and the current <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> of Rice Road.|$|E
25|$|Modifications {{were made}} to a <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> tunnel (also known as the Penn Pocket, which was {{originally}} built for short turn World Trade Center to Exchange Place runs to handle PRR commuters from Harborside Terminal) to allow trains from Newark to reach the Hoboken bound tunnel and vice versa. The modifications required PATH to bore through the bedrock dividing the stub tunnel and the tunnels to and from Newark. The new Exchange Place station opened in June 2003. Because of the original alignment of the tracks, trains to/from Hoboken use separate tunnels from the Newark service. From Newark, trains cross over to the Newark/Hoboken bound track just north of Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used a crossover switch to go to Hoboken. From Hoboken, trains enter on the Manhattan-bound track at Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used the same crossover switch {{to go to the}} Newark-bound tracks before entering Grove Street.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{improved}} {{version of}} unit-cell {{for the design}} of composite right left transmission line (CRLH TL) is reported in this paper. Comparative results of both conventional design of unit-cell and proposed design of unitcell for CRLH TLs are presented in this article. The conventional unit-cell is designed based on inter digitalcapacitor (IDC) in series and vias to the ground plane at the <b>stub</b> <b>ends</b> in shunt, whereas proposed unit-cell is designed based on wire bonded interdigital capacitor (WBIDC) in series and vias to the ground plane at the <b>stub</b> <b>ends</b> in shunt. Use of WBIDC in the proposed unit-cell improves high frequency performance by reducing undesired self resonances generated in IDC at lower frequency end. A simple technique is also used in both designs to miniaturize the unit-cell profiles. Dispersion diagrams of the unit-cells show the presence of self resonances in the conventional IDC based unit-cell and absence of such self resonances in the proposed WBIDC based unit-cell, which causes the wider operational frequency band of WBIDC based unit-cell. The performances of both unit-cells are compared from dispersion curve and S - parameters characteristics. The frequency parameter and performance of the both unit-cells are evaluated by full-wave electromagnetic simulator using Ansoft Designer, based on method of moment...|$|R

The new western terminus will be located at Elm Creek Boulevard in Maple Grove. The freeway continues westward from this point in the median of CR81, but this section will be an unused <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> past the ramps that connect to CR81 During the 2011 Minnesota state government shutdown, construction on MN610 was halted for 20days.

500|$|However, many of {{the civic}} groups still opposed I-70 passing through Leakin Park; the groups used {{litigation}} and political will to indefinitely delay the construction of I-70 through the park. [...] In 1981, the city cancelled the portion of I-70 from its current eastern terminus through Leakin and Gwynns Falls parks to the Interstate's interchange with I-170. [...] I-170 and the portion of proposed freeway south to I-95 remained part of plans with a new designation for the L-shaped freeway, I-595. [...] However, in 1983, I-595 was cancelled as well due to escalating costs; saving funds for the original I-595 freeway would detract from more pressing needs like maintenance of city streets and rapid transit. [...] I-595 was later used as an unsigned designation for the upgrade of US50 between the Capital Beltway and Annapolis. [...] With the abandonment of I-70's extension further into the city, the Baltimore City Department of Transportation converted the Interstate's <b>stub</b> <b>end</b> east of Security Boulevard into a park and ride facility that opened in September 1985.|$|E

40|$|Repoint is a {{new concept}} for track {{switching}} developed at Loughborough University. Through a novel locking arrangement it allows parallel, multi-channel actuation and passive locking functions, providing {{a high degree of}} fault tolerance. The concept, based around a stub switch, offers several features that current designs are unable to achieve. The aim of the work presented in this paper is to evaluate the dynamic interaction forces due to the passage of rolling stock over the switch and, particularly, the area of the <b>stub</b> rail <b>ends,</b> in comparison to a conventional switch. Specific behaviour and load transfer conditions from one rail to the other at the joint are analysed, as well as long term wear conditions of the rails.
