It was also indicated that there was no significance difference between male and female customers' perceptions of service quality in <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreations</b> programmes.

Data collection included: semi-structured interviews with grant recipients and key partnership members (n= 22); and document analysis. A capacity-building framework was used to guide data analysis. The findings showed that partnerships without the engagement of key stakeholders and a diversity of skills, resources, and approaches were limited to 'come and try' events rather than structured <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> programs in the short term.
