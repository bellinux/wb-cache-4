5|$|Sponges were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Homoscleromorpha, a group thought {{to belong to}} the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.|$|E
5|$|Molecular <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current species {{concept for}} H.repandum may need {{revision}} {{as there is}} a poor overlap between morphological and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, {{but it is}} well {{established}} that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic epidemiology <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as tourettism.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved {{for the management of}} anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient {{for the needs of}} the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. Recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely {{played a role in the}} cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Lava Fork volcano is {{associated}} {{with a small group of}} related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which extends from the Alaska–Yukon border to near the port city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Noise as {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras to rock groups as {{they are exposed to}} high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.|$|E

5|$|Other sites {{show more}} circumstantial {{evidence}} of mammoth hunting, such as piled bones bearing butcher marks. Some {{of these sites}} are not closely associated with Clovis points. The Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site and the Dent Site, where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with butcher marks and in association with Clovis points, were once interpreted as the killing of entire herds by Clovis hunters. However, isotope <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of the year, and therefore not herds killed in single incidents. Many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time, and are therefore ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, {{populations of}} horses in {{isolated}} areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally {{have been proven}} to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sorraia is {{more closely related to}} other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.|$|E
5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury {{says that}} the king also seized and {{depopulated}} many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal New Forest region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians {{have come to the}} conclusion that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.|$|E

Thus, studies are needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative therapies of GAD. Several <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> effective treatments of GAD include kava, relaxation training, acupuncture, meditation, and autogenic training. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> also <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> complementary therapies are effective for more specific anxiety disorders, such a panic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder...|$|R

5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as {{they do not have the}} proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Millet cultivation: The {{discovery}} in northern China of domesticated varieties of broomcorn and foxtail millet from 8500 BC, or earlier, suggests that millet cultivation might have predated that of rice {{in parts of}} Asia. Clear evidence of millet began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of Cishan, Peiligang and Jiahu. Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storage pits, 80 with millet remains, with a total millet storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000kg of grain. By 4000 BC, most Yangshao areas were using an intensive form of foxtail millet cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging and harvesting the crop. The success of the early Chinese millet farmers is still reflected today in the DNA of many modern East Asian populations, such <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout East Asia.|$|E
5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> P. rebeli {{caterpillars}} benefit most {{when they}} parasitize {{off of the}} Myrmica schencki ant colony than any other ant colony. When Myrmica ant colonies encounter a period of food shortage, more P. rebeli caterpillars survive than if this food shortage were to occur in any other species of ant colony. This is because the P. rebeli caterpillars have a lower social rank in other ant species compared to their social rank in the M. schencki ant colony. This phenomenon is seen during times of stress, {{when some of the}} hungry P. rebeli caterpillars secrete compounds to attract attention from the ant colony it has parasitized. While the M. schencki ants are still fooled into believing that the P. rebeli are of their own brood, these compounds do not mimic those of non-host species' societies in other ant species, and thus, results in the P. rebeli being identified as intruders and killed.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Ocean Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in sea surface temperatures between {{the eastern and}} western sections of the tropical Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical Indian Ocean is cooler (lower sea surface temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea surface temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea surface temperatures on the eastern section and cooler sea surface temperatures on the western section of the tropical Indian Ocean. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean Dipole is partly responsible for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general. During a positive phase, precipitation is higher in the Río de la Plata Basin due to teleconnections.|$|E
5|$|Aspect weavers' {{performance}}, {{as well as}} {{the performance}} of the code that they produce, has been a subject of analysis. It is preferable that the improvement in modularity supplied by aspect weaving does not impact run-time performance. Aspect weavers are able to perform aspect-specific optimizations. While traditional optimizations such as the elimination of unused special variables from aspect code can be done at compile-time, some optimizations can only be performed by the aspect weaver. For example, AspectJ contains two similar but distinct keywords, thisJoinPoint, which contains information about this particular instance of woven code, and thisJoinPointStaticPart, which contains information common to all instances of code relevant to that set of advice. The optimization of replacing thisJoinPoint with the more efficient and static keyword thisJoinPointStaticPart can only be done by the aspect weaver. By performing this replacement, the woven program avoids the creation of a join point object on every execution. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unnecessary creation of join point objects in AspectJ can lead to a performance overhead of 5% at run-time, while performance degradation is only approximately 1% when this object is not created.|$|E
