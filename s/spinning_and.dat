30|$|In summary, we {{demonstrated}} detailedly that {{band structure}} and transport property of silicene under a periodic field strongly {{depend on the}} <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley degrees of freedom. The numerical results indicate that electrons with different <b>spins</b> <b>and</b> valleys have various characteristics in Dirac point, bang gap, and group velocity. In particular, owing to the electric field and exchange field, the anisotropic velocity is restrained, which displays a collimation behavior for specific <b>spins</b> <b>and</b> valleys. Therefore, the transmission presents strong spin- and valley-dependent feature, consistent with the band structure, resulting in a significant <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley polarizations. In addition, the disorder could greatly enhance the <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley polarizations. Finally, we hope these results can be conducive to the potential applications of the <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley indices.|$|R

Furthermore, the <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley polarizations could be enhanced by the silicene superlattices [51]. Just like graphene, many novel electronic structures are expected in silicene superlattices. However, works on silicene superlattices are very few [50, 51]. In this paper, we discuss in detail a complementary aspect, namely, the spin- and valley-dependent band structure and transport property of silicene.
