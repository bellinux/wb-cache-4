Hotel industry executives flatly warned McCarthy the project would not be profitable.

500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. I thought if I go for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E

In later testimonies, he indicated that his ethnic background was not entirely relevant to him: [...] "Germans <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Hungarian, Hungarians that I was Romanian, Romanians said that I was Jewish, but Jews <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> communist, although I was not yet one at the time".|$|E

2500|$|As a non-devout Jew, Zeldis felt {{disconnected}} from her people {{and wanted to}} explore her heritage. She moved to Israel in 1949 {{at the age of}} eighteen, becoming a Zionist and working on a kibbutz. [...] It was here that Zeldis met her future husband, Hiram Zeldis. The two went back to the US to marry, and then returned to the kibbutz. Zeldis began painting, yet had little confidence in the quality of her work. However, Aaron Giladi, a well known Israeli artist visited the kibbutz and praised Zeldis’s paintings. Zeldis was overwhelmed by his regard and his request for two paintings, saying, [...] "I lost my voice from excitement—I couldn’t go to his lecture I was so emotionally upset. I heard afterwards that he <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great artist". [...] Giladi’s compliments came with constructive criticism; his suggestion to paint larger intimidated Zeldis. After trying and failing to use larger canvases she stopped painting for a period of time, which was extended by childbirth and a permanent move to Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 1910, Wedge {{was arrested}} and incarcerated in the city jail on charges of battery for {{attempting}} to strike a night watchman named Gus Miller and begging after being found on Fifth Street near Market Street at 4.30am. Wedge denied the allegations and explained his alcoholic odor as due to his incarceration with drunks and [...] "wine bums", and that he possessed port wine {{given to him by}} the Hahnemann Hospital to prevent pneumonia. Wedge was given the sobriquet [...] "The Fighting Parson of the Barbary Coast". In 1917 Wedge explained its origin: [...] "I was preaching on a beer keg in a saloon on the Barbary coast in San Francisco when a couple of toughs went for me. I guess maybe I cleaned out the place then. A reporter on the San Francisco newspaper gave me the name. He <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fellow who, if he could not preach good into men, would knock h—l out of them. Those fellows got me, though, and put me in the hospital for a while". After being hospitalized after a vicious assault by several denizens of the Barbary Coast at the corner of Pacific and Montgomery avenues, by the end of 1910 Wedge decided to return to Omaha to recuperate and to attempt to reconcile with Prudence Tracy.|$|E
