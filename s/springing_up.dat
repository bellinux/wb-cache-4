5|$|The hotel faced stiff {{competition}} from the early 20th century, {{with a range of}} new hotels <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), The St. Regis (1904), The Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.|$|E
5|$|The {{hotel was}} not immensely {{profitable}} in its opening years; smaller {{than many of}} the new hotels <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> in that period, it was not fashionable initially, and was resented by many of the London elite who considered it vulgar. It took £3628 in 1908, over a thousand pounds less than the previous year, and the hotel lost over £50,000 between 15 May 1906 and 31 July 1908, which led to the replacement of Elles with manager with Theodore Kroell and appointment of Charles Van Gyzelen as manager of the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly {{earned him a}} {{reputation}} in science fiction circles, although he said to only have received a few fans' letters {{a year in the}} pre-internet days. The publication of A Game of Thrones caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main Ice and Fire fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members as of 2011, was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. García, Jr., and his girlfriend; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided {{to organize a}} rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside. Hananu was motivated to act {{by what he saw}} as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
25|$|Business started <b>springing</b> <b>up.</b> The town's new {{business}} district was initially {{centered around the}} current Third Street Promenade.

25|$|Drobeta was {{the most}} {{important}} town of Dacia Inferior. <b>Springing</b> <b>up</b> in the vicinity of a stone camp housing 500 soldiers and established by Trajan to guard the northern approaches to Trajan's Bridge, the town was elevated by the emperor Hadrian to a municipium, holding the same rights as an Italian town. During the middle 190s, Septimius Severus transformed the town into a full-fledged colonia.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{situation}} indicated {{a large amount of}} pent-up demand, and a situation that could not remain static for long. By the end of the 1960s, a number of small magazines dedicated to the hobby were <b>springing</b> <b>up,</b> along with new game companies. Many of these were not available in any store, being spread by 'word of mouth' and advertisements in other magazines.|$|E
25|$|While {{colleges were}} <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> across the Northeast, {{there was little}} {{competition}} on the western frontier for Transylvania University, founded in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1780. It boasted of a law school {{in addition to its}} undergraduate and a medical programs. Transylvania attracted politically ambitious young men from across the Southwest, including 50 who became United States senators, 101 congressmen, 36 governors and 34 ambassadors, as well as Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.|$|E

25|$|From the 1920s to the 1940s, Long Island {{began the}} {{transformation}} from backwoods and farms as developers created numerous suburbs. Numerous {{branches of the}} LIRR already enabled commuting from the suburbs to Manhattan. Robert Moses engineered various automobile parkway projects to span the island, and developed beaches and state parks for the enjoyment of residents and visitors from the city. Gradually, development also followed these parkways, with various communities <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> along the more traveled routes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sections}} of the river were highly polluted, {{so much so that}} when the Rother Valley Country Park was being created around the section north of Killamarsh and east of Beighton, cleaner water was brought in from the Moss Brook to feed the park's lakes. The recent closures of industry and the work of the Environment Agency has improved the quality of the river Rother. The watercourse now holds a good head of coarse fish, and angling clubs are <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> along its length.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the ICR with its subsidized freight-rate agreements, as well as the National Policy of prime {{minister}} Sir John A. Macdonald, the industrial revolution struck Maritime towns quickly. The ICR was the perfect vehicle for transporting raw ore such as iron ore and coal to steel plants in Trenton, Sydney Mines and Sydney, as well as finished and semi-finished products to other Maritime and central Canadian locations. This led to foundries and factories of various industries <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> throughout Nova Scotia and New Brunswick along the ICR main line and branch lines.|$|E

25|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Embargo Act of 1807, and {{prohibited}} {{the importation of}} slaves in 1808. That same year Fernandina was declared a free port; it began to ship great quantities of Florida cotton and lumber, and became a resort for the smuggling business and contraband slave trade. The town entered a boom period of extraordinary growth, with finer residences and crude shacks <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> next to each other. Vegetable gardens were planted haphazardly about, and the streets {{were little more than}} crooked paths. The unsightly and unsanitary condition of Fernandina disturbed Governor White, and on May 10, 1811, two days after Clarke's appointment as surveyor general, he instructed him to plat the town so that the streets were properly aligned and the lots were uniform.|$|E
25|$|During {{those early}} days of cricket in Rio de Janeiro, the sport was also <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> at British sports clubs {{elsewhere}} in the country, including: the São Paulo Athletic Club in São Paulo (founded in 1888); the Santos Athletic Club in São Paulo (1889); Clube Internacional de Cricket and Club de Cricket Victoria, both in Salvador, Bahia (both founded in 1899); and the British Country Club in Recife, Pernambuco (1920). Teams and grounds were also created at the British-owned Morro Velho mine just outside Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais (1887), and at the Frigorífico Anglo plant in Barretos, São Paulo (1913), where cricket was played until the mid-1990s. Cricket was also played at the Fazenda dos Ingleses in Caraguatatuba, {{on the coast of}} São Paulo, from 1927 until the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} divided into five regions: Central Desert, La Serranía, the Vizcaíno Desert, the Magdalena Plains and Los Cabos. The Central Desert has desert plants, with {{vegetation}} <b>springing</b> <b>up</b> during short and irregular rains. The La Serranía is the high mountain areas with significant tree cover, some species of which are commercially valuable. The Vizcaíno Desert runs along the Pacific coast around the Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio lagoons; it contains lower mountain ranges such as the San Francisco, San Alberto, Las Tinajas de Murillo and El Serrucho, along with the El Azufre and Las Vírgenes volcanos. The Magdalena Plains is a large, flat area near the Pacific coast, and the Los Cabos region is distinguished by microclimates determined by the geologic change {{in the area and}} rain patterns.|$|E
