40|$|Introduction. The best {{treatment}} for unruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms is unclear. We perform a meta-analysis of recent publications {{to evaluate the}} results of unruptured MCA aneurysms treated with surgical clipping and endovascular coiling. Methods. A PubMed search for articles published between January 2004 and November 2013 was performed. The R statistical software package was {{used to create a}} random effects model for each desired incidence rate. Cochran’s Q test was used to evaluate possible heterogeneity among the rates observed in each study. Results. A total of 1891 unruptured MCA aneurysms, 1052 clipped and 839 coiled, were included for analysis. The complete occlusion rate at 6 – 9 months mean follow-up was 95. 5 % in the clipped group and 67. 8 % in the coiled group (P< 0. 05). The periprocedural thromboembolism rate in the clipping group was 1. 8 % compared with 10. 7 % in the aneurysms treated by coiling (P< 0. 05). The recanalization rate was 0 % for clipping and 14. 3 % for coiling (P= 0. 05). Modified Rankin scores of 0 – 2 were obtained in 98. 9 % of clipped patients compared to 95. 5 % of coiled (NS). Conclusions. This review weakly <b>supports</b> <b>clipping</b> as the preferred treatment of unruptured MCA aneurysms. Clinical outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Treatment of {{very small}} unruptured {{intracranial}} aneurysms (VSUIAs, defined as # 3 mm) can be indicated in selected circumstances. The feasibility and outcomes of endovascular therapy for VSUIAs have been recently published; however, the efficacy and complication rate of surgical clipping {{has not been}} reported in any large series to date. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a multicenter study to examine surgical outcomes for VSUIAs. METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing surgery for a VSUIA in 4 neurosurgical centers between October 2001 and December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: In the study, 183 patients (128 women, mean age 51. 3 years) were treated with 190 procedures {{for a total of}} 228 aneurysms. Most were anterior circulation aneurysms (n = 215). The majority were directly clipped (n = 222, 97. 4 %), with coagulation or wrapping in the remainder. After 1 reoperation for incomplete clipping, postoperative imaging of 225 aneurysms confirmed complete occlusion in 221 (98. 2 %), 1 neck remnant (0. 44 %), and 3 partial occlusions (1. 3 %). Mortality was 0 %. Early postoperative neurological deficit developed in 12 patients (6. 6 %); posterior circulation location was a significant risk factor for early neurological deficit (P,. 001). Middle cerebral artery aneurysms had the lowest rate of postoperative deficits at 1. 5 % (P =. 023). After the initial 30 -day perioperative period, all deficits related to treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms recovered; overall neurological morbidity decreased to 2. 7 % with no mortality. CONCLUSION: VSUIA clipping is highly effective and is associated with a low morbidity rate. For VSUIAs selected for treatment, our data <b>support</b> surgical <b>clipping</b> as the modality of choice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Several 3 D {{rendering}} {{techniques have}} been developed in which part of the final image {{is the result of}} rendering from a virtual camera whose position in the scene differs from that of the primary camera. In these situations, there is usually a planar surface, such as the reflecting plane of a mirror, that can be considered the physical boundary of the recursively rendered image. In order to avoid artifacts that can arise when rendered geometry penetrates the boundary plane {{from the perspective of the}} virtual camera, an additional clipping plane must be added to the standard six-sided view frustum. However, many 3 D graphics processors cannot <b>support</b> an extra <b>clipping</b> plane natively, or require that vertex and fragment shaders be augmented to explicitly perform the additional clipping operation. This paper discusses a technique that modifies the projection matrix in such a way that the conventional near plane of the view frustum is repositioned to serve as the generally oblique boundary clipping plane. Doing so avoids the performance penalty and burden of developing multiple shaders associated with user-defined clipping planes by keeping the total number of clipping planes at six. The near plane is moved without affecting the four side planes, but the conventional far plane is inescapably destroyed. We analyze the effect on the far plane as well as the related impact on depth buffer precision and present a method for constructing the optimal oblique view frustum. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Soil CO 2 flux was {{measured}} across 947 plots at 7 experimental grassland sites at the Cedar Creek Natural History Area {{in order to}} determine the relationships between soil CO 2 flux and environ-mental factors, living plant biomass, and soil C and N. Soil CO 2 flux increased as the day progressed, and was positively related to aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and soil % C. However, most of the variation in soil CO 2 flux explained by a multiple regression model (r 2 = 0. 55) was attributed to the different experimental sites (61 %). Soil CO 2 flux increased with increasing aboveground plant bio-mass (explaining 16 % of the model variation), belowground plant biomass (12 %), and soil C and C:N ratio (6 %). The length of time between aboveground biomass in a plot was clipped and soil CO 2 flux varied among plots. Soil CO 2 flux declined with increased time since <b>clipping,</b> <b>supporting</b> the idea that recently fixed carbon is a significant component of soil CO 2 flux. Soil CO 2 flux did not follow standard Q 10 relationships. Over a 20 °C temperature range, soil CO 2 flux tended to be lower in warmer plots. More work is necessary to understand what factors explain the large differences that were seen among experimental sites in soil CO 2 flux that could not be explained by biomass or soil properties...|$|R
