500|$|I'm {{so excited}} about the 'Alejandro' video, [...] Actually, we're {{shooting}} it very soon and I don't want to say who the director is yet because it's {{going to give a}} lot away. [...] Are you absolutely mad? I would never, ever tell you ! I {{would be more likely to}} lie through my teeth to you [...] what the video's about <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> all be surprised. But I will tell you it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|E
500|$|Bernardi {{suggested}} East St. Louis, Illinois, {{because it}} was filled with old buildings [...] "that exist in New York now, and [...] have that seedy run-down quality" [...] that the team was looking for. East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, [...] "block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places there was absolutely nothing, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see three and four blocks away." [...] As well, Alves found an old bridge to double for the [...] "69th St. Bridge". The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, [...] "so that they wouldn't have any liability," [...] Hill remembers. Locations across the river in St. Louis, Missouri were used, including Union Station and the Fox Theatre, both of which have since been renovated, as well as the building which would eventually become the Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Michele Clapton designed most of {{the newly}} introduced costumes and jewelry in [...] "The Winds of Winter". Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes. In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale. Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was [...] "immediately sure" [...] of how the dress should look. She stated in the interview, [...] "I {{knew it had to}} be leather and I knew it had to be linked to Tywin. I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim her ankles, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei." [...] She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a [...] "deadness inside her." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} side of the wood was a large deep river. The water flowed <b>so</b> rapidly <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} swim against the stream.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} levels of items. Common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary. Legendary items are <b>so</b> {{valuable}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{not find it}} a crate very much.|$|R
500|$|Production {{designer}} Carey Meyer {{built the}} ship Serenity {{in two parts}} (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed {{as part of the}} set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: [...] "...you could pull it away or move something huge, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made." [...] There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer, and that there were not [...] "fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back". He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was [...] "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home". As Joss Whedon discusses in the DVD commentary, each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that as you move {{from the back of the}} ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the tail of the ship.|$|E
500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E
2500|$|According to Tezuka, the {{prototype}} initially {{was not a}} side-scrolling game, and the player controlled a 16 by 32 pixel square. Tezuka only suggested the use of Mario after seeing the sales figures of Mario Bros., which was still selling well throughout the previous year since its release. The prototype was based around a shooting mechanic with very different controls. The sky-based bonus stages are a remnant of a level design where Mario jumped onto a cloud and fired at enemies. [...] They changed the game's focus to jumping action and they thus remapped the A button from shooting to jumping. After releasing Mario Bros., the team had reflected {{that it had been}} an illogical gameplay decision for Mario to be hurt by stomping upon the walking turtles, so they decided any future Mario game would [...] "definitely have it <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> jump on turtles all you want." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{the general}} public, Wallace {{was best known}} as a {{panellist}} throughout the 27-year run of the BBC radio panel game My Music, from 1967 to 1994, not missing a single episode of more than 520 that were broadcast. John Amis, who appeared opposite Wallace in the series, remembered, [...] "There were many pleasurable things about being in My Music.... One was that I was actually paid every week to listen to Ian's singing: ballads, folksongs, straight songs and opera, he sang them all <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> savour the words, and the actual sound was thrilling, a high bass-baritone with a marvellous, sonorous top F, a sound that went to the heart." [...] Occasionally Wallace would choose a rumbustious comic song, some of which he also included in his LP recordings, including [...] "The One Eyed Riley", [...] "I Can't Do My Bally Bottom Button Up", [...] "Never Do It at the Station", and the sewerman's song, [...] "Down Below".|$|E

6000|$|A {{moment of}} silence ensued, of silence <b>so</b> {{profound}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have heard a pin drop on the deck. Then Ransome's unperturbed voice uttered pleasantly the words: ...|$|R
60|$|Therefore one morning, after {{a breakfast}} <b>so</b> dainty <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} imagine it, Popopo {{set out for}} the earth and at once {{was in the midst of}} a big city.|$|R
60|$|They had Henry Mullins, the manager, on {{the stand}} {{for an hour and}} a half, and the {{excitement}} was <b>so</b> breathless <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have heard a pin drop. Nivens took him on first.|$|R

6000|$|... "Good," [...] said Mr. Wharton, {{but with}} no more enthusiasm than he had {{previously}} shown; [...] "I thought I had not misjudged you. Is your law business <b>so</b> onerous <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not go to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have acquired," [...] she complained, [...] "an air of unnatural reserve. You seem {{as though}} you had found some problem in life <b>so</b> weighty <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not lose sight of it even for a moment. Ah!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{if you let}} me past he {{will think}} that I ran by <b>so</b> quickly <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not stop me. He could not be very angry then, and I shall give you more money than you would lose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He'll find it, too, {{if it is}} to be done. I thought you'd like to know, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go {{out with}} me and the soldiers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{only some}} old soldier would turn up, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get your father's pension," [...] went on Mattie, [...] "that {{would be better}} than a reward." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{girls had}} tried their hand, {{but so far}} without much success. The first day it had been too thin. The next day <b>so</b> thick <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> cut it in slices. And both days it had been burned.|$|R

6000|$|... "Willie jibed {{with his}} name considerable. He weighed {{about as much as}} a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings, and he had a 'Where-is-Mary?' {{expression}} on his features <b>so</b> plain <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> almost see the wool growing on him.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood in}} the middle o' the road nearly {{opposite}} where the keeper was hiding, and sniffed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ha' 'eard him the other end o' the village.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Be quiet, Nicolo!' said another, {{and there}} was an awkward silence, during which Matteo and I looked at one another in surprise; and then {{everyone}} burst out talking, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not hear what was said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course going cheaply to {{work and}} buying the things secondhand, I should say I could pick up the things for you, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do very well," [...] Mrs. Grimstone said, [...] "for six or seven pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have I?" [...] said Nancy. [...] "I didn't take him, did I? He isn't {{a millionaire}} <b>so</b> hard <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> notice it, anyhow.
