5|$|In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission was {{launched}} by NASA. This spacecraft {{was designed to}} observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares {{during a time of}} high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the <b>solar</b> <b>corona</b> before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.|$|E
5|$|Plasma and ionised gases have unique {{properties}} and display behaviors unlike {{those of the}} other states, and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature and subject to interpretation. Based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density, partially ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced. Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionised plasma, along with the <b>solar</b> <b>corona</b> and stars.|$|E

In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought {{to be part of the}} heliopause. In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem with}} wave heating {{has been the}} {{complete}} absence, until the late 1990s, of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the <b>solar</b> <b>corona.</b> The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the <b>solar</b> <b>corona</b> was made in 1997 with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) {{for long periods of}} time with stable photometry. Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 millihertz (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfvén waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of the plasma in the chromosphere/transition region /inner corona is vital for the acceleration of the solar wind. With new theoretical descriptions of the <b>solar</b> atmosphere and <b>corona,</b> and the increased observational possibilities provided by the SOHO spacecraft, {{it is possible to}} conduct an integrated study of the <b>solar</b> atmosphere and <b>corona</b> using observational and theoretical approaches. Over the past few years a series of observational techniques have been used to estimate the solar wind densities, temperatures and flow speed in the inner corona. These estimates suggest that the solar wind has higher outflow speeds in the inner corona and lower densities than previously assumed. A comparison with densities derived from atmospheric models support these lower densities...|$|R
40|$|The heating of the <b>solar</b> {{chromosphere}} and <b>corona</b> is {{a long-standing}} puzzle in solar physics. Hinode observations show the ubiquitous presence of chromospheric anemone jets outside sunspots in active regions. They are typically 3 to 7 arc seconds = 2000 to 5000 kilometers long and 0. 2 to 0. 4 arc second = 150 to 300 kilometers wide, and their velocity is 10 to 20 kilometers per second. These small jets have an inverted Y-shape, {{similar to the}} shape of x-ray anemone jets in the corona. These features imply that magnetic reconnection similar to that in the corona is occurring at a much smaller spatial scale throughout the chromosphere and suggest that the heating of the <b>solar</b> chromosphere and <b>corona</b> may be related to small-scale ubiquitous reconnection.

25|$|The left photo shows a {{diffraction}} {{ring around}} the rising Sun caused by a veil of aerosol. This effect dramatically disappeared when the Sun rose high enough until the pattern was no longer visible on the Earth's surface.

25|$|The {{amount of}} power {{required}} to heat the <b>solar</b> <b>corona</b> can easily be calculated as the difference between coronal radiative losses and heating by thermal conduction toward the chromosphere through the transition region. It is about 1 kilowatt for every square meter of surface area on the Sun's chromosphere, or 1/40000 {{of the amount of}} light energy that escapes the Sun.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{proved to}} be correct and their naming of the phenomena became the international standard.

50|$|Solar {{activity}} and related events have been regularly recorded {{since the time}} of the Babylonians.

Thomas Harriot was the first to observe sunspots, in 1610. Observers confirmed the less-frequent sunspots and aurorae during the Maunder minimum.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, high {{resolution}} (<0.2″) soft X-ray imaging with the High Resolution Coronal Imager aboard a sounding rocket revealed tightly wound braids in the corona. It is {{hypothesized that the}} reconnection and unravelling of braids can act as primary sources of heating of the active <b>solar</b> <b>corona</b> to temperatures of up to 4 million kelvins. The main heat source in the quiescent corona (about 1.5 million kelvins) is assumed to originate from MHD waves.|$|E
25|$|Coronal loops are {{the basic}} {{structures}} of the magnetic <b>solar</b> <b>corona.</b> These loops are the closed-magnetic flux cousins of the open-magnetic flux {{that can be found}} in coronal hole (polar) regions and the solar wind. Loops of magnetic flux well-up from the solar body and fill with hot solar plasma. Due to the heightened magnetic activity in these coronal loop regions, coronal loops can often be the precursor to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).|$|E
25|$|Coronal {{seismology}} {{is a new}} way {{of studying}} the plasma of the <b>solar</b> <b>corona</b> with the use of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids—in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma. Philosophically, coronal seismology is similar to the Earth's seismology, the Sun's helioseismology, and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kinds are used to probe a medium. The potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field, density scale height, fine structure and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups.|$|E

Hi-C shows evidence of reconnection and heating in several different regions and magnetic configurations with plasma being heated to 0. 3 - 8 x 10 (exp 6) K temperatures. Surprisingly, many of the first results highlight plasma at temperatures that are not at the peak of the response functions...|$|R
