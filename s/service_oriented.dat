25|$|The Jacksonville Housing Authority (JHA) is the quasi-independent agency {{responsible}} for public housing and subsidized housing in Jacksonville. The Mayor and City Council of Jacksonville established the JHA in 1994 to create an effective, community <b>service</b> <b>oriented,</b> public housing agency with innovative ideas and a different attitude. The primary goal was to provide safe, clean, affordable housing for eligible low and moderate income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. The secondary goal was to provide effective social services, work with residents to improve their quality of life, encourage employment and self-sufficiency, and help residents move out of assisted housing. To that end, JHA works with HabiJax to help low and moderate income families to escape the public housing cycle and become successful, productive, homeowners and taxpayers.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} will {{be based}} on IBM's CloudBurst, which is an integrated service delivery platform that includes BladeCenter technology, storage, networking, virtualization and service management software. The workload-optimized system will provide JUST with a private cloud environment as a platform for innovation. IBM will also help to coordinate the centre and assist JUST in developing new curricula on key technology areas such as <b>Service</b> <b>Oriented</b> Architecture (SOA), Business Processes Management (BPM), Business Analytics, Business Processes Optimization (BPO), Service Science and Cloud Computing. IBM will use its expertise in these areas and draw on skills from its research and development laboratories to help develop educational resources and run workshops, courses, internships and certification programs. The initiative will support the university in driving skills and expertise in services science to the benefit of national schools, higher education and research establishments in Jordan and beyond.|$|E

The results suggest that shippers perceive tracing {{to be the most}} important service attribute of a web site, followed by customs response, vessel schedules, and electronic document service. Based on the concept of market segmentation, we employed cluster analysis to classify users (shippers) of web site services provided by liner shipping companies into four segments, namely support and performance <b>services</b> <b>oriented</b> firms, equipment information oriented firms, performance information oriented firms, and transaction <b>services</b> <b>oriented</b> firms. Theoretical and practical implications of the research findings are discussed. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

40|$|When <b>Services</b> <b>Oriented</b> Computing (SOC) {{approach}} is applied in enterprise application domain, the business processes are first modeled and then selected processes are implemented as <b>Services</b> <b>Oriented</b> Architecture (SOA) applications, e. g., web services. Planning techniques {{have been widely}} considered suitable for web services, e. g., for composition. Traditionally, the area of planning has looked at plans {{in the context of}} how they could be generated from the domain theory and problem specification. While synthesizing plans is useful and important, it puts heavy demands on how the information is modeled and available in the domain. In SOC, the domain is too complex to build explicit models for automated planning. Plan analysis and management looks at issues related to how plans, defined as a set of coordinated activities, are used after they are obtained and how they play a role in subsequent planning, without assuming planning to be automated or manual. We show that plan analysis can be the enabler of automated reasoning in <b>Services</b> <b>Oriented</b> Computing by helping in identifying business process improvement possibilities and then in identifying how web service implementations can be effectively created or assembled...|$|R
