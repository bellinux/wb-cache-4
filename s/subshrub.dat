500|$|Perovskia atriplicifolia is a {{deciduous}} perennial <b>subshrub</b> with an erect to spreading habit. Superficially, {{it resembles}} {{a much larger}} version of lavender. Multiple branches arise from a shared rootstalk, growing to a height of , with occasional specimens reaching [...] The mature plant may be [...] The rigid stems are square in cross-section, and are covered by an indumentum formed by stellate, or star-shaped, trichomes and oil droplets. Especially during autumn, these hairs give the stems a silvery appearance.|$|E
500|$|Perovskia atriplicifolia (...) , {{commonly}} called Russian sage, is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant and <b>subshrub.</b> Although {{not a member}} of Salvia, the genus of other plants {{commonly called}} sage, it is closely related to them. It has an upright habit, typically reaching , with square stems and grey-green leaves that yield a distinctive odor when crushed. It is best known for its flowers. Its flowering season extends from mid-summer to late October, with blue to violet blossoms arranged into showy, branched panicles.|$|E
500|$|The fungus {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with deciduous trees such as oak, birch and beech on chalky soils. It is also suspected of being a mycorrhizal associate of <b>subshrub</b> rock roses in the genus Helianthemum. Field studies indicate that the fungus, when paired as a mycorrhizal partner with seedlings of the conifer Cunninghamia lanceolata, increases the seedling's survival rate, augments its height and ground diameter, and increases the chlorophyll content in the leaves. A similar growth-enhancing effect had been noted earlier with Pinus taiwanensis seedlings. These beneficial effects on plant growth {{are a result of}} multiple interactions among the fungus, host plant, and indigenous soil microbes that increase the biomass of carbon, and increase the bacterial diversity in the mycorrhizosphere. In a study comparing the salinity resistance of three common ectomycorrhizal fungi (the others were Suillus bovinus and S.luteus), S.luridus was the most tolerant to high concentrations of salt, and is a good candidate species for the inoculation of tree seedlings to be planted on saline soil. [...] Fruit bodies grow singly or scattered on the ground, from June to November after summer rains. S.luridus may occur in parks near a single tree, though it will not be found in acidic soils.|$|E

2500|$|Eriophyllum latilobum {{occurs as}} a <b>subshrub</b> between 20 and 50 centimeters in height. [...] Its thin leaves are {{two to six}} centimeters in length, and have a diamond to obovate shape; the deeply triangular-lobed leaves are smooth on the top surface.

[...] The ray flowers number 6-13. [...] The rays surround 40-70 disc flowers, each three to four millimeters in diameter. [...] The strigose (hairy) fruit measures 3-4 millimeters (0.12-0.16 inches), and its pappus can vary between 0.3 and 1.0 millimeters (0.012-0.40 inches). [...] Disc scales are larger than the ray scales. [...] Chromosomes are characterized as: 2n=32.|$|E
