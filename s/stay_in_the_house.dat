5|$|The {{freehold}} {{of much of}} {{the southern}} side of the Pall Mall is owned by the Crown Estate. In addition to St. James's Palace, Marlborough House, which was once a royal residence, is its neighbour to the east, opening off a courtyard just to the south of the street. It was built for Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough who laid the foundation stone in 1709, with building complete by 1711. The house reverted to Crown ownership in 1817; the future King George V was born here in 1865 and briefly lived in the house as Prince of Wales during the reign of his father, Edward VII. It became government-owned in 1959 and houses now the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Commonwealth Foundation. The Prince Regent's Carlton House was built at the eastern end of Pall Mall in 1732 for Frederick, Prince of Wales and later inhabited by his widow, Princess Augusta. A ball was held at the house on 19 June 1811 to celebrate the start of the Prince's regency, but ultimately he did not decide to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> upon ascending the throne, and it was demolished. John Nash built Carlton House Terrace on its site between 1827–32.|$|E

25|$|On the 737 season, Enchong Dee was {{introduced}} {{as a new}} host; however, {{as part of the}} tradition of the program, he had to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> first and experience how the housemates are experiencing their stay inside the House. He later was allowed to exit the house; afterwards, he returned to his hosting stint as the show's hourly updater. On the other hand, Mariel Rodriguez returned to the show after five years to play as the last celebrity houseguest and later host the Big Nights marking her significant return as host, similar to that of what happened to Gonzaga in the first Teen Edition Big Night.|$|E
25|$|History {{indicates}} that Policarpa {{was not involved}} in politics before 1810, but by the time she moved back to Bogotá in 1817, she was actively participating in political issues. Because Bogotá was the stronghold of the Reconquista, where most of the population were Spanish Royalists and approved of the take over by Pablo Morillo, {{it was very difficult to}} get in and out of the city. Policarpa and her brother Bibiano entered the capital with forged documents and safeguards, and a letter of introduction written by Ambrosio Almeyda and José Rodríguez, two Revolutionary leaders; they recommended she and her brother <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano under cover of working as her servants. In reality Andrea Ricaurte's home was the centre of intelligence gathering and resistance in the capital.|$|E

25|$|Tagore {{was raised}} mostly by servants; {{his mother had}} died in his early {{childhood}} and his father travelled widely. The Tagore family was {{at the forefront of}} the Bengal renaissance. They hosted the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly. Tagore's father invited several professional Dhrupad musicians to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and teach Indian classical music to the children. Tagore's oldest brother Dwijendranath was a philosopher and poet. Another brother, Satyendranath, was the first Indian appointed to the elite and formerly all-European Indian Civil Service. Yet another brother, Jyotirindranath, was a musician, composer, and playwright. His sister Swarnakumari became a novelist. Jyotirindranath's wife Kadambari Devi, slightly older than Tagore, was a dear friend and powerful influence. Her abrupt suicide in 1884, soon after he married, left him profoundly distraught for years.|$|E
25|$|Next summer a Norwegian ship, led by Fritz Mack from Tromsø, left Norway {{to rescue}} the {{stranded}} men. Outside the house they found five dead bodies wrapped in a tarpaulin. On the door, which was locked from the inside, there was a sign with a warning not to enter. Inside there were dead bodies scattered in chairs, on beds and on the floor. All together the expedition found fifteen bodies, which were taken out and buried in their beds. Two more bodies were discovered {{by a group of}} researchers a few years later. One of the sealers, Karl Albertsen, had kept a diary during his <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The diary told that a man named Hans Hansen had been the first to die, in November. By Christmas everyone in the house was ill. The last diary entry was written on 19 April. It is assumed that Albertsen was the penultimate man to die.|$|E
500|$|In 1774, Joseph Webb Jr., also a {{successful}} merchant, married Abigail Chester {{and the couple}} remained in the house; they became well-known hosts and their house was nicknamed [...] "Hospitality Hall". The house's fame stems from George Washington's five night <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> where he planned the Siege of Yorktown that led to American Independence with French general Comte de Rochambeau. Smithsonian magazine writer Howard Hugh suggests that the red wool flock wallpaper in the bedchamber where Washington slept was hung {{in anticipation of the}} general's arrival.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Wintour and Littleton, {{on their}} way from Huddington to Holbeche House, were told by a {{messenger}} that Catesby had died. [...] At that point, Littleton left, but Thomas arrived at the house to find Catesby alive, albeit scorched. [...] John Grant was not so lucky, and had been blinded by the fire. [...] Digby, Robert Wintour and his half-brother John, and Thomas Bates, had all left. [...] Of the plotters, only the singed figures of Catesby and Grant, and the Wright brothers, Rookwood, and Percy, remained. [...] The fugitives resolved to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{and wait for the}} arrival of the King's men.|$|E
500|$|Catesby survived, albeit scorched. Digby left, {{ostensibly to}} give himself up, as did John Wintour. Thomas Bates fled, along with Robert Wintour. Remaining were Catesby (described as [...] "reasonably well"), Rookwood, the Wright brothers, Percy and John Grant, who had been so badly injured that his eyes were [...] "burnt out". They {{resolved}} to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{and wait for the}} arrival of the king's men. Catesby, believing his death to be near, kissed the gold crucifix he wore around his neck and said he had given everything for [...] "the honour of the Cross". He refused to be taken prisoner, [...] "against that only he would defend himself with his sword".|$|E
500|$|In August 1945, Northrup met L. Ron Hubbard for {{the first}} time. He had visited 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue {{at the behest of}} Lou Goldstone, a {{well-known}} science fiction illustrator, while on leave from his service in the US Navy. Parsons took an immediate liking to Hubbard and invited him to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> for the duration of his leave. Hubbard soon began an affair with Northrup after beginning [...] "affairs with one girl after another in the house." [...] He was a striking figure who habitually wore dark glasses and carried a cane with a silver handle, the need for which he attributed to his wartime service: as Northrup later put it, [...] "He was not only a writer but he was the captain of a ship that had been downed in the Pacific and he was weeks on a raft and had been blinded by the sun and his back had been broken." [...] She believed all of it, though none of his claims of wartime action or injuries were true.|$|E

500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E
500|$|Time {{magazine}} identified 38-year-old second-term congressman Kemp as {{a future}} leader in its 1974 [...] "Faces for the Future" [...] feature. Another early-career notable magazine appearance was in a 1978 issue of Esquire. The article explained allegations of homosexual activity among staffers in Ronald Reagan's Sacramento office in 1967; Kemp was not implicated. Kemp considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1980 and Hugh Sidey mentioned him as a contender to unseat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election and was a front runner for the vice presidency at the 1980 Republican National Convention, where he received 43votes from conservative detractors of George H. W. Bush. [...] After he was reelected for a sixth term in 1980, his Republican peers elected him to a party leadership position, and he served seven years {{as chairman of the}} House Republican Conference. This promotion occurred immediately after Kemp and David Stockman urged Reagan by memorandum to dedicate his first 100days to working on an economic package with Congress. Kemp considered running for Governor of New York in 1982 but ultimately decided to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> By 1984, many viewed Kemp as Reagan's heir apparent.|$|E

The league rewards those that blaze trails to new territory; in this case, the first St. Louis-area high school kids to ever play {{baseball}} at several prominent programs across the country. By coming back to the place where their journey started, they are creating two-way paths for others to follow in their footsteps [...] just like Lewis and Clark. With this program in place, players from states such as California and Texas [...] that had never before traveled to Missouri [...] are now playing in the LCBL.

2500|$|Baldwin was {{the first}} person to enter the Celebrity Big Brother house on January 3, 2010. The theme for this series was [...] "Hell", with a devil head on the front door. He {{frequently}} taunted the head by saying [...] "you're a loser". During his <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> he frequently read passages from the Bible to his fellow housemates. He also tried to convert eventual winner Alex Reid. He failed to win many fans and was evicted on January 22, 2010, becoming the fourth housemate to be evicted. In a three-way vote—against Ivana Trump and Sisqó—he received 50% of the public vote. After his eviction, the website restorestephenbaldwin dot org, unsolicited by him, began soliciting cash donations to improve Baldwin's career.|$|E

By November 1980 Lindy Morrison (ex-Xero) had joined the group on drums and backing vocals. By 1981 Forster and Morrison were also lovers, she later remembered [...] "Robert never took part in any group discussions ...
