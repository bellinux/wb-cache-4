40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} paper focused on the recovery of cobalt from mixed Co-Mn hydroxide precipitates (obtained from <b>sulphate</b> leach liquors <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> oxide ore), using ammonia-ammonium carbonate leaching. The characterization of the initial mixed hydroxide precipitates, as well as the corresponding leached residue was carried out by X-ray Diffraction, TG-DTA and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Cobalt and manganese precipitation was based on the statistical design and analysis of experiments, {{in order to determine the}} main effects and interactions of the precipitation factors, which were the equilibrium pH and the temperature. Co and Mn were precipitated as hydroxides at pH = 10. 5 and T = 25 degrees C. using 5 M NaOH as a neutralizing agent, by 99. 9 % and 99. 5 %, respectively. The main mineralogical phases were, Mn 3 O 4 (Hausmannite), gamma-Mn 3 O 4 and CoMn 2 O 4, while Co(OH) (2) and Mn(OH) (2) (Pyrochroite) were also present as minor constituents. Cobalt and manganese separation was based on selective cobalt recovery by ammonia-ammonium carbonate leaching of the produced mixed hydroxide precipitate. The factors studied were the ammonia-ammonium carbonate concentration and the solid to liquid ratio. The cobalt recovery efficiency reached 93 %. Mn 3 O 4 (Hausmannite) was the main mineralogical phase of the leached residue, while MnCO 3 (Rhodochrosite) and Mn 2 O 3 were also present.

40|$|Nanofiltration (NF) has {{attracted}} much attention {{over the past few}} years due to the reduced energy consumption compared to reverse osmosis (RO) and better separation performance compared to ultrafiltration (UF). Although research has been done in the area <b>of</b> NF <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> ions, sodium ions, and acid separation, not much attention has been given to the separation <b>of</b> high <b>nickel</b> concentrations from sulphuric acid streams. The use of NF for the separation <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> and acid from a spent nickel electrolyte is an innovative process alternative for future industrial application within a base metal refinery. In this study, the separation performance of a composite polyamide NF membrane on a spent nickel electrolyte was investigated by varying the sodium sulphate concentration in the feed (50 – 150 g/l), the trans-membrane pressure (35 - 55 bar), and cross-flow velocity (1. 5 - 3. 5 m/s), and measuring quantities such as total permeate flux, acid rejection, nickel rejection, and sodium rejection. The nickel and acid concentration in the feed were kept constant with variations between 40 - 60 g/l and 25 - 40 g/l respectively, while the temperature of the experiments was kept constant at 50 ˚C. The membrane was found to be very selective for nickel ions, with the rejection <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> ions varying between 54. 4 % and 98. 2 %. The rejection of acid ions varied between - 5. 9 % and 21. 8 %.

Acidification of surface- and groundwater and swelling may occur. During construction of a road tunnel through Gran, Norway, an alum shale deposit was established. Reducing conditions in the deposit groundwater are supposed to prevent weathering of alum shale, but it is uncertain if release of elements of environmental concern is primarily controlled by redox conditions. This study investigated the distribution of elements in alum shale from Gran and Jevnaker to understand the potential risk of release of these elements.
