40|$|We examine {{managerial}} decision horizons {{for target}} and acquirer firms in <b>stock</b> <b>financed</b> {{mergers and acquisitions}}. We find that acquirer CEOs have longer decision horizons than target firm CEOs in <b>stock</b> <b>financed</b> mergers. Acquirer CEOs in cash financed mergers and acquisitions also have longer decision horizons than target CEOs. Acquirer CEOs in both <b>stock</b> and cash <b>financed</b> mergers have significantly higher proportions of equity based compensation and significantly lower proportions of cash based compensation than target CEOs. In logistic regressions, measures of decision horizons for target and acquirer CEOs are not {{significantly related to the}} odds of <b>stock</b> <b>financing</b> in mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, measures of managerial decision horizons are not uniformly higher for stock acquirers or uniformly lower for stock targets on comparison with CEOs of firms of similar size. Our results do not offer strong support to the implications from the Shleifer and Vishny theory on the rationale for <b>stock</b> <b>financed</b> acquisitions.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the motives underlying the payment method in corporate acquisitions. The findings {{support the notion that}} the higher the acquirer's growth opportunities, the more likely the acquirer is to use <b>stock</b> to <b>finance</b> an acquisition. Acquirer managerial ownership is not related to the probability of <b>stock</b> <b>financing</b> over small and large ranges of ownership but is negatively related over a middle range. In addition, the likelihood of <b>stock</b> <b>financing</b> increases with higher preacquisition market and acquiring firm stock returns. It decreases with an acquirer's higher cash availability, higher institutional shareholdings and blockholdings, and in tender offers. Copyright 1996 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R
