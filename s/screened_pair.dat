40|$|The {{distribution}} of the electric microfield at a charged particle moving in a two-component plasma is calculated. The theoretical approximations are obtained via the parameter integration technique and using the <b>screened</b> <b>pair</b> approximation for the generalized radial distribution function. It is shown that the two-component plasma microfield distribution shows a larger probability of high microfield values than the corresponding {{distribution of}} the commonly used OCP model. The theory is checked by quasiclassical molecular-dynamics simulations. For the simulations a corrected Kelbg pseudopotential has been used.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the grand-canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics, we give an exact diagrammatic representation of the density profiles in a classical multicomponent plasma near a dielectric wall. By a reorganization of Mayer diagrams for the fugacity expansions of the densities, we exhibit how the long-range of both the self-energy and pair interaction are exponentially screened at large distances from the wall. However, the self-energy due to Coulomb interaction with images still diverges {{in the vicinity of the}} dielectric wall and the variation of the density is drastically different at short or large distances from the wall. This variation is involved in the inhomogeneous Debye-Hückel equation obeyed by the <b>screened</b> <b>pair</b> potential. Then the main difficulty lies in the determination of the latter potential at every distance. We solve this problem by devising a systematic expansion with respect to the ratio of the fundamental length scales involved in the two coulombic effects at stake. (The application of this method to a plasma confined between two ideally conducting plates and to a quantum plasma will be presented elsewhere). As a result we derive the exact analytical perturbative expressions for the density profiles up to first order in the coupling between charges. The mean-field approach displayed in Paper I is then justified. Comment: 37 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of infinite asymptotically uniform distributions of purely self-gravitating particles in one spatial dimension provides {{a simple and}} interesting toy model for the analogous three dimensional problem treated in cosmology. In this paper we focus on a limitation of such models {{as they have been}} treated so far in the literature: the force, as it has been specified, is well defined in infinite point distributions only if there is a centre of symmetry (i. e., the definition requires explicitly the breaking of statistical translational invariance). The problem arises because naive background subtraction (due to expansion, or by “Jeans swindle” for the static case), applied as in three dimensions, leaves an unregulated contribution to the force due to surface mass fluctuations. Following a discussion by Kiessling of the Jeans swindle in three dimensions, we show that the problem may be resolved by defining the force in infinite point distributions as the limit of an exponentially <b>screened</b> <b>pair</b> interaction. We show explicitly that this prescription gives a well defined (finite) force acting on particles in a class of perturbed infinite lattices, which are the point processes relevant to cosmological N -body simulations. For identical particles the {{dynamics of}} the simplest toy model (without expansion) is equivalent to that of an infinite set of points with inverted harmonic oscillator potentials which bounce elastically when they collide. We discuss and compare with previous results in the literature and present new results for the specific case of this simplest (static) model starting from “shuffled lattice” initial conditions. These show qualitative properties of the evolution (notably its “self-similarity”) like those in the analogous simulations in three dimensions, which in turn resemble those in the expanding universe...|$|E

40|$|We propose {{new types}} of density {{dependent}} contact pairing interaction which reproduce the pairing gaps in symmetric and neutron matter obtained by a microscopic treatment based on the nucleon-nucleon interaction. These interactions are able to simulate the pairing gaps of either the bare interaction or the interaction screened by the medium polarization effects. It is shown that the medium polarization effects cannot be cast into the density power law function usually introduced together with the contact interaction and require the introduction of another isoscalar term. The BCS-BEC crossover of neutrons pairs in symmetric and symmetric nuclear matter is studied by using these contact interactions. It is shown that the bare and <b>screened</b> <b>pairing</b> interactions lead to different features of the BCS-BEC crossover in symmetric nuclear matter. For the <b>screened</b> <b>pairing</b> interaction, a two-neutron BEC state is formed in symmetric matter at k_Fn∼ 0. 2 fm^- 1 (neutron density ρ_n/ρ_ 0 ∼ 10 ^- 3).
