5|$|At the {{juvenile}} <b>stage,</b> <b>a</b> teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult <b>stage,</b> <b>a</b> teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E

The royal dynasty, however, had a stabilizing effect on Poland's politics. The Jagiellonian Era is often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great prosperity, and in its later <b>stage,</b> <b>a</b> Golden Age of Polish culture.|$|E

5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg <b>stage,</b> <b>a</b> larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage.

After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E
