The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the <b>student</b> <b>support</b> of a small college with the resources of a major university.|$|E
5|$|Nehru died in May 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister of India. Shastri and {{his senior}} cabinet members Morarji Desai and Gulzari Lal Nanda were strong {{supporters}} of Hindi being the sole official language. This increased the apprehension that Nehru's assurances of 1959 and 1963 {{would not be}} kept despite Shastri's assurances to the contrary. Concerns over the preference of Hindi in central government jobs, civil service examinations and the fear that English would be replaced with Hindi as medium of instruction brought students into the anti-Hindi imposition agitation camp in large numbers. On 7 March 1964, the chief minister of Madras State, M. Bhaktavatsalam at a session of the Madras Legislative Assembly recommended the introduction of Three-language formula (English, Hindi and Tamil) in the state. Apprehension over the Three-language formula increased <b>student</b> <b>support</b> for the anti-Hindi cause.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Essex, Bercow was elected as the last {{national}} chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students (FCS), 1986–87. The FCS was then broken up by {{the chairman of the}} Conservative Party, Norman Tebbit, after one of its members had accused previous Tory PM Harold Macmillan of war crimes in extraditing Cossacks to the Soviet Union. Bercow attracted the attention of the Conservative leadership, and in 1987 he was appointed by Tebbit as vice-chairman of the Conservative Collegiate Forum (the successor organisation of the FCS) to head the campaign for <b>student</b> <b>support</b> {{in the run-up to the}} 1987 general election.|$|E

Macquarie University operated two libraries during the transition. The old library in building C7A closed {{at the end of}} July 2011 (which has since been repurposed as a <b>student</b> <b>support</b> and study space), and the new library in building C3C became fully operational on 1 August 2011. The new library was the first university library in Australia to possess an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS). The ASRS consists of an environmentally controlled vault with metal bins storing the items; robotic cranes retrieve an item on request and deliver it to the service desk for collection.|$|E

25|$|NC State's Main Campus {{has three}} sub-campuses: North Campus, Central Campus, and South Campus. North Campus {{is the oldest}} part of NC State and is home to most {{academic}} departments and a few residence halls. Central Campus is mainly residence halls, cafeterias, gymnasiums and <b>student</b> <b>support</b> facilities. Finally, Greek Court, the McKimmon Conference and Training Center, and student park-and-ride areas are found on South Campus. North and Central Campus are separated by the North Carolina Railroad. Pedestrian tunnels allow students to commute between campuses. Central and South Campuses are separated by Western Boulevard, a major downtown artery. University Housing divides Main Campus into West, Central, and East Campus for residence hall purposes. West and Central campuses are divided by Dan Allen Drive, while Central and East are divided by Morill Drive and Reynolds Coliseum.|$|E
25|$|The LSE Students' Union (LSESU) is {{affiliated}} to the National Union of Students and {{is responsible}} for campaigning and lobbying the School on behalf of students as well providing <b>student</b> <b>support</b> and the organisation and undertaking of entertainment events and student societies. It is often regarded as the most politically active in Britain – a reputation it has held since the well documented LSE student riots in 1966–67 and 1968–69, which made international headlines. In 2015, the School was awarded the top spot for student nightlife by The Guardian newspaper {{due in part to}} its central location and provision of over 200 societies, 40 sports clubs, a Raising and Giving (RAG) branch and a thriving media group. In 2013, the Union moved into a purpose-built new building – the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre on the Aldwych campus.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{selection}} process used to gain admission to the TAG Magnet; and, since one of the definitions of a TAG student is a national-norm reading score of “80” or higher, the school does not have students who read below grade level. However, since TAG requires an AP course (AP Human Geography) as freshman, the school does have {{students who do not}} read well enough to tackle a college-level course in their first year of high school. These students are referred to the <b>Student</b> <b>Support</b> Team (SST) for review. This leads to a parent-teacher-student conference attended by both the counselor and the principal. Parent, student, and teacher agree to work together as they check on progress achieved through tutoring before and after school. In some cases, additional projects are assigned to improve reading skills.|$|E
