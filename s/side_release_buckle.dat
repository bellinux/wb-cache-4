40|$|Injection Molding is {{a crucial}} segment of the {{plastics}} industry mainly due to its ability and flexibility to manufacture intricate components at high production rates and also with easy process flow. Injection molding has laid its hands over right from small parts to big machine parts. Plastic side release buckles, commonly employed in standard bags, suitcases and pouches, and are manufactured exclusively by the injection molding process all around the world. The process involved should be perfect enough to produce parts without defects and low quality. Gate location {{is one of the}} important in this process which is necessary for the filling purposes. In view of the significance of a perfect gate location for the plastic injection mold for the <b>side</b> <b>release</b> <b>buckle,</b> this paper focusses on the complete analysis of the buckle using a moldflow software and the determination of optimum gate locations for it. The analysis is complete look into the various quality features important for the mold, it considers identification and improvement of parameters such as fill time, quality, extent of packing and reduced defects and warpage. Utilization of the optimized gate locations for the mold lead to reduced production costs, higher quality and enhanced competitive power of mold enterprises...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringInertial {{release of}} the RCF- 67 <b>side</b> <b>release</b> <b>buckle</b> is {{investigated}} in this thesis through review of the literature, finite element modeling, and experimental testing. A finite element (FE) model is developed using the explicit non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA. The propensity of the buckle to unlatch under various combinations of acceleration pulse amplitudes, durations, and belt tension is simulated and profiled. The non-linear modal response of the spring {{is found to be}} significant contributor. The results are correlated and compared against experimental test data within the literature. Rate sensitive foam is added to the buckle model to demonstrate prevention of inertial release through addition of a damping element. The FE model predicts the performance of the buckle with high fidelity and granularity {{both before and after the}} rate sensitive foam is added. Laboratory impact sled testing is performed on both configurations to further corroborate the results of the model. A "whipping" effect is observed in the buckle housing acceleration data and high speed video which causes oscillation in the acceleration of the housing, where peak accelerations are also higher and pulse durations are longer measured at the buckle CG compared to those measured on the rigid mounting structure. The wealth of experimental and computational data found in the literature, combined with that obtained in this study, allows for insightful conclusions to be drawn regarding the unlatching potential of the RCF- 67 buckle as well as the effectiveness of adding rate sensitive foam to this buckle design. This modification to add damping provides a simple, inexpensive, and effective means of rendering a seat belt buckle safe under severe crash conditions where it may not otherwise perform as intended. Applicability to automotive seat belt buckle design in general is expanded on. LS-DYNA and the associated methodology used in this study proves effective in analyzing a buckle design for prevention of inertial release based on limited test data...|$|E

5000|$|The M-1910 haversack pack {{continued}} production {{during the}} interwar years with minor modifications and was issued to many {{troops in the}} early part of World War II due to M-1928 haversack shortages. [...] "An upgraded haversack was developed in 1928 that had quick <b>release</b> <b>buckles</b> and a web strap and buckle closure on the meat can pouch replacing the metal button. However, the M-1928 haversack did not go into production until 1940, and older haversacks continued to be issued until stocks were exhausted." [...] The M-1944 Combat Pack was developed from the much lighter and user-friendly US Marine Corps M-1941 Jungle pack which was developed during the Banana Wars which required a lighter pack in the tropics. The M-1944 pack had some shortcomings and a new M-1945 began replacing earlier packs in February 1945. The two packs had incompatible combat and cargo packs due to different <b>release</b> <b>buckles.</b>|$|R

The story had probably been sensationalized along the way, and many agreed that these were inflammatory charges with only hearsay evidence. On November 26, 1827 with Queen Regent Kaahumanu presiding, Richards was <b>released.</b> <b>Buckle</b> pointed out that the woman named Leoiki had come willingly, and they were now officially married. There were precedents at the time for English and Americans of high rank to marry Hawaiian noble women. For example, the respected John Young had taken a Hawaiian bride much earlier.|$|R
