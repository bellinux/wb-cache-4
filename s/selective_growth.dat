25|$|Cancer is {{the result}} of somatic {{mutations}} which provide cancer cells with a <b>selective</b> <b>growth</b> advantage. Recently it has been very important to determine the novel mutations. Genomics and proteomics techniques are used worldwide to identify mutations related to each specific cancer and their treatments. Computational tools are used to predict growth and surface antigens on cancerous cells. There are publications explaining a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk. Algorithm CanPredict was used to indicate how closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes. Cancer immunology has been given so much importance that the data related to it is growing rapidly. Protein–protein interaction networks provide valuable information on tumorigenesis in humans. Cancer proteins exhibit a network topology that is different from normal proteins in the human interactome. Immunoinformatics have been useful in increasing success of tumour vaccination. Recently, pioneering works have been conducted to analyse the host immune system dynamics in response to artificial immunity induced by vaccination strategies.. Other simulation tools use predicted cancer peptides to forecast immune specific anticancer responses that is dependent on the specified HLA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>growth</b> through {{dielectric}} masking {{is readily}} achieved using CBE {{as compared to}} its parent techniques of MBE and MOCVD. <b>Selective</b> <b>growth</b> is hard to achieve using elemental source MBE because group III atoms do not desorb readily after they are adsorbed. With chemical sources, the reactions associated with the growth rate are faster on the semiconductor surface than on the dielectric layer. No group III element can, however, arrive at the dielectric surface in CBE due {{to the absence of}} any gas phase reactions. Also, it is easier for the impinging group III metalorganic molecules to desorb {{in the absence of the}} boundary layer. This makes it easier to perform selective epitaxy using CBE and at lower temperatures, compared to MOCVD or MOVPE.In recent developments patented by ABCD Technology, substrate rotation is no longer required, leading to new possibilities such as in-situ patterning with particle beams. This possibility opens very interesting perspectives to achieve patterned thin films in a single step, in particular for materials that are difficult to etch such as oxides.|$|E

40|$|This work {{provides}} a {{detailed study of}} device structures and fabrication routes required for the realisation of lateral SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). After a comprehensive study of BJT and HBT device technologies our own designs of lateral SiGe HBT are introduced. The first design investigated is a device proposed in earlier work that utilises "SOI cavities" and confined <b>selective</b> epitaxial <b>growth.</b> Process and device characteristic simulations were performed for devices of modest lithographic mode and thick SOI suggested the device would be reach typical SiGe Hbt performance levels with a cut off frequency (fT) of 15 - 22 GHz, common emitter gain of 58 - 92 and maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 14 GHz. The fabrication {{of the types of}} lateral HBT that been have explored require detailed understanding and control of <b>selective</b> epitaxial <b>growth</b> and etching techniques and each of these two important processes have been developed. <b>Selective</b> epitaxy <b>growths</b> on different crystallographic planes and seed window alignments have been carried out, and, as would be expected, <b>selective</b> epitaxial <b>growth</b> rate are seen to vary for each crystal plane. These different growth rates lead to different facet formations on lateral growth fronts that can inhibit lateral growth rates and thereby prevent the formation of suitable structures for HBT design. A mathematical model is developed that enables a prediction of these growth phenomena. The epitaxy and etching development studies have allowed us to propose a new design of lateral SiGe HBT, based on non-selective growth on SOI sidewalls. Simulations of this new design indicate high-speed performance with fT /fmax of 395 / 983 GHz and 1. 58 ps ECL delay time on the 0. 13 mm lithographic node at collector currents of ~ 8 mA and a common emitter gain around 600.

Importantly, the length of ITO NWs was found to significantly influence the field emission properties.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} the fabrication by {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) of a mask with resolution down {{to a couple of}} tens of nanometers, which is suitable for <b>selective</b> area <b>growth</b> of II-VI compounds nanostructures. We introduce a new II-VI alloy system that is easy to be selectively grown at low temperature by metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) and to be engineered with different bandgap energies while being lattice-matched to GaAs substrates. Based on these two ingredients we demonstrate II-VI compound nanostructures obtained by <b>selective</b> area <b>growth.</b> High-resolution patterning {{is one of the key}} points for this approach. For this purpose a very thin carbonaceous mask deposited on a GaAs substrate is patterned by AFM. The carbonaceous film with a thickness of - 3 nm is locally deposited by electron-beam irradiation in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The carbonaceous film is patterned by anodization activated by the electric field applied between the tip and the substrate. The highest resolution that was obtained is about 20 nm. This two-instruments combination provides unmatched advantages for patterning such as the continuous monitoring of the patterning status and the extension of the area and resolution of the patterning as compared with the case when only one is employed. For the <b>selective</b> area <b>growth,</b> the II-VI compound semiconductors are chosen because they grow at low temperature and this system can cover a wide range of bandgap energies from UV to Green. In this direction, we propose for the first time the quaternary alloy ZnlVlgCdS and we demonstrate <b>selective</b> area <b>growth</b> of high-quality ZnMgCdS/ZnCdS heterostructures that are lattice-matched to GaAs substrates. Using the highest-resolution patterning and the newly developed alloys, arrays of quantum dots (- 26 nm) uniformly aligned (- 100 -nmpitch) providing densities as high as 1010 cm- 2 are demonstrated. The paper is structured as follows: Chapter 1 is an introduction to the field of nanostructures and current status in developing nanostructures and applications based on them. The technologies based on scanning probe techniques are given a special attention. Chapter 2 describes the AFM based lithography. AFM patterning by mechanic surface modification and electric-field induced anodization are treated. In the first section the mechanical approach is described. This is based on the plowing through a soft polymer resist for creating the patterns, which are subsequently transferred into the underlying SiO 2 layer by wet etching. The second approach described is based on the combination of SEM and AFM. The local masking technology relies on the deposition by electron-beam of - 3 nm thick carbonaceous film directly on the substrate surface in the SEM followed by the highresolution patterning by AFM anodization. In the mechanical patterning, the influences of the force value, the time sequence of the force application, and the SiO 2 thickness on the resolution of the patterns are discussed. In the electric field based patterning, the distribution of the electric field at the tip-film interface and the water meniscus geometry are estimated and the main parameters involved are discussed. The effects of modulation in polarity, amplitude, and frequency of the electric field during the patterning are analyzed in detail. A resolution of - 28 nm is demonstrated for the masks ready for <b>selective</b> area <b>growth.</b> A comparison between these two approaches is provided. Chapter 3 discusses the design of II-VI compound semiconductors suitable for bandgap engineering and low-temperature <b>selective</b> area <b>growth.</b> After a brief introduction of the growth method, the main advantages of the II-VI materials are presented. A new alloy system ZnMgCdS/ZnCdS that can be grown lattice-matched to GaAs is introduced. Structural, morphological and optical properties of the grown alloys and control of the Mg composition are discussed for different growth conditions. The influence of the nucleation and initial growth on the structural and optical properties of the alloys is emphasized. Chapter 4 is focused on the nanoscale <b>selective</b> area <b>growth.</b> The specific points of the nanoscale <b>selective</b> area <b>growth</b> are presented. The nucleation issue is discussed together with the means to overcome it. MOMBE growth of arrays of dot-like nanostructures based on the ZnMgCdS/ZnCdS alloys is demonstrated. The summary of the current work and a proposal for future devices based on this technology are given in Chapter 5. As a future application of this research a new design for ultra-small cavity light emitting devices in the blue region that are ready for monolithic integration is proposed. The proposed ring structure will have a high coupling efficiency of the spontaneous emission into the cavity modes. This is achieved by minimizing the cavity volume to support a few resonance modes and by facilitating the light emission only at the antinodes of the cavity optical field. The fabrication of the ultra-small ring structure is possible only by AFM lithography and <b>selective</b> area <b>growth</b> since the geometrical and the structural quality requirements are very tight...|$|R
