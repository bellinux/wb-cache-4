Goals of this retrospective study were to test interobserver agreement for MRI measurements of optic nerve sheath diameter and associations between optic nerve sheath diameter, signalment data, and presumed intracranial hypertension status in a cohort of dogs. A veterinary radiologist interpreted scans of 100 dogs and dogs were assigned to groups based on {{presence or absence of}} at least two MRI characteristics of presumed intracranial hypertension. Two observers who were unaware of group status independently measured optic nerve diameter from transverse T 2 -weighted sequences. Mean optic nerve sheath diameter for all dogs was 3 mm (1 - 4 mm). The mean difference between observers was 0. 3 mm (limits of agreement, - 0. 4 and 1. 0 mm). There was no correlation between optic nerve sheath diameter and age for either observer (r = - 0. 06 to 0. 00) but a moderate positive correlation was observed between optic nerve <b>sheath</b> diameter and <b>body</b> weight for both observers (r = 0. 70 - 0. 76).

40|$|This {{research}} was stimulated by pastoral concerns {{pertaining to the}} South African Hindu Community. It {{was found that the}} community had a noticeable number of individuals stagnant or stranded at the level of gross spirituality. On the other hand it is known that the primary texts of Hinduism and its long mystical traditions, from the Vedic Period to the Neo-Vedanta Movement, had adequate motivational and goal-orientated material to address this challenge. This work surveys the Vedic and Upanishadic texts in order to show the literary, social and philosophical conditions under which they were produced. Hindu mysticism emerges from all these strands of development. Gross mysticism in the form of elaborate rituals occupies the attention of the early Vedic seers. This graduates into subtle subjective mysticism in the Upanishads. At each phase there is a paradigm shift which this study interprets in the light of Shankara (medieval period) and Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan of the Neo-Vedanta Movement. In the early Vedic period the soul is a metaphysical entity. Upon death it is judged in accordance with its good or bad actions. Heavenly rewards or the punishment of hell are meted out to it. Heaven and hell are final eschatological goals for the soul in the Vedic period. In the Upanishadic period heaven and hell are temporary eschatological goals. The ultimate Upanishadic goal is Liberation which implies the mystical cessation of empirical existence and the realization of Unitary Consciousness. The Taittiriya Upanishad defines the soul analytically as a formulation of five <b>sheaths</b> : <b>body,</b> vital energy, mind, intellect and bliss with an immortal consciousness as its divine focus. These sheaths are fundamental to Hindu sacred psychology. Functioning under the effects of ignorance each sheath binds the soul to mundane existence. However, each sheath also possesses an intrinsic capacity to liberate the soul from suffering. This research explores the limitations and opportunities of each sheath and indicates the path by which the soul's divine potential may be realized. In the light of the Neo-Vedantic outlook this process is considered with a life-affirming attitude which is of relevance to South African Hindus. Religious Studies and ArabicD. Lit et Phil.

The cilia contain nine outer, nine secondary, and two central fibers, such as have been described previously in other material. Each outer fiber is a doublet with one subfiber bearing arms. One particular pair of outer fibers (numbers 5 and 6) are joined together by a bridge. The two central fibers are enclosed by a central sheath; also present in this region is a single, small mid-fiber. The different groups of fibers are connected together by radial links that extend from the outer to the secondary fibers, and from the secondary fibers to the central <b>sheath.</b> The basal <b>body</b> consists of a cylinder of nine triplet fibers. Projecting from it on one side is a dense conical structure called the basal foot. The cylinder of outer fibers continues from the basal body into the cilium, passing through a complex transitional region in which five distinct changes of structure occur at different levels. There are two sets of fibers associated with the basal bodies: a pair of striated rootlets that extends from each basal body down into the cell, and a system of fine tubular fibers that runs parallel to the cell surface. The relationship between fine structure and direction of beat is the same in all four types of cilia examined. The plane of beat is perpendicular to the plane of the central fibers, with the effective stroke toward the bridge between outer fibers 5 and 6, and toward the foot on the basal body...|$|R

Females of the parasites in study were obtained by deworming or necropsy. After parasitic identification eggs were collected from each female and were cultured by modified Mönning technique, resulting in L 3 larvae after eight days at 26 - 28 °C. For the present work females from the following species were considered: Craterostomum acuticaudatum, Poteriostomum imparidentatum, Poteriostomum ratzii, Strongylus edentatus, Strongylus vulgaris, Triodontophorus brevicauda, Triodontophorus serratus and Triodontophorus tenuicollis. The objective of the present work was to define morphological parameters to be considered in morphometric identification of Strongylidae of horses. L 3 larvae morphological parameters as, total length of the larvae (with sheath), excretory pore (distance from excretory pore to anterior end), sheath tail length (distance from the anus to the sheath posterior end), maximum larvae width), length of oesophagus, tail length (without sheath) and distal portion (distance from tail end to sheath tail end) were registered. Statistical analyses with Kruskal-Wallis test and Tukey test show {{that it is possible to}} use the considered parameters to distinguish the species concerned because there are significant differences between them. Multinomial regression analyses reveal the most relevant parameters to morphometric specific identification.

From this group 24 of them were subjected to work for 24 days. Empty body weight (EBW) was calculated by subtracting the weight of gut content from slaughter weight. The coefficient of correlation on slaughter with empty body weight and hot carcass weight were 0. 98 and 0. 96 respectively. The regression of body components (empty body weight, carcass weight, lean, fat, bone, hump, external and internal offal) on slaughter weight gave better relationship {{than the rest of}} the body parts. The weights of body composition of one livestock unit (LU= 250 kg live weight) using derived equation from live weight indicated that empty body weight was 86 % while hot carcass was 51 % of body weight.

40|$|The {{structure}} of undischarged and discharged trichocysts has been examined in Paramecium caudatum, and their light-microscopic appearance {{compared with their}} fine-structural organiza-tion. In living specimens undischarged trichocysts appear to be of a single type with a unimodal variation in length about a mean of 37 fim. When fixed for electron microscopy or compressed beneath a coverslip many of the trichocysts expand within the cell, giving rise {{to a variety of}} different forms of lower phase density. Ultrastructurally the undischarged trichocyst consists of at least 10 different components: these include a mesh-like <b>sheath</b> surrounding the <b>body</b> of the organelle; an inner and an outer sheath enclosing the tip, the inner sheath being made up of 4 spiralling envelopes with a square net substructure, and the outer sheath being formed of a dense amorphous matrix containing longitudinal microtubules and scattered fine filaments; a boundary surface to the outer sheath; a membranous trichocyst sac the apical region of which is surrounded by a cylinder of micro-tubules joined to each other with dense material; and lastly, the crystalline matrix of the trichocyst body and tip. This crystalline appearance is apparently related to the presence of a loosely interwoven complex of fine filaments which form a highly regular pattern of unit structures repeating at 16 -nm intervals. In extended trichocysts the 60 -nm banding pattern of the body is also composed of fine filaments arranged in a different, elongated manner in 2 distinct and alternating patterns which are taken to be 2 views of the same structure. Measurements indicate that when trichocysts extend they elongate by a factor of from 6 to 8. It is proposed that the crystalline pattern of the unextended trichocyst body transforms into the extended form by a simple rearrangement of the constituent filaments accompanied by their elongation.

40|$|This resarch was {{stimulated by}} {{pastoral}} concerns regarding {{the high rate}} of suicide in the South African Hindu community. On the one hand it was found that traumatized individuals contemplating suicide were woefully ill-equipped with helpful religious guidelines and on the other it is known that the primary and authoritative scriptures of Hinduism possess a wealth of information that can promote healing. This work uses the Taittiriya Upanishad (3. 10. 5) to address this challenge. The early Vedic writings are not systematized nor are they fully explicable except through commentaries. This research surveys the early Vedic and Upanisadic Writings in order to show the literary, social and philosophical conditions under which the texts were produced. The Taittiriya Upanisad is the culminating part of several strands of thought that emerged from the earlier Taittiriya School. In order to interpret the text of this Upanisad it was necessary to link its key concepts with other Upanisads of this period. Further interpretations emerged from later Upanisads. These texts were viewed in the light of several commentators - Shaukara (medieval period), and Vivekananda, Aurobindo and Radhakrishuan of the Neo-Vedanta movements. In the early Vedic period the soul is a metaphysical entity. Upon death it is judged and in accordance with its good or bad actions, heavenly rewards or the punishments of hell are meted out to it. Heaven and hell are final eschatological goals for the soul in the Vedic period. In the later Vedic or Upanisadic period it is found that heaven and hell are temporary eschatological goals. The ultimate goal becomes Liberation which implies the cessation of duality and the realization of non-duality. Correspondingly the Taittiriya Upauisad defines the soul in a manner in which its components have the potential to achieve this later goal. Here the soul is a formulation of five <b>sheaths</b> : <b>body,</b> vital energy, mind, intellect and bliss with an immortal consciousness as its focus. Functioning under the effects of ignorance each sheath binds the soul to suffering and rebirths either on earth or on other planes (heaven or hell). However, each sheath also possesses an intrinsic capacity to liberate the soul from suffering. Ibis work explores these negative and positive capabilities of the sheaths and points out the path by which the soul's divine potential may be realized. The nltinoate healing or liberation occurs when the 'focusconsciousness' of the soul is intuitively realized. This consciousness is one with the universal consciousness. This achievement produces the 'liberated soul' who experiences ecstasy at this knowledge of oneness. This research also points out that the Neo-Vedanta movements, unlike their medieval counterparts, have a life-affirming and positive social attitude that seeks to draw from ancient texts for the purposes of healiug and social upliftment. ...|$|R
30|$|Skin is the {{outermost}} protecting <b>sheath</b> of human <b>body</b> {{and is in}} direct contact with the external environment which makes it highly susceptible to injury. Skin defects or wounds are common which may result from trauma, skin diseases, burn or removal of skin during surgery (Coyer et al. 2015). Such circumstances require immediate therapeutic interventions to regain the structure and function of the skin and allow the usual mobility of the patient. Superficial wounds can lead to the bacterial invasion and related complications if not treated immediately (Horiuchi et al. 2010). Moreover, even minor deformities bring psychological distress on the affected individuals, especially to children. The best option of skin tissue engineering is the use of autografts though it is limited by the amount and size of available grafts besides other factors such as creation of a secondary wound and other risks (Zöller et al. 2014). Other types of skin grafts such as allografts and possibly xenografts are associated with the risks of immune reactions and transmission of diseases besides some ethical and cultural issues (Nunery 2001). Wound dressing materials such as those based on polymers or their combinations with other substances have largely been developed but they are not living and hardly can be cellularized and replaced by native tissue (Abrigo et al. 2014). In this regard, tissue engineering holds great promises for improving the treatment of skin defects by providing solutions for the challenges such as lack of multi-layered native skin architecture and vascular networks in the constructs (Jank et al. 2017). This approach provides some solutions where besides biomaterial, living cells, biological or chemical signals are being used with the purpose of forming functional skin (Metcalfe and Ferguson 2007 b). However, such conventional tissue engineering approaches suffer from inherent problems of non-homogeneous distribution of cells, failure to integrate and vascularize upon implantation with subsequent rejection of the implanted biomaterial along with formed skin (Verseijden et al. 2010). Although, some tissue engineered skin products are in market, many limiting factors such as vascularization through the skin substitute which remains a major and critical limiting factor in the clinical success (MacNeil 2007).|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Endovascular {{replacement}} of failed Vanguard endoprosthesis with a newly inserted bifurcated Excluder endograft in 6 selected patients over a 10 -year period is reported. REPORT: Six male patients were treated by secondary EVAR procedures for endograft failure (type I and/or III endoleaks caused by endograft disintegration and/or migration). All failed endografts (1 tube, 5 bifurcated) were Vanguard prostheses. Technically, a new bifurcated Excluder endograft was placed within the old failing Vanguard endograft. All reinterventions were performed under local anesthesia supplemented by systemic analgesia/sedation. In 3 patients, insertion {{of the new}} Excluder endograft was possible without any additional technical measure as the failing Vanguard endograft trunk had migrated distally. In another 3 patients, the failed Vanguard endograft trunk was still in place. In these patients, the Vanguard main body was pulled caudally with a transfemoral cross-over guide wire {{in order to gain}} sufficient length to allow the short limb of the Excluder endograft to open within the trunk of the failed Vanguard endoprosthesis. This guide wire was introduced through a second femoral 5 F in the main access and exeteriorized with a snare through the contralateral 12 Fr <b>sheath.</b> The main <b>body</b> and short limb of the Excluder was then deployed whilst pulling on the cross-over wire. RESULTS: Six patients initially treated by a Vanguard endograft underwent complete relining with a newly inserted Excluder bifurcated stentgraft. The mean interval from the first EVAR procedure to the described replacement procedure was 75 +/- 20. 2 months (range: 53 - 109). The new bifurcated Excluder endografts were successfully deployed in all patients (technical success: 100 %). Primary sealing (defined as absence of endoleaks type I, III or IV in the postoperative contrast enhanced CT scan) was achieved in 6 of the 6 patients. There was no operative mortality. No further endovascular or open treatment was needed in the other 5 patients. During the mean follow-up period of 26 +/- 20. 1 months (range 2. 5 - 50 months), 2 patients died from unrelated causes. CONCLUSION: Secondary endovascular {{replacement of}} failed Vanguard endografts with a bifurcated Excluder endograft proved to be feasible and safe with no 30 -day mortality. Technical detail requires traction on a cross-over wire to pull the old graft caudally and create enough space for the new bifurcated graft to be deployed...|$|R
