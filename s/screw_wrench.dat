In 1836 the Coes brothers purchased the business, and formed the L. & A. G. Coes Company as a partnership. In October 1839 the facility where they worked was destroyed by a fire. The Coes brothers were unable to continue in businesses so they moved to Springfield, Massachusetts to work as pattern makers in the foundry of Laurin Trask.

30|$|The last {{category}} is the transmission indices {{based on the}} screw theory [31, 32]. Considering the virtual coefficient is dimensionless and independent of the coordinate system, the virtual coefficient between input and output <b>wrench</b> <b>screws</b> {{is defined as the}} transmission factor, and used to evaluate kinematic performance of the spatial mechanism [33]. Then, the transmission factor is unitized [34], and the generalized transmission <b>wrench</b> <b>screw</b> is proposed [35, 36]. Chen et al. introduced the generalized transmission index and analyzed spatial linkages [37]. Further, input and output transmission indices as well as the total transmission index are proposed [38]. Above indices focus on the analysis of the input power efficiency of the driving joint and the output power efficiency of the branch. The power is calculated through the reciprocal product of twist and <b>wrench</b> <b>screws.</b> Screw theory is a powerful and systematic mathematical tool. However, definition and calculation of these indices are quite complicated, and not intuitive.|$|R

40|$|Mathematical and {{mechanical}} entities such as line vectors, <b>screws</b> and <b>wrenches</b> can be conveniently represented {{within the framework}} of dual algebra. Despite the applications received by this type of algebra, less developed appear the numerical linear algebra algorithms within the field of dual numbers.

It will be proposed an original application to finite and infinitesimal rigid body motion analysis...|$|R
50|$|Many screws use a {{screwdriver}} head fitting, {{rather than an}} external wrench. Screwdrivers are applied in-line with the fastener, {{rather than from the}} side. These are smaller than most wrench heads and cannot usually apply the same amount of torque. It is sometimes assumed that screwdriver heads imply a <b>screw</b> and <b>wrenches</b> imply a bolt, although this is incorrect. Coach screws are large square-headed screws with a tapered wood screw thread, used for attaching ironwork to timber.|$|R
25|$|In geometry, Plücker coordinates, {{introduced}} by Julius Plücker in the 19th century, {{are a way}} to assign six homogeneous coordinates to each line in projective 3-space, P3. Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a one-to-one correspondence between the 4-dimensional space of lines in P3 and points on a quadric in P5 (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of Grassmann coordinates (which describe k-dimensional linear subspaces, or flats, in an n-dimensional Euclidean space), Plücker coordinates arise naturally in geometric algebra. They have proved useful for computer graphics, and also can be extended to coordinates for the <b>screws</b> and <b>wrenches</b> {{in the theory of}} kinematics used for robot control.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the <b>screws</b> and <b>wrenches,</b> Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square head set screw refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a hexagon socket head hollow set screw, for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly." [...] (These transitional growing pains echo those experienced many decades later with the adoption of the Torx drive).|$|R

50|$|The {{force and}} torque vectors {{that arise in}} {{applying}} Newton's laws to a rigid body can be assembled into a <b>screw</b> called a <b>wrench.</b> A force has a point of application and a line of action, therefore it defines the Plücker coordinates of a line in space and has zero pitch. A torque, on the other hand, is a pure moment that is not bound to a line in space and is an infinite pitch screw. The ratio of these two magnitudes defines the pitch of the screw.|$|R

He tried to remember just exactly how he had hidden those tools. He tried to persuade himself they were certainly and surely hidden, but his memory began to play antics. Had he really left the handle of the wrench sticking out, shining out at the fork of the branch? ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is first}} {{shown that the}} scalar product on any {{orthogonal}} space (V, g) allows one to define linear isomorphisms of the vector spaces of bivectors and 2 -forms on V with the underlying vector spaces of the Lie algebra so(p, q) and its dual, respectively. When those isomorphisms are applied to the electromagnetic excitation bivector and field strength 2 -form, resp., one can associate various algebraic constructions that pertain to them as bivector fields and 2 -forms with corresponding constructions in terms of so(1, 3) and its dual. The subsequent association with corresponding things in line geometry will then become straightforward. In particular, the fields can be represented by motors, such as <b>screws</b> and <b>wrenches,</b> while the Cartan-Killing form on so(1, 3) is isometric to the scalar product on bivectors that gives the Klein quadric. When the space of bivectors (and therefore the space of 2 -forms) is given an almost-complex structure (and therefore, a complex structure), one can also represent most of the constructions on the former and its dual in terms of so(3; C) and its dual.

5000|$|Matco Tools, Inc. is an American {{professional}} tool distributor for {{the automotive}} and other industries [...] {{and is based}} in Stow, Ohio, United States. This includes over 13,000 different tools such as <b>wrenches,</b> <b>screw</b> drivers, gauges, and specialty tools. Matco produces their own line of high quality toolboxes in the USA at their Jamestown, NY manufacturing plant. They do not manufacture any of their tools,they do rebrand and contract other manufactures to make tools for them.They also contract several Chinese factories to manufacture their air tools, electric, and diagnostic tools. They also carry a similar lifetime warranty on all hand tools. [...] The company was founded in 1946 and began selling direct to professional mechanics in 1979. Matco is an acronym for Mac Allied Tool Company. Originally Matco was the box manufacturing division of Mac Tools. However, {{they have not been}} associated with Mac since 1979. Former corporate owner Danaher spun off several subsidiaries, including Matco, in 2016 to create Fortive.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{isotropic}} compliance {{property is}} {{examined in the}} Special Euclidean Group SE(3). The relation between the wrench and the resulting twist is examined, considering an end-effector of 6 D. O. F. serial manipulators. Two properties are introduced. The first one, called local isotropic compliance, is verified if the force vector {{is parallel to the}} tip point displacement vector, and, at the same time, if the torque vector is parallel to the change of orientation vector. The second one, called screw isotropic compliance, is verified if the <b>wrench</b> <b>screw</b> axis is parallel to the twist screw axis. In the latter case, the <b>wrench</b> and twist <b>screw</b> axes are generally not coincident in the Cartesian space. If they are, the contact point could (screw-B isotropic compliance) or could not (screw-A isotropic compliance) belong to the coincident axes. Four cases are analyzed and classified. Active stiffness regulation is considered to achieve isotropic compliance in a generic configuration. Two arrangements are taken into account for the control system, which acts either in parallel or as a series with the passive joint stiffness. The control stiffness matrix is then determined for both the arrangements and for all the four kinds of isotropic compliance. One detailed example of application is presented and the obtained results are verified by using multi-body dynamic simulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for computing the transmission index of parallel mechanisms. The approach {{is based on an}} extended concept to compute the maximal virtual coefficient, which is an important notion involved in the formulation of dimensionally homogeneous transmission indices for singularity analysis and dimensional optimization of parallel mechanisms. By exploiting the dual property of the virtual coefficient, two characteristic points instead of one as in {{the current state of the}} art are defined: one characteristic point – termed the transmission characteristic point – is located on the ‘floating’ axis of the transmission wrench, as in existing approaches, while a second one – termed the output characteristic point – is located on the floating axis of the output twist of the platform, which is a novel concept. This allows one to define two characteristic lengths, namely, the transmission and output characteristic lengths, respectively, of which the larger is then used for the measure of the “distance” between the transmission <b>wrench</b> <b>screw</b> and the output twist screw. As shown in this paper, this new measure makes it possible to discern more finely the configuration-dependent properties of kinematic performance of parallel mechanisms, thus making it more suitable for dimensional optimization. Confidence in this statement is demonstrated through the comparative study of two in-parallel mechanisms using the new method and previously existing ones...|$|R
