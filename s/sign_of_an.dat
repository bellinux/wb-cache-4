5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
5|$|As archbishop, William {{undertook}} {{a number of}} ecclesiastical reforms, and became popular {{with the people of}} York. However, he still needed a pallium, the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archbishop's authority from the pope, which he had not yet received. The Cistercians, who were still adamantly opposed to his being archbishop, were determined to prevent his receiving it. William travelled to Rome in an attempt to obtain the pallium. The election of Pope Eugene III, a Cistercian, in 1145, was a setback for his cause. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous Cistercian abbot and religious leader, exerted all his influence to ensure William's suspension, sending a series of complaints to the new pope that William had been intruded by secular powers into the see, that he was oppressing the Cistercian monasteries and that he had irregularly appointed William of St. Barbara as Dean of York. In the winter of 1145–46 Eugene re-examined the case, declared that William had not been validly consecrated, and suspended him from office. William was required to obtain an in-person refutation of the old charges by William of St. Barbara, who was now the Bishop of Durham.|$|E
5|$|Bradman was on 89 {{and heading}} towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time {{courtesy}} of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but the seamer's leg cutter moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. Bedser had dismissed Bradman all four times {{so far in the}} Test series. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 after Australia had lost 3/33. The tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss, Miller striking one six over square leg into the grandstand. He had also offered two chances, but none of the catches were completed. This gave Australia a lead of 478 {{at the end of the}} third day, with Miller on 22 and Brown on 7. In all, England had missed seven catches or stumpings. O'Reilly said the loss of three quick wickets in the afternoon was not so much a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> English revival but Australian complacency due to the large size of the lead.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} this night from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was known he was ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI vectored Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former ground radar operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and adjusted his speed to match the German pilot. After closing the range as much as he dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{appointed}} Lord Chancellor of England in 1085, and {{was present at}} William I's deathbed in 1087. He continued as Chancellor to William Rufus until 1092; what precipitated his loss of office is unclear. He retained the king's trust, for Rufus employed him in 1095 along with William Warelwast on a diplomatic mission to Pope Urban II regarding Archbishop Anselm receiving the pallium, the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archbishop's authority. Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the Antipope Clement III in return for Anselm's deposition and the delivery of Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody, to dispose of as he saw fit. The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by Whitsun with a papal legate, Walter the Cardinal Bishop of Albano, who had Anselm's pallium. The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm's deposition. Rufus resigned himself to Anselm's position as archbishop, and at the king's court at Windsor he consented to Anselm being given the pallium.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E

5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E
5|$|The crisis deepened on 10 October 1970, when Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham {{announced}} that Sobers {{would not be}} allowed to enter Guyana until he apologised. This was a major issue for the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) as the team played at least one Test match a year in Georgetown, the Guyanese capital. The Jamaica Labour Party called for Sobers to resign as captain four days later; Indira Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister, then {{announced that}} if Sobers were not removed from the West Indies team, India would cancel its upcoming tour of the West Indies, scheduled for early 1971. The WICB considered its options. Cancelling matches in Guyana might prompt Burnham to instruct Guyanese members of the West Indian team to boycott, and sacking Sobers might cause Barbados to withdraw in protest; either way, the unity of the West Indies team was threatened. Meanwhile, no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> apology emanated from Sobers.|$|E

25|$|The {{implementation}} of DRS {{in this series}} resulted in several controversies, mostly relating {{to the use of}} the Hot Spot technology. The most high-profile occurred in the first innings of the third Test: Usman Khawaja was given out caught-behind by on-field umpire Tony Hill, and reviewed the decision; Hot Spot showed no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> edge, and many observers noted that visual evidence also appeared to show that Khawaja did not edge the ball, but the decision was not overturned. Cricket Australia requested a formal explanation of the decision from the ICC following the match, and the decision was heavily criticised in Australian media. Kevin Pietersen was dismissed in similar circumstances in the second innings of the same match.|$|E
25|$|Swelling of {{a volcano}} signals that magma has {{accumulated}} near the surface. Scientists monitoring an active volcano will often measure {{the tilt of}} the slope and track changes {{in the rate of}} swelling. An increased rate of swelling, especially if accompanied by an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions and harmonic tremors is a high probability <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impending event. The deformation of Mount St. Helens prior to the May 18, 1980 eruption was a classic example of deformation, as {{the north side of the}} volcano was bulging upwards as magma was building up underneath. Most cases of ground deformation are usually detectable only by sophisticated equipment used by scientists, but they can still predict future eruptions this way.|$|E
25|$|Peirce's {{theory of}} signs {{is known to}} be one of the most complex {{semiotic}} theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign — not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The sign relation is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its object, and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its interpretant (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible triadic relation, according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.|$|E

25|$|Still, {{it may be}} doubted {{whether this}} {{multiplication}} of fast-days can {{be taken as a}} <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increased tendency to Asceticism. Probably the theory of Robertson Smith (The Religion of the Semites, p.413) still holds good to a large extent in explanation of many of the fast-observances of later Judaism, as undoubtedly it does for the voluntary and occasional fast-days mentioned in the historical books of the Bible; namely, that Oriental fasting is merely a preparation for the eating of the sacrificial meal. The rabbinical injunction, not to eat too late a meal {{on the eve of the}} Sabbath-day, so as to enjoy all the more that of the Sabbath, tends to corroborate the theory. Perhaps this also underlies the rabbinical report that some examples of rabbinical piety fasted every Friday (in preparation for the Sabbath).|$|E
25|$|In Redemption Ark, Skade and Clavain {{independently}} encounter technology {{captured by}} the Mademoiselle, that permits the alteration of a ship's inertial mass in order to permit high-g acceleration for interstellar travel. It works by suppressing fluctuations and turmoil in quantum foam that supposedly causes momentum and inertia (similar {{to the concept of}} Higgs Bosons). It is also mentioned in that the technology may have been linked to the alien tower (in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Skade tries to modify the technology with the help of Exordium to allow faster than light travel, via a state transition from tardyonic to tachyonic, but her efforts are spectacularly unsuccessful, and the technology itself has the side effect of removing individuals caught in the transition bubbles from all recent history, as well as crippling her ship. Only those very close to the area of effect remember a person who is erased or unravelled backwards in time and recorded history indicates a much earlier death of that person. Because the victims (the deleted and nearby observers) are the only thing that remain from the time line where the victims began, people suddenly panicking and searching for a 'colleague' who died years before (in the new timeframe) can be the only <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident. This happens at least twice in the novels. The Inhibitors make reference to a similar effect erasing entire species from history. As such, neither they nor any other species in the galaxy with the technology to build inertia suppressing drives ever use them to travel faster than light.|$|E
