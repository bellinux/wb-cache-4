5|$|The December 1960 nor'easter was a {{significant}} early-season winter storm that impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States. Moderate to heavy snowfall fell from West Virginia to eastern Maine, amounting to 10in (25cm) or more in parts of 13states and peaking at 21.4in (54.4cm) at Newark, New Jersey. The storm was accompanied by strong winds, gusting to over 90mph (145km/h) in coastal New England, and left in its wake a dangerously cold air mass. The storm originated in a weak low pressure area which formed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December 10. A <b>secondary</b> <b>low</b> developed over South Carolina on the next day, supported by the merger of two troughs aloft. Sliding southeast of New England, the new storm explosively deepened to become a full-fledged nor'easter, with a minimum central air pressure of 966 mbar.

25|$|However, {{early on}} February 16, heavy snow started falling {{in those two}} cities, and the snow later {{developed}} in Philadelphia. Heavy snow was continuously reported, falling at rates of up to 4inches (10cm) per hour. In addition, temperatures were frigid, around 15°F (-10°C). The heavy snow continued all day, and it developed in New York City by the evening. At about the same time, the snow changed to sleet in Washington, D.C., and significantly lowered the accumulation. Throughout {{the rest of the}} Northeast, however, the snow continued for much of the night. The sleet changed back to snow by the next morning in Washington, D.C., and soon ended. By that time, a <b>secondary</b> <b>low</b> pressure system formed off the North Carolina coast and traveled north, turning the storm into a nor'easter for New York City and Boston. Blizzard Warnings were issued, and the snow began in Boston that day. In the evening, the heavy snow ended in New York City, and ended in Boston the morning of February 18. After that, the storm weakened and brought a few inches of snow to other parts of New England. The blizzard left the East Coast of the United States on February 19 and moved out into the North Atlantic Ocean. The storm weakened until it was completely absorbed by other systems on February 22.|$|E

However, as additional energy moved into {{the eastern part of}} the country, a new area of low pressure developed near the North Carolina coast late on the 13th.

Strong winds resulting from the tight pressure gradient between the nor'easter and an area of high pressure located over the United States brought down a few utility poles, which sparked a brush fire on December 24.

Between 0500 and 0700UTC on January4, the storm moved ashore along the Eastern Shore of Virginia, about 25mi (40km) south of Ocean City, Maryland. It quickly weakened while moving across the Delmarva Peninsula and it emerged into the Chesapeake Bay by 1000UTC that day. Three hours later, the storm was stalled over northern Virginia.

2500|$|During the mid-afternoon {{hours of}} January22, a new {{low-pressure}} area {{began to develop}} over {{the coast of the}} Carolinas as the former storm tracked into central Georgia. Owing to uncertainty in short-range guidance but a high confidence of a sharp northern edge of precipitation, many forecasts until just hours before snowfall began were predicting 12" [...] of snow or less from Allentown, Pennsylvania, toward New York City and the southern coast of New England.

2500|$|The strong low {{pressure}} system responsible {{for much of}} the extreme weather (this was actually a series of three storms) traversed much of the Pacific Ocean before the first storm arrived late on January 3. On December 29, 2007, a powerful extratropial disturbance developed over eastern Siberia, which emerged into the northwest Pacific, and moved to the Aleutian Islands as a well-defined low by January 3. On January 2, another extratropical disturbance developed within a well-defined trough of {{low pressure}}, in the northeast Pacific Ocean. On January 3, the 1st storm system approached {{the northern part of the}} West Coast, powered by a Pineapple Express atmospheric river, resulting in heavy downpours of rain and strong gusts across much of the Western Seaboard. Late on January 3, the 2nd storm system in the Gulf of Alaska split, with the new storm to the south usurping the majority of the moisture of the 2nd system. On January 4, as the 1st storm system weakened, and the southern part of the storm split off into another storm, which began moving eastward across the Southern United States. Later on the same day, as the first storm began moving ashore in British Columbia, the 3rd (and the most powerful) storm brought the largest bands of snow and rain, which impacted the Pacific Coast from British Columbia to northern Mexico, by January 5. Heavy downpours of rain, heavy snow, and fierce winds lashed the West Coast. Meanwhile, the 2nd storm system, slowly moved eastward along the southern coast of Alaska, before stalling in the Gulf of Alaska on January 5. From January 4 and 5, general rainfall from the superstorm in the West Coast was around [...] of rain in Oregon and Utah, while nearly [...] fell over parts of Nevada and as much as [...] in parts of California. Snowfall amounts for those two days reached as much as [...] in Blackcap Basin, California, while many mountain regions of California, Nevada and Idaho received between 1 and [...] of snow.

2500|$|The {{origins of}} the nor'easter {{originated}} from with the remnants of Hurricane Ida, a storm that formed on November4 over the southern Caribbean Sea. After tracking through Nicaragua as a Category1 hurricane, the system attained Category2 status over the Yucatán Channel. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the combination of increasing wind shear and cooler waters caused Ida to weaken. The system eventually moved over the southeastern United States on November10 before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Ida eventually dissipated over the Florida Panhandle. However, Ida's mid-level circulation {{led to the formation}} of a new low over southeastern Georgia, which eventually moved off the coast of North Carolina. This new low quickly intensified and became a powerful nor'easter that caused substantial damage throughout the Mid-Atlantic States. Due to the rapid succession of these systems, United States media referred to the nor'easter as [...] "Nor'Ida". By November12, the system attained a minimum pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg) along with winds of 65mph (100km/h). In combination with a large area of high pressure, a long stretch of easterly, onshore winds impacted areas from Virginia to southern New England. Tracking parallel to the North Carolina coastline, the system eventually moved onshore near Cape Hatteras by November13. Due to the high pressure system situated over Vermont, the low turned southeastward, bringing its center back over water. Gradual weakening took place during this period, though heavy rains continued to fall across much of the Chesapeake Bay area. On November14, a brief <b>secondary</b> <b>low</b> developed off the coast of Delaware. Continuing to weaken, the cyclone resumed a northward track after the high weakened and persisted through November17, by which time it had moved over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
