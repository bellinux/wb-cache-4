40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{identify}} different types of <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> applied in the apparel industry, and to explain how various <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> are related to the apparel firm’s characteristics, prerequisites and supplier performance. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on a survey that was sent out to Swedish apparel firms. Commonly applied <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies,</b> in terms of supply markets and supply channels, are first derived using cluster analysis. These strategies are then linked to relevant firm characteristics, prerequisites and supplier performance measures, where significant differences between groups of firms applying various <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> are targeted. Findings – Five commonly applied <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> are identified. Further, several significant differences – with respect to product issues, organizational issues and supplier performance – are found between the firm groups. Research limitations/implications – Several future research areas in conjunction with this study can be derived by widening or changing the scope. For instance, other industries as well as apparel industries in other countries can be targeted and thus provide valuable comparisons. Practical implications – Assessing the contextual appropriateness of <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> provides a strategic sourcing benchmark for firms across industries. Notably, apparel firms’ experience in exploiting low-cost supply markets may provide valuable insights for firms that just recently have recognized the potential of these markets. Originality/value – This paper provides a contextual understanding of how various <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> are utilized in the Swedish apparel industry, and thereby contributes to the general conception of <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dual <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> {{supplement}} inflexible, low-cost country sourcing {{with quick}} response manufacturing. Due to short product life cycles, combined with uncertain demand, dual <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> are {{very common in}} several industries, in particular in the sporting goods or fashion industries. Even though scholars have given some attention {{to the analysis of}} dual <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies,</b> the importance of the decision-maker's risk preferences has not been covered yet. In this paper we analyse dual <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> using an extended single-product newsvendor model with two order points. Different risk preferences will be modelled using an exponential utility function. Within realistic parameter ranges, the optimal order quantities can only be numerically computed. The findings of this paper show that dual <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> are always preferable to an exclusive offshore approach, as long as the onshore ordering costs are smaller than the selling price of the considered product. The more risk-averse the decision-maker, the smaller the offshore order quantity will be. Newsvendor model Dual sourcing Quick response Fashion products Demand forecasting Risk-aversion...|$|R

50|$|A {{first step}} towards {{materials}} parsimony that {{some companies are}} using is the materials <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategy</b> known as “green screening,” which seeks to exclude potentially hazardous materials from products.

It also can have the effect of dramatically reducing the number of materials in the product designer’s pallet. Beyond green screening, the emerging strategy of uni-materialization or monomateriality takes the material parsimony approach to its logical extreme by seeking to design products from a single material.|$|E

50|$|Given {{the nature}} of the {{multisourcing}} model, clients and suppliers have to create the right environment to ensure that this model works. Firstly, the <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategy</b> needs to become coequal with other parts of strategy planning, like operations strategy and IT strategy, rather than an afterthought. The proper sequence of strategy development requires that sourcing strategies be set as a direct outflow of business strategy. It is essential that companies have workshops with the goal of breaking down the agreements they have with their suppliers to the most basic level to ensure that everyone understands their role and the quality of work that is required of them. By breaking down activities at this granular level, providers can collectively agree on how each shared process will work and how they will engage with each other, clarifying their accountability. In these workshops, providers are taken through business scenarios to confirm details like method, data content and timescales for each cross-provider interaction. The outputs of these workshops are operational level agreements (OLAs) which are signed and agreed upon by all providers to maximize performances and ensure that everyone is aware of the requirements of their job.|$|E

The results lent some support to the contingency model of global <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategy</b> in that product innovation, process innovation and asset specificity were significant moderator variables for financial, but not strategic, performance. However, the results provided no support for bargaining power of suppliers and transaction frequency as moderator variables. In other words, in achieving high financial performance for a product, whether a particular <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategy</b> should be used for a particular product depended on the levels of product innovation, process innovation and asset specificity. © 1995 JIBS.

40|$|Purpose - The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to compare the {{differences}} between the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the large enterprises (LEs) of the Hong Kong clothing industry in terms of the adoption of production <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> and buyer-supplier relationships. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted among 120 small to large-sized clothing firms in Hong Kong. Findings - The results show that there were certain differences between SMEs and LEs with regard to production sourcing: LEs are more able to disperse production globally; LEs are more likely to adopt single sourcing, while SMEs prefer multiple sourcing; SMEs tend to use a combined strategy of in- and outsourcing, whereas LEs select either insourcing or outsourcing; and LEs are more likely to develop a formal strategic alliance with their trading partners. Research limitations/implications - The adoption of <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> and buyer-supplier relationships may change over time: future research should also be directed towards collecting longitudinal data. Practicalimplications - To compete with LEs, SMEs have to ally strategically with their trading partners. Adopting <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> in a more cooperative manner is therefore imperative. Nonetheless, both SMEs and LEs should exploit their advantages by adopting proper or innovative combinations of <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategies</b> and buyer-supplier relationships, and hence their respective disadvantages can be offset and their competitive advantages can be enhanced.

This research was conducted by carrying out literature review, analysis of case studies through semi-structured interviews, analysis of an online-based survey, development of a global sourcing framework, feedback process and finally the refinement of the framework. The global sourcing practices, in terms of eight critical success factors, which were identified through literature, was investigated through case studies. This research also provides insights into how critical certain factors are to the effectiveness of the company‟s <b>sourcing</b> <b>strategy</b> and how broadly were those factors actually implemented. The gaps between the perceived importance of global sourcing practices and the actual implementation were explored through survey. The information gathered from the literature, case studies and survey provided the input to develop a global sourcing framework.
