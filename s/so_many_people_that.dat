Likewise, the Oxford Dictionaries do not regard the split infinitive as ungrammatical, but on balance consider it likely to produce a weak style and advise against its use for formal correspondence. [...] R. W. Burchfield's revision of Fowler's Modern English Usage goes farther (quoting Burchfield's own 1981 book The Spoken Word): [...] "Avoid splitting infinitives whenever possible, but do not suffer undue remorse if a split infinitive is unavoidable for {{the completion of a}} sentence already begun." [...] Still more strongly, the style guide of The Economist says, [...] "Happy the man who has never been told that it is wrong to split an infinitive: the ban is pointless.
