5|$|A {{study by}} Arima et al. {{published}} in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling {{to provide the}} first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to <b>soy</b> production. Previously, the indirect impacts of <b>soy</b> crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a global scale, while the study took a regional approach. The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for cattle production on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC in measuring the carbon footprint of <b>soy</b> crops, whether produced for biofuels or other end-uses.|$|E

5|$|In 1940 Julian {{was able}} to produce 100lb of mixed <b>soy</b> sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The <b>soy</b> {{stigmasterol}} was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was shipped to the buyer, Upjohn, in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.|$|E
5|$|Julian {{supervised}} {{the assembly of}} the plant at Glidden {{when he arrived in}} 1936. He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated <b>soy</b> protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated <b>soy</b> protein could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir plywood, and in the manufacture of water-based paints.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1965, the {{brothers}} introduced new long ovens and kneading machines. That same year, they produced the country's first sliced bread and bread containing <b>soy</b> flour.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of <b>soy,</b> corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of <b>soy</b> and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria, often {{lactic acid}} bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, in {{combination}} with yeasts and moulds, {{have been used for}} thousands of years in the preparation of fermented foods, such as cheese, pickles, <b>soy</b> sauce, sauerkraut, vinegar, wine and yogurt.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, it {{peaked at}} number four on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and {{number one on}} the Tropical Albums chart. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Dicen Que <b>Soy</b> has sold over 144,000 copies as of 2000.|$|E
5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and <b>soy</b> sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. <b>Soy</b> sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E
5|$|Soybean oil: Chinese records dating {{prior to}} 2000 B.C. mention {{the use of}} {{cultivated}} soybeans to produce edible <b>soy</b> oil. Ancient Chinese literature reveals that soybeans were extensively cultivated and highly valued as a use for the soybean oil production process before written records were kept.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, Odwalla has {{produced}} and subsequently withdrawn various juice flavors {{due to their}} lower popularity, including the Odwalla Superfood Amazing Purple, <b>Soy</b> Vanilla, and Pomegranate Mango drinks.|$|E
5|$|Dicen Que <b>Soy</b> {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics for the arrangement and selection of songs for the album. The {{success of the}} record led to India receiving a Billboard Latin Music Award and a Lo Nuestro nomination. In the United States, it peaked at number four {{and one on the}} Billboard Top Latin Albums and Tropical Albums charts respectively, and has sold over 140,000 copies as of 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India covered the song on her album, Dicen Que <b>Soy</b> which {{was produced by}} Sergio George and released as the album's first single. It was picked by George for India to cover as {{he felt it was}} something women could relate to. India's version was included on the soundtrack for The 24 Hour Woman.|$|E
5|$|In many East Asian cultures, salt is not {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} condiment. In its place, condiments such as <b>soy</b> sauce, {{fish sauce}} and oyster sauce {{tend to have a}} high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurants}} at the University are staffed with nutritionists {{and food}} engineers, often {{students at the}} university, offering balanced menu that meets the nutritional needs of the university population, serving over 10 thousand meals per day at the main campus. The menu usually consists of rice and beans, a traditional staple food in Brazil, a type of meat (chicken, beef, sausage, pork, etc.), textured <b>soy</b> protein for vegetarians, salad, juice, and dessert.|$|E
5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (<b>soy</b> sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{was born}} in Llandudno, North Wales, to a wealthy upper middle-class English family, {{although}} little is known of her early life. By her teenage years {{she was living in}} England's West Country, where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying psychology and psychoanalysis at the University of London before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the First World War she joined the Women's Land Army and established a company selling <b>soy</b> milk products. She became interested in esotericism through the teachings of the Theosophical Society, before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the Alpha et Omega occult organisation.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner became {{president}} in May 2003. In the mid-2000s, export of unprocessed soybeans and of soybean oil and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina's export revenue, triple the joint {{share of the}} traditional exports, beef and wheat. Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds of which came from <b>soy</b> exports. Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation over 20%.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd-century-BCE {{tomb of the}} Lady Dai {{contained}} {{not only}} decayed remnants of actual food, such as rice, wheat, barley, two varieties of millet, and soybeans, but also a grave inventory with recipes on it. This included vegetable and meat stews cooked in pots, which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew. Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, <b>soy</b> sauce, and salt. Recipes in the Han usually called for meat stuffed in cereals, cakes, and other wrappings.|$|E
5|$|The Arima {{study is}} based on 761 {{municipalities}} located in the Legal Amazon of Brazil, and found that between 2003 and 2008, soybean areas expanded by 39,100km² in the basin's agricultural areas, mainly in Mato Grosso. The model showed that a 10% (3,910km²) reduction of <b>soy</b> in old pasture areas would {{have led to a}} reduction in deforestation of up to 40% (26,039km²) in heavily forested municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis showed that the displacement of cattle production due to agricultural expansion drives land use change in municipalities located hundreds of kilometers away, and that the Amazonian ILUC is not only measurable but its impact is significant.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans. Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and <b>soy</b> sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of termites, various methods {{have been developed to}} track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or <b>soy</b> milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E
5|$|After the United Kingdom {{entered the}} First World War, Fortune joined the Women's Land Army. She was {{initially}} stationed {{on a farm}} near to Bishop's Stortford on the borders between Essex and Hertfordshire, before later being relocated to an experimental base for the Food Production Department. There she carried out experiments {{in the production of}} <b>soy</b> milk, subsequently founding the Letchworth-based Garden City Pure Food Company to sell her products and publishing The Soya Bean: An Appeal to Humanitarians in 1925. It was while working at the base that she underwent a spiritual experience and subsequently further immersed herself in theosophical literature. After doing so, she became preoccupied by the idea of the 'Ascended Masters' or 'Secret Chiefs', claiming to have had visions of two such entities, the Master Jesus and the Master Rakoczi.|$|E
5|$|Despite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do {{not suffer}} any more from overt zinc {{deficiency}} than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, <b>soy</b> foods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers {{may interfere with}} zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption. Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (15mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers, and {{the most widely used}} indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, <b>soy</b> and azuki beans. In the Sahel region of Africa, local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 BC. Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Jolie {{expanded}} {{the scope of}} the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals. She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a <b>soy</b> milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free <b>soy</b> formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of <b>soy</b> is protective.|$|E
5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish. Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, <b>soy</b> sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and <b>soy</b> sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and <b>soy</b> sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E
5|$|Before {{affecting}} North Carolina, {{the threat}} of Carol prompted a hurricane warning from Wilmington to Manteo. Storm warnings were issued southward to Charleston. Residents evacuated north of Wilmington along the ocean. While passing by the state, the strongest winds remained {{to the east of}} Hurricane Carol, though winds of 90 to 100mph (145 to 160km/h) were reported at Cape Hatteras. Further inland, the hurricane produced a wind gust of 55mph (90km/h) in Wilmington and 65mph (105km/h) in Cherry Point. The winds resulted in agricultural damage to the corn and <b>soy</b> bean crop. High winds caused minor damage to roofs and houses, and also downed some trees and power lines. Near the coast, waves from the storm damaged fishing piers, and flooding was reported in New Bern. High waves also damaged coastal roadways. Damage in the state totaled to around $228,000. Carol passed 100miles (160km) to the east of Virginia, and produced 40mph (65km/h) winds in Virginia Beach. The hurricane produced 4inches (100mm) of rain in Norfolk. Further to the northwest, rainfall from the system alleviated drought conditions in the Washington, D.C. area. Damage was minor from Virginia to Delaware, where light rains fell. Precipitation also extended into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In Guam, {{the threat}} of Typhoon Isa {{postponed}} a flight from Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48hours. The flight was the last in , which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States. The threat of the typhoon also canceled {{the first round of}} the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history. Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15–25cm (6–10in) across the island. The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season, and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April. The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86km/h (53mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and <b>soy</b> bean crops.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and <b>soy).</b> Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
