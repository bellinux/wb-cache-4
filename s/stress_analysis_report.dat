40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to stressful environments {{can lead to}} serious health problems. Therefore, measuring stress in daily life situations through non-invasive procedures has become a significant research challenge. In this paper, we describe a system for the automatic detection of momentary stress from behavioral and physiological measures collected through wearable sensors. The system 2 ̆ 7 s architecture consists of two key components: a) a mobile acquisition module; b) an analysis and decision module. The mobile acquisition module is a smartphone application coupled with a newly developed sensor platform (Personal Biomonitoring System, PBS). The PBS acquires behavioral (motion activity, posture) and physiological (hearth rate) variables, performs low-level, real-time signal preprocessing, and wirelessly communicates with the smartphone application, which in turn connects to a remote server for further signal processing and storage. The decision module is realized on a knowledge basis, using neural network and fuzzy logic algorithms able to combine as input the physiological and behavioral features extracted by the PBS and to classify the level of stress, after previous knowledge acquired during a training phase. The training is based on labeling of physiological and behavioral data through self-reports of stress collected via the smartphone application. After training, the smartphone application can be configured to poll the <b>stress</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>report</b> at fixed time steps or {{at the request of}} the user.

40|$|Technical {{development}} in the Advanced Neutron Source (ANS) project is dynamic, and a continuously updated information source is necessary to provide readily usable materials data to the designer, analyst, and materials engineer. The Advanced Neutron Source Materials Databook (AMBK) is being developed {{as a part of}} the Advanced Neutron Source Materials Information System (AMIS). Its purpose is to provide urgently needed data on a quick-turnaround support basis for those design applications whose schedules demand immediate estimates of material properties. In addition to the need for quick materials information, there is a need for consistent application of data throughout the ANS Program, especially where only limited data exist. The AMBK is being developed to fill this need as well. It is the forerunner to the Advanced Neutron Source Materials Handbook (AMHB). The AMHB, as reviewed and approved by the ANS review process, will serve as a common authoritative source of materials data in support of the ANS Project. It will furnish documented evidence of the materials data used in the design and construction of the ANS system and will serve as a quality record during any review process whose objective is to establish the safety level of the ANS complex. The information in the AMBK and AMHB is also provided in electronic form in a dial-up computer database known as the ANS Materials Database (AMDB). A single consensus source of materials information prepared and used by all national program participants has several advantages. Overlapping requirements and data needs of various sub-projects and subcontractors can be met by a single document which is continuously revised. Preliminary and final safety <b>analysis</b> <b>reports,</b> <b>stress</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>reports,</b> equipment specifications, materials service reports, and many other project-related documents can be substantially reduced in size and scope by appropriate reference to a single data source...|$|R

However, the assumption of this calculation makes it impossible to consider the effects of the bobbin, an epoxy impregnated structure, on stress of the coil.

40|$|Abstract — A Fusion Development Facility (FDF) is {{proposed}} {{to fill the}} technological gaps between ITER and a Fusion DEMO. FDF is a steady state copper, water-cooled coil machine with a primary goal to test multiple blanket configurations in its lifetime. For efficient remote exchange of the breeding blankets, it is planned to exchange them through vertical motions in large segments. Two principal remote handling approaches are under study, one exchanging large rings and the second poloidal wedge sections. For either scenario, a joint is required in the toroidal coils {{to allow for the}} vertical blanket exchange. Two approaches to making the joint are under study along with the respective structural models for reacting the magnetic loads. Initial <b>stress</b> <b>analysis</b> is <b>reported</b> showing the structural feasibility of either concept. Coolant flow is important in such a steady state device and manifold and piping layout concepts are developed as part of the remote handling study.
