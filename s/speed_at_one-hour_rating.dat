Lightweight, high energy density nickel electrodes have been developed which deliver in excess of 180 mAh/g <b>at</b> the <b>one-hour</b> discharge <b>rate.</b> These electrodes {{are based on a}} highly porous, nickel micro-fiber (less than 10 micron diameter) substrate, electrochemically impregnated with nickel-hydroxide active material. Electrodes are being tested both as a flooded half-cell and in full nickel-hydrogen and nickel-metal hydride cells. The electrode technology developed is applicable to commercial nickel-based batteries for applications such as electric vehicles, cellular telephones and laptop computers and for low-cost, high energy density military and aerospace applications...|$|R

40|$|For {{the design}} of {{naturally}} ventilated buildings, information of air <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> the openings of a building is important. However, the only data set usually available to designers is meteorological data, such as wind speed and direction measured at weather stations. This paper explores the ratio of air <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> building openings to the wind <b>speed</b> measured <b>at</b> weather stations. Meteorological data from three weather stations as well as air velocity that was obtained through full-scale physical measurements were used in this study. The results showed that air <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> building openings was {{about half of the}} wind <b>speed</b> recorded <b>at</b> the closest station to the case study. This ratio reduced to approximately 30 % when comparing to the weather stations located in greater distance and more open areas. Given that air <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> the openings has a direct relation to the ventilation rate, employing these ratios to the available weather data when designing for natural ventilation, can provide more realistic picture of natural ventilation performance...|$|R

The affinity of wind <b>speeds</b> measured <b>at</b> different locations is defined by Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient. Five turbines with similar wind conditions are selected among 30 wind turbines for in-depth analysis. The wind data from these turbines are used to predict wind <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> a selected location. A neural network ensemble is used to predict the value of wind <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> the turbine of interest. The models have been tested and the computational results are discussed. The results demonstrate that a higher Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient between the wind <b>speeds</b> measured <b>at</b> different turbines has produced better prediction accuracy for the same training and test scenario. 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
