5|$|During the Victorian {{expansion}} of Manchester, Didsbury {{developed as a}} prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury village and Parrs Wood {{to the east and}} Withington to the north, but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the Midland Railway line in 1880 contributed greatly to the rapid growth in the population of Didsbury, with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to Manchester Central. The line closed in 1967, although Didsbury station building remained standing until its demolition in the 1980s. The <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> and water fountain have survived, dedicated to local doctor and campaigner for the poor, Dr. J. Milson Rhodes.|$|E

25|$|The presentational package {{featured}} numerous {{people of}} various backgrounds dancing {{in a predominantly}} red background to a soundtrack based around an upbeat central jingle. The BBC One logo is now located in a red box, similar in style to BBC Two's idents of the time, with the BBC logo stacked {{on top of an}} upper case 'ONE'. The music for all idents was written by Peter Lawlor of Water Music Productions in London. The look was also the first one not to feature a <b>station</b> <b>clock.</b> It has been reported that a <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> was designed for the new look, however BBC Marketing decided not to use it. The concerns with this stemmed around a lack of serious ident to link into the news, and indeed this problem famously occurred one day into the new look upon the death of The Queen Mother.|$|E

50|$|A {{railway station}} will often have several <b>station</b> <b>clocks.</b> They {{can be found}} in a clock tower, in the booking hall or office, on the concourse, inside a train shed, on or facing the station platforms, or elsewhere.|$|R
25|$|The area of {{the station}} where the bomb detonated has been reconstructed but, as a {{memorial}} of the attack, the original floor tile pierced by the detonation has been left in place and a deep crack closed by a glass panel {{has been made in}} the reconstructed main wall. As a further memorial, the <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> that stopped at 10:25 due to the explosion, has been repaired but permanently set at that time.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} items of art on display {{to the public}} at St Pancras. At {{the south end of the}} upper level, a [...] high [...] bronze statue named The Meeting Place stands beneath the <b>station</b> <b>clock.</b> Designed by British artist Paul Day, it is {{intended}} to evoke the romance of travel through the depiction of a couple locked in an amorous embrace.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Heggessey {{took the}} {{decision}} to abandon the traditional [...] "Globe" [...] idents the channel had used {{in a variety of}} forms for its between-programme idents since 1963. They were replaced by a new style of on-air identity for the channel, the [...] "Rhythm & Movement" [...] idents. The new idents attracted criticism for going against the traditions of the channel and pandering to political correctness, as they featured activities performed by people of various ethnicities. The abandonment of a <b>station</b> <b>clock,</b> and perceived lack of a 'serious ident', also put the BBC in an embarrassing situation just one day into the new look with the death of the Queen Mother.|$|E
40|$|Quasars can be {{employed}} to synchronize global data communications, geophysical measurements, and atomic clocks.

50|$|The Swiss Federal Railways clock {{designed}} by Hans Hilfiker {{has become a}} national icon. It is special in that it stops for just over a second {{at the end of}} each minute, to wait for a signal from the master clock which sets it going again — thus keeping all <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> synchronized.|$|R

60|$|I saw he had guessed right, {{and thought}} it best to throw myself unreservedly on his mercy. Time was indeed important. I glanced at the <b>station</b> <b>clock.</b> It was not very far from the stroke of six, and we must manage to get married before the detective could miss us at Edinburgh, where he was due at 6.30.|$|E
60|$|They were at Brussels--half an {{hour for}} breakfast. They got down. On the great <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> it said six o'clock. They had coffee and rolls and honey in the vast desert {{refreshment}} room, so dreary, always so dreary, dirty, so spacious, such desolation of space. But she washed her face and hands in hot water, and combed her hair--that was a blessing.|$|E
50|$|An LMU is a {{receiver}} that {{is placed in}} {{a position in the}} network that is able to report the RTDs of a number of different base stations. If the base <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> are not synchronised to a common source, then it is necessary to continuously update the RTDs, as the time offsets will be changing due to the clock drift in each base station.|$|R
30|$|The c 5 ++ {{analysis}} {{software was}} used for the analysis in this study. In order to compute the theoretical delays, c 5 ++ follows the latest International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) conventions (Petit and Luzum 2010). The software package was extended with the capability to simulate observations and was used to run extensive Monte Carlo simulations for each INT 1 and INT 2 session scheduled during the year 2014. A simulated observation on a baseline includes contributions from the <b>station</b> <b>clocks,</b> local tropospheres, and a baseline-dependent noise component. The <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> were modelled as integrated random walk processes with the clock stability per time unit as a tunable parameter. The troposphere was modelled using the Kolmogorov turbulence model (Treuhaft and Lanyi 1987) following the approach of Nilsson and Haas (2010). The observation noise component was simulated as baseline-dependent in order to be consistent with the set-up used in the simulations that were carried out during the studies of the requirements and capabilities of VGOS (Petrachenko et al. 2009).|$|R

60|$|Ossipon {{entered the}} carriage, hastily {{closed the door}} and looked out to see the time by the <b>station</b> <b>clock.</b> Eight minutes more. For the first three of these Mrs Verloc wept violently and helplessly without pause or interruption. Then she {{recovered}} somewhat, and sobbed gently in an abundant fall of tears. She tried to talk to her saviour, to the man who was the messenger of life.|$|E
60|$|In the dim cavern of Paddington Station the boat-train snorted impatiently, {{varying the}} process with an {{occasional}} sharp shriek. The hands of the <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> pointed to ten minutes to six. The platform was a confused mass of travellers, porters, baggage, trucks, boys with buns and fruits, boys with magazines, friends, relatives, and Bayliss the butler, standing like a faithful watchdog beside a large suitcase. To the human surf that broke and swirled about him he paid no attention. He {{was looking for the}} young master.|$|E
60|$|Minds in {{the village}} of Anfield worked with {{extraordinary}} rapidity. The first person of whom he asked the way to the Junction answered the riddle almost without thinking. He left his machine out in the road and went on to the platform. The first thing that caught his eye was the <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> with its hands pointing to five past four. And when he realized that, his uncle's train having left a clear half hour before, his labours had all been for nothing, the full bitterness of life came home to him.|$|E
3000|$|In Herring et al. (1990), the VLBI delay rate {{observations}} {{were used to}} directly compute the PSD of the ZWD. However, other random walk processes affect the VLBI data as well, most notably <b>station</b> <b>clocks.</b> Herring et al. (1990) assumed that the clock noise is significantly smaller {{than that of the}} ZWD and would inflate the ZWD PSD estimates by less than 20 %. However, we found that the ZWD noise was on average lower than suggested by Herring et al. 1990 [...]...|$|R
50|$|France adopted Paris Mean Time as its {{standard}} national time in 1891. It {{also required}} <b>clocks</b> inside railway <b>stations</b> and train schedules {{to be set}} five minutes late to allow travelers to arrive late without missing their trains, even while clocks on the external walls of railway stations displayed Paris Mean Time. In 1911, France adopted Paris Mean Time delayed 9 minutes 21 seconds, Greenwich Mean Time without mentioning Greenwich. At the same time, slow railway <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> were eliminated.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the GPS constellation is modeled using four possible ensembles of monitor site clocks and two {{different versions of the}} composite clock algorithm. The analysis of our previous paper is scrutinized; the conclusion remains that the improvements due to improved <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> are minimal if the “Greenhall” algorithm is used for the composite clock. The response to a satellite and monitor station time step is investigated. Furthermore, the proportional process noise case is studied for different initial covariances...|$|R
60|$|The major {{has put it}} {{on record}} that those two hours {{appeared}} to him the longest that ever he passed in his life, and Tom, no doubt, would endorse the sentiment. Everything must have an end, however, and the <b>station</b> <b>clock,</b> the hands of which seemed several times to have stopped altogether, began at last to approach the hour at which the Portsmouth train was timed to depart. Baumser and his two friends had come back, all three smoking cigarettes, and looking the better for their visit to the cookshop. The five got into a first-class railway carriage and waited. Would they never have done examining tickets and stamping luggage and going through all sorts of tedious formalities? At last, thank God! comes the shrill whistle of the guard, the answering snort from the engine, and they are fairly started upon their mission of rescue.|$|E
60|$|That unfortunate artistic soul of his, {{which had}} been in the tropics of expectation, and was now in the arctic of reaction, had just finally settled down to black despair, with a grim {{recognition}} of the fact that Maude had certainly and absolutely given him up, when one boomed from the <b>station</b> <b>clock,</b> and on the very stroke she hurried on to the platform. How could he have strained his eyes after other women, as if a second glance were ever needed when it was really she! The perfectly graceful figure, the trimness and neatness of it, the beautiful womanly poise of the head, the quick elastic step, he could have sworn to her among ten thousand. His heart gave a bound at the sight of her, but he had the English aversion to giving himself away, and so he walked quickly forward to meet her with an impassive face, but with a look in his eyes which was all that she wanted.|$|E
60|$|I {{have taken}} two photographs, {{one to the}} right and one to the left of this {{agreeable}} place. I may perhaps adopt a kind of guide-book style in reviewing its principal features: I begin at the railway station. I have made a rather nearer and larger photograph of the railway station, which presents a diversified and entertaining scene to the incoming visitor. Porters (out of a box of porters) career here and there with the trucks and light baggage. Quite a number of our all-too-rare civilians parade the platform: two gentlemen, a lady, and a small but evil-looking child are particularly noticeable; and there is a wooden sailor with jointed legs, in a state of intoxication as reprehensible as it is nowadays happily rare. Two virtuous dogs regard his abandon with quiet scorn. The seat on which he sprawls is a broken piece of some toy whose nature I have long forgotten, the <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> is a similar fragment, and so is the metallic pillar which bears the name of the station. So many toys, we find, only become serviceable with a little smashing. There is an allegory in this--as Hawthorne used to write in his diary.|$|E
40|$|The {{long term}} {{performance}} of the eight LORAN-C chains is presented {{in terms of the}} Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of the U. S.

The atomic time scale and the UTC of several national laboratories and observatories relative to the international atomic time are reported. Typical performance of several NASA tracking <b>station</b> <b>clocks,</b> relative to the USNO master clock, is also presented...|$|R
50|$|News, time-checks, {{real-time}} travel {{advice and}} weather reports are often valuable to listeners. The news headlines and station identification are therefore given {{just before a}} commercial. Time, traffic and weather are given just after. The engineer typically sets the <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> to standard local time each day, by listening to WWV or WWVH (see atomic clock). These segments are less valued by the most targeted market, young people, so many commercial stations shorten or omit these segments in favor of music.|$|R
30|$|To {{estimate}} the relative effect of adding the third station to the INT 1 and INT 2 observing geometries, reference UT 1 –UTC Weighted Root Mean Square (WRMS) values {{were computed for}} both session types. The <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> and the baseline-dependent observation noise were simulated with identical parameters for all stations. The reference values for the INT 1 and INT 2 were computed by generating 500 UT 1 –UTC estimates for each session and from these computing one yearly reference WRMS value for the INT 1 and INT 2 sessions, respectively.|$|R
60|$|The <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> {{was upon}} {{the stroke of}} five, and the guard {{was about to give}} the {{customary}} signal to the engine-driver when he observed two belated passengers hurrying down the platform. The one was an exceptionally tall man, dressed in a long black overcoat with astrakhan collar and cuffs. I have already said that the evening was an inclement one, and the tall traveller had the high, warm collar turned up to protect his throat against the bitter March wind. He appeared, as far as the guard could judge by so hurried an inspection, to be a man between fifty and sixty years of age, who had retained {{a good deal of the}} vigour and activity of his youth. In one hand he carried a brown leather Gladstone bag. His companion was a lady, tall and erect, walking with a vigorous step which outpaced the gentleman beside her. She wore a long, fawn-coloured dust-cloak, a black, close-fitting toque, and a dark veil which concealed the greater part of her face. The two might very well have passed as father and daughter. They walked swiftly down the line of carriages, glancing in at the windows, until the guard, John Palmer, overtook them.|$|E
6000|$|So far all {{had gone}} admirably. My luggage {{was waiting for}} me, and I had no {{difficulty}} in finding the carriage which Holmes had indicated, the less so {{as it was the}} only one in the train which was marked [...] "Engaged." [...] My only source of anxiety now was the non-appearance of Holmes. The <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> marked only seven minutes from the time when we were due to start. In vain I searched among the groups of travellers and leave-takers for the lithe figure of my friend. There was no sign of him. I spent a few minutes in assisting a venerable Italian priest, who was endeavoring to make a porter understand, in his broken English, that his luggage was to be booked through to Paris. Then, having taken another look round, I returned to my carriage, where I found that the porter, in spite of the ticket, had given me my decrepit Italian friend as a traveling companion. It was useless for me to explain to him that his presence was an intrusion, for my Italian was even more limited than his English, so I shrugged my shoulders resignedly, and continued to look out anxiously for my friend. A chill of fear had come over me, as I thought that his absence might mean that some blow had fallen during the night. Already the doors had all been shut and the whistle blown, when-- ...|$|E
60|$|A {{request for}} a special {{is not a very}} {{uncommon}} circumstance in a rich commercial centre, but that two should be required upon the same afternoon was most unusual. It so happened, however, that Mr. Bland had hardly dismissed the first traveller before a second entered with a similar request. This was a Mr. Horace Moore, a gentlemanly man of military appearance, who alleged that the sudden serious illness of his wife in London made it absolutely imperative that he should not lose an instant in starting upon the journey. His distress and anxiety were so evident that Mr. Bland did all that was possible to meet his wishes. A second special was out of the question, as the ordinary local service was already somewhat deranged by the first. There was the alternative, however, that Mr. Moore should share the expense of Monsieur Caratal's train, and should travel in the other empty first-class compartment, if Monsieur Caratal objected to having him in the one which he occupied. It was difficult to see any objection to such an arrangement, and yet Monsieur Caratal, upon the suggestion being made to him by Mr. Potter Hood, absolutely refused to consider it for an instant. The train was his, he said, and he would insist upon the exclusive use of it. All argument failed to overcome his ungracious objections, and finally the plan had to be abandoned. Mr. Horace Moore left the station in great distress, after learning that his only course was to take the ordinary slow train which leaves Liverpool at six o'clock. At four thirty-one exactly by the <b>station</b> <b>clock</b> the special train, containing the crippled Monsieur Caratal and his gigantic companion, steamed out of the Liverpool station. The line was at that time clear, and there should have been no stoppage before Manchester.|$|E
30|$|For the {{troposphere}} height H {{a constant}} value of 2  km {{was used for}} both the actual stations and the additional third station. Similarly, a constant wind speed of 5  m/s (North and East component) was applied for all <b>stations.</b> The <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> were characterised with a stability of 10 ^- 14 @ 50  min. The baseline-dependent observation noise was set to 0.01  m (33  ps) for all baselines.

50|$|The <b>station</b> <b>clocks</b> in Switzerland are {{synchronized}} by {{receiving an}} electrical impulse from a central master clock at each full minute, advancing the minute hand by one minute. The second hand {{is driven by}} an electrical motor independent of the master clock. It requires only about 58.5 seconds to circle the face, then the hand pauses briefly {{at the top of}} the clock. It starts a new rotation as soon as it receives the next minute impulse from the master clock. This movement is emulated in some of the licensed timepieces made by Mondaine.|$|R
