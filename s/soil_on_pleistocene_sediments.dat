40|$|Palaeomagnetic {{measurements}} {{have been}} carried out <b>on</b> Eocene to <b>Pleistocene</b> <b>sediments</b> <b>on</b> the Ionian island of Zakynthos, NW Greece. Magnetostratigraphic constraints, biostratigraphic analyses of planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils provide a reliable time frame for these deposits. The results show that no significant rotation occurred between 8. 11 and 0. 77 Ma, but that Zakynthos underwent a 21. 6 º 7. 4 º clockwise rotation between 0. 77 Ma and Recent. Thus, our data indicate a rapid rotational event, in contrast to continuous rotation since 5 Ma as previously postulated [Laj et al., Tectonophysics 86 (1982) 45 67]. We speculate this late Pleistocene tectonic rotation phase to be linked to rapid uplift in the Greek region which results from rebound processes caused by (African) slab detachment underneath the Ionian islands.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new perspective}} for the temporal variation of crop cultivation adoption during the period 6000 - 5400 BP in Flevoland (central Netherlands) based on the spatial evolution of soils and hydrology. To determine the role of soil properties and groundwater level rise in the adoption of crop cultivation in wetlands, mapping of the mid-Holocene palaeotopography, palaeohydrology, soil conditions and distribution of Swifterbant archaeological remains was combined with grain size analyses of cored sediments in two selected study areas. Results show that the low natural fertility and water holding capacity of the sandy <b>soils</b> <b>on</b> the <b>Pleistocene</b> surface in southern Flevoland compared to the loamy soils {{in the northern part}} of Flevoland, can explain the lack of crop cultivation in the south.

In the Holocene sediment, the metabolically active bacteria, including arsenate-respiring bacteria, {{were determined by}} DNA stable-isotope probing. After incubation with 13 C-acetate and 13 C-lactate, active bacterial community in the Holocene sediment was dominated by different Geobacter spp. -related 16 S rRNA sequences. Substrate addition also resulted in the enrichment of sequences related to the arsenate-respiring Sulfurospirillum spp. 13 C-acetate selected for ArrA related to Geobacter spp. whereas 13 C-lactate selected for ArrA which were not closely related to any cultivated organism. Incubation of the <b>Pleistocene</b> <b>sediment</b> with lactate favoured a 16 S rRNA-phylotype related to the sulphate-reducing Desulfovibrio oxamicus DSM 1925, whereas the ArrA sequences clustered with environmental sequences distinct from those identified in the Holocene sediment.

40|$|Here {{we present}} an {{improvement}} of paleotemperature reconstructions for the Southern Ocean by combining new diatom {{data from the}} Pacific sector with published Atlantic and Indian sector reference data. The statistical analysis of 336 surface sediment samples recovered from a wide area of Southern Ocean environments defines a supra-regional reference data set for quantitative summer sea surface temperature (SSST) estimations. In situ temperature measurements covering the time span from approx. 1900 to 1991 were used as reference instead of more recent time series of satellite-derived data, possibly biased by ocean warming. Different transfer function (TF) models for the Imbrie and Kipp Method (IKM), the Modern Analog Technique (MAT), Weighted Averaging (WA), and Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares (WAPLS) were tested. Best performance for IKM was obtained using the D 336 set with 29 diatom taxa and three factors, resulting in {{root mean square error}} of prediction (RMSEP) of 0. 833 °C for SSST. MAT estimates were best with six analogs resulting in lowest RMSEP of 0. 812 °C. WAPLS applied to D 336 resulted in a RMSEP of 0. 782 °C. WA performed less well, expressed by a RMSEP of 0. 974 °C. Furthermore, two subsets for the Atlantic (D 151) and the Pacific sectors (D 107) were applied with IKM to test for advantages of localized TFs. IKM-D 151 and IKM-D 107 performed comparably good as IKM-D 336, with RMSEP of 0. 71 °C and 0. 68 °C, respectively. Application of the augmented reference data sets <b>on</b> two <b>Pleistocene</b> <b>sediment</b> records from the Atlantic (PS 1768 - 8) and Pacific (PS 58 / 271 - 1) sectors led to best performance of IKM with D 336, expressed by high overall communalities (> 0. 75) and fewer (PS 1768 - 8) to no (PS 58 / 271 - 1) no-analogs, compared to the regional data sets, proving IKM-D 336 to deal better with higher assemblage variability.

For this purpose, borings were made along transects from inland to the coast to a depth of up to 6 meters. The results of these studies indicate the presence of five physiographic regions and fifteen geomorphic units in the coastal plain of Jambi. In the coastal plain of South Kalimantan, four physiographic regions and eleven geomorphic units were established. The landforms in both of these coastal plains were developed by peat and mineral soil deposits. These deposits started to accumulate during the Holocene period. In Jambi, peats situated in the ombrogenous peats zone, which sometimes exceed 6 meters in depth, have been deposited since the terrestrial <b>soils</b> <b>on</b> the <b>Pleistocene</b> terrace were transformed into fluviatile swampy soils to form the so-called peat-capped terrace.

At intermediate (7. 624 MPa) to high (15. 237 MPa) over-burden pressure, the majority of the samples tested show velocity weakening, whereas lower overburden pressures do not give a clear trend regarding velocity weakening or strengthening of the samples. In consolidated-undrained triaxial tests, peak shear stresses observed are between 27 and 140 kPa, with the strongest sample by far coming from a core catcher section. We suspect that this is an effect of fabric changes induced during hydraulic piston coring. One sample coming from the base of a mass transport de-posit at Site U 1322 is the weakest one tested. Young’s moduli cal-culated range from 2 to 17. 4 kPa.
