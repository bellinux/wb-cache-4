5|$|It {{should be}} borne {{in mind that}} the {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the <b>section</b> <b>is</b> terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end, which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the <b>section</b> <b>is</b> {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become, since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections.|$|E
5|$|Krake's queue {{is divided}} into two sections. The first <b>section</b> <b>is</b> only used during busier days and isn't paved, but rather filled in with gravel. The second <b>section</b> <b>is</b> a paved path that leads the roller coaster's station.|$|E

50|$|The Saga - Nabeshima <b>section</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} to be {{duplicated}} in 1966, and by 1969 the Tosu - Hizen-Yamaguchi and Isahaya - Kikitsu <b>sections</b> <b>were</b> duplicated. The Urakami-Nagasaki <b>section</b> <b>was</b> duplicated in 1990.|$|R
5|$|I-475 {{was first}} opened to {{traffic in the}} early 1970s. The first <b>section</b> <b>was</b> built between I-75/US10 northward to M-21/M-78. The second <b>section</b> <b>was</b> built from I-75/US10/US23 to BUSM-54 along {{the north side of}} town. These two <b>sections</b> <b>were</b> opened on November 9, 1973 and September 26, 1974 respectively. The final <b>section</b> <b>was</b> opened between them in 1981.|$|R

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of GÃ¶ttingen, Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctorate on the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but {{the development of the}} laser permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross <b>section</b> <b>is</b> named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} k-type section, the image {{impedance}} of the m-type low-pass <b>section</b> <b>is</b> purely real below the cut-off frequency and purely imaginary above it. From the chart {{it can be}} seen that in the passband the closest impedance match to a constant pure resistance termination occurs at approximately m = 0.6.|$|E

50|$|The Minato-Machi - Tennoji <b>section</b> <b>was</b> {{duplicated}} in 1903 {{and extended}} to Kashiwabara in 1908. The Nara - Kizu <b>section</b> <b>was</b> duplicated in 1914, and the Kashiwabara - Nara section between 1923 and 1926.

50|$|The spiric {{sections}} {{result from}} the intersection of a torus with a plane that {{is parallel to the}} rotational symmetry axis of the torus. Consequently, spiric <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> fourth-order (quartic) plane curves, whereas the conic <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> second-order (quadratic) plane curves. Spiric <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> a special case of a toric <b>section,</b> and <b>were</b> the first toric <b>sections</b> to <b>be</b> described.|$|R
5|$|Between Tilbury and Highway402, {{the highway}} remains four lanes wide with a grass median.

Several interchanges are slated to be upgraded {{as part of this}} construction.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{included}} in the 400-series network, the Highway407 ETR <b>section</b> <b>is</b> not {{considered part of the}} provincial highway network due to it now being privately operated.|$|E
5|$|From Lincoln, {{the river}} again turns first east, then south, making a cut through an belt of upland {{known as the}} Lincoln Gap. This <b>section</b> <b>is</b> again {{believed}} to have been a lower course of the Trent during and before periods of glaciation.|$|E
50|$|Bhubaneswar Yard and Khurda Road-Bhubaneswar <b>section</b> <b>was</b> {{electrified}} in 2001-02. Bhubaneswar-Barang <b>section</b> <b>was</b> electrified in 2002-03.|$|R
50|$|With the {{surviving}} personnel, two Carabinieri <b>Sections</b> <b>were</b> formed: the 184th Carabinieri <b>Section</b> <b>was</b> {{assigned to the}} Folgore Division, while the 314th Carabinieri <b>Section</b> <b>was</b> assigned to the Nembo Division and fought in the Italian Civil War on the loyalist side.|$|R

5|$|MN610 was {{originally}} planned to extend west to I-94 in Maple Grove, and the freeway's mile markers reflected these plans, with {{the zero point}} calibrated to this future terminus. A portion of this <b>section</b> <b>is</b> very unusual; it is routed {{down the middle of}} the median of CR81 in Maple Grove, forming a roadway within a roadway.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1977, the City of Niagara Falls assumed River Road between Hiram Street, {{north of}} the Rainbow Bridge, and Glenview Avenue, east of Victoria Avenue.

5|$|Perhaps one of Zobel's most {{fascinating}} inventions is the lattice filter section. This <b>section</b> <b>is</b> both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, {{yet it is}} constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.|$|E
5|$|Stela 9 {{was erected}} {{on the west}} side of StructureA-3. It is badly damaged and one <b>section</b> <b>is</b> missing. The stela depicts Wat'ul Chatel with the {{attributes}} of the Maize God and describes him invoking the Vision Serpent.|$|E
5|$|Students {{may receive}} college credit or upper-level college course {{placement}} upon the {{successful completion of}} a three-hour exam ordinarily administered in May.

50|$|Since {{the opening}} of the {{cemetery}} two <b>sections</b> <b>were</b> added, South West and West, and the North <b>section</b> <b>was</b> extended.
