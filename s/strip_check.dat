40|$|AbstractAim {{of present}} {{research}} endeavour is to fabricate nanostructured strips of aluminium alloy by a machining based deformation process. Aluminium 6061 {{was used as}} a test material. Furthermore, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) is used for deformation analysis of <b>strips</b> to <b>check</b> the level of deformation along their thickness. Microhardness testing was done using Vickers microhardness testing machine. Microstructure characterization of bulk aluminium and chips (as strips) was done by electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). For in-depth deformation analysis thickness of strips was reduced in steps up to 100 μm by abrasive papers. After each step of reducing thickness of strips by 100 μm, X- ray scan and microhardness testing of strips were performed. The results show that microstrain in strips was increased and crystallite size was decreased. Moreover, hardness of the strips was ∼ 40 - 44 % more than the bulk material. Higher hardness in strips may be attributed to their ultrafine microstructure resulted from high deformation observed in strips. Furthermore, variation in deformation level along the thickness of sheets was also observed...|$|R

Women used to wrap it around their waist, pleated in front over the belly and drape it over their {{shoulder}} covering their bust area and fastened it with a pin at the shoulder. ‘Choli’ or blouse, as an upper garment {{was introduced in the}} later Vedic period with sleeves and a neck. A new version of sari, little smaller than sari, called dupatta, was also incorporated later and it was used to wear along with ghaghara (frilled skirt up to feet). The word sari is derived from Sanskrit शाटी [...] which means 'strip of cloth'and शाडी [...] or साडी [...] in Prakrit, and became [...] in Hindi.Most initial attires of men in those times were dhoti and lungi. Dhoti is basically a single cloth wrapped around the waist and by partitioning at the center, is fastened at the back. A dhoti is from four to six feet long white or colour strip of cotton. Generally, in those times, no upper garment was worn and Dhoti was the only single clothing that men used to drape it over their bodies. Later on, many costumes evolved like kurtas, pajamas, trousers, turbans, etc. Wool, linen, diaphanous silks and muslin were the main fibres used for making cloth and patterns with grey <b>strips</b> and <b>checks</b> were made over clothes.|$|R

We used Clinitek 50 ® which is a semiquantitative <b>strip</b> test to <b>check</b> spot urine sample from 81 patients with albustix one plus or less. The incidence of Clinitek 50 ® microalbuminuria was 17 %, 18. 2 % and 75 % in 47, 22 and 12 patients with albustix negative, trace or one plus respectively. Nineteen and 13 of the 21 Clinitek 50 ® positive patients were checked for spot urine DCA 2000 ® and two 12 -hour urine collection for immunoassay respectively. Around 60 % of these samples fell into the microalbuminuria range and 40 % into the overt albuminuria range by either technique. There was no false positive of Clinitek 50 ®. The lowest range of microalbuminuria detected by Clinitek 50 ® was 27 μg/minute (38 mg/day).

The repair was difficult as the car was not symmetrical, having been hand built and already showing signs of previous, body damage. It was also noted that the shell was becoming very brittle, being made of thin alloy and being over 40 years old. To add to that, the rear offside wing had been made from a different material, so may have already had some restoration completed on the shell. The restorers retained as much of the original bodywork as possible, reworking it if necessary. They worked from large blown up photographs to set about creating the old shape, complete with the original inaccuracies, asymmetrical dimensions and distortions.|$|R
40|$|A {{soil and}} water {{conservation}} (SWC) project has been going on in southern Mali since 1986. Donor support was gradually withdrawn between 1998 and 2002, but no final evaluation was undertaken to learn lessons from this long-term and large-scale experience. The objective of this present research was {{to find out how to}} evaluate impact, what the impact in Mali has been, and which recommendations could be made for monitoring and evaluation in SWC projects. A reconstructed logical framework made it possible to find out what was needed for the impact evaluation, what was available from project monitoring and external monitoring, and what additional data and analyses were required. Missing baseline data were substituted by reconstructed baselines and virtual time series. Between 1988 and 2002, agriculture has expanded and intensified, but crop yields have declined and nutrient balances are still negative. Further intensification is needed to halt and reverse the yield decline. The cause-effect chain between project activities and impact showed that the SWC extension approach was effectively increasing farmer adoption of SWC measures. Farmer adoption steadily increased, spread to neighbouring villages and continued after project withdrawal. Erosion control measures (live fences, stone rows, grass <b>strips</b> and <b>check</b> dams) reduced erosion by 50 – 70 % and improved crop yields by 5 – 12 %. Current annual farmer benefits of increased cotton production largely outweigh the annual SWC extension costs during the project. SWC projects are recommended to complete the logical framework and monitor accordingly, and to collaborate with external monitoring for a more efficient evaluation of impact. Achieving impact may take longer than the project life span. Therefore, project activities should be embedded in a long-term national programme. It also implies that to assess impact after a short project period requires proxy impact indicators that reflect a continuing change, rather than an end-status...|$|R

40|$|In component-based systems, {{there are}} several {{obstacles}} to using Design by Contract (DbC), {{particularly with respect to}} third-party components. Contracts are particularly valuable when debugging or testing composite software structures that include third-party components. However, existing approaches have critical weaknesses.

The LSNT {{was used to determine}} the recommended N fertilizer rate that was applied uniformly across each field except on <b>check</b> <b>strips</b> where zero or nonlimiting (3 ̆e 220 kg N ha− 1) sidedress N was applied. Leaf chlorophyll (SPAD) readings, end-of-season stalk nitrate concentrations, and grain yield and quality (protein, starch, and oil content) showed significant year, field, soil map unit and N rate response. Average grain yield with the LSNT program was significantly lower than the nonlimiting rate in 1997 and 1998 but not in 1999 or 2000. This suggests that although watershed-scale implementation of the LSNT can reduce nitrate loss through drainage water, it may also increase producer risk, especially when above-normal rainfall occurs shortly after the sidedress N fertilizer is applied. To encourage adoption of the LSNT program for its water quality benefits, we suggest that federal, state, or private agencies develop affordable risk insurance or some other financial incentives to help producers minimize the potential crop risk associated with this program...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxy candidates in Abell 1689 (z = 0. 183) are investigated, based on deep high-resolution {{images from the}} Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. A UCD candidate has to be unresolved, have i < 28 mag (M-V < - 11. 5 mag), and satisfy color limits derived from Bayesian photometric redshifts. We find 160 UCD candidates with 22 mag < i < 28 mag. We estimate that about 100 of these are cluster members, based on their spatial distribution and photometric redshifts. For i greater than or similar to 26. 8 mag, the radial and luminosity distribution of the UCD candidates can be explained well by Abell 1689 's globular cluster (GC) system. For i less than or similar to 26. 8 mag, there is an overpopulation of 15 +/- 5 UCD candidates {{with respect to the}} GC luminosity function. For i less than or similar to 26 mag, the radial distribution of UCD candidates is more consistent with the dwarf galaxy population than with the GC system of Abell 1689. The UCD candidates follow a color-magnitude trend with a slope similar to that of Abell 1689 's genuine dwarf galaxy population, but shifted fainter by about 2 - 3 mag. Two of the three brightest UCD candidates (M-V similar or equal to - 17 mag) are slightly resolved. At the distance of Abell 1689, these two objects would have King profile core radii of similar or equal to 35 pc and r(eff) similar or equal to 300 pc, implying luminosities and sizes 2 - 3 times those of M 32 's bulge. Additional photometric redshifts obtained with late-type stellar and elliptical galaxy templates support the assignment of these two resolved sources to Abell 1689 but also allow for up to four foreground stars among the six brightest UCD candidates. Our findings imply that in Abell 1689 there are {{greater than or equal to}} 10 UCDs with M-V < - 12. 7 mag, probably created by stripping "normal" dwarf or spiral galaxies. Compared with the UCDs in the Fornax Cluster - the location of their original discovery - they are brighter, larger, and have colors closer to normal dwarf galaxies. This suggests that they may be in an intermediate stage of the <b>stripping</b> process. <b>Checking</b> the photometric redshifts of the brightest UCD candidates with spectroscopy would be the next step to definitely confirm the existence of UCDs in Abell 1689...|$|R

This system has been written in AutoLISP using AutoCAD on a personal computer and the I-DEAS drafting programming Language on the I-DEAS master series drafting with on HP 9000 / 715 (64) workstation. Data exchange between AutoCAD and I-DEAS master series drafting is accomplished using DXF(drawing exchange format) and IGES(initial graphics exchange specification) files. This system is composed of six main modules, which are input and shape treatment, production feasibility <b>check,</b> <b>strip</b> layout, data conversion, die layout, and post processing modules.

40|$|Photochemical {{machining}} (PCM), {{also known}} as photoetching, photofabrication or photochemical milling, is a non-traditional manufacturing method based on the combination of photoresist imaging and chemical etching. PCM uses techniques similar to those employed {{for the production of}} printed circuit boards and silicon integrated circuits. The PCM industry plays a valuable worldwide role in the production of metal precision parts and decorative items. Parts produced by PCM are typically thin, flat, and complex. These parts have applications in electronics, mechanical engineering, and the aerospace industry. The increasing popularity of industrial applications, together with greater competition, means {{that there is a need}} to understand the costs involved in PCM so that the right technology can be selected for manufacturing. The paper identifies the costs involved in Photochemical Machining and presents a cost model for PCM using a bottom-up approach. The research used IDEF 3 representation (work breakdown structure, WBS) to identify the process used in PCM. Expert interview, literature survey, and participant observation were used to identify cost drivers at each stage of the manufacturing process. The WBS and the cost drivers were used to develop the cost model, which is focused on stainless steel machining. Spreadsheets were used to implement the model, while the workbook is divided according to the main process steps and general costs. The worksheets contained in this workbook are: General Costs, Produce Drawing, Process Phototool, Select Metal, Prepare Metal, Coat the Metal, Process Photoresist, Etch Metal, <b>Strip</b> Photoresist, and <b>Check</b> & Package.

40|$|Introduction: While {{individuals}} with gluten sensitivities are instructed {{to follow a}} strict gluten-free diet, misinformed concerns over the consumption of gluten products {{has led to a}} rise in gluten avoidance diets, without a diagnosis of celiac disease. Gluten-free products, and therefore the diet as a whole, have been found to have twice as much fat, reduced carbohydrates and fiber, and approximately one-third less protein (Miranda 2014). Research on the effects of gluten-free diets on adolescent development is lacking. With recorded nutrient deficiencies in those that abstain from gluten, detrimental effects could be seen in adolescents who are put on non-prescribed gluten- free diets. Body mass is one factor in puberty onset, and may occur earlier in individuals consuming a gluten-free diet, from lower quality ingredients used in gluten-free products. Purpose: To evaluate the effects of gluten on weight gain, body composition, glycemic response, and puberty onset in newly weaned female rats, hypothesizing that gluten restriction causes a faster increase in body fat, triggering an earlier onset of puberty. Also, that gluten-restriction causes a higher increase in blood glucose than gluten- containing food. Methods: Sprague-Dawley female weaned rats (n= 20), age 23 days, were randomly separated into two groups, and fed either a gluten-free chow or a normal chow diet. Animals were housed separately at the UNLV LACF in a 12 -hour light/dark cycle room; water was provided ad libitum. Food intake, body weight and blood glucose were recorded daily for two weeks. Blood was collected from a tail clip, and glucose was measured using a Bayer Contour glucose meter and test <b>strips.</b> Rats were <b>checked</b> daily for vaginal opening starting on the 25 th day of life. After vaginal opening was confirmed, rats were euthanized and body composition was measured by a DXA scan. Results: Vaginal opening in the gluten-free group occurred earlier than in the control group (30 ± 2 vs 31 ± 2 days for gluten-free vs control respectively, p= 0. 01). Percent body fat was increased in the gluten-free group compared with controls (13. 8 ± 0. 39 vs 10. 4 ± 0. 72, p= 0. 015), however, weight gain (86 ± 2 vs 84 ± 3 g), food intake (236 ± 30 vs 215 ± 24 g), and daily blood glucose (83 - 86 mg/dL vs 80 mg/dL - 85 mg/dL for gluten-free and control respectively) were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Vaginal opening, and hence onset of puberty, occurred sooner in rats fed the gluten-free diet. Percent body fat was higher in the gluten-free group, consistent with the suggestion that increased body fat plays a role in the decreasing age of menarche in adolescent females. These results reinforce the importance of diet and how it can affect growth and maturation...|$|R
