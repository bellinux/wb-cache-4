5|$|Accum {{held his}} first lecture on {{chemistry}} and mineralogy {{in a small}} room in his house on Old Compton Street. His audience grew <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in The Times on January 6, 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{peninsula}} was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who became {{convinced of the}} region's economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola, improving the communication with the mainland. A possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April, the Germans invaded Greece and {{advanced}} <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> their forces quickly threatened to outflank the New Zealand positions. On 9 April the 4th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn and began moving {{south to the}} Servia Pass. Here, the 18th Battalion was positioned in the hills above the town of Servia {{and to the right}} of 19th Battalion, which was defending the pass itself. From 11 April, Stukas mounted air raids on the New Zealand positions before the Germans brought artillery to bear two days later as their ground forces approached. It was during an artillery barrage on 15 April that the battalion suffered its first fatality of the war. The same day, the 18th Battalion fended off initial probing attacks by elements of the 9th Panzer Division but were unable to prevent the Germans from occupying Servia.|$|E
5|$|The boys take Marvin to an all-you-can-eat buffet, {{where he}} is shocked by how much food the townsfolk consume {{compared}} to his home country, and by how wasteful Cartman is with his food. Back at school, Mr. Garrison announces the food drive is a failure because students have brought {{in only a few}} cans of creamed corn. The boys present Marvin to the class during show and tell, after which Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria tell the boys they will have to call Red Cross and send Marvin home. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephisto shows Chef that the turkey DNA is growing <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> the turkeys might take over the world if they are not stopped.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
50|$|Principally a {{military}} term, {{order of battle}} refers to the composition of an adversary's organization, including units, key personnel, equipment, and strength. In general, this {{is a form of}} basic intelligence, but is so important, and often <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> changing, <b>that</b> it may be assigned to a specific branch of an intelligence unit.|$|R

25|$|The disease {{suddenly}} appeared in Hamburg, spreading <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that,</b> {{in a few}} weeks, {{more than a thousand}} people died. The sickness swept through eastern Europe as an epidemic causing high mortality rates. It arrived in Switzerland in December, then was carried northwards to Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and eastwards to Lithuania, Poland and Russia.|$|E
25|$|Not all tornadoes {{are easily}} seen. A tornado funnel can be {{transparent}} until reaching {{an area with}} loose dirt and debris. Also, some tornadoes have been seen against sunlit areas, but rain or nearby low-hanging clouds has obscured other tornadoes. Occasionally, tornadoes have developed so suddenly, <b>so</b> <b>rapidly,</b> <b>that</b> little, if any, advance warning was possible.|$|E
25|$|In July Glover and Stanning {{started to}} be coached by Robin Williams. They were ranked 16th and 17th in their event and were also {{regarded}} as reserves for the women's eight.

25|$|After losing {{both his}} parents {{by the age}} of 10, Maugham was raised by a {{paternal}} uncle who was emotionally cold. Not wanting to become a lawyer like other men in his family, Maugham eventually trained and qualified as a physician. The initial run of his first novel, Liza of Lambeth (1897), sold out <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> Maugham gave up medicine to write full-time.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century it was reckoned that Younger’s was producing a quarter of all Scotland's beer. The company’s overseas trade had grown <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> 80,000 barrels a year were leaving the London stores alone for sixty overseas-based agencies. Cargoes were being carried from Leith to Belgium which became a principal market; private customers included the Czar of Russia and his household; and deliveries were finding their way across the world to destinations ranging alphabetically from Alexandria to Zanzibar.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies of}} the {{phenomenon}} suggested one {{solution to the problem}} was to increase the compression rate. In this approach, the compression would be started and stopped <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> the bulk of the plasma would not have time to move; instead, a shock wave created by this rapid compression would be responsible for compressing the majority of the plasma. This approach became known as fast pinch. The Los Alamos team working on the Columbus linear machine designed an updated version to test this theory.|$|E

5000|$|The torpedo struck Esquimalts {{starboard}} side. She sank {{within four}} minutes, the last Canadian vessel {{to be lost}} due to enemy action in World War II. While eight of her crew went down with her, the remainder survived the immediate disaster. Esquimalt sank <b>so</b> <b>rapidly,</b> however, <b>that</b> no distress signals were sent, {{and no one knew}} of the sinking until some eight hours later when [...] discovered the survivors. During the delay 44 crewmen had died of exposure, leaving only 26.|$|R
50|$|Pallor mortis occurs almost {{immediately}} (within 15-25 minutes) post-mortem; paleness develops <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> after death <b>that</b> {{it has little}} to no use in determining the time of death, aside from saying that it either happened less than 30 minutes ago or more, which could help if the body were found very soon after death.|$|R
25|$|By 11 September {{the armies}} were {{advancing}} <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> 76th AA Bde gave up Dieppe and concentrated at Amiens under orders {{to prepare for}} the AA defence of the vital port of Antwerp once that was in Allied hands. In the interim the brigade took over coast defence duties at Boulogne, with 113th HAA Rgt moving there on 23 September. Next day, 362/113th HAA Bty came under fire from German 88mm guns at Cap Gris Nez, and for two days the battery replied until the target was observed to be damaged.|$|E
25|$|The Waltham-Lowell system {{pioneered the}} use of a {{vertically}} integrated system. Here there was complete control over all aspects of production. Spinning, weaving, dying, and cutting were now completed in a single plant. This large amount of control made it so that no other company could interfere with production. The Waltham mill also pioneered the process of mass production. This greatly increased the scale of manufacturing. Water powered line shafts and belts now connected hundreds of power lines. The increase in manufacturing occurred <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> there was no localized labor supply in the early 19th century that could have sufficed. Lowell solved this problem by hiring young women.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Charles {{experienced}} leg cramps, dehydration and nausea. He was so ill {{that his}} relatives kept watch on {{him at all}} times, including a young cousin named Emma Pontier and {{a young woman who}} stayed with them by the name of Anna Brun. Marie treated him with various medicaments, especially gum arabic, which, according to her, always did her good, and which she always kept a ready supply of in her small malachite box, but to no avail. Charles deteriorated <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> another physician, Dr. Massénat, was called in for consultation. He also diagnosed cholera and prescribed eggnog to strengthen him.|$|E

25|$|Underway {{again on}} 6 December, Balao {{spent two days}} in {{training}} exercises and practice approaches with Coucal as her target. On 13 December, the submarine conducted communication and identification tests with friendly search planes and then began her patrol.

The four warships maneuvered in a radical zigzag plan at a speed of , passing the submarine <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> she only managed a shot at the second cruiser. Balao fired four torpedoes which overran their target. While rigging for depth charges, she heard three explosions, but upon surfacing, could see no sign of damage.

25|$|Jobs {{expanded}} <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> 400,000 {{people were}} attracted to the city from 1941 to 1943, including 50,000 blacks in the second wave of the Great Migration, and 350,000 whites, many {{of them from the}} South. Some European immigrants and their descendants feared black competition for jobs and housing. The federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work but when in June 1943, Packard promoted three blacks to work next to whites on its assembly lines, 25,000 whites walked off the job. The Detroit race riot of 1943 took place three weeks after the Packard plant protest. Over the course of three days, 34 people were killed, of whom 25 were African American, and approximately 600 were injured, 75% black people.|$|E
25|$|CH-type radar {{displays}} use a {{time base}} generator {{to produce a}} smoothly varying voltage that is fed {{to one of the}} inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The time base is calibrated to move the CRT dot across the screen in the same time that echoes would be returned from objects at the radar's maximum range. The dot moves <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>that</b> it looks like a solid line. The return signal is amplified and then sent into the CRT's other channel, causing the spot to deflect away from the straight line being created by the time base. For small objects, like aircraft, the deflection causes a small blip to appear on the display. The range to the target can be measured by comparing the location of the blip to a calibrated scale on the display.|$|E
