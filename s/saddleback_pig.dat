This farm had <b>saddleback</b> <b>pigs,</b> Jacob sheep, assorted hens and ducks and a range of animals not commonly found on small farms including rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs. The farm closed when the new school building was opened.|$|R
5000|$|Tim Wilson {{came from}} a farming {{background}} but initially dealt in antiques and property development. [...] He acquired an old farm in Nottinghamshire and kept three <b>saddleback</b> <b>pigs</b> there to {{make good use of}} the pigsty. [...] When they were grown and slaughtered, he bought three gilt Tamworth sows, Milli, Molly and Mandy and a Tamworth boar named Dai Bando. These bred quickly and so he soon had an abundance of pork. [...] He learnt how to make sausages and, in 1998, his friend Anne Wilson started a stall at the Borough Market selling his sausages. [...] The stall was successful and became a permanent outlet. Chef Paul Hughes then joined the business, bringing expertise in charcuterie and, together, they opened a butcher's shop in the Marylebone district of London. The business continued to prosper and in 2012 had grown to three farms, five shops and a series of cookery books.|$|R

50|$|The Wessex <b>Saddleback</b> or Wessex <b>Pig</b> is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} pig {{originating in the}} West Country of England, (Wessex), especially in Wiltshire and the New Forest area of Hampshire. It is black, with white forequarters. In Britain it was amalgamated with the Essex pig to form the British Saddleback, and it is extinct as a separate breed in Britain. However, the Wessex Saddleback survives in Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|Congenital tremor (CT) is {{a disease}} of newborn pigs {{characterized}} by spontaneous clonic contractions {{of one or more}} groups of voluntary muscles. Besides suspected or confirmed etiologies of CT such as classical swine fever virus, pseudorabies virus, Japanese encephalomyelitis virus, hereditary disorders in Landrace or <b>Saddleback</b> <b>pigs,</b> organophosphorus poisoning etc., porcine circovirus (PCV) {{has been described as a}} potential cause of CT. The type AII seems to be the most common form of CT. Although a potential association between PCV 1 or PCV 2 and CT-AII has been observed, about 50 % CT cases described up till now are caused by unknown reasons. In a PCV-seropositive 108 -sow, farrow-to-finish Belgian pig farm breeding hyperprolific Landrace, 42 litters with shaking piglet(s) were reported since June 2006. On March 2012, piglets born from four sows of a 27 sow batch demonstrated CT. After exclusion of main etiologies of CT from these CT-affected piglets, it was hypothesized that PCV 1 or PCV 2 could be the reason. Necropsies (n= 8) and histopathology (n= 3) were performed and no evidence of macroscopic or microscopic lesions were seen in cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord. Pre-suckled and post-suckled (after 3 days of colostrum uptake) serum samples were also collected from 9 piglets to determine PCV 1 - and PCV 2 -specific Ab titres by an immuno-peroxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). No PCV-specific Ab titres were observed in pre-suckled serum samples (≤ 40), whereas IPMA Ab titres of ≥ 640 were observed in post-suckled serum samples. Both PCV 1 and PCV 2 could not be isolated (< 101. 7 TCID 50 /g tissue) from 4 tested piglets (in heart, brain and lungs). The present results do not support the hypothesis that PCV 1 or PCV 2 are linked to CT in newborn piglets. Peer reviewe...|$|R
