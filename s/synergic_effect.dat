50|$|Uranyl nitrate, UO2(NO3)2, can be {{extracted}} from aqueous solution into diethyl ether. The complex that is extracted has two nitrato ligands {{bound to the}} uranyl ion, making a complex with no electrical charge and also the water molecules are replaced by ether molecules, giving the whole complex notable hydrophobic character. Electroneutrality {{is the most important}} factor in making the complex soluble in organic solvents. The nitrate ion forms much stronger complexes with the uranyl ion than it does with transition metal and lanthanide ions. For this reason only uranyl and other actinyl ions, including the plutonyl ion, , can {{be extracted}} from mixtures containing other ions. Replacing the water molecules that are bound to the uranyl ion in aqueous solution by a second, hydrophobic, ligand increases the solubility of the neutral complex in the organic solvent.

50|$|Conversely, plutonyl is {{more easily}} reduced than uranyl. This {{difference}} is utilized in {{the separation of}} plutonium from uranium in the PUREX process, as described below. The plutonyl ion is always associated with other ligands. The most common arrangement is for the so-called equatorial ligands to lie in a plane perpendicular to the O-Pu-O line and passing through the plutonium atom. With four ligands, as in PuO2Cl42− the plutonium has a distorted octahedral environment, with a square of ligand atoms in the equatorial plane. In plutonyl nitrate, PuO2(NO3)22H2O, as in uranyl nitrate there is a hexagon of six ligand atoms in the equatorial plane, four oxygen atoms from bidentate nitrate ions and two oxygens from the water molecules. Plutonyl nitrate, like uranyl nitrate, is soluble in diethyl ether. The complex that is extracted has no electrical charge. This {{is the most important}} factor in making the complex soluble in organic solvents. Also the water molecules are replaced by ether molecules. Replacing the water molecules that are bound to the plutonyl ion in aqueous solution by a second, hydrophobic, ligand increases the solubility of the neutral complex in the organic solvent.

5000|$|In Sanskrit Anahata means [...] "sound {{produced}} {{without touching}} two parts" [...] {{and at the}} same time it means [...] "pure" [...] or [...] "clean, stainless". The name of this chakra signifies the state of freshness that appears when we are able to become detached and to look at the different and apparently contradictory experiences of life with a state of openness (expansion). Normally we are used that an effect is produced by the confrontation of the two opposite forces. At the level of Anahata chakra appears the possibility to integrate the two opposite forces and in this way to obtain the effect (sound, in this case), without the two forces to be confronted(without touching of the two parts). This energy is specific to cooperation and integration, which brings peace and a new perspective in a world which, up to this level (considering only the energies specific to the first three centres of force: Muladhara, Swasdhistana and Manipura) was made only of a more or less conscious confrontation between opposite forces. The name Anahata suggests, in fact, the <b>synergic</b> <b>effect</b> of the interaction of energies at this level.|$|E
5000|$|Both linear and {{branched}} polyethylenimine {{have been}} used for CO2 capture, frequently impregnated over porous materials. First use of PEI polymer in CO2 capture was devoted to improve the CO2 removal in space craft applications, impregnated over a polymeric matrix. After that, the support was changed to MCM-41, an hexagonal mesostructured silica, and large amounts of PEI were retained in the so-called [...] "molecular basket". MCM-41-PEI adsorbent materials led to higher CO2 adsorption capacities than bulk PEI or MCM-41 material individually considered. The authors claim that, in this case, a <b>synergic</b> <b>effect</b> takes place due to the high PEI dispersion inside the pore structure of the material. As a result of this improvement, further works were developed to study more in depth the behaviour of these materials. Exhaustive works have been focused on the CO2 adsorption capacity as well as the CO2/O2 and CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity of several MCM-41-PEI materials with PEI polymers. Also, PEI impregnation has been tested over different supports such as a glass fiber matrix [...] and monoliths. However, for an appropriate performance under real conditions in post-combustion capture (mild temperatures between 45-75°C and the presence of moisture) it is necessary to use thermally and hydrothermally stable silica materials, such as SBA-15, which also presents an hexagonal mesostructure. Moisture and real world conditions have also been tested when using PEI-impregnated materials to adsorb CO2 from the air.|$|E

5000|$|A {{detailed}} comparison among PEI {{and other}} amino-containing molecules showed an excellence performance of PEI-containing samples with cycles. Also, {{only a slight}} decrease was registered in their CO2 uptake when increasing the temperature from 25 to 100°C, demonstrating a high contribution of chemisorption to the adsorption capacity of these solids. For the same reason, the adsorption capacity under diluted CO2 was up to 90% of the value under pure CO2 and also, a high unwanted selectivity towards SO2 was observed. Lately, many efforts {{have been made in}} order to improve PEI diffusion within the porous structure of the support used. A better dispersion of PEI and a higher CO2 efficiency (CO2/NH molar ratio) were achieved by impregnating a template-occluded PE-MCM-41 material rather than perfect cylindrical pores of a calcined material, following a previously described route. The combined use of organosilanes such as aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane, AP, and PEI has also been studied. The first approach used a combination of them to impregnate porous supports, achieving faster CO2-adsorption kinetics and higher stability during reutilization cycles, but no higher efficiencies. A novel method is the so-called [...] "double-functionalization". It is based on the impregnation of materials previously functionalized by grafting (covalent bonding of organosilanes). Amino groups incorporated by both paths have shown synergic effects, achieving high CO2 uptakes up to 235 mg CO2/g (5.34 mmol CO2/g). CO2 adsorption kinetics were also studied for these materials, showing similar adsorption rates than impregnated solids. This is an interesting finding, taking into account the smaller pore volume available in double-functionalized materials. Thus, it can be also concluded that their higher CO2 uptake and efficiency compared to impregnated solids can be ascribed to a <b>synergic</b> <b>effect</b> of the amino groups incorporated by two methods (grafting and impregnation) rather than to a faster adsorption kinetics.|$|E

The PA treatment (200 [*]μM) drastically altered intracellular triglyceride levels, total cholesterol, and expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism (CD 36, SREBP 1 c, PPAR-γ, and PPAR-α), whereas pretreatment with ACE significantly attenuated these alterations.
