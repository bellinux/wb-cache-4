5|$|The {{channel of}} Muncy Creek is sinuous with high streambanks and the creek has cobble and gravel bars. There {{are a few}} <b>strainers</b> on the creek.|$|E
25|$|<b>Strainers</b> {{are formed}} by many natural or {{man-made}} objects, like storm grates over tunnels, trees that {{have fallen into}} a river ("log jam"), bushes {{by the side of}} the river that are flooded during high water, wire fence, rebar from broken concrete structures in the water, or other debris. <b>Strainers</b> occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river forming <b>strainers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Small bowls {{were used}} for both eating and drinking. Small jugs {{contained}} condiments like olive oil, vinegar and sweeteners. Wide-mouthed pitchers held water and milk, while spouted decanters with narrow, ridged necks with built-in <b>strainers</b> held wine.|$|E
50|$|The actual initial drain {{part in a}} {{lavatory}} or sink is {{termed a}} <b>strainer.</b> If there is a removable <b>strainer</b> device that fits into the fixed <b>strainer,</b> it is termed a <b>strainer</b> basket. The initial pipe that leads from the <b>strainer</b> to the trap is termed the tailpiece.|$|R

25|$|Sweepers are trees {{fallen in}} or heavily {{leaning over the}} river, still rooted on the shore and not fully submerged. Its trunk and {{branches}} may form an obstruction in the river like <b>strainers.</b> Since it is an obstruction from above, it often does not contribute to whitewater features but may create turbulence. In fast water sweepers can pose a serious hazard to paddlers.|$|E
25|$|The {{tea leaves}} are {{packaged}} loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container {{such as a}} tea chest. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are sometimes vacuum packed for freshness in aluminised packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea must be individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavor control {{at the expense of}} convenience. <b>Strainers,</b> tea balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, the lid of which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.|$|E
50|$|Then the {{right-hand}} helper throws the fibre <b>strainer</b> on the bowl. In {{this kind of}} kava party the <b>strainer</b> is very large and is called unu. Skilfully, the mixer wets the fau and wipes {{the edge of the}} bowl, being very technical and formal in his movements. Then he begins to strain the kava, a process called in this ceremony milolua. He carefully and slowly pulls the <b>strainer</b> through the water with both hands. He then raises it, one end in his left hand, twists it and lays the twisted fiber on his left forearm, the one end still clasped in his left hand; then he reaches under his left arm with the right hand, takes hold {{of the end of the}} <b>strainer</b> lying on his arm, wrings the liquid from the <b>strainer</b> into the bowl, and turns his hands over and shakes the pieces of kava out of the <b>strainer</b> onto a mat to his right. The operation is repeated, but this time, instead of shaking the kava particles efe out of the <b>strainer,</b> he throws the <b>strainer</b> behind and away from him.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Clean {{water is}} a basic need of every individual. Today in {{numerous}} cities of India large number of waste water is produced. Such waste water is polluting natural water bodies like rivers lakes etc. Hence waste water filtration amp waters final purification is need of hour. In conventional type of filters when <b>strainer</b> gets clogged we have to manually clean it which takes time amp filtration processes stops during cleaning process. While in Self-Cleaning Basket <b>Strainer</b> when <b>strainer</b> gets clogged a pressure difference is created between inlet amp outlet nozzle which is sensed by the differential pressure gauges. A differential pressure gauge activates backwash assembly which automatically cleans the <b>strainer.</b> Hence Self-Cleaning Basket <b>Strainer</b> is used to save cleaning time amp it automates the filtering process...|$|R

25|$|The Thetford Hoard (also {{known as}} the Thetford Treasure) is a hoard of Romano-British {{metalwork}} found by Arthur and Greta Brooks at Gallows Hill, near Thetford in Norfolk, England, in November 1979, and now in the British Museum. Dating from the mid- to late-4th century AD, this hoard {{is a collection of}} thirty-three silver spoons and three silver <b>strainers,</b> twenty-two gold finger rings, four gold bracelets, four necklace pendants, five gold chain necklaces and two pairs of necklace-clasps, a gold amulet designed as a pendant, an unmounted engraved gem, four beads (one emerald and three of glass), and a gold belt-buckle decorated with a dancing satyr. A small cylindrical lidded box made from shale also belonged to the hoard.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} {{of bread and}} beer were closely linked, since barley was the same key ingredient used for both, {{and most of the}} tools used in beer production, such as mortars, querns and winnowing baskets were also the same as for bread making. Archaeological evidence specific to beer making is thus uncommon, and earlier indications were that the ancient Israelites did not often drink beer. More recently, Iron Age sites in Israel have produced remains such as beer jugs, bottles, <b>strainers</b> and stoppers, all of which provide evidence that the Israelites drank beer. Nonetheless, the widespread cultivation of grapes, used primarily for winemaking, indicates that wine drinking was probably far more common than beer drinking.|$|E
500|$|Near Mifflinburg, Buffalo Creek is [...] "tiny and twisting" [...] and {{its path}} is {{interrupted}} by fences and logs. There are also some <b>strainers</b> along its length. The creek is shallow for much of its length, even in stream pools. It mainly descends via gentle riffles. However, there is a weir with a height of [...] downstream of Mazeppa.|$|E
25|$|In an {{emergency}} {{it is often}} best to try to climb {{on top of a}} <b>strainer</b> {{so as not to be}} pinned against the object under the water. In a river, swimming aggressively away from the <b>strainer</b> and into the main channel is recommended. If it is impossible to avoid the <b>strainer,</b> one should swim hard towards it and try to get as much of one's body up and over it as possible.|$|R
50|$|A {{stretcher}} frame {{constructed from}} <b>strainer</b> bars {{should not be}} confused with one constructed from stretcher bars. <b>Strainer</b> bars are fixed to one another with wood glue, nails or staples, often in conjunction. <b>Strainer</b> bar frames are often reinforced with other fixed elements such as corner and cross braces. These frames are not built to accommodate the insertion of tightening keys into their corners to further tighten the canvas stretched upon them as a stretcher bar frame would.|$|R
5000|$|The Boston Shaker: A two-piece shaker {{consisting}} of a [...] metal bottom and traditionally a [...] glass or plastic mixing glass. The mixing container and bottom are inserted into each other for shaking or used separately for stirring or muddling. A separate <b>strainer,</b> such as a Hawthorne or Julep <b>strainer,</b> are required for this type shaker if crushed ice is used. Without such a <b>strainer,</b> some bartenders may instead strain by narrowly separating the two pieces after shaking and pouring the drink through the resulting gap. The market offers now [...] and [...] container versions too. Beginning in the late 1870s and early 1880s, versions of the Boston Shaker appeared with the metal bottom piece containing integral <b>strainer</b> mechanisms.|$|R

500|$|The {{topography}} at {{the headwaters}} of Roaring Creek is mountainous. However, much of the watershed is rough and hilly and the creek flows through a valley surrounded by broken hills. It flows through a narrow gorge for its last [...] The creek's channel is sinuous. There are cobbly and rocky rapids on some reaches of the creek. In the gorge, the creek flows past cliffs and over ledges and waterfalls. A set of wet limestone ledges known as the Roaring Creek Bluffs are located along the creek in Franklin Township and Montour County. Power lines also cross the creek in this reach. Some <b>strainers</b> occur on the creek upstream of State Route 3012. A ridge known as Sharp Ridge is located near the creek.|$|E
500|$|One type of {{soil series}} {{found in the}} {{vicinity}} of Little Fishing Creek is the Middlebury Series. This soil series ranges from deep and fairly well-drained to poorly-drained alluvial soil. It consists of Tioga soils and Holly soils. All of the rock in the creek's watershed upstream of the United States Geological Survey's stream gauge is shale or sandstone. A fairly narrow band of rock of the Hamilton Group is located near the creek. Rock outcroppings of the Chemung Formation are visible in Hemlock Township, approximately [...] upstream of Fishing Creek. Rock formations consisting of shale and sandstone are present {{in the vicinity of}} the creek. Numerous riffles occur on parts of Little Fishing Creek. There are also <b>strainers</b> in places.|$|E

2500|$|Another major {{whitewater}} {{feature is}} a sieve, {{which is a}} narrow empty space that water flows through between two obstructions, usually rocks. [...] Similar to <b>strainers,</b> water is forced through the sieve, resulting in higher flow velocity which forces water up and creates turbulence.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Strainers</b> {{are formed}} when an object blocks {{the passage of}} larger objects but allows {{the flow of water}} to {{continue}} - like a big food strainer or colander. [...] These objects can be very dangerous, because the force of the water will pin an object or body against the strainer and then pile up, pushing it down under water. For a person caught in this position, it will be difficult or impossible to get to safety, often leading to a fatal outcome.|$|E

2500|$|In 1913 Anna Alston married Harry Bearden. Through the marriage, {{the future}} artist Romare Bearden became Charles’ cousin. The two Bearden {{families}} {{lived across the}} street from each other; the friendship between Romare and Charles would last a lifetime. As a child Alston was inspired by his older brother Wendell's drawings of trains and cars, which the young artist copied. Charles also played with clay, creating a sculpture of North Carolina. As an adult he reflected on his memories of sculpting with clay as a child: [...] "I’d get buckets of it and put it through <b>strainers</b> and make things out of it. I think that's the first art experience I remember, making things." [...] His mother was a skilled embroiderer and took up painting at the age of 75. His father was also good at drawing, wooing Alston's mother with small sketches in the medians of letters he wrote her.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Strainers</b> and sieves {{can pose}} a {{particular}} hazard. If the sieve is visible above water, a boater can be pinned {{against it and}} may eventually be forced underwater as the current passes through. [...] If the sieve is completely submerged, it is especially insidious because {{it may not be}} discernible at all. [...] In shallow water, bows of boats can get caught in submerged sieves, as the current pulls the nose down below the rocks where it can lodge. [...] If this happens, {{it is likely that the}} whole boat will get pulled under water. [...] Sieves pose a particular hazard to swimmers because even the smallest sieves can trap a person's foot if they stand up in the current. [...] The force of the current then pushes the whole body underwater, becoming a deadly situation in a matter of seconds. [...] It is for this reason that one of the first things whitewater boaters learn is never to stand up in more than ankle deep water where there is a current.|$|E
