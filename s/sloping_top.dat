25|$|Parliament Hill is a {{limestone}} outcrop with a gently <b>sloping</b> <b>top</b> {{that was}} originally covered in primeval forest of beech and hemlock. For hundreds of years, the hill {{served as a}} landmark on the Ottawa River for First Nations and, later, European traders, adventurers, and industrialists, to mark their journey to {{the interior of the}} continent. After Ottawa—then called Bytown—was founded, the builders of the Rideau Canal used the hill as a location for a military base, naming it Barrack Hill. A large fortress was planned for the site, but was never built, and by the mid 19th century the hill had lost its strategic importance.|$|E

60|$|In {{that vast}} {{hall in the}} busy town of Sherborne, in which our illustrious English novelist is {{expected}} to read next month--though he is strongly of opinion that he is deficient in power, and too old--I wonder what accommodation there is for reading! because our illustrious countryman likes to stand at a desk breast-high, with plenty of room about him, a <b>sloping</b> <b>top,</b> and a ledge to keep his book from tumbling off. If such a thing should not be there, however, on his arrival, I suppose even a Sherborne carpenter could knock it up out of a deal board. Is there a deal board in Sherborne though? I should like to hear Katey's opinion on that point.|$|E

It is just the one crag of rock, as everybody knows, but great enough to carve a city from. The sea was extremely little, but there went a hollow plowter round the base of it. With the growing of the dawn I could see it clearer and clearer; the straight crags painted with sea-birds' droppings like a morning frost, the <b>sloping</b> <b>top</b> of it green with grass, the clan of white geese that cried about the sides, and the black, broken buildings of the prison sitting close on the sea's edge.|$|E

40|$|Geobag {{retaining}} wall using construction waste {{is a new}} flexible supporting structure, and the usage of construction waste to fill geobags can facilitate the construction recycling. In this paper, model tests were performed on geobag {{retaining wall}} using construction waste. The investigation was concentrated on the <b>slope</b> <b>top</b> settlement, the distribution characteristics of the earth pressures on retaining walls and horizontal wall displacements, and slope failure modes. The {{results indicated that the}} ultimate loads that the <b>slope</b> <b>tops</b> with retaining walls could bear were 87. 5 %~ 125 % higher than that of the <b>slope</b> <b>top</b> without retaining walls. The ultimate loading of strengthened slopes with different slope ratios from 1 [*]:[*] 0. 75 to 1 [*]:[*] 0. 25 could be reduced by 11. 8 % to 29. 4 %. The horizontal displacements of the retaining walls constructed from geobags were distributed in a drum shape, with the greatest horizontal displacements occurring about 1 / 3 ~ 1 / 2 of the wall height away {{from the bottom of the}} wall. As the slope ratio increased, the failure of the slope soil supported by geobag retaining wall using construction waste changed from sliding to sliding-toppling (dominated by sliding) and then to toppling-sliding (dominated by toppling). The range of 1 / 3 ~ 1 / 2 of wall height is the weak part of the retaining walls, which should be strengthened with certain measures during the process of design and construction...|$|R

50|$|In 1988, Corima diversified into carbon {{composite}} parts and its first product for cycling : the disc wheel. This {{was followed by}} the 4-spoke wheel, the Puma monocoque frame, the Aero wheel, the Ellipse seatpost and others to create a range of carbon products. In 1994, Corima expanded to frames, achieving success with the Puma, an aerodynamic carbon monocoque road frame with a steeply <b>sloping</b> <b>top</b> tube, based on the custom track frame ridden by Chris Boardman in 1993. However, production was discontinued in 1999, due to revised UCI rules that rendered the Puma's geometry inconsistent with racing frame guidelines. This banning from competition meant limited exposure and sponsorships. Corima continued making a track frame with similar geometry and <b>sloping</b> <b>top</b> tube - the Cougar - until it was replaced by the VIF frame.|$|E

50|$|Kona Bikes is {{a bicycle}} {{company based in}} the Pacific Northwest. Founded in 1988 and still owned by Dan Gerhard and Jacob Heilbron in Vancouver, BC, their World Headquarters are located in Ferndale, Washington, with Canadian {{distribution}} offices in Vancouver, and European distribution offices in Geneva, Switzerland. Gerhard and Heilbron worked initially with Mountain Bike Hall of Fame rider Joe Murray to create a range of custom steel hardtails. Kona was the first brand to produce a complete range of <b>sloping</b> <b>top</b> tube design mountain bike frames. Paul Brodie collaborated with the TBG and was likely instrumental in implementing the <b>sloping</b> <b>top</b> tube design from previous work with Rocky Mountain and with his own company.The Canadian headquarters are located near the famous North Shore mountains of Vancouver, leading Kona to develop a range of Freeride mountain bikes in 1998 known for durability {{as well as for}} their ability to handle extremely technical downhill terrain. Kona has gone on to develop a complete range of road, commuter, cyclo-cross in addition to a complete range of mountain bikes. Using a range of materials including carbon fiber, titanium, aluminum and steel, Kona's bikes are sold in over 60 countries worldwide. The company's website is located at www.konaworld.com.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of table <b>top</b> <b>slope</b> and height on body posture and muscular activity pattern. Twelve asymptomatic participants performed a 5 -min reading task while sitting, in six experimental conditions manipulating the table <b>top</b> <b>slope</b> (20 ° backward slope, no slope) and its height (low, medium, up). EMGs recordings were taken on 9 superficial muscles located at the trunk and shoulder level, and the angular positions of the head, trunk and pelvis were assessed using an inertial orientation system. Results revealed that the <b>sloping</b> table <b>top</b> was associated with a higher activity of deltoideus pars clavicularis (P< 0. 05) and a smaller flexion angle of the head (P< 0. 05). A tentative conclusion is that a <b>sloping</b> table <b>top</b> induces a more erect posture of the head and the neck, but entails an overload of the shoulder, which might be harmful on the long run...|$|R
