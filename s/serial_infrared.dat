A wrist-mounted accelerometer provided stroke information to the transmitter. The signal was detected using a photodiode detector. Both the transmitter and receiver units measured 27 × 19 mm. Propagation experiments in air and under water were performed in a glass tank (91 × 39 × 45 cm) to validate the system. The maximum link length in air was 2 m and in still water 70 cm. In water with bubbles, the range reduced to 50 cm. This distance is sufficient for wrist-head communications during swimming.

40|$|As {{more data}} {{communications}} products, such as printers and laptop PCs, are released with infrared capability, {{support for a}} core set of IrDA standards has strong support from many manufacturers because, among other things, they want {{to ensure that their}} products will interoperate in a transparent and user-friendly manner. The use of infrared techniques for data communications has been around for several years, and by 1993 several commercial products were available with this capability. However, each company has tended to have its own infrared standard, and although devices from the same manufacturer could communicate with each other, competing systems tended not to be interoperable. Examples of such proprietary infrared systems include Hewlett-Packard’s HP SIR (<b>serial</b> <b>infrared),</b> Sharp’s ASK systems, and General Magic’s MagicBeam. The resulting confusion in the marketplace meant that users viewed infrared as having only limited utility. On June 28, 1993, the Infrared Data Association (IrDA) had its first meeting with the purpose of establishing a ubiquitous, low-cost, point-to-point <b>serial</b> <b>infrared</b> standard. Some 50 representatives from 20 interested companies were expected, but over 120 people representing more than 50 companies actually attended. It was clear that the industry was interested in developing a standard that would allow the true value and utility of infrared to be realized. At the culmination of this process—and due in no small part to the enthusiasm and spirit of cooperation of the participating companies—the first IrDA standards were published, just one year and two days after the initial meeting. To date, IrDA has specified the physical and protocol layers necessary for any two devices that conform to the IrDA standards to detect each other and exchange data. The initial IrDA 1. 0 specification detailed a serial, half-duplex, asynchronous system with transfer rates of 2400 bits/s to 115, 200 bits/s at a 1 ������� � ���� • �� � �������������� � ������ � range of up to one meter with a viewing half-angle of between 15 and 30 degrees (see Figure 1).

Infrared light, {{commonly referred to as}} “IR”, is a common, easy-to-use, low power and low-cost media to transmit information. Among the few “wireless” communication choices, IR has the significant advantage of compatibility with hundreds of millions of electronic devices with IR ports (i. e., laptop PCs, PDAs). The vast majority of IR-capable devices are compatible with a set of standards established by the Infrared Data Association, or IrDA®.

40|$|Because of the {{importance}} of small target detection in infrared images, many studies have been carried out in thisarea. Using a Kalman filter and mean shift algorithm, this study proposes an algorithm to track multiple small movingtargets even in cases of target disappearance and appearance in <b>serial</b> <b>infrared</b> images in an environment with manynoises. Difference images, which highlight the background images estimated with a background estimation filterfrom the original images, have a relatively very bright value, which becomes a candidate target area. Multiple targettracking consists of a Kalman filter section (target position prediction) and candidate target classification section(target selection). The system removes error detection from the detection results of candidate targets in still imagesand associates targets in serial images. The final target detection locations were revised with the mean shift algorithmto have comparatively low tracking location errors and allow for continuous tracking with standard model updating. In the experiment with actual marine infrared serial images, the proposed system was compared with the Kalmanfilter method and mean shift algorithm. As a result, the proposed system recorded the lowest tracking location errorsand ensured stable tracking with no tracking location diffusion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Digital {{infrared}} {{thermal imaging}} {{is a means}} of measuring the heat radiated from the skin surface. Our goal was to develop and assess the reproducibility of <b>serial</b> <b>infrared</b> measurements of the knee and to assess the association of knee temperature by region of interest with radiographic severity of knee Osteoarthritis (rOA). METHODS: A total of 30 women (15 Cases with symptomatic knee OA and 15 age-matched Controls without knee pain or knee OA) participated in this study. Infrared imaging was performed with a Meditherm Med 2000 ™ Pro infrared camera. The reproducibility of infrared imaging of the knee was evaluated through determination of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for temperature measurements from two images performed 6 months apart in Controls whose knee status was not expected to change. The average cutaneous temperature for each of five knee regions of interest was extracted using WinTes software. Knee x-rays were scored for severity of rOA based on the global Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale. RESULTS: The knee infrared thermal imaging procedure used here demonstrated long-term reproducibility with high ICCs (0. 50 - 0. 72 for the various regions of interest) in Controls. Cutaneous temperature of the patella (knee cap) yielded a significant correlation with severity of knee rOA (R = 0. 594, P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION: The skin temperature of the patellar region correlated with x-ray severity of knee OA. This method of infrared knee imaging is reliable and as an objective measure of a sign of inflammation, temperature, indicates an interrelationship of inflammation and structural knee rOA damage...|$|E
