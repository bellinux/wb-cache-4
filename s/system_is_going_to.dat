There will be 49,750 rooms to meet IOC requirements, of which some 1,700 are located in apartment hotels {{in the city and}} more than 13,000 in hotels throughout Rio de Janeiro and the football tournament host cities. Rio de Janeiro proposed the use of cruise ships and condominium apartments to overcome a possible shortage in the number of hotel rooms. Six modern cruise ships will provide more than 8,500 cabins. Media would be accommodated in a combination of media villages and hotels. Rio de Janeiro plans to implement [...] of Olympic lanes connecting the four Olympic zones and the Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport. An existing corridor of high-capacity rail and metro systems as well as motorways and major roads links three of the four Olympic zones, and with the development of the western corridor, all four zones will be connected. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the main solution to the city's topography. Security and disaster-related risks for the event will be mitigated by the implementation of a comprehensive security operation. Crime in parts of Rio de Janeiro was considered to be an issue for the safety of people attending the Games. Rio de Janeiro's experience in mounting security structures around highly mediatized and crowd-attracting events is a positive aspect. The Federal Government will be responsible for the security of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.|$|E

Activities included going to Liberia and Croatia to monitor their elections, bringing major speakers to campus, denouncing the death penalty, trying to end the United States embargo against Cuba, fostering political courage among his students, promoting amendment to the United States Constitution to end electoral college, and to limit the President to a single six-year term of office.

As much the system complexity and the number of intelligent agents grow, as much the system response uncertainty seems to grow also: this suggests to have greater attention to the agents autonomy and responsibility. Present paper first aims to verify if the increasing complexity of actual logistics <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow a greater and greater autonomy to individual agents.
