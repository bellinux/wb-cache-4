40|$|The NCV 8508 B is a {{precision}} micropower Low Dropout (LDO) voltage regulator. The part contains {{many of the}} required features for powering microprocessors. Its robustness makes it suitable for <b>severe</b> <b>automotive</b> environments. In addition, the NCV 8508 B is ideal for use in battery operated, microprocessor controlled equipment because of its extremely low quiescent current...|$|E
40|$|The NCV 8770 is 350 mA LDO {{regulator}} with integrated reset functions dedicated for microprocessor applications. Its robustness allows NCV 8770 {{to be used}} in <b>severe</b> <b>automotive</b> environments. Ultra low {{quiescent current}} as low as 21 ï¿½A typical makes it suitable for applications permanently connected to battery requiring ultra low quiescent current with or without load. This feature is especially critical when modules remain in active mode when ignition is off. The NCV 8770 contains protection functions as current limit, thermal shutdown and reverse output current protection...|$|E
40|$|A new {{generation}} of mechatronic devices, such as the E-latch for door closure, is introduced in the automotive field to replace mechanical systems with electro-actuated parts with embedded electronic control unit (ECU) connected to the main vehicle network. Due to <b>severe</b> <b>automotive</b> safety-critical requirements an energy back-up solution is proposed, based on supercaps and boost converter, to ensure E-latch operation even in case of main battery failure. An in-depth thermal, electrical and durability characterization of the supercaps proves the suitability of the energy back-up unit for automotive applications...|$|E
50|$|In late 2008 GM, {{along with}} Chrysler, {{received}} {{loans from the}} American, Canadian, and Ontarian governments to bridge the late-2000s recession, record oil prices, and a <b>severe</b> global <b>automotive</b> sales decline (see also automotive industry crisis of 2008-2009) due to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. On February 20, 2009, GM's Saab division filed for reorganization in a Swedish court after being denied loans from the Swedish government.|$|R
40|$|With the {{anticipation}} of increasing system demands, the need to integrate multiple functions (e. g. digital, analog, high voltage, etc.) on a single chip has become apparent. PICs (power integrated circuits), which combine high-voltage, high-current output devices with low-voltage logic and control elements, have provided better performance and reliability, and reduced cost and system size compared to the discrete approach. A major issue {{for the design of}} this kind of circuits is the substrate cross-talk between adjacent power and CMOS devices, which prevents normal operation of the circuits. The issue becomes more <b>severe</b> in <b>automotive</b> applications, in which a high temperature environment is usually involved. The commonly used isolation techniques in PICs are the traditional p-n junction isolation (JI) and the dielectric isolation (DI). But JI still requires large silicon area, and the electrical isolation is rather poor. Although the superiority of DI offered by SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology results in a much smaller chip area and minimum leakage current, the higher wafer cost and lower heat dissipation capability limit it only to niche applications. In this paper, a novel bulk silicon isolation structure with wafer-thick, front-back trench is proposed for automotive (42 V) power integrated circuit (PIC) applications. This technique provides the advantages of complete isolation with lower wafer cost and higher thermal dissipation capability compared with the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology. Experimental results show that the novel isolation structure can provide complete electrical isolation and a 13 % reduction in the thermal resistance compared to the SOI technology. In addition, this novel isolation technology offers a potential cost reduction of 5 X to 10 X compared to the SOI technology...|$|R
40|$|The E-latch {{is a new}} {{automotive}} mechatronic {{device that}} substitutes the door closure mechanical system with electro-actuated parts plus an embedded electronic control unit (ECU) connected to the main vehicle network. Due to <b>severe</b> <b>automotive</b> safety-critical requirements for door closure, an energy back-up system is required. A solution based on supercaps and boost converter is proposed in this work to ensure E-latch operation even in case of main battery failure. An in-depth thermal, electrical and durability characterization of the supercaps proves {{the reliability of the}} energy back-up unit for automotive applications. A Components Off the Shelf (COTS) approach has been followed for the E-latch prototype and test phases. A migration towards an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design approach is envisaged for future large volume production...|$|E
