25|$|An {{insolvent}} {{is liable}} to imprisonment {{for a number of}} acts committed before sequestration, which, if committed by a <b>solvent</b> <b>person,</b> would not constitute crimes: for example, failing to keep proper books, or diminishing his assets by gambling, betting or hazardous speculations. Further, an insolvent is criminally liable for certain specified acts committed during sequestration, such as obtaining credit to an amount exceeding R20 without informing the creditor that he is insolvent.|$|E
60|$|Of the gains, however, {{which the}} {{possession}} of a capital enables a person to make, (1) a part only is properly an equivalent {{for the use of}} the capital itself; namely, as much as a <b>solvent</b> <b>person</b> would be willing to pay for the loan of it. This, which as everybody knows is called interest, is all that a person is enabled to get by merely abstaining from the immediate consumption of his capital, and allowing it to be used for productive purposes by others. The remuneration which is obtained in any country for mere abstinence is measured by the current rate of interest on the best security; such security as precludes any appreciable chance of losing the principal. What a person expects to gain, who superintends the employment of his own capital, is always more, and generally much more, than this. The rate of profit greatly exceeds the rate of interest. (2.) The surplus is partly compensation for risk. By lending his capital on unexceptionable security he runs little or no risk. But if he embarks in business on his own account, he always exposes his capital to some, and in many cases to very great, danger of partial or total loss. For this danger he must be compensated, otherwise he will not incur it. (3.) He must likewise be remunerated for the devotion of his time and labor. The control of the operations of industry usually belongs to the person who supplies the whole or the greatest part of the funds by which they are carried on, and who, according to the ordinary arrangement, is either alone interested, or is the person most interested (at least directly), in the result. To exercise this control with efficiency, if the concern is large and complicated, requires great assiduity, and often no ordinary skill. This assiduity and skill must be remunerated.|$|E

5000|$|The Municipal Bank {{was founded}} in 1896 to support the {{financial}} needs of the citizens and small businesses in the highly productive region of southern Santa Fe Province, centered in Rosario. At the time, the city had around 92,000 inhabitants and was already the most important port on the Paran√° River. The idea of creating a municipal financial institution was expressed in 1893 by mayor Floduardo Grandoli, citing the proliferation of [...] "centers of usury" [...] that exploited those in need of credit, especially the poor (something not addressed by {{the profile of the}} Provincial Bank of Santa Fe, which granted loans only to demonstrably <b>solvent</b> <b>persons).</b> Acting on this, the municipal Counseling Commission passed a bill (on 1 February 1895) dictating an [...] "Organic Charter of the Municipal Bank of Loans and Savings Accounts". The bank opened exactly one year later.|$|R
50|$|An abettor {{differs from}} an {{accessory}} {{in that he}} must be present at the commission of the crime; in addition they are equally guilty as they knowingly and voluntarily assist in the commission of that crime. All abettors (with certain exceptions) are principals, and, in the absence of specific statutory provision to the contrary, are punishable to the same extent as the actual perpetrator of the offence. A person may in certain cases be convicted as an abettor in the commission of an offence in which he or she could not be a principal, e.g. a woman or boy under fourteen years of age in aiding rape, or a <b>solvent</b> <b>person</b> in aiding and abetting a bankrupt to commit offences against the bankruptcy laws.|$|E
