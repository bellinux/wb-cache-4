40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{analyzes}} the compatibility of the simplified empirical method {{based on the}} dimensionless parameter of <b>Solar</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Ratio</b> (SLR) and the monthly procedure of the standard ISO 13790 for indirect gains, specifically for unconditioned zones adjacent to a conditioned zone, but separated from it by a partition wall (sunspaces). The main contribution of the work presented here is the new formulation to account SLR correlations in ISO 13790, obtained for sunspaces, but generalizable for other solar systems with known SLR functions. Simulation models are used to perform a sensitivity analysis of internal gains and heat transfer through solar collector surfaces, both issues that distinguishes ISO 13790 from Load Ratio methods. The analysis shows that internal gains {{can be added to}} the heat source term or subtracted to heat transfer term without influencing the utilization factor dependence with the gain-to-loss ratio. On the other hand, the SLR assumption that solar collector surfaces are neutral elements and, therefore, not added to the heat transfer term, results in large inconsistencies between SLR and ISO 13790 methods. The detailed monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fairly reproduces results obtained by simulation. However, predictions from the simplified monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fail in mid season months and coldest months...|$|E
40|$|The method Passive Cooling Load Ratio (PCLR) is an {{innovative}} simplified method which calculates the monthly cooling energy {{needs of a}} thermal zone where passive cooling systems are installed using the variables: cooling energy load and passive cooling potential. This new method {{is based on the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Ratio</b> (SLR) that was previously developed for solar heating systems. Although, PCLR was theoretically developed for any passive cooling system, here it is applied to passive cooling based on ventilation strategies. In addition, this paper presents its application to an office room ventilation using: i) forced cooled air from an earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) and ii) natural induced air by a solar chimney from the EAHE. Correlations were obtained for those systems, using the parameters that describe the local climate, the system type and its dimensions. The numerical model used to obtain the correlation functions when one of the systems is installed, associates previously developed numerical models with 5 R 1 C model of ISO 13790. However, the PCLR method can be used to accurately estimate the cooling energy needs without using complex models for simulation. The error for all systems does not overcomes 5. 2 %, which is an acceptable variation for a simplifed method...|$|E
40|$|A solar-aided {{coal-fired}} power plant realizes the integration of a fossil fuel (coal or gas) and clean energy (solar). In this paper, a conventional 600 MW {{coal-fired power}} plant and a 600 MW solar-aided {{coal-fired power plant}} have been taken as the study case to understand the merits of solar-aided power generation (SAPG) technology. The plants in the case study have been analyzed by using the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics principles. The <b>solar</b> irradiation and <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> have been considered in the analysis. We conclude that if the solar irradiation was 925 W/m 2 and <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> of the SAPG plant was 100 %, the exergy efficiency would be 44. 54 % and the energy efficiency of the plant (46. 35 %). It was found that in the SAPG plant the largest exergy loss was from the boiler, which accounted for about 76. 74 % of the total loss. When the <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> of the unit remains at 100 %, and the solar irradiation varies from 500 W/m 2 to 1, 100 W/m 2, the coal savings {{would be in the}} range of 8. 6 g/kWh to 15. 8 g/kWh. If the solar irradiation were kept at 925 W/m 2 while the <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> of the plant changed from 30 % to 100 %, the coal savings could be in the range of 11. 99 g/kWh to 13. 75 g/kWh.

The {{influence}} of the Deficiency of Power Supply Probability (DPSP), Relative Excess Power Generated (REPG), Energy to <b>Load</b> <b>Ratio</b> (ELR), fraction of PV and wind energy, and coverage of PV and wind energy against the system size and performance were analyzed. The technical feasibility of PV-wind hybrid system in given range of load demand was evaluated. The methodology of Life Cycle Cost (LCC) for economic evaluation of stand-alone photovoltaic system, stand-alone wind system and PV-wind hybrid system have been developed and simulated using the model. The comparative cost analysis of grid line extension energy source with PV-wind hybrid system was studied in detail. The optimum combination of solar PV-wind hybrid system lies between 0. 70 and 0. 75 of <b>solar</b> energy to <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> and the corresponding LCC is minimum. The PV-wind hybrid system returns the lowest unit cost values to maintain the same level of DPSP as compared to standalone solar and wind systems.

40|$|The {{integrity}} {{of nearly all}} engineering structures are threatened {{by the presence of}} cracks. Structural failure occurs if a crack larger than a critical size exists. Although most well designed structures initially contain no critical cracks, subcritical cracks can grow to failure under fatigue loading, called fatigue crack growth (FCG). Because it is impossible or impractical to prevent subcritical crack growth in most applications, a damage tolerant design philosophy was developed for crack sensitive structures. Design engineers have taken advantage of the FCG threshold concept to design for long fatigue lives. FCG threshold (DK th) is a value of DK (crack-tip loading), below which no significant FCG occurs. Cracks are tolerated if DK is less than DK th. However, FCG threshold is not constant. Many variables influence DK th including microstructure, environment, and <b>load</b> <b>ratio.</b> The current research focuses on <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects on DK th and threshold FCG. Two categories of <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects are studied here: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects operate in the crack wake and include fatigue crack closure mechanisms. Intrinsic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects operate in the crack-tip process zone and include microcracking and void production. To {{gain a better understanding of}} threshold FCG <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects (1) a fatigue crack closure model is developed to consider the most likely closure mechanisms at threshold, simultaneously, and (2) intrinsic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> mechanisms are identified and modeled.

(The <b>loading</b> <b>ratios</b> were D/Pd= 0, 0. 08, 0. 10, 0. 17 and 0. 27.)

When the traffic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> is over 3, the number of discarded packets in TDMA exceeds MPMH and MPMH-SRSC, which leads to lower average delay in TDMA.|$|R

30|$|With the {{introduction}} of MRMC, MPMH-MRMC can better utilize MPMH than the MPMH-SRSC, and the throughput of MPMH-MRMC increases linearly even under heavy traffic load. With the traffic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> from 10 to 20, MPMH-MRMC surpasses MPMH-SRSC by about 82.34 % under uniform traffic and 108.29 % under random traffic, respectively.

When the traffic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> is over 3, the number of discarded packets in TDMA exceeds MPMH and MPMH-SRSC, which results in smaller network throughput in TDMA.

The variation with <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> of the peak (Kth) and cyclic (ΔKth) stress intensities at the fatigue threshold showed that two different processes controlled the behaviour. At high <b>load</b> <b>ratios</b> dislocations are generated readily during loading and the threshold is controlled by the need for sufficient unloading to allow dislocations to run back into the crack, so that the criterion ΔK ≥ ΔK* results.

Test data were generated from threshold to near fracture using compression pre-cracking constant-amplitude (CPCA) or compression pre-cracking loadreduction (CPLR) test methods in the threshold regime; and constant-amplitude loading at higher rates. Remote back-face strain (BFS) gages were used to monitor crack growth. BFS and local strain gages placed along the crack path were both used to measure crack-opening loads. Previous research had indicated that high <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> and Kmax tests produced crack-closure-free conditions. However, measured crack-closure behavior under high <b>load</b> <b>ratios</b> and Kmax test conditions was attributed to residualplastic deformations, crack-surface roughness and/or fretting-debris. From local crack-opening load measurements, the effective stress-intensity-factor range appeared to be uniquely related to crack-growth rate from threshold to higher rate conditions...|$|R
