2500|$|In late 1999, al-Shehhi, Atta, Ziad Jarrah, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh {{decided to}} travel to Chechnya {{to fight against the}} Russians, but were {{convinced}} by Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi at the last minute to change their plans. They instead traveled to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and train for terrorist attacks. Immediately afterwards, Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah reported their passports stolen, possibly to erase travel visas to Afghanistan. After their training, the hijackers began to attempt to hide their radicalism. al-Shehhi shaved his beard and seemed to his old friends like he had become less religious.

That's right, Ziva and Tony in Paris! You wouldn't believe it, but as if that weren't enough, their French hotel totally screws up the reservation and the two bad-ass agents end up ... gulp ... sharing a room together." [...] Executive producer Shane Brennan disclosed, [...] "There will be a realization that the spark is still there. It doesn't mean that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be resolved, {{but it does mean}} that the journey may have started again. It's a long road back.

60|$|VALENTINE. As if <b>something</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. It {{came over}} me {{suddenly}} just before you proposed that we should run away to the others.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, Nigel," [...] she confessed. [...] "I can't {{imagine what}} is wrong with me. I feel shivery--nervous--as though <b>something</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen." ...|$|R
50|$|At the Island Fire, {{when the}} players left, J.K and Joel told the viewers that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen to Claw, and they weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> like it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to {{tell you}} boys something," [...] said the girl, in almost a whisper, and not noticing what Fred had proposed. [...] "I-I am afraid <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus appealed to, {{the chief}} gave {{it as his}} opinion that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen, for the sky in the nor'-west looked uncommonly black. Having given {{utterance}} to this cautious remark he relapsed into silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Mr. Fentolin," [...] she whispered. [...] "Please come in; {{let us go}} in at once. He only plays when he is excited. I {{am afraid}}! Oh, I am afraid that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she said, [...] "I {{feel it in}} my very bones. I {{firmly believe}} that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen to every one of us. I have a most mysterious {{pricking}} about my left elbow!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{four young}} {{people looked at}} each other. What did this mean? Had the {{servants}} left in a body? Did they know that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen? Such <b>were</b> the mute questions which their looks asked each other.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were some}} rumors that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen ... We did know there <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a riot.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, with {{a strange}} look of her large eyes, [...] "if you {{continue}} to be guided by me, you shall. I tell you so, and I never make mistakes. Hush, <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. What is it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know that}} very well. It {{was the only}} thing to do with it. I had sat looking at it all day without {{touching}} it. I had begun to hate it. It seemed <b>to</b> me <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems ages ago," [...] he replied. [...] "To-day, at any rate, I feel differently. I {{knew when}} I glanced at Lady Amesbury's card {{this morning that}} <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. I went to that stupid garden party all agog for adventure." ...|$|R
50|$|Some sources claim Criswell's {{most famous}} {{prediction}} was on The Jack Paar Program (1962-65) in March 1963, when he predicted that US President John F.

6000|$|The {{months passed}} (more than I had bargained for), and no {{occasion}} presented itself for disturbing that {{mark in the}} book.

60|$|RIDGEON. Yes, of course. Theres {{nothing wrong}} {{with any of the}} organs: nothing special, anyhow. But I have a curious aching: I dont know where: I cant {{localize}} it.

6000|$|... "I don't {{only just}} believe it, Marse Tom, I know it. Day before {{yesterday}} they knew <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen.
