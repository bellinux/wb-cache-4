5|$|Senator Mary White had {{announced}} her intention {{to stand for}} the Fianna Fáil nomination in 2008, but in May 2011 said that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be seeking the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Teresa Geter {{was a big}} contributor, as well, {{with five}} blocked shots. Clement was able to play the game, but it set her rehab back, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> play again for over a month.|$|E
5|$|After {{her mother}} {{announced}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{run for re-election}} in 2014, Davis filed as a Democratic candidate for county clerk. At a candidates' forum, Davis stated {{she felt she was}} best qualified for the position because of her 26 years of experience in the clerk's office.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should hope not!" [...] said Mrs. Mulbridge. [...] "I guess <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> {{have been}} alive {{to tell the}} tale, {{if it had n't}} been for you." ...|$|R
60|$|Polly soon lured her out again, by {{assurances that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> be utterly despoiled, and {{promises}} to try and soften the hard hearts of her father's creditors, if the ear-rings and the smelling-bottle were attached.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it did me; for {{you know}} {{as soon as we}} came to grief I offered to release Trix from the engagement, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> let me," [...] {{continued}} Tom, as if, having begun the subject, he wished to explain it thoroughly.|$|R
5|$|Chapter 5 relates that Odin {{gave all}} of his temple priests {{dwelling}} places and good estates, in Njörðr's case being Nóatún. Chapter 8 states that Njörðr married a woman named Skaði, though <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have intercourse with him. Skaði then marries Odin, and the two had numerous sons.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E
5|$|Mary Dudley {{said that}} if this were not true, I might be sure <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{say such a thing}} as it might cost her her life and she was acting now with the Queen's consent, but she (the Queen) would not speak to the Emperor's {{ambassador}} about it.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Jennings {{directly}} {{gave her}} the gratifying assurance that <b>she</b> certainly <b>would</b> <b>NOT,</b> and Miss Steele was made completely happy.|$|R
60|$|Picotee gazed {{upon the}} sea with a crestfallen look, as if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> cross {{it in any}} {{capacity}} just then.|$|R
60|$|Lady Janet intimated by a {{sign that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> hear. <b>She</b> at once {{inclosed}} the check in an undirected envelope.|$|R
5|$|The {{contracts}} of Edelstein, Epps, and Leonard expired {{at the end}} {{of season}} seven. As a cost-cutting measure, the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries. Epps and Leonard came to terms with the producers, but Edelstein did not, and in May 2011 it was announced that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be returning for the show's eighth season.|$|E
5|$|When word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce {{found it}} {{difficult}} to believe, and his wife fainted. Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's candidacy would not be successful, as he knew <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> like to live in Washington.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E
50|$|Kitten {{refused to}} vote and {{therefore}} cast a vote against herself. Even if she did vote, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> still <b>not</b> receive her suitcase.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> mayhap <b>not.</b> I believe myself <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do {{anything}} short of disowning her Popery {{to get out of}} prison; but as matters stand I doubt me whether Cis--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} {{supposed}} that," [...] answered the lady; [...] "for if Miss Asher <b>would</b> <b>not</b> take you <b>she</b> certainly <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{be content with}} either of them." ...|$|R
5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E
5|$|After being {{sworn in}} as premier, Dunderdale {{announced}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be seeking {{the leadership of the}} Progressive Conservative Party and therefore would only serve in the role of premier until a leadership election was held in the spring of 2011. However, on December 17, 2010, Dunderdale announced that she was reconsidering running for the leadership of the party and that she would make a final decision after Christmas.|$|E
5|$|At Theobald's request, Pope Gregory urged Alice {{to come to}} Rome, {{because the}} {{legitimacy}} of her parents' marriage was to be investigated. Alice refused {{to appear before the}} papal tribunal, but renounced her claim to Champagne and Brie for 40,000 livres tournois and estates yielding a yearly income of 2,000 livres in September 1234. In the agreement with Theobald, she also stated that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> erect fortresses in her estates in Champagne.|$|E
50|$|On September 4, 2012, Toscano parted {{ways with}} Interscope Records and 19 Management and her debut album that <b>she</b> {{recorded}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be released.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, please, sir, don't blame Fan much, for {{she truly}} is n't half as silly as Trix and the other, girls. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> go sleigh-riding, though Mr. Frank teased, {{and she wanted}} to ever so much. She 's sorry, I know, and won't forget what you say any more, if you 'll forgive her this once," [...] cried Polly, very earnestly, when the foolish little story was told.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{stood at}} the front gate looking after them. Do what <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> <b>she</b> could <b>not</b> help a tear or two rising to her eyes. Mr. Loudon noticed her {{standing}} there, and {{he went down to}} her.|$|R
5|$|Closing in Melbourne August 9, 2009, {{the show}} {{transferred}} to Sydney's Capitol Theatre. Previews began on September 5, 2009, {{with the official}} opening on September 12. Shortly into the run, Harrison {{was forced to leave}} the role of Elphaba, so current standby Jemma Rix and Australian theatre veteran Pippa Grandison began to share the role, each appearing in four shows per week. Eventually, it was confirmed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be returning to the cast.|$|E
5|$|Danny, {{aware that}} the Oceanic Flight 815 {{survivors}} are responsible, takes his anger out on Sawyer by violently beating him; Sawyer refrains from fighting back. Kate pleads with him to stop; Danny ceases only after Kate admits to loving Sawyer. Afterwards, Kate notices a gap in her cage, and manages to climb through. She tries to free Sawyer, but he bitterly refuses, remembering Karl's escape and bloody capture. Kate returns to her cage, insisting that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> abandon him, and tells Sawyer that she lied about loving him so that Danny would stop.|$|E
5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been {{troublesome}} for some time, she suffered {{a succession of}} falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices. She realised that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title Harvest of the Cold Months.|$|E
60|$|Lawson sniggered. Since Mrs Chaplin {{held the}} purse-strings {{if she wanted}} a new frock for the {{occasion}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> certainly <b>not</b> ask her husband for the money.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you {{everything}};--that is, everything I can." [...] And Grace blushed as {{she thought of the}} one secret which <b>she</b> certainly <b>would</b> <b>not</b> tell.|$|R

5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed as {{someone with a}} bright political future. Many expected her {{to run in the}} 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , she said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale was the Progressive Conservative Candidate in the {{district}} of Fortune-Hermitage in the 1993 provincial election. Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> win the election she felt she had to send premier Clyde Wells a message about the way he was treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> tolerate the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented Sylvia in an {{indifferent}} tone, {{though she}} was slightly disturbed. Herbert was keen-witted, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> have had him {{take an interest in}} her affairs.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2009, Hazlett drew flak for criticizing Frozen River, an indie {{film that}} <b>she</b> claimed <b>would</b> <b>not</b> draw {{ratings for the}} Oscars and calling fans of the film [...] "effete." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't like it," [...] she replied. She {{had indeed}} been trying all the {{afternoon}} to read it, {{and for some reason}} the glory which she had perceived at first had faded, and, read as <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> <b>she</b> could <b>not</b> grasp the meaning with her mind.|$|R
