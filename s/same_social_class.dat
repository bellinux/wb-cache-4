Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent. Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> {{that served as the}} recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population.|$|E

This mass grave contained the remains of 53 females ranging in age between 15–30 years of age, arranged in two layers separated by matting.

Analysis of bones and dental traits of these women have led archaeologists to believe these individuals were not from the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> and ethnic group as other individuals interred in the mound. Non-metric dental traits have suggested that these individuals were not from the Cahokia area and were possibly immigrants new to the area. Analysis of specific carbon isotope and nitrogen isotope ratios left by maize consumption in the bones and cartilage of the women as well as pathologies indicative of poor health and nutritional stress; have led researchers to also conclude they were of a lower social status than elite burials in the mound, consuming more maize and less animal protein than elite individuals.|$|E

This term, renaissance, was used by Mace et al, (2007) in their paper about the urban changes to east Manchester. A further term called social rejuvenation is more appropriate because it implies an intervention in the continuing decline of as area without specifying for whom the improvements are intended thus allowing the market forces to determine the social makeup, and therefore avoiding accusations of letting the locals down through unfulfilled promises. This paper examines in detail both Sydney 2000 and Barcelona 1996 Olympic Games organisers’ strategies in developing their cities in order to host their respective games and in doing so the effects these plans had on the demographic structure of the local populations.

40|$|Objective. —To {{determine}} if there are <b>social</b> <b>class</b> gradients in health in children aged 6 to 11 years. Methods. —Self and parent reports of health of children in 5 sites across the United States were assessed using the Child Health and Illness Profile–Child Edition. Distribution of scores in 4 domains: satisfaction (with health); comfort; resilience; and risk avoidance were used to create profiles of health. <b>Social</b> <b>class</b> {{was defined as a}} composite of parental education and work participation. Results. —Social class gradients were found for all but the satisfaction domain and for most subdomains in the parent version; the most notable gradient was in the risk avoidance domain, with better health the higher the <b>social</b> <b>class.</b> Apparent gradients did not reach statistical significance in the child reports.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{possible}} influence of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> on the prevalence of cerebral palsy. DESIGN [...] The study was a retrospective population based survey of all cases of cerebral palsy. SETTING [...] The study involved all cases of cerebral palsy born to residents in the Eastern Health Board area of the Republic of Ireland between 1976 and 1981 inclusive. PATIENTS [...] There were 289 cases of cerebral palsy during the study period. Thirty one were excluded because they were attributable to postneonatal brain damage, leaving 258 children for analysis. Cases with uncertain diagnosis were excluded. MAIN RESULTS [...] There was a clear <b>social</b> <b>class</b> gradient in the overall prevalence of cerebral palsy, also evident in the individual syndromes of hemiplegia and diplegia. No such gradient was detected in the other syndromes, either singly or in combination. Among cases of low birthweight (less than or equal to 2500 g), the prevalence was the <b>same</b> across the <b>social</b> <b>class</b> range after allowing for the increased low birthweight rate in the lower <b>social</b> <b>class</b> categories. Among normal birthweight cases there was a strong positive association with decreasing <b>social</b> <b>class.</b> Intrauterine growth retardation seemed to be a factor in cerebral palsy in all <b>social</b> <b>class</b> groups. Prevalence of cerebral palsy severe enough to prevent walking by the fourth birthday, but not of cases ambulant by this age, increased with socioeconomic disadvantage. CONCLUSIONS [...] The clear <b>social</b> <b>class</b> gradients in hemiplegia and diplegia suggest that environmental factors play an important role in the aetiology of these syndromes, but there was no evidence of a contribution from this type of factor in the remaining types of cerebral palsy...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHOD: Birthweight data by enumeration district deciles ranked by Townsend Deprivation Index based on 1991 census data for all live births in the West Midlands Health Region were studied in three consecutive whole year birth cohorts, 1991 to 1993 and by Registrar General's <b>social</b> <b>class</b> in a 10 % sample of live births (within marriage and jointly registered, provided by the Office of National Statistics) in the same region for the same period.

Relative risk of birth weight or = 3500 g, the most advantageous group, is substantially greater in the socially advantaged. Using the area-based measure, an estimated 12 % of births < 3500 g could be ascribed to social inequalities whereas the <b>same</b> figure using <b>social</b> <b>class</b> was 7 %.

40|$|The word {{regeneration}} features {{prominently in}} the official documentation of the London 2012 organisers, the International Olympic Committee, various books, articles and journals, especially in relation to justifying the hosting of mega-events. Exactly what does the word mean and is it the correct word to use? London 2012 intends to transform {{the lives of the}} people of East London through the social, physical and economic changes, in that ‘regeneration’ means keeping the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> and improving the facilities and infrastructure for their benefit. However, experience from past Games has proven that in most case the ex-athletes village properties’ become sort after accommodation through their location, historical significance and in particular with Sydney, their high environmental standards. These properties therefore appreciate in value very quickly and become occupied by middle class, thus causing a renaissance of the area rather than regeneration (Mace et al, 2007). In addition there is also social rejuvenation relating to reversing the decline of an area without specifying for whom the improvements are necessarily intended. Is it feasible to accommodate mix use housing? Will the Games organisers eventually need to maximise their return on the sale of the properties and therefore reduce the size of the affordable housing stock? Will the true locals benefit from the organisers plans for the area? Many of the answers to these questions can be considered by studying past Games’ experiences, particularly lessons to be learnt from Barcelona and Sydney. Several in-depth interviews with stakeholders of the Games have been conducted, using stakeholder theory for the theoretical underpinning (Friedman and Miles, 2002). A phenomenological stance is taken as it is an approach that focuses on how life is experienced and the use of interviews from past-Games will help with predicting what could happen in London. It is the perceptions, meanings, attitudes and feelings that are important to discuss as these experiences tell a story. Whilst the interviews were conducted by city, the semi-structured approach to interview protocol has allowed each interview to be iterative, in that new themes emerging are included in subsequent interviews. The sampling is purposive, whereby each interviewee has a role within the Olympic planning from the perspective of the local community. The data from the interviews has been analysed via thematic analysis, using Ritchie and Spencer’s Framework (1994) ...|$|R

In addition to the substantial number of Shaoxing natives who succeeded in becoming officials via the regular civil-service examination route, this vertical Shaoxing clique also included county-level jail wardens, plus unofficial legal specialists (muyou) working privately for officials at the county, prefectural, and provincial levels, plus clerks working in Beijing's Six Boards (central administrative offices), especially the Boards of Revenue and Punishment.

40|$|Theoretical {{models are}} a way of visualizing, in context, the many factors that {{contribute}} to inequalities in health. This article presents a model showing the micro-level pathways relating employment and working conditions to health inequalities. A first important (indirect) pathway runs through the unequal distribution of harmful working conditions. Both employment and working conditions tend to be unequally distributed along the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> axes: <b>social</b> <b>class,</b> gender, ethnicity/race, immigration/migration status, ter-ritory, and so forth. Underlying mechanisms are exploitation, domination, and discrimination. Material deprivation and economic inequalities constitute a second direct pathway linking (nonstandard) employment conditions to health inequalities. In a third pathway, employment conditions may have an important effect on health inequalities via several psychosocial, behavioral, and physiopathological pathways. Although these several pathways are separated for analytical purposes, they are largely intertwined and, ideally, should be studied in an integrated way. The theoretical model presented in this article serves three main purposes: providing analytical clarity for organizing scientific data, encouraging further observation and causal testing, and identifying policy entry points.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concentrates on}} the textual analysis of five short stories from the period 1962 - 1910, all of which share the same characteristic: they all present the coexistence of a natural and a supernatural domain, being these two domains incompatible according to the premises proposed by the text. Considering that these stories appear in a historical period in which reason {{is seen as the}} means to achieve 'civilisation' and 'progress', the ambiguous coexistence of these two orders appears as a challenge to the hegemony of reason and, in an extended sense, as a challenge to the modernisation project. Furthermore, considering that the authors of these stories belonged to the dominant classes, be it politically or intellectually, the challenge comes from the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> that formulated the official discourse. In order to understand how these texts construct the ambiguity between a natural and a supernatural domain, the following questions were posed: At which levels of the texts is the mentioned ambiguity created? How is it created? How is it kept throughout the stories? When studying the use of narrative techniques, it could be seen that the technical preoccupation is very much present in these stories, and that the creation of a natural and a supernatural domains is in great measure a product of the narrative act. When analysing the use of motives, figures and themes, it could be seen that through these, the stories inscribe themselves in the gothic tradition and in the wider tradition of the supernatural in literature. This contributes {{to the creation of the}} supernatural domain. The motif of the threshold and its associated motif, the motif of the gothic castle, were shown to play a fundamental roll in the structuring of the textual space in which the coexistence of the domains will take place. The analysis of the use of the discourses of science and progress showed that science not always contributes to the creation of the natural domain, as well as confirmed the presupposition that the discourse of science and the discourse of spiritualism were not separated by clear limits.
