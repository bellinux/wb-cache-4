40|$|The paper {{examines}} if {{the seven}} South Asian countries satisfy the criteria {{to form an}} optimal currency area. The empirical part of the paper reveals some positive attributes (such as the existence of positive shocks for major economies like India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). The paper provides geo-political reasoning for more economic cooperation among the countries, suggesting areas where cooperation could be mutually beneficial to the economies. This paper argues {{that the benefits of}} a common currency would accrue from the peace that economic integration would bring between India and Pakistan. The paper also compares this region with Western Europe and Southeast Asia. <b>South</b> <b>Asia,</b> <b>SAARC,</b> Monetary union, economic integration, optimal currency areas...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{economic}} growth of countries nowadays relies {{much on the}} regional economic alliance developed among countries. This type of integration is gradually spreading to {{different parts of the}} world including the <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> <b>SAARC</b> is an organization of South Asian countries, mainly institutionalized as an economic alliance to work with collaboration and accelerate their socio-economic development. But, since the inception of SAARC, the achievement in regional economic integration is insignificant and the level of intra-regional trade flow among SAARC countries is still very low compared to the rest of the world. The region accounts for a very insignificant share of world trade but persistent high levels of tariff barriers. The present study attempts to examine the prospects and briefly reviews and identifies constraints to intra-regional trade and modes of economic cooperation in the region. It aims to enhance cooperation amongst members in order to improve competitiveness and put forward a set of recommendations for the policy makers requiring relentless determination to make the alliance successful in future...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe devastating earthquakes that ravaged Nepal {{in the spring}} of 2015 demonstrated the risk of disaster that affects all of <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> They also demonstrated the real limits to a regional disaster management and response. According to The Kathmandu Post, almost 4175 troops from 18 countries were deployed for rescue and relief operations. All South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member states except Afghanistan and Maldives rushed to help in the Nepalese tragedy. SAARC had no plan for this response mode of transporting relief materials. The lack of a pre-coordinated plan or resource management created tensions even in the capital Kathmandu. The situation in remote areas, where the road links were damaged and helicopters were the only mode of transporting relief materials, was even worse. The elements of a more effective structure for disaster response in the region may be at hand within SAARC. Political leaders all voice their support for regional effort to respond to or mitigate the frequent natural disasters in <b>South</b> <b>Asia,</b> but <b>SAARC</b> {{has not been able to}} establish strong institutions for coordinated response to higher magnitude disasters. This thesis examines why SAARC has not been able to form or sustain a strong disaster management organization and, based in part on other regions’ experiences with coordinated disaster management, which elements would contribute to a more effective regional disaster management within SAARC framework.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{is defined as}} economic access to food along with food production and food availability. Agriculture in the SAR (South Asian Region) is caught in a low equilibrium trap with low productivity of staples, supply shortfalls, high prices, low returns to farmers and area diversification - all these factors can {{be a threat to}} food security. <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> still has the highest number of people (423 millions) living on less than one dollar a day. The region has the highest concentration of undernourished (299 million) and poor people with about 40 per cent of the worlds hungry. Despite an annual 1. 7 per cent reduction in the prevalence of undernourishment in the region in the past decade, the failure to reduce the absolute number of the undernourished remains a major cause for concern. Estimates by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) indicate that by 2010, Asia will still account for about one-half of the worlds undernourished population, of which two-thirds will be from <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> Though <b>SAARC</b> countries have established a food bank {{to meet the needs of}} food security in the region, it has not been operational even during times of crisis. This is despite the felt need of member nations to evolve mechanisms to make the SAARC Food Security Reserve operational. It is against this background that this study has been undertaken. Conducted in collaboration with think-tanks from South Asian countries, it aims to identify issues relating to food security, the policy initiatives taken to tackle these issues, evaluate these policies and suggest measures to overcome identified constraints in order to improve the food security situation in the region. <b>South</b> <b>Asia,</b> food security, Safety Nets, Food Bank...|$|R

40|$|<b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> has {{attracted}} global attention {{because it has}} experienced rapid GDP growth {{over the last two}} decades. What is not so well known is that <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is the least integrated region in the world. <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> has opened its door {{to the rest of the}} world but it remains closed to its neighbors. Poor market integration, weak connectivity, and a history of friction and conflict have resulted in two <b>South</b> <b>Asias.</b> The first <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is dynamic, growing rapidly, highly urbanized, and is benefiting from global integration. The second <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is rural, land locked, full of poverty, and lagging. The divergence between the two <b>South</b> <b>Asias</b> is on the rise. Policy makers in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> have realized that countries and regions can not grow in isolation. The unique geography of South Asia— distance and density—has the potential to raise growth through increased flow of labor, capital, ideas, technology, goods and services within the region and with the rest of the world. Most lagging regions, in terms of both per capita income and poverty incidence, in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> are either land-locked or located in the border areas. Regional cooperation and market integration will unlock the development of these lagging regions in <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> This paper—a product of the <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> Regional Programs Unit, <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> Region—is part of a larger effort in the Region to promote dialogue and debate on the importance of regional cooperation for growth and poverty reduction i...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{sharing a}} common culture and heritage, <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> {{is one of}} the least {{integrated}} regions of the world. There are numerous persistent problems creating continuous hurdles for regional integration in <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> In this paper an effort is made to present the case for the regional integration of <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> from the perspective of functional theory. Interestingly, some countries in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> are energy deficit and some have vast unexplored potential to meet these shortfalls. The pertinent issue is how to link demand and supply of energy in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> so that it subsequently becomes a functional area for cooperation. This paper considers prevalent models of cooperation in energy security of other regions and argues how it can be relevant to the context of <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> The role of various actors essential for promoting cooperation in energy security in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is discussed in this paper.
