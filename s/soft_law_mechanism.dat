40|$|This piece {{seeks to}} contextualize today’s {{environment}} of policy learning and emulation by {{turning to a}} continuing debate that would distinguish internationalization and globalization. One of the most contentious points in this debate is the role and legitimacy of the various actors involved in globalization. This piece discusses the mechanism of “soft law, ” which allows non-state actors to participate in policy processes traditionally and even exclusively populated by sovereign nation states. The analysis utilizes Ostrom et al. ’s Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to highlight the institutional implications of non-sovereigns in policy formation, and thus learning and emulation, introduced by the dynamics of globalization. Ultimately, the <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanism</b> suggests that policy learning and emulation {{is not limited to}} cross-national relationships, but should recognize the relationships of a host of transnational organizations...|$|E

We explain the absence thus far of adequate protection for blue-collar migrant labour in formal law and corporate governance from a 'path-dependence' perspective and examine the potential of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> options and government policies on labour migration as possible catalysts of change. The impact of the 1997 Asian fĳinancial crisis in creating new corporate governance rules and government support {{for the development of}} CSR is discussed along with international initiatives, such as the United Nations Global Compact, whereby Malaysian companies have committed to playing a positive role in creating favourable outcomes for labour and human rights. Avenues of development vis-a-vis CSR and other <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for blue-collar migrant workers are offered. We conclude with a comment on the trajectory for CSR, <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> options and blue-collar migrant employee relations in Malaysia by highlighting the potential for hybrid labour regulation, whereby <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> may be hardened through creative methods of interpretation by the courts. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{introductory}} article aims {{to clarify}} why <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> {{is an interesting}} field to explore from a legal anthropological perspective and to point {{out a number of}} issues this theme section suggests taking into consideration. The article provides the context for the theme section, inserting <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> within global legal concerns and processes. It outlines the emergence of the notion of <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> and summarizes the controversies it has raised among legal scholars and law practitioners. Then it explains why, despite the elusive character of the notion and its uncertain normative status, as soon as we move beyond a number of emblematic concerns for <b>law</b> practitioners, <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and practices appear to be a vantage point to explore the emerging transnational legal order, and particularly the relations among state, supra-state, and non-state (private) forms of regulation. Finally, the article introduces the articles in the special section of this issue by highlighting {{the ways in which they}} empirically deal with <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> practices and global legal pluralism in a variety of social fields and contexts, using ethnographic sensitivity and imagination. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of tax competition in global economy. How can tax systems respond to the challenge - by international cooperation or by national rules, by tax harmonisation or by tax competition? In this paper we approach the question {{as a matter of}} global governance. Tax competition is seen both as a means and as an object of global governance. Our conclusion {{is that there is no}} universal answer to the question: competition or harmonisation? Attempts to govern the processes of global economy on a national level may easily lead to tax competition. On the other hand, at least at the supranational level, i. e. at regional or global level, the goals and mechanisms of governance seem to emphasise harmonisation. Nowadays especially the OECD has become an important actor or forum for cooperation in taxation. It has succeeded in many ways in preventing and reducing harmful tax competition. The <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms</b> developed by the OECD have often been converted into the hard <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on national level. The governance activities have been based on both <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> and hard <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Could {{industry}} {{improve our}} response to botnet attacks? If so, how should this private sector participation be regulated? This paper examines how regulation {{could be used to}} facilitate private sector intervention against robot networks, also known as botnets. The first part of this paper is dedicated to exploring botnets and the potential role industry could play to mitigate them. The second part exposes the regulatory challenges that must be met by regulators attempting to further industry participation in this arena. The third part outlines starting points for regulating this select private sector intervention. It builds upon the pioneering efforts launched in the Netherlands, United States, Germany, and Finland, and presents a compass for guiding regulatory choice. Stemming from these considerations, a hard <b>law</b> and two <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are presented as a commencement for regulating this intervention. This paper does not concentrate on a particular jurisdiction, but adopts a more international approach that could support regulatory efforts {{in various parts of the}} world, given the omnipresent discussion on how to counter botnets...|$|R
40|$|Food {{security}} has long developed since President Roosevelt determined {{it as the}} “freedom from fear and the freedom from want. ” The concept surrounds four pillars: availability, accessibility, utilization and stability; a failure to provide all four is {{likely to result in}} an individual or group as food insecure. Indigenous Peoples, and especially those in the Arctic region, are deemed some of the most food insecure world-wide. This is a result from constant bombardment of challenges and threats that are facing them daily, including climate change, shipping, tourism, mining, forestry, oil & gas. These threats have impacted the Indigenous way of life andtheir environment, leading to a shift away from traditional foods towards more store-bought foods. These changes have resulted in tremendous health impacts on Indigenous Peoples through nutrition content and food contamination. On the other hand, a number of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> mechanismsare currently in place directly and indirectly aimed to promoting and protecting food security in the Arctic and associated rights, such as the right to food and the right to culture; however, there are gaps that still remain. Suggestions to address these gaps have formulated around both legally binding and <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as an international food security treaty and using the Arctic Council as a platform for protecting and promoting food security. Regardless, Indigenous Peoples, their rights and concerns all need {{to be taken into account}} when concerning food security...|$|R
40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{has gained}} more {{importance}} {{in recent years}} as companies have realized that the adoption of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> CSR instruments is a strategic resource to improve their social, environmental and financial performance. Although CSR has received a lot of attention from the academic world in recent years, researchers have not yet fully explored how specific <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms</b> impact on companies. Using the qualitative method, this study examines the external and internal impacts of CSR on firms. To succeed in the aim of this thesis, the ESR (Socially Responsible Company) Distinction is used as a case of study and proxy indicator of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> CSR instruments. In the process, this study will also collect information about what motivates companies to pursue the ESR Distinction, as well as the changes and benefits derived from obtaining this recognition. The results show that CSR initiatives enhances the relationship with stakeholders and corporate reputation, boost firm attractiveness to investors, reduce costs and improve the firm’s operational efficiency. The findings suggest that external impacts are higher than the internal ones, which is connected with the companies’ motives to adopt CSR initiatives. Responses indicate that the primary motivation lies on improving companies’ reputation, followed by the firm’s differentiation from competitors, and external pressures. This dissertation expands the knowledge in this field by focusing on the impacts of private CSR initiatives, specifically in Codes of Conduct and Label instruments through the analysis of the ESR Distinction. Consequently, the study’s results contribute to knowledge by highlighting the importance of external pressures on companies’ decision-making to adopt CSR initiatives as an explanatory factor of where firms put greater efforts to receive higher impacts...|$|R
40|$|European women's {{organizations}} {{were among the}} first social movements to recognize the European Union (EU) as an important context for claim-making. From the mid- 1990 s, feminist groups had secured a representation to this transnational opportunity structure {{in the form of the}} European Women's Lobby (EWL), which receives EU funding, has access to policy setting, and is credited with a role in the construction and consolidation of EU gender equality policy. More recently, the EWL has experienced a contraction in the EU political opportunity context, a function of Eurocrisis dynamics that deem gender equality too costly at a time of austerity. EU progress on gender equality has stalled, with most policy advanced through non-binding or <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This work assesses the implications of these shifts for the strategies and patterns of mobilization employed by the EWL as it works to exploit <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> opportunities and develop collaborative strategies with other EU non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and in other intergovernmental fora to promote a gendered analysis of the economic crises. Though this latter strategy is a relatively late and weak engagement on austerity, it marks a departure in strategic terms. The organization has also adopted strategies aimed at compensating for declining resources including seeking out new resource streams and cohering closely to topics where EU funding opportunities remain. Analysis of the EWL's response to this challenging political opportunity structure allows for an assessment of how feminist NGOs deal with austerity-based reductions in the political space and financial support for feminist mobilization and gender equality measures across Europe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} existing tax competences in EU law, in {{the light}} of European and international obligations, and their evolution since the initial founding of the European Economic Community. It approaches this task not just from the perspective of competences, but examines values, objectives, obligations and actual governance capacities underpinning the implementation and realisation of these aims and duties in the field of taxation. The analysis is linked to discourses addressing sustainability gaps within EU taxation law and policy, in particular: a prevailing focus on economic growth; a lack of EU-level environmental taxation; an absence of tax measures that tackle, much less consider inequalities in income and wealth; and, persisting socio-economic inequalities between men and women. The concept of sustainable development features prominently in the objectives of the European Union and is closely linked to the function of the internal market. The implications of sustainability for legal obligations, however, remain unclear, and particularly so in the context of taxation. This paper provides an outline of the current legal framework for positive and negative integration of taxation, and considers the evolution of values, objectives and obligations in European and International law with a particular focus on the legal concept of sustainable development. From this basis, it examines legislative capacities to address the economic, ecological and social dimensions of sustainable development in the area of taxation and offers preliminary options for the amendment of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> so as fully to support European values and objectives in the field of taxation...|$|R
40|$|As {{proposed}} by FAO, the General Assembly of the United Nations declared 2013 as the International Year of Quinoa (IYQ), highlighting the potential role of quinoa's biodiversity in contributing to global food security, given its high nutritional value and tremendous potential {{to adapt to}} different agroclimatic conditions. The declaration recognizes {{the role of the}} Andean communities in creating this biodiversity and conserving numerous local varieties of quinoa. The cultivation of quinoa on other continents will continue to expand in the coming years, and there will be an increasingly widespread distribution of systems of intellectual property rights (IPR) governing varieties or genes. It is, therefore, essential to recognize the contribution made by the Andean communities, applying measures to guarantee the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits derived from the use of quinoa's genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge. This chapter addresses these issues. Four main targets can be identified: recognition of the Andean identity of quinoa's genetic resources and the associated traditional knowledge; conservation of the components of biological diversity and ecosystems; sustainable and effective use of quinoa's genetic resources in order to encourage innovation; fair and equitable sharing of the benefits derived from the use of these resources and associated traditional knowledge. The existing international frameworks do not address these issues in a satisfactory way. The CBD and the Nagoya Protocol regulate bilateral access and benefit-sharing. However, quinoa's genetic resources are transboundary and for decades they have been disseminated outside the Andean zone. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (Treaty) addresses these various objectives but does not cover the many different non-agricultural and non-food uses of quinoa (medicinal applications, cosmetics etc.). It also fails to address adequately (at least so far) the in situ conservation dimension - a critical aspect for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from the use of quinoa with the Andean populations. Intellectual property rights, even those that are sui generis, including plant variety protection (PVP) certificates, geographical indications and collective trademarks, mainly focus on encouraging innovation. They are temporary (of limited duration and validity) and are not recognized by all countries. IPR mechanisms do not address the conservation of genetic resources and alternative solutions are required. <b>Soft</b> <b>laws</b> instruments such as the FAO's Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) and biocultural landscapes deals with in situ conservation for the protection of agrarian systems that enrich biodiversity. Nevertheless, they are unsuitable for dealing with ex situ biodiversity conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits derived from the use of genetic resources. Although the Open Source Seed Initiative seems to provide an interesting alternative mechanism for the multiple stakeholders involved in different stages of production, selection, diffusion and conservation, it lacks a legal structure which would allow it to protect the exchange of genetic material and prevent misapropriation. However, these systems do not include wild crop relatives. They focus predominantly on varieties of the cultivated species. Consequently, there is no single legal framework capable at this stage of dealing simultaneously and globally with the four areas identified. The gaps in each of these instruments are an incentive for improvement. Solutions still need to be developed to better harmonize the different existing legal frameworks and <b>soft</b> <b>laws</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and/or create new complementary ones. The rapid spread of quinoa at global level provides an opportunity to consider the implications of the current regulatory instruments for genetic resources {{so that they can be}} improved an...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> as {{a mode of}} EU governance. European <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> can {{be qualified}} as a relatively ‘new’ mode, notably due to its dramatic proliferation and the increasing involvement of private actors. The concept of ‘soft law’ is viable on the premiss that normativity may be graduated (‘the continuum view’). <b>Soft</b> <b>law</b> deploys specific legal effects apart from outright legal bindingness, and not merely political or otherwise factual effects. The legal effects of European <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> flow from the Member States’ general duty to cooperate (Art. 4 (2) TEU). The paper then traces the emergence of EU <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> and establishes a typology distinguishing between institutional <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> member States’ European <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> and private self- and co-regulation (including technical and financial standard-setting). Next, some factors explaining the emergence of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> as a new mode of governance are sought, and some undeclared policy goals such as competence creep, and the alleviation of private actors’ lack of formal law-making capacity, are highlighted. The relation between European <b>soft</b> and hard <b>law</b> is analysed in terms of <b>soft</b> <b>law’s</b> ‘pre-law’, ‘law-plus’, and ‘para-law’ functions. Finally, European <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is evaluated along the parameters of effectiveness and legitimacy; and its overall significance for the European integration process is assessed...|$|R

40|$|After a brief {{review of}} the history and {{typology}} of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in public international law, we approach the concept deductively. We reject the binary view and subscribe to the continuum view. Building on the idea of graduated normativity and on the prototype theory of concepts, we submit that <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is in the penumbra of law. It can be distinguished from purely political documents more or less readily, depending on its closeness to the prototype of law. Insights gained by the study of public international <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> are relevant to EC and EU <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> despite some differences between those legal orders. European <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is created by institutions, Member States, and private actors.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the regulative force of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> and the ever {{changing}} connections and overlaps between <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> and the sources of law in different legal systems. The analysis reveals the variety of phenomena that fall into the <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> catego-ry and the many roles played by <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> at different levels (including the inter-institutional one). This variety and the overall complexity of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> can only be observed and studied by going {{beyond the limits of}} the rulemaking process and embracing the entire (global) regulatory process, one which extends not only to rulemaking and regulatory supervision but also to regulatory enforcement and judicial re-view.

In all of the legal systems examined <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> shows itself to be an extraordinary instrument, playing a key role in ensuring and guarantee-ing the effectiveness, balance and dynamicity of the legal system itself. Furthermore, these multiple roles are strengthened and underpinned by legisla-tors, who implement mechanisms that not only permit <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> to accede to the field of normativity, but also encourage compliance with it by increasing the costs of non-compliance by the imposition of duties, such as the duty to report non-compliance, to give reasons for non-compliance, to disclose the names of those who are not in compliance with <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> thereby ensuring the effective-ness of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> and, ultimately, the regulatory process itself...|$|R

40|$|Particularly {{in light}} of recent {{developments}} in sovereign debt litigation, there is a pressing need for discussion of more robust sovereign debt restructuring mechanisms. This paper contends that any sovereign debt workout mechanism (DWM) should embody the principles of legitimacy and impartiality, to the extent possible, in order to garner the stable and long-term adherence of international stakeholders. These two elements are important both for attracting support ex ante, i. e. in the initial development of any treaty, ad hoc, or <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> restructuring <b>mechanism,</b> and for ensuring ex post that a DWM is ultimately utilized by states and their creditors. These principles are particularly essential in the international arena, given the absence of a clear global enforcement mechanism and {{in light of}} the historical resistance of some states and other institutional actors {{to the development of a}} debt workout mechanism. The first section of this background paper will introduce the key concepts of legitimacy and impartiality, laying out different schools of thought on the characteristics of a legitimate and impartial institutional order and developing a preliminary list of features appropriate for a DWM. The second section will consider the institutional and historical background of debt restructuring in light of these themes, to better understand the political and economic context of current discussions of a possible workout mechanism. Third, this paper will consider how several domestic and transnational institutions attempt to meet standards of legitimacy and impartiality, focusing especially on domestic insolvency/debt restructuring institutions and on investment treaty arbitration rules. Finally, this paper will offer preliminary recommendations for how a future DWM might instantiate the principles of legitimacy and impartiality, and will briefly assess existing proposals in light of these themes. This last section will also note several obstacles to meeting the goals of legitimacy and impartiality, and ask whether the negative effect of such impediments might be mitigated...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} legitimate expectations and <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> In what circumstances can an agency’s guidelines create law — or at least legally enforceable expectations? At first glance, the answer would appear obvious. The key reason for developing <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is to provide guidance and transparency as to the process (and sometimes the substance) of administrative action. <b>Soft</b> <b>law</b> by its nature gives rise to expectations. Whether those expectations, in turn, give rise to legal effects is decidedly less clear. In fact, this question has vexed Canadian administrative law. Nowhere are questions of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> and legitimate expectations more salient than {{in the context of}} tax administration. We canvass the relationship between legitimate expectations and <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in the context of Canadian tax administration. The analysis proceeds in three parts. In the first part, we consider the important roles of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in a tax administration system premised on self-assessment. Within this analysis, we list and describe six sources of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in the tax administration context. In the second part, we explore the development of the doctrine of legitimate expectations in Canada, and the implications of the Supreme Court of Canada’s (SCC) most considered treatment of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> and legitimate expectations in Agraira v Canada. The third part of the chapter analyses when (and pursuant to which principles) <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in the tax administration context (eg information circular, interpretation bulletin, or advance judgment) may give rise to a legitimate expectation. We conclude that Canadian administrative law has only begun to grapple with legitimate expectations, and that its development in the context of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> represents an important catalyst for sorting out a more coherent and transparent framework for the review of administrative action...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether there is <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in international law has been as much the subject of contemporary debate as {{whether or not there}} is private legal authority in the international society. The legal boundaries seem to be blurred by the process of globalisation and the recent shift in international law. The traditional definition of international law has been outdated as new forms of treaties has introduced new subject of law to the judicial arena. At the same time a supplementary map of law has been added to the cartography of international <b>law,</b> <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> These correlating processes have comprehensive political and legal consequences at both the international and national levels. This essay examines and identifies <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> from a legal-political perspective and locates and explores private forms of legal authority on the map of contemporary international law. In respect to theory, it accounts for an interdisciplinary approach involving issues of both international law and international relations. In the process this study examines issues regarding the relative legal normativity and the blurring of legal authority in international law. The focus is on the legal character, the constitutive practices and the legal and political influence of <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> It discusses the influence and power exerted by <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> over state actors in the international system and at the national level. The essay finds that <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is of substantial relevance in the international ambit. To some extent a limited normative force of certain norms is recognized in <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> even though it is conceded that those norms would not be enforceable by an international court or other international organ. To say that it does not exist because it is not of the enforceable variety, might blind students of international law to another dimension of the landscape of international practice. <b>Soft</b> <b>law</b> does not translate to soft obligations in the reality of international society, and it seems to be some confusion surrounding the obligations conceived by it. The research here presented suggests that its political and legal power is substantial. The researched examples do not display any real private legal authority in <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> This is because <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is found to be a separate phenomenon from international <b>law</b> proper. However, <b>soft</b> <b>law’s</b> impact on national governments combined with the wider acceptance of the presence of private actors in the creation of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> suggests that private power is noteworthy in comparison. In one of the studied examples, the <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is concluded by private business representatives solely, but in requiring the status of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> it is dependant on the recognition of the international and national legal bodies...|$|R

International organizations cease to be the "second" subject of international law, and if you have not won the first place, {{it is only a matter}} of time. In the article the role of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in the <b>mechanism</b> of international organizations functioning are shown, the legal nature and impact of these acts on the member states. In our opinion, norms of "soft law", as a rule, contained in resolutions of international organizations are non-binding and do not formally bind member states. Norms of "soft law" are often adheres by the states and moreover are implemented into the national legal systems by incorporating similar in content standards into the national legislation. This is due to the fact that norms of "soft law" has a weight of moral and political significance and, as a rule, are created by organizations that have a considerable authority. Jurists generally distinguish two kinds of acts of recommendatory force: model acts (laws) and recommended acts which are not model, adopted {{in the framework of}} international organizations. In this connection the question of each mentioned method influence on the legislation of state. In our opinion, one of distinguishing features of the model recommendatory acts has is quite limited influence on the law of states and a narrow scope. At the same time, recommendatory acts of some specialized international organizations have a more complex effect on the development of national legislation, contain the highest level of standards, and as well develop international treaty provisions...|$|R

In this paper, we advance four complementary explanations for why states use <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> that de-scribe a much broader range of state behavior than has been previously explained. First, and least significantly, states may use <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> to solve straightforward coordination games in which {{the existence of a}} focal point is enough to generate compliance. Second, under what we term the loss avoidance theory, moving from <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> to hard law generates higher sanctions that both deter more violations and, because sanctions in the international system are negative sum, increase the net loss to the parties. States will choose <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> when the marginal costs in terms of the expected loss from violations exceed the marginal benefits in terms of deterred violations...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is to evaluate <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> as a method to regulate public procurement from a trade perspective. The value of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is studied under this thesis according to a four-fold approach – bindingness, precision, discretion and delegation. An international legal instrument can be considered soft along {{one or more of}} the above four dimensions. Based on the reviews of the current procurement regimes, the thesis outlines the values of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in regulating procurement. <b>Soft</b> <b>law</b> may serve as a second-best to hard law where the latter can not be achieved. It is explained that public procurement is a sensitive subject in the sense that many states are often unwilling to give up their regulatory freedom for protectionism purposes. <b>Soft</b> <b>law</b> in terms of all the four dimensions is argued as an effective device for breaking deadlock and fostering compromises in negotiating a procurement agreement. Also, it can serve as an ‘intermediate step’ towards the formation of hard law even though this is not necessarily the case. <b>Soft</b> <b>law</b> can also be regarded as a better alternative to hard law even where the latter is attainable. Possible advantages of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> are identified including its reduced negotiating costs; reduced implementing costs; reserved states’ regulatory autonomy for national legitimate objectives and better adaptation to changes. Meanwhile, its possible disadvantages are mentioned and possible ways of addressing these disadvantages are also suggested. Special features of procurement are identified including intrusiveness, sensitivity, complexity and constant evolution, which might be relevant for <b>soft</b> <b>law’s</b> influence in that particular area. At the end, the thesis sets out both s short-term and a long-term proposal for developing a multilateral agreement on government by use of <b>soft</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R

European <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is now often relied on in national courts, and can have an important impact on the rights and obligations of individuals. However, some {{of the goals of}} the Commission are only partly attainable due to the specific legal status of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> instruments, and the current languages policy of the European Union. Given that <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> was not found to expressly impose obligations on individuals, the Court held that there was no requirement to publish it in all the official languages of the European Union. This has a negative impact on transparency and legal certainty, diminishing the role of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> instruments in promoting such goals...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article {{explores the}} {{interface}} between classic government structures [...] the courts [...] and key governance tools [...] <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> It presents the quantitative and qualitative results of research that asks the questions of whether and how <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> {{is reflected in the}} European competition and state aid case law. It suggests that <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is taken seriously by the Court of Justice of the European Union, and figures more and more in the judgments, orders and opinions issued in these areas. The case law recognises legal effects for <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> instruments through the mediation of general principles of law. The article argues that, through the mechanisms of the judicialisation process, the European Courts have rubber-stamped hybrid modes of regulating competition and state aid and have embedded <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> within the constitutional legal framework of the Union, {{while at the same time}} endowing traditional legal values with new functions in a "new governance" context...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of establishing legal order sui generis {{that on the}} EU level will, due to its flexibility and differentiation, be able to effectively respond to dynamic movements of internal market {{as well as to}} globalization challenges in general, {{in the last two decades}} lead to extensive transformations of the EU legal order. One of them is growing importance of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> instruments and subsequent differentiation of legal regulation – to traditional regulation new modes of regulation have been added (as a result of so called “new legislative culture”). Although at first when adopting the decision, the Court of the European Union denied the recognition of existence and function of <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> later the Court gradually adapted to differentiating trend in the EU legal order and is thus nowadays recognizing the normative value of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in the EU. When deriving the decision the Court is considering <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> as part of legal framework (in this case <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is used as a ground for interpretation of hard law provision or as an instrument of confi rmation of interpretation of binding law) or it recognizes self-binding and binding effect of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> (in this case soft instrument is a substantive rule on which the decision is grounded). With such approach, to <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> normative status is conferred; the latter – despite it being on the non-binding side – is therefore having indirect legal effect and is creating indirect legal consequences...|$|R
40|$|This work {{draws from}} {{accounts}} {{on the nature}} and legal effects of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> instruments in EU and international law with the ultimate aim to construct a theoretical framework for recognition of EU competition soft law—guidelines, communications, notices, and the like—in the judicial discourse of national courts of the European Union. “Recognition” is used to encompass instances in which the national judiciary either explicitly interprets—that is, agrees or disagrees with—the content of competition soft instruments, or treats their substance in a roundabout, implicit way—without explicit reference to <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in the judgment proper. This second option is called “the persuaded judiciary scenario. ” Importantly, a foundational assumption of the current work is that courts do not transform <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> into hard law when subjecting the former to judicial interpretation/recognition. This Article also takes issue {{with the fact that}} CJEU preliminary rulings on competition <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> disputes originating in Member States have thus far exhibited a rather resistant attitude to <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> The supranational judiciary has, to a large extent, refused to interpret <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> because of its lack of binding force. The possibility that national courts adopt a similar approach in the currently decentralized competition enforcement system is thus not discounted, but is seen as undesirable for two important reasons...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the phenomenon of}} <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> The very name &# 145;soft law&# 146; sounds like an oxymoron: if <b>law</b> is <b>soft,</b> is it not therefore prevented from being law? There is some force to that objection, but only in a purely formalist sense. More practically, lawyers have understood for at least seventy years that public authorities are able to issue certain communications {{in a way that}} causes them to be treated like law, even though these are neither legislation nor subordinate legislation. Importantly for <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> as a regulatory tool, people tend to treat <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> as binding even though public authorities know that it is not. It follows that <b>soft</b> <b>law's</b> &# 145;binding&# 146; effects do not apply equally between the public authority and those to whom it is directed. Consequently, <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is both highly effective as a means of regulation, and inherently risky for those who are regulated by it. Much has been written about using <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in regulation, {{but that is not the}} concern of this thesis. <b>Soft</b> <b>law</b> plays a vital part in administrative law. It manages the tension between decision-makers having the flexibility to decide individual matters on their merits on one hand, and, on the other, the expectation that like issues will broadly be decided consistently with each other. That tension is central to the rule of <b>law.</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>law</b> cannot resolve the tension between flexibility and consistency, but it does provide a mechanism which can guide decision-makers towards consistency without binding them to certain outcomes. Chapter 2 deals extensively with issues that arise from <b>soft</b> <b>law's</b> role in managing this tension. The focus of the remaining chapters is on people who are regulated by <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> and, more specifically, what happens when a public authority breaches its own <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> upon which people have relied. Where people in that circumstance suffer loss as a consequence of their reliance on <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> this thesis asks what remedies might lie to assist them. Chapter 3 looks at whether judicial review can be extended to cover exercises of <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> either in order to grant a procedural remedy or to compel the public authority to perform in substance what its <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> had promised. It concludes that other countries, such as the UK, provide some hope for people who have relied upon <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> to their detriment. Australian jurisprudence, by contrast, offers little scope for a person so affected to obtain a judicial review remedy, either procedural or substantive. The most that the Australian cases have offered is that <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is not meaningless, even where it is unenforceable. Chapter 4 examines the capacity to obtain a money remedy based upon establishing invalidity. This could either be through a damages remedy being included in judicial review for ultra vires acts or in restitution. Public law damages is a remedy whose time has not yet come. It has been firmly rejected in Australian courts and, in the UK, a Law Commission recommendation in favour of such a remedy was firmly rejected by the government. Restitution against public authorities has, by contrast, been on a firm footing in the UK for twenty years. Australian courts are yet to adopt the English jurisprudence formally, but there is little stopping them from doing so. Chapter 5 looks at modes of compensation which are not based upon a finding of invalidity, namely tort and equity. Chapter 5 looks at two examples of how this might occur. The first asks whether and when public authorities might owe a duty of care to come to the aid of an individual, and what role a <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> set of instructions might play in deciding such a matter. It is nothing new that tort liability applies to public authorities &# 147;as nearly as possible&# 148; in the same way that it does to individuals. The key issue here is when a public authority might be required to do more than would be expected of an individual. The second example looks at whether equity has the capacity to provide a compensatory remedy where someone has suffered loss as a result of relying on <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> As with previous chapters, Chapter 5 concludes that the likelihood of an Australian court providing a remedy in either tort or equity is slender. Chapter 6 argues, however, that challenges to public authorities&# 146; use of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> outside the scope of the courts are most likely to provide suitable remedies. In particular, the flexibility of the Ombudsman has been used to significant effect in obtaining remedies where people have relied to their detriment on <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> The conclusion is that, just as the court-based responses to this problem are inadequate, the &# 145;soft&# 146; controls on <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> are effective...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{applies the}} concept of social norm {{dynamics}} to explain how corporate governance <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is enforced. Design/methodology/approach: Using data of German listed stock companies and of economic media coverage between 2001 and 2010, we observe the complex relationship between sanctions and behavior in {{the social context of}} corporate governance <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> Findings: We find that the public discussion of normative demands related to corporate governance issues increases if firms do not comply with the German Corporate Governance Code. We show that groups of actors, such as DAX companies, represent the addressees of normative demands, i. e., targets of expectations about what is appropriate and what is not. We also find that normative demands tend to be personalized, as public discussion is greater when initiated by a specific individual or firm. Finally, we demonstrate that social control in terms of public sanctioning positively influences a firm’s compliance with the <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> whereby negative statements (disapproval) outweigh the effects of positive statements (approval). Originality/ value: We corroborate the social character of normative demands in the context of corporate governance <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> and contribute {{to a better understanding of}} why <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> can work despite its having no legally binding force. The results of our study suggest that sanction mechanisms in the context of social norms underpin the strength of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> as an alternative to, or extension of, hard law...|$|R
