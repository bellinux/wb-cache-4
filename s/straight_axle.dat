5000|$|Designed by Steve Swaja in 1963, {{they were}} built for Tony Nancy, to run in NHRA's AA/Gas (A/Gas supercharged) class. The {{aluminum}} body was built by Emil Deidt and Wayne Ewing, on an RCS chassis. It had a <b>straight</b> front <b>axle</b> with bicycle wheels, a pointed-nosed body covering both slicks, and mid-mounted engine, with exhaust pipes out {{the underside of the}} body ahead of the rear tires.|$|R
50|$|The frame {{comprised}} lightweight longitudinal {{channel and}} tubular cross-members. It was <b>straight</b> over the <b>axles</b> with a dropped section {{forward of the}} front axle to provide a lower entrance. A drop frame for a luggage boot was optional at the rear. Special steels were used to keep weight down.|$|R
50|$|<b>Straight</b> <b>axle</b> — {{term for}} a car (often a gasser) that has had it stock A-arm style front {{suspension}} removed for leaf springs and a solid tube axle.|$|E
50|$|Dana 44 axles {{were used}} {{both in the}} front and the rear at least through 1979. Brake {{hardware}} was mostly General Motors equipment (sourced from the <b>straight</b> <b>axle</b> 1/2 ton 4x4 light duty truck and SUV line including the six lug rims), with disc brakes up front (optional on earlier models) and drum brakes in the rear.|$|E
50|$|The Stowboard design {{consists}} of a metal alloy middle platform, 110 mm front wheels mounted on a pivoting front truck, a plastic rear foot platform with 65mm conical rear wheels mounted on a <b>straight</b> <b>axle.</b> This design allows the Stowboard to be folded down from full length (31 inches) to an 11 x 8.5 x 4 inch block.|$|E
50|$|Axles {{were made}} of drop-forged H girder sections, so forging their upswept ends was a simple addition. To avoid {{creating}} stress risers, the drop was formed as smooth curves, not as sharp corners. Bugatti famously used a round bar for their axles, with the spring passing through holes within it and avoiding the U bolts that il patron found so ungainly. For further lowering, {{at the cost of}} reduced suspension travel, some axles were also prepared for racing by being mounted above the leafsprings, rather than below, although this was more common for <b>straight</b> rear <b>axles</b> than dropped front axles.|$|R
50|$|It was a biplane of mixed, mostly wooden construction. A {{fuselage}} of {{a wooden}} frame, covered with plywood. Two-spar rectangular wooden wings, canvas covered. Upper wing of slightly greater span, with extended ends with ailerons. Tail of metal frame, covered with canvas. Straight engine in a fuselage nose, with a chimney-like exhaust pipe (LVG-produced planes had horizontal exhaust pipe). Engine was initially covered with an aerodynamic cover, but it was often abandoned. Two-blade wooden propeller, 2.8 m diameter. Water radiators on both fuselage sides, later water radiator before upper wing. Fixed conventional landing gear, with a <b>straight</b> common <b>axle</b> and a rear skid.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Steve Swaja (with some tweaking by owner George Schreiber and his boss, [...] "Big Daddy" [...] Roth) {{and built}} by Jim Davis in 1963, {{the car had}} a 153 in wheelbase. The {{aluminum}} body, hammered by Tom Hanna for US$5000, had a very pointed nose, canopied cockpit, and V-shaped [...] "claw" [...] tail, and was painted Diamond T yellow with red lettering (hence the name). The <b>straight</b> front <b>axle</b> had bicycle wheels and wing-like fairings. [...] The engine, a blown Chrysler hemi (bored 0.030 in over, for a total displacement of [...] ) prepared by Bill Demerest (but maintained by owner-driver Schreiber), was exposed, as were the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} and most obvious {{feature of the}} TXT-1 over most other available RC monster trucks is the twin vertical plate chassis and, more important, the <b>straight</b> <b>axle</b> suspension system. The former is specified as 6mm machined aluminum plate with extensive milling to reduce weight without critically reducing rigidity. Several tubular aluminum braces improve the structure, while the closed plastic transmission housing is a stressed member. Two formed plastic plates serve to further improve rigidity while providing ample space for mounting electronic components.|$|E
50|$|A <b>straight</b> <b>axle</b> is {{a single}} rigid shaft {{connecting}} a wheel {{on the left side}} of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side. The axis of rotation fixed by the axle is common to both wheels. Such a design can keep the wheel positions steady under heavy stress, and can therefore support heavy loads. Straight axles are used on trains (that is, locomotives and railway wagons), for the rear axles of commercial trucks, and on heavy duty off-road vehicles. The axle can optionally be protected and further reinforced by enclosing the length of the axle in a housing.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the Model 15 was based on studies of the Fokker D.VII, of which 142 were {{brought back to the}} U.S. for {{evaluation}} as part of the Armistice Agreement ending World War I. Many of the features were similar. The Model 15 had a fuselage of welded steel tubing braced with piano wire, while the tapered single bay wings were fabric on a wooden frame, with spruce and mahogany wing spars and three-ply wood ribs. Wing struts were changed from the normal wood used in Boeing designs to streamlined steel tubes. The landing gear had a <b>straight</b> <b>axle,</b> streamlined into a small 16 in chord wing.|$|E
50|$|For 1923 {{with the}} OE engine the <b>straight</b> cut back <b>axle</b> gear was {{replaced}} by a spiral bevel with a higher 3.3:1 reduction ratio. The chassis and wheelbase were lengthened four inches and the chassis was also strengthened by widening the cross-section of the side rails. The body was widened three inches. Rear axle torque was now taken through a banjo-shaped torque arm alongside the propellor shaft.|$|R
50|$|As looks, ride quality, and {{handling}} became {{more important to}} consumers, new shapes were incorporated into frames. The most visible of these are arches and kick-ups. Instead of running <b>straight</b> over both <b>axles,</b> arched frames sit lower—roughly level with their axles—and curve up over the axles and then {{back down on the}} other side for bumper placement. Kick-ups do the same thing, but don't curve down on the other side, and are more common on front ends.|$|R
5000|$|The 521 was the facelifted {{version of}} 520, with a {{so-called}} [...] "flat-deck" [...] style. This meant a flattened bonnet and front fenders {{as well as}} a new grille design. It used the Nissan J engines (the previously mentioned J13 or the larger J15, rated at 77 hp) and later had a [...] Nissan L16 engine, always with a <b>straight</b> rear <b>axle.</b> The 520 strongly resembles a Datsun 410/411 from the front, since it shares most sheet metal with that car. The fender emblems said [...] "Datsun 1300", [...] "Datsun 1500" [...] or [...] "Datsun 1600" [...] (depending on engine fitment). Van/delivery van (V521) and double cab (U521) versions were available. It was manufactured from June, 1968-1972, preceded by the 520 and followed by the 620. The 521 was the first compact half-ton pickup sold in the American market, in 1968 [...]|$|R
5000|$|The race {{vehicles}} {{used at the}} King of the Hammers {{are known}} as Ultra 4 vehicles which are capable of speeds over 100 miles per hour for the desert sections, but still contain gear ratios of 100 to 1 or lower for technical rock crawling. This Ultra4 class is unlimited 4400, and every vehicle is custom fabricated by each team. Traditional design for the front drive-train is a <b>straight</b> <b>axle</b> design, but (IFS) or (Independent front suspension) is becoming a popular design for the high speeds achieved in the wide open plains of the desert. Most racers use highly modified engines that can have up to (800 hp). 40" [...] tires are common and racers use beadlock wheels.|$|E
50|$|Wheel rate on {{independent}} suspension is fairly straightforward. However, special consideration {{must be taken}} with some non-{{independent suspension}} designs. Take {{the case of the}} <b>straight</b> <b>axle.</b> When viewed from the front or rear, the wheel rate can be measured by the means above. Yet because the wheels are not independent, when viewed from the side under acceleration or braking the pivot point is at infinity (because both wheels have moved) and the spring is directly inline with the wheel contact patch. The result is often that the effective wheel rate under cornering is different from what it is under acceleration and braking. This variation in wheel rate may be minimized by locating the spring as close to the wheel as possible.|$|E
50|$|Wooden {{construction}} biplane with fixed landing gear. The fuselage was framed, {{with metal}} covering for front engine section, plywood covering for the midsection and canvas covering for the tail section. Rectangular two-spar wings, plywood (leading edge) and canvas covered, of equal span. Crew of two, sitting in tandem in open cockpits: pilot in front, observer in the rear. Conventional fixed landing gear, {{with a common}} <b>straight</b> <b>axle</b> and a rear skid. Engine in front, two barrel-type water Lamblin radiators below the fuselage, between the landing gear. Two-blade wooden propeller. Fuel tanks in the fuselage. The pilot had one fixed 7.7 mm (.303 in) Vickers machine gun with an interrupter gear, the observer had twin 7.7 mm (.303 in) Lewis Guns on a ring mounting.|$|E
2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the driving axle. The trailing carrying axle passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a <b>straight</b> carrying <b>axle</b> rather than a cranked driving axle, the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6".

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed by}} Willy Sabersky-Müssigbrodt and developed by Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (LVG) in 1917. The C.VI was a further development of the C.V, which Sabersky-Müssigbrodt had made for his former employer DFW. It was lighter, smaller and aerodynamically refined, although its fuselage seemed more bulky. It was a biplane of mixed, mostly wooden construction. It featured a semi-monocoque fuselage, plywood covered. Rectangular wings of wooden and metal construction, canvas covered. Upper wing of slightly greater span, shifted some 25 cm (10 in) towards front. Vertical fin plywood covered, rudder and elevators of metal frame canvas covered, stabilizers (tailplanes) of wooden frame canvas covered. Straight uncovered engine in the fuselage nose, with a chimney-like exhaust pipe. Two-blade Benz wooden propeller, 2.88 m (9.45 ft) diameter. Flat water radiator in central section of upper wing. Fixed conventional landing gear, with a <b>straight</b> common <b>axle</b> and a rear skid.Aircraft were equipped with a radio (morse;send only); transmissions were {{by means of an}} antenna which could be lowered below the aircraft when needed. The crew had parachutes and heated flying suits.A total of 1,100 aircraft of the type were manufactured.|$|R

50|$|He {{was also}} {{involved}} with car racing, driving MGs and Rileys. In 1934 {{he joined the}} MG works team and in the 1934 BRDC International Trophy Race at Brooklands, Handley drove well until a back axle broke late in the race. Later in 1934 he co-drove Eyston's MG K3 'Magic Magnette', but crashed on the Railway <b>Straight</b> when an <b>axle</b> bearing seized. It was in September 1934 that he raced an N type MG Magnette in the Ards TT in Northern Ireland in the International RAC Sports Car Race but had to retire with engine trouble. In 1934 and in 1935 he raced MGs in the Isle of Man Mannin Beg 'round the houses' event. In 1934 he led on the first lap with the MG Magnette but had a crash and retired shortly afterwards. In the following year he entered the Mannin Beg with the 745cc MGR but retired with axle failure.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{the complex}} {{transverse}} horizontal drive {{it was decided to}} use a vertical longitudinal rear-engined layout, Instead of the very low horizontal frame of the first two chassis, this was slightly higher at the front and ramped gently upward and tapered outward toward the rear, where the Cummins VIM V6-200 engine was mounted. This 9.6-litre 90-degree vee-six engine developed 192 bhp at 2600rpm and was compact enough to fit under the rear seat on a bodied bus and allow drive to pass through a conventional Daimler SCG Daimatic four-speed semi-automatic gearbox to a <b>straight</b> spiral-bevel rear <b>axle</b> manufactured by Eaton, an electrically operated two-speed axle being optional. All round air suspension was standard, with rubber and steel leaf options. Although some drawings show a front-mounted radiator, standard production versions had this mounted on the rear offside, as on the Fleetline. Other components such as the front axle, steering, brakes, driving controls etc. were {{similar to those of the}} Fleetline. The model was announced as the Roadliner model SRC6-36, this was the third and last Daimler bus chassis to be given a model name as well as an alphanumeric code.|$|R
5000|$|... "The engine a {{sets the}} face plate b, {{which serves as}} the flywheel, into motion and the {{rotation}} is transferred to the discus wheel c. Through this the shaft dd with the sprocket turns. Thus the chain e drives the rear axle. The speed is adjusted by shifting the discus wheel c on the shaft dd {{by means of the}} hand lever fastened {{to the left of the}} upper end of the steering column and the articulated lever f. The bearings of the shaft dd with the discus wheel c can be shifted forwards and backwards carriage-like by the hand lever g to the right of the driver's seat. By means of this hand lever the discus wheel c is engaged with the face plate b and the engine, or idling, pressed backwards against the brake arm f to brake the car. So this lever serves both to brake and to engage the clutch. Independently of the aforementioned brake there are two band brakes r1 and r2 on both rear wheels. The beehive radiator n cools the cylinders by means of the belt-driven pump l. The chassis is made of iron-reinforced wood. The front <b>axle</b> is <b>straight,</b> the rear <b>axle</b> is full-length and has no differential." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} debate {{as to whether}} the first driving axle of the 4-12-2 was cranked to provide {{clearance}} for the main rod connected to the second axle. Union Pacific drawings show no such crank on the first axle, and the Railway Age article says [...] "The 67-inch drivers permit the use of a <b>straight</b> <b>axle</b> on the front drivers..." [...] The spacing {{between the first and second}} axles was increased by 18 in to provide clearance. Based on the published dimensions, this means at its closest the centerline of the inside rod was 11.645 inches from the centerline of the first axle. (UP drawings reproduced in Kratville and Bush's [...] "Union Pacific Type" [...] books show the inside rod 113 inches long and the first and second driver axles 88 inches apart. The inside cylinder axis was inclined 9.5 degrees and was 32 inches above the plane of the driving axles at a point 181 inches ahead of the second driving axle, so the cylinder axis missed the centerline of the second axle by 1-11/16 inches. The rod centerline is closest to the axle when the crank is 54.49 degrees below horizontal.) ...|$|E
