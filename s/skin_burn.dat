The severity of the chemical <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> can be classified into three grades, namely Superficial, Partial thickness and Full thickness. Towards achieving this aim, a database of chemical <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> images has been created by collecting images from various Hospitals. The initial pre-processing involves the contrast enhancement in L*a*b colour space. The pattern classifier technique namely K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier (KNN), has been applied on chemical <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> images to classify them as Superficial, Partial and Full thickness burns. The help of dermatologists and plastic surgeons has been taken to label the images with chemical <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> grades and the labelled images are used to train the classifiers. From the many features that were extracted from the images, two significant features such as the mean and then DCT were selected that best embody the differing characteristics of the three grades of chemical skin burns. The algorithms are optimized on features of pre-labelled images, by fine-tuning the classifier parameters [...] The efficiency of the analysis and classification of the KNN method is about 67. 5 % for grade 1, 82. 5 % for grade 2 and 75 % for grade 3. The design and development of such a classifier is clinically very significant particularly, when it is used in emergency remote areas...|$|E

40|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>burn</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complications}} throughout the world. Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) is used as a choice treatment in many superficial burn wounds. But, some studies have questioned its efficacy. The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of Normal Saline (NS) and SSD on healing of superficial <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> wounds in rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned in two different groups including treatment and control, with 20 animals each. After sedation, a type II <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> wound in the shape of a 1 -cm diameter circle was created in the dorsum of the rats with boiled water contact. In treatment group, NS and in control group, SSD was used topically for care. Diameter of the wound as well as the hair growing grade was determined on days 3, 7 and 14 post-intervention. In each step of the experiment, histopathological sections were prepared; thereafter reepithelialization and alleviation of inflammation at the healing site of burn wound were assessed. Statistically, the data obtained were compared between the groups. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the mean diameter of the wound on days 3 and 14 (p = 0. 089, p = 0. 495). The mean diameter of the wound was significantly lower in treatment (NS) group on day 7 (p< 0. 001). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the mean hair growth score in different stages of the experiment (p = 1, p = 0. 647, p = 0. 805). Histopathologically, there were no significant difference between these two experimental groups from the view point of reepithelialization and alleviation of inflammation at the healing site of burn wound.

The test was performed on both dry and wet specimens.

With {{the building of the}} International Space Station and plans for exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, astronauts will be staying in space for longer periods of time. With these increased stays in space comes an increase in fire safety concerns. One area of fire safety interest is flammability. While current flammability test procedures are in place, they are all performed on the ground and may not be representative of flammability in microgravity. In addition to this, limited research into the severity of <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> injury in a microgravity environment has been performed. An apparatus was designed to be flown on a low gravity parabolic aircraft flight to assess the flammability of cotton and 50 % cotton/ 50 % polyester fabrics and the resulting <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> injury that would occur if these fabrics were to ignite. The apparatus, modelled after a Canadian General Standards Board standard flammability test, was also used on the ground for experiments in 1 -g. Variables examined in the tests include gravity level, fabric type, air gap size, oxygen concentration, apparatus orientation, ignition source, and method used to secure the specimen. Flame spread rates, heat fluxes, and <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> predictions determined from test results were compared. Results from test in 1 -g indicated that the orientation of the apparatus had a large effect on flame spread rate, heat flux and predicted <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> times. Flame spread rates and heat fluxes were highest when the fabric was held in the vertical orientation, which resulted in the lowest predicted times to produce skin burns. Flame spread rates and heat fluxes were considerably lower in microgravity than in 1 -g, which resulted in higher predicted times to produce skin burns...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused {{ultrasound}} (HIFU) ablation is {{a relatively}} new, noninvasive way of ablation for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Emerging evidence has shown that it is effective {{for the treatment of}} HCC, even in patients with poor liver function. There is currently no data on the safety limit of HIFU ablation in patients with cirrhosis. However, this information is vital for the selection of appropriate patients for the procedure. We analyzed HCC patients who had undergone HIFU ablation and determined the lower limit of liver function and other patient factors with which HCC patients can tolerate this treatment modality. METHODS: Preoperative variables of 100 patients who underwent HIFU ablation for HCC were analyzed to identify the risk factors in HIFU intolerance in terms of stress-induced complications. Factors that may contribute to postablation complications were compared. RESULTS: Thirteen (13 %) patients developed a total of 18 complications. Morbidity was mainly due to skin and subcutaneous tissue injuries (n = 9). Five patients had first-degree <b>skin</b> <b>burn,</b> one had second-degree <b>skin</b> <b>burn,</b> and three had third-degree <b>skin</b> <b>burn.</b> Four complications were grade 3 a in the Clavien classification and 14 were below this grade. Univariate analysis showed that age (p = 0. 022) was the only independent factor in HIFU intolerance. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU ablation is generally well tolerated in HCC patients with cirrhosis. It is safe for Child-Pugh A and B patients and selected Child-Pugh C patients.

40|$|A {{serious problem}} in {{emergency}} medicine is the correct evaluation of <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> depth {{in order to make}} the appropriate choice of treatment. In clinical practice there is no difficulty in classifying first and third degree burns correctly. However, differentiation between the IIa (superficial dermal) and IIb (deep dermal) wounds is problematic even for experienced practitioners. In this work the use of surface skin temperature for the determination of the depth of second-degree burns is explored. An analytical solution of the three-dimensional Pennes steady-state equation is obtained assuming a small burn-depth-to-extension ratio. The inverse problem is posed in a search space consisting of geometrical parameters associated with the burned region. This space is searched to minimize the error between the analytical and experimental skin surface temperatures. The technique is greatly improved by using local one-dimensionality to provide the shape of the burned region. The feasibility of using this technique and thermography to determine <b>skin</b> <b>burn</b> depth is analyzed.
