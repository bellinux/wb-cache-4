Guest's application was accepted by return of post and {{he was asked to}} report early in July 1910. Champion's practice, as Deputy Sheriff, consisted mainly of debt-collecting and lending money to doubtful borrowers at a high rate of interest.|$|E
5|$|Emma Silver is a radio {{personality}} who relocated from New York City {{to establish}} {{her career in}} Seattle. After hearing of her grandfather Walt's death, Emma returns to her childhood home in Valleyville, Washington. After meeting with the attorney Bobby Ellis, Emma discovers that she has inherited Walt's farm and pumpkin seeds. Bobby suggests that Walt wanted Emma to enter the local pumpkin growing contest to keep up a family tradition. In his last letter, Walt instructs his granddaughter to find <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of the farm. Emma's new neighbor Seth Cullen contemplates asking Emma for Walt's seeds {{so that he can}} enter the contest and win its grand prize, which would allow him to open his own automobile repair shop. Emma and Seth first meet when he is repairing her front door and she mistakes him for a burglar. During Walt's funeral, Emma learns that Walt was in debt. Bobby tells her that the entire debt must be paid {{by the end of the}} year or the farm will be foreclosed. Mayor Kyle Finster informs Emma that he intends to develop the land following its foreclosure.|$|E
25|$|Pets {{might have}} the ability to stimulate their caregivers, in {{particular}} the elderly, giving people <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress. There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life. In a 1986 study of 92 people hospitalized for coronary ailments, within a year 11 of the 29 patients without pets had died, compared to only 3 of the 52 patients who had pets. Having pet(s) was shown to significantly reduce triglycerides, and thus heart disease risk, in the elderly. A study by the National Institute of Health found that people who owned dogs were less likely to die {{as a result of a}} heart attack than those who didn’t own one. There is some evidence that pets may have a therapeutic effect in dementia cases. Other studies have shown that for the elderly, good health may be a requirement for having a pet, and not a result. Dogs trained to be guide dogs can help people with vision impairment. Dogs trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with other disabilities.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, Đurić {{received}} {{an invitation from}} the newly formed Bosnian Olympic Committee to compete for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the C-1 500 m canoeing event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Despite not having trained {{for two years and}} the ongoing conflict between the Serbs and the Bosniaks, he accepted the request as he ultimately decided he was first and foremost a sportsman. As the Bosnian Olympic Committee could not afford to pay for his travel, he had to hitch-hike his way over [...] to Barcelona. With only a letter from the Olympic Committee and no valid passport, he managed to get a truck ride to the Austrian border but was initially refused passage by a disbelieving immigration officer who thought he was a refugee seeking asylum. After convincing them of his credentials with a phone call to the Olympic Committee, the border guards helped him persuade <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him half-way to Slovenia, where he managed to get another ride to the airport and flew to Barcelona. A two-day trek later, he made it to the Summer Olympics where he was one of Bosnia's ten debuting competitors.

500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What did I know about chronic clinical depression? [...] She kind of needed <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of her.

500|$|There was a {{widespread}} debate among {{fans of the}} series as to who the character {{coming out of the}} closet would be, also similar to how they years earlier debated who shot the character Mr. Burns. Matt Groening joked at the Comic-Con convention that [...] "it's Homer". Many fans correctly guessed that it would be one of Homer's sisters-in-law, either Patty or Selma, while others believed it to be Waylon Smithers. It had for a long time been hinted on the show that the Smithers character was gay and in love with his boss Mr. Burns. However, as The Baltimore Sun writes, it would have been unlikely for Smithers to be the outed character because {{it would not have been}} a surprise to fans, and his love for his heterosexual boss would prevent him from marrying another person. Patty was suspected by fans and the press because she had not often been seen dating men on the show. The tabloid newspaper The Sun revealed already in September 2004 that the character who would come out was Patty, though this was regarded as a rumor and Jean would not confirm it. Bookmakers in the United States and the United Kingdom took bets on which character would be uncovered as homosexual, and if there would be a kiss featured in the episode—BetUS laid odds at four to five that it was Patty, while Smithers had four to one odds and Ned Flanders fifteen to one odds. A kiss was given odds of seven to five. BetUS said gamblers made more than 900 bets on the coming-out on their website. According to The Baltimore Sun, another betting site named PaddyPower.com [...] "stopped taking wagers because so much money was being placed on [...]" [...] Jean told The Advocate that he thought it was [...] "an insane thing for <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> bets on a result that can be determined by other people", referring to the Simpsons staff, [...] "and could be changed by them at the last minute." ...|$|E

Towards the end of 1867 he was a passenger on the brig Kamehameka going to Honolulu for a vacation. At this time Ben Pease was the captain of the schooner the Blossom and trading in coconut and coconut oil in the Marshall Islands. As trading was good, in late 1867 Pease sent George Bridges, his mate, to Honolulu to ask Mr. C. A. Williams, the owner of the Blossom, to supply another schooner and to engage <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> charge of the trading station at Ponape atoll (now known as Pohnpei).
