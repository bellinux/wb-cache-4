With alkali metals A, the {{crystals}} have a chemical formula APaO3 and perovskite <b>structure,</b> <b>or</b> A3PaO4 and distorted rock-salt <b>structure,</b> <b>or</b> A7PaO6 where oxygen atoms form a hexagonal close-packed lattice. In all these materials, protactinium ions are octahedrally coordinated. The pentoxide Pa2O5 combines with rare-earth metal oxides R2O3 to form various nonstoichiometric mixed-oxides, also of perovskite structure.|$|E

5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular <b>structure</b> <b>or</b> organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E

5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their <b>structure</b> <b>or</b> apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target <b>structure</b> <b>or</b> function. Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary <b>structure,</b> <b>or</b> even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E

5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, <b>structure</b> <b>or</b> object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the same basic characteristics. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} that a semi-circular <b>structure</b> <b>or</b> barbican was built by Edward I in 1277; this area was later named the Lion Tower, to the immediate west of the Middle Tower.

By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie.|$|E

As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, and elsewhere in the body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated.|$|E

5|$|In mixed inhibition, the {{inhibitor}} {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary <b>structure</b> <b>or</b> three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Magia is a {{collection}} of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads. It was produced by Miguel E. Cubillos and Pablo Tedeschi, and recorded at Aga Studios in Bogotá, when Shakira was 13. A Sony Music Columbia representative said that the recording process was simple and went perfectly fine. But for Shakira, the process was problematic, as she had no ability to decide which tracks would be included and no input into the rhythmic <b>structure</b> <b>or</b> artistic production of the songs.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{terms are}} used in taxonomic research. Primary {{homology}} is the initial hypothesis made by a researcher based on similar <b>structure</b> <b>or</b> anatomical connections, inferring that two characters share an ancestry. Secondary homology is implied by parsimony analysis, where a character that only occurs once on a tree is taken to be homologous. As implied in this definition, many cladists consider homology to be synonymous with synapomorphy, a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.|$|E

5|$|Such {{trafficking}} capacity {{depends on}} the MAM, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate transfer of lipid intermediates between organelles. In contrast to the standard vesicular mechanism of lipid transfer, evidence indicates that the physical proximity of the ER and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for lipid flipping between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein tethering structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter <b>structure,</b> <b>or</b> ERMES, although it remains unclear whether this structure directly mediates lipid transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for lipid flipping.|$|E
