They attempted {{to separate the}} more characteristic metals from substances having those characteristics to a lesser degree. Such substances included zinc, antimony, bismuth, <b>stibnite,</b> pyrite and galena. These were all then called semimetals or bastard metals.|$|E
5|$|Prospectors George Grimes and Moses Splawn {{were the}} first to {{discover}} gold in the forest at the eponymous Grimes Creek on August 2, 1862. Subsequent gold discoveries at Rocky Bar in 1863 and Atlanta in 1864 increased the rush of people to Idaho, and in 1863 Idaho City, with a population of 6,267, surpassed Portland, Oregon as the largest city in the Pacific Northwest. The Idaho gold rush was largely over by 1870, and the population of the Boise Basin fell from 16,000 to 3,500. In 1898 the forest's first gold dredge was built in Placerville and followed by several others. By 1951, when the last dredges shut down, at least 2.3 million ounces (65.2 million grams) of gold had been produced from the Boise Basin area. Silver was mined along the Crooked River from 1882 until 1921, but a silver mine at Silver Mountain proved unsuccessful. Following a shortage of mercury during World War II, mines in the <b>Stibnite</b> area became the country's largest producer of tungsten and second largest source of mercury. The most important known placer deposit of niobium and tantalum in the United States is located in Bear Valley. From 1953 until 1959, dredges there produced $12.5 million ($ today) in niobium, tantalum, and uranium. Other minerals mined in the forest include antimony and molybdenum.|$|E
25|$|This {{is similar}} to the salt {{cementation}} process but creates sulfides instead of chlorides. Finely divided impure gold and elemental sulfur are reacted together under moderate heat in a sealed crucible. The impurities form metal sulfides and the gold is left unreacted. The gaseous sulfide condenses on the crucible fabric. The antimony process is the same but uses <b>stibnite</b> (Sb2S3) instead of sulfur because <b>stibnite</b> is stable at a higher temperature than sulfur. This is much quicker than the salt process and gave a purer gold, but it could dissolve some of the gold as well. This process is first described in the Probierbuchlein.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{variation}} in the isotopic composition of Sb in <b>stibnites</b> (Sb ores) was explored using multicollector ICP-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). A method for isolating Sb (after acid digestion) without introducing artificial mass fractionation was developed, based {{on the use of}} a combination of cation exchange chromatography using Dowex AG 50 -X 8 resin and anion exchange chromatography using Amberlite IRA 743 resin. For pure <b>stibnites</b> (Sb 2 S 3), Sb isolation is not strictly required as at a 2 : 3 Sb : S molar ratio, it was demonstrated that the concomitant S does not affect the 123 Sb/ 121 Sb isotope ratio result. However, the method can be deployed for other Sb ore types with a lower Sb : Sratio and for samples with lower purity. Indium was used as an internal standard for correction of the instrument-induced mass discrimination occurring in the MC-ICP-MS instrument. The 123 Sb/ 121 Sb ratio could be measured with 0. 002 % repeatability (internal precision), while for the samples the 1233 values were characterized by an uncertainty of 1 3 unit. The isotopic composition of the selected materials (<b>stibnites</b> from various regions of the world) shows a variation spanning 10 3 units (or 0. 1 %). The method developed shows potential to be used in provenance determination studies of ancient glass. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Solvothermal and {{hydrothermal}} {{methods have}} been employed to generate nano-sized Sb 2 S 3 (<b>stibnites)</b> {{from a variety of}} xanthate, dithiocarbamate and dithiophosphate precursors. The solvothermal method allows control of morphology by regulating precursor and size by reaction time; this process also produces near-uniform and larger particles. The xanthate precursors are far superior to the dithiocarbamates in their ability to produce oxide-free Sb 2 S 3. Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) provided a means to produce good quality films of Sb 2 S 3. The advantages of xanthate precursors is rationalised in terms of a facile, low-temperature Chugaev rearrangement...|$|R
500|$|During the {{classical}} era (and even {{up to the}} 17th century), tin was often not distinguished from lead: Romans called lead plumbum nigrum ("black lead"), and tin plumbum candidum ("bright lead"). The association of lead and tin {{can be seen in}} other languages: the word olovo in Czech translates to [...] "lead", but in Russian the cognate олово (olovo) means [...] "tin". To add to the confusion, lead bore a close relation to antimony: both elements commonly occur as sulfides (galena and <b>stibnite),</b> often together. Pliny incorrectly wrote that <b>stibnite</b> would give lead on heating, instead of antimony. In countries such as Turkey and India, the originally Persian name surma came to refer to either antimony sulfide or lead sulfide, and in some languages, such as Russian, gave its name to antimony (сурьма).|$|E
