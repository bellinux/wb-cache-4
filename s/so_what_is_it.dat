2500|$|<b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> like? As children, we <b>were</b> told <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like {{chickenpox}} but worse. In fact <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{not related}} to chickenpox, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unimaginably worse. In an unvaccinated population, something like 10–30 percent of all patients with smallpox {{would be expected to}} die. And dying was not easy; smallpox was, as Macaulay wrote, 'the most terrible of all the ministers of death.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [38] Is {{there not}} {{such a thing as}} the {{philosophy}} of American history and politics? And if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?...</b> Wise men say there are two sets of wills to nations and to persons--one set that acts and works from explainable motives--from teaching, intelligence, judgment, circumstance, caprice, emulation, greed, etc.--and then another set, perhaps deep, hidden, unsuspected, yet often more potent than the first, refusing to be argued with, rising as it were out of abysses, resistlessly urging on speakers, doers, communities, unwitting to themselves--the poet to his fieriest words--the race to pursue its loftiest ideal. Indeed, the paradox of a nation's life and career, with all its wondrous contradictions, can probably only be explain'd from these two wills, sometimes conflicting, each operating in its sphere, combining in races or in persons, and producing strangest results.|$|E
60|$|I have here, by {{handling}} four questions, proved, {{that the}} seventh day sabbath was not moral. For that must of necessity be done, {{before it can be}} made appear that {{the first day of the}} week is that which is the sabbath day for Christians. But withal it follows, that if {{the seventh day}} sabbath was not moral,[5] the first day is not <b>so.</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> then? Why, a sabbath for holy worship is moral; but this or that day appointed for such service, is sanctified by precept or by approved example. The timing then of a sabbath for us lies in God, not man; in grace, not nature; nor in the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones: God always reserving to himself a power to alter and change both time and modes of worship according to his own will.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the common}} man's day shall have arrived, {{the new social}} {{institutions}} of that day will prevent the weeding out of weakness and inefficiency. All, the weak and the strong, will have an equal chance for procreation. And the progeny of all, of the weak {{as well as the}} strong, will have an equal chance for survival. This being so, and if no new effective law of development be put into operation, then progress must cease. And not only progress, for deterioration would at once set in. It is a pregnant problem. What will be the nature of this new and most necessary law of development? Can the common man pause long enough from his undermining labors to answer? Since he is bent upon dragging down the bourgeoisie and reconstructing society, can he so reconstruct that a premium, in some unguessed way or other, will still be laid upon the strong and efficient so that the human type will continue to develop? Can the common man, or the uncommon men who are allied with him, devise such a law? Or have they already devised one? And if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|E

Number two: that was some much cooler than I thought <b>it</b> would <b>be.</b> And number three: <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> about? I plan to try the film in some festivals and see if it gets picked up there. If nothing happens with that, I will distribute it myself in the hopes that it will become an underground rockabilly cult film.” ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that {{a modern}} English triolet {{normally}} aims at achieving? The answer must be various.

5000|$|Stan! commented: [...] "There {{are a lot}} of {{very good}} racing games out there, set against a wide variety of {{interesting}} backdrops, everything from cavemen riding dinosaurs through Formula One racers on real-world tracks and on to spaceships hurtling through interstellar space. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that makes Circus Maximus stand out as, far and away, my favorite of the bunch? Is it the Imperial Roman setting? The elegant mechanics? The way the game encourages players to work together while still competing? I can't really say that it's any of those things, but rather that it's all of those things together." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the near}} future, a {{maintenance}} vehicle is orbiting the Earth {{on a mission}} to repair nuclear-armed satellites. Suddenly, the crew experiences a mysterious, inexplicable power failure that cannot be accounted for. As the ship grows colder, they find themselves drifting toward {{the dark side of the}} Moon. An old NASA shuttle, the Discovery, drifts toward them, although NASA has not been operating for 30 years. Two of the crew members board the ship and find a dead body. The mission records of the crew's own ship indicate that the shuttle they have found disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle many years before. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> doing in space? As they attempt to solve this mystery, it quickly becomes apparent that a malevolent force has been waiting on the NASA shuttle, using the aforesaid dead body as its host and it now begins to stalk the crew members one at a time.|$|E

5000|$|Rick Swan {{reviewed}} GURPS IOU: Illuminati University for Dragon magazine #228 (April 1996). Noting SJG's {{success with}} the Illuminati: New World Order card game, he commented that [...] "despite its title, GURPS IOU {{has nothing to do}} with cards. Nor, for that matter, does it have much to do with the GURPS Illuminati supplement of a few years back. IOU looks like a setting for the GURPS role-playing game - and indeed, it has its share of game stats and adventure hooks - but the anything-goes, logic-down-the-dumper approach makes it virtually unplayable, at least by anyone who takes their games even semi-seriously. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> Basically, IOU is a glorified joke book, a drop of Monty Python mixed with a bucket of Three Stooges." [...] Swan concluded his review by saying: [...] "Maybe you consider yourself too sophisticated for silly stuff like this. But you've gotta admit - Democrats for Cthulhu, that’s pretty good." ...|$|E

5000|$|Following Cottle's long {{coaching}} tenure, Loyola hired Bill Dirrigl {{as their}} head coach. After four seasons Dirrigl was fired and Loyola graduate Charley Toomey {{took over as}} head coach in 2006. In both 2007 and 2008, Toomey led the Greyhounds to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament. The 2010 and 2011 NCAA lacrosse championships were held at M&T Bank Stadium. Loyola, worked in conjunction with Johns Hopkins, Towson, and UMBC to run these events. The Hounds failed {{to advance to the}} 2009 NCAA lacrosse playoffs despite having the ninth place RPI, the third highest strength of schedule, and a 9-5 record. Instead Brown gained the slot because of their wins over Cornell and University of Massachusetts. Brown had an RPI of twelve, their schedule ranked a low of thirty six, and were ranked third in the Ivy League. Coach Toomey compared the 2009 Greyhound's dilemma to that of the 2006 Harvard squad saying, [...] "I can remember in 2006, Harvard gets in at 6-6, losing their last three games, and they said, ‘It’s not a numbers thing, it’s a strength-of-schedule thing.’ … <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> going to be? Is it going to be big wins or numbers? If it’s numbers, we look doggone good. If it’s about big wins, then we might be on the outside looking in." [...] Harvard made the tournament over Toomey's squad that season, the reason being that their 'big wins' were not as competitive as Harvard's record, RPI and SOS. RPI vs. Big wins has been a very large argument in the NCAA tournament selection process the past few years.|$|E
