40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} a static observer for estimating wind speed {{in order to}} control wind speed and angle control at a user position in a submersive virtual environment. Addition of wind display evolves the Treadport Virtual environment into a highly immersive virtual environment called Treadport Active Wind Tunnel (TPAWT). Experiments on a scaled model of the TPAWT show that headwind flow stream diverges at the user. Pitot tube sensors placed at a particular region of converged flow in the scaled TPAWT provide measurements with lower noise. Open loop experiments on a scaled model of TPAWT show that there exists a relationship between speed measured at this region of converged flow and the wind speed at the user position. Using this relationship, the wind speed at the user can be estimated. We use this relation and combine previously used speed and angle controllers based upon the small gain theorem with a dynamic extension and conditional angular rate-switching control. Finally, we simultaneously control wind speed and headwind angle. towards the user.

Such hypothetical primordial objects {{may have}} been the seed of the massive black holes (BHs) observed at the centre of galaxies. Under the standard picture, these objects can be approximately described as n= 3 polytropes, and they are expected to shine extremely close to their Eddington luminosity. Once however, one considers the porosity induced by instabilities near the Eddington limit, which give rise to super-Eddington states, the standard picture should be modified. We study the structure, evolution and mass loss of these objects. We find the following. First, the evolution of SMSs is hastened due to their increased energy release. They accelerate continuum driven winds. If there is no rotational stabilization, these winds are insufficient to "evaporate" the objects, such that they can collapse to form a supermassive BHs, however, they do prevent SMSs from emitting a copious amount of ionizing radiation.

A WKB dispersion relation is derived for the stability problem. We find that the disk is always unstable if the wind torque is strong. At lower wind torques instability also occurs provided the rotation is close to Keplerian. The growth time scale of the instability can be as short as the orbital time scale.

30|$|The tending and the {{thinning}} operations realised in Germany {{resulted in a}} much faster initial growth of the stands (Mund et al. 2002), which were kept far below the self-thinning state. This management follows the simplest principle of sylviculture, whereby the growth is concentrated on few selected individuals. Optimal growth is favourable {{to the health of}} the trees and reduces the risk of insect attack or wind throw. The beneficial effects of thinning on tree growth and stand productivity can be explained by the increase of the water and nutrient resources available to the remaining trees. The amount of light that is intercepted by trees crowns increases, which further increases the tree-level efficiency (Aussenac 2000; Forrester et al. 2013). Thus the remaining trees have a more extended crown, which is also important in <b>stabilizing</b> against <b>wind</b> damage (Burschel and Huss 2003). Reduced canopy cover leads to less rain interception (Aussenac & Granier 1988) and reduced transpiration (Bréda et al. 1995; Simonin et al. 2007; Lagergren et al. 2008). Altogether the water resources are improved, even if only temporarily. For these reasons, limiting the growing stock in forests by increasing the harvest volumes and frequency has been promoted as a mean to reduce forest vulnerability to climate change, wind or insect damages (Seidl et al. 2011 a, b). The improvement of the soil water conditions after thinning can help the stand survive water stress events which are predicted to become more prominent with climate change. If the somewhat pessimistic climatic preditions made for European forests become true, with more frequent and intense droughts (Spellmann et al. 2015), such aspects need to be accounted for in the management of future forests.|$|R

Here we propose two new evolutionary processes which make the symbiotic channel to SNe Ia much wider. (1) We first show that the WD + RG close binary can form from a wide binary even with such a large initial separation as a_i ≲ 30000 R_. Such a binary consists of an AGB star and a low mass main-sequence (MS) star, where the AGB star is undergoing superwind before becoming a WD. If the superwind at the end of AGB evolution is as fast as or slower than the orbital velocity, the wind outflowing from the system takes away the orbital angular momentum effectively. As a result the wide binary shrinks greatly to become a close binary. Therefore, the WD + RG binary can form from much wider binaries than our earlier estimate. (2) When the RG fills its inner critical Roche lobe, the WD undergoes rapid mass accretion and blows a strong optically thick wind. Our earlier analysis has shown that the mass transfer is <b>stabilized</b> by this <b>wind</b> only when the mass ratio of RG/WD is smaller than 1. 15. Our new finding is that the WD wind can strip mass from the RG envelope, which could be efficient enough to stabilize the mass transfer even if the RG/WD mass ratio exceeds 1. 15. With the above two new effects (1) and (2), the symbiotic channel can account for the inferred rate of SNe Ia in our Galaxy...|$|R
40|$|Kobayashi, NobuhisaThe {{observed}} {{increase of}} population in coastal areas worldwide {{and the rise}} in sea level highlight the importance of protecting the coast. It is commonly known that a beach with a dune provides storm protection. However, rapid profile changes and destruction of sand dunes {{may be caused by}} wave-induced overwash and increase the flood risk landward of the dunes. This investigation examines a possible non-intrusive form of shore protection. Vegetation has been used to <b>stabilize</b> dunes against <b>wind</b> and wave attenuation by vegetation has been investigated to predict wind waves propagating across inundated vegetated areas. However, the effects of vegetation on dune erosion and overwash during storm events has never been studied. A laboratory experiment encompassing five tests on the effects of woody plants on erosion and overwash of high and low dunes was performed. While fordune scarp-ing occurred for the three high dune tests, it did not occur for the two low dune tests. In comparison to the respective bare dune, wave overtopping and overwash was not reduced by a narrow vegetation zone on a steep backdune of a high dune. However, a wide vegetation zone covering the high dune reduced foredune scarping, prevented wave overtopping initially and reduced sand overwash after the initiation of wave over-topping. By retarding wave uprush and reducing wave overtopping and overwash, a wide vegetation zone covering an entire low dune reduced dune erosion. The data set obtained will be applied in future to extend the time-and depth averaged, process based numerical model CSHORE to include the vegetation effects on wave overtopping and overwash of vegetated dunes. The extended CSHORE may be applied to prototype dunes. University of Delaware, Department of Civil EngineeringM. C. E...|$|R
