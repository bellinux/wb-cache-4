25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to a lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, <b>statements</b> <b>like</b> Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E

Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language {{has the potential to be}} meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful. <b>Statements</b> <b>like</b> [...] "God loves me" [...] are discussed largely in Religious Language.|$|E

At that stage, they intended to make no reference in the script to any characters having a concern about Dax's relationship with a woman so as to focus the story. Clearance was sought for the plot, first from showrunner Ira Steven Behr, then executive producer Rick Berman, and finally from the studio executives. Moore later explained that they agreed to the idea, saying that Star Trek stood for making <b>statements</b> <b>like</b> those in [...] "Rejoined".|$|E

It was released as Lohan's debut single and lead single from the [...] "Speak" [...] on September 21, 2004, by Casablanca Records. The song's lyrics allude to the constant paparazzi and media backlash regarding Lohan.

500|$|In late 1964, O'Hara went to Italy {{to shoot}} The Battle of the Villa Fiorita (1965) with Rossano Brazzi. O'Hara played a British woman who leaves her diplomat husband in England for an Italian pianist (Brazzi). She had high {{expectations}} for the film but soon realized that Brazzi was miscast. During the production O'Hara witnessed a robbery taking place nearby at jewellery store nearby in Milan. She was so frustrated with the finished film, which was a box office flop, that she cried. O'Hara made her last picture with James Stewart the following year in the comedic western, The Rare Breed. Malone thought that she modeled her performance on Julie Andrews, [...] "adopting a schoolmarmish voice and demeanor that ill befit her", and coming out with pious <b>statements</b> <b>like</b> [...] "cleanliness is next to godliness".|$|E

500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with <b>statements</b> <b>like</b> [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks back to you, {{you would have to}} beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime. So we have to give [...] a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they don't know Trek, to say the {{things that need to be}} said in order to get people onto our side." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} Education in Popular Culture, Alma Harris, Roy Fisher, Ann Harris, and Christine Jarvis {{analyzes}} the adult education {{aspects of this}} episode that portrays adult learners as [...] "stupid and lazy". After Homer is appointed as a teacher, he feels immensely proud and boasts to all his acquaintances about it, initially making it seem like if the show is indicating that adult education tutors have a relatively high status in society. [...] "However," [...] the authors added, [...] "Homer's pride is undercut for the audience by the awareness of {{how he came to}} be appointed and by the subsequent representation of the adult education center. It seems that anyone can become a tutor. [...] Homer's fellow tutors are drunks, incompetents and down-and-outs, adult education is therefore presented as an amateur business staffed by the dregs of society." [...] The writers of the book thought the whole idea of storytelling and building on experience that Homer uses, and that many adult education tutors uses in real life, is represented in the episode [...] "simply as an excuse for gossip and prurient curiosity". They also thought that <b>statements</b> <b>like</b> [...] "I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course. What the heck was the lab fee for?" [...] imply that adult education is [...] "exploitative and poor value for money, and that the students themselves contribute to this by demanding an essentially recreational service." [...] The authors concluded that the episode [...] "certainly sustains a popular view of adult education as pointless and recreational. Similarly, no value whatsoever is attributed to the extensively researched, proven through practice and well-argued perspective that adult learners do best when the curriculum builds on and values their experience." ...|$|E

Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains <b>statements</b> <b>like</b> [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E
