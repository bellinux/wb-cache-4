5|$|After invading Britain in 43AD the Romans {{crossed the}} Humber Estuary in 71AD {{to invade the}} Northumbrian {{territory}} of the Parisi tribe. From their bridgehead at Petuaria they travelled northwards and built roads along the Wolds to Derventio, present day Malton, and then westwards to the River Ouse where they built the fort of Eboracum. There is evidence of extensive use of the light soils of the Wolds for grain farming in the Roman era. Several Roman villas which were the centres of large agricultural estates have been identified around Langton and Rudston. In the low-lying lands {{on either side of}} the Wolds there was an increase in the number of settlements between 500BC and 500AD as the land became drier and more accessible due to a fall in sea level. The lower-lying land was used for stock breeding. During the last years of Roman occupation Anglo-Saxon raiders were troubling the area and, by the second half of the 5thcentury, settlement by Anglian invaders was taking place in east Yorkshire. Village names containing the elements -ing, -ingham or -ham are Anglian settlement names. As Christianity became established in the area from the 7thcentury onwards, several cemeteries like the one at Garton on the Wolds show evidence of the abandonment of pagan burial practices. In 867AD the Great Danish Army captured the Anglian town of York, and the remnants of the army settled in Yorkshire from 876AD when their leader Halfdan shared out the land among them. Scandinavian settlements have names including the elements -by and -thorpe. <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>rule</b> in the area came to an end in 954AD with the death of their ruler Eric Bloodaxe.|$|E

50|$|Only about 100 or 150 Norse words, mainly {{connected}} with government and administration, {{are found in}} Old English writing. The borrowing of words of this type was stimulated by <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>rule</b> in the Danelaw and during the later reign of Cnut. However, most surviving Old English texts {{are based on the}} West Saxon standard that developed outside the Danelaw; it is not clear to what extent Norse influenced the forms of the language spoken in eastern and northern England at that time. Later texts from the Middle English era, now based on an eastern Midland rather than a Wessex standard, reflect the significant impact that Norse had on the language. In all, English borrowed about 2000 words from Old Norse, several hundred surviving in Modern English.|$|E
50|$|Old English {{developed}} from {{a set of}} Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by Roman invasion. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that {{formed the basis for}} the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian.

50|$|Estonians {{have strong}} ties to the Nordic {{countries}} stemming from important cultural and religious influences gained over centuries during <b>Scandinavian</b> and German <b>rule</b> and settlement. Indeed, Estonians consider themselves Nordic rather than Baltic, in particular because of close ethnic and linguistic affinities with the Finns.|$|R

Norway had a Council of the Realm (Riksrådet) that was abolished by the Danish-Norwegian king in 1536. In Sweden the parallel Council gradually came under the influence of the king during the 17th century.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{transitions in}} life and landscape in Scandinavian-occupied early medieval England. The Viking Age is here contextualised within a longer view, looking both to Middle Saxon England {{on the eve of}} the Scandinavian incursions, and beyond the end of <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>rule</b> to structures of landholding and lordship following the Norman Conquest (c. AD 700 - 1100). Four local case studies from across three different counties (Lincolnshire, Norfolk, and Leicestershire) provide the basis for analysis. The primary dataset used to identify and assess these places was metal-detected portable material culture recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS). This is combined with data from HERs, Domesday Book, place-names, and landscape evidence in order to identify new early medieval settlements and occupied landscapes. Within these it is possible to identify a range of activities taking place, and socio-cultural negotiations being enacted. This enables the tracking of settlement dynamics over time, and in particular how changing social, political, and cultural contexts affected these transitions...|$|E
50|$|Tallinn, first {{mentioned}} in 1219, received city rights in 1248, but the earliest human settlements date back 5,000 years. The initial claim {{over the land}} was laid by the Danes in 1219 after a successful raid of Lyndanisse led by Valdemar II of Denmark, followed by a period of alternating <b>Scandinavian</b> and German <b>rule.</b> Due to its strategic location, the city became a major trade hub, especially from the 14th to the 16th century, when it grew in importance {{as part of the}} Hanseatic League.|$|R
30|$|There {{are just}} two {{justifications}} for two-tier bargaining in Boeri’s schema. First, sectoral agreements could be retained for those firms where plant-level bargaining does not take place. Second, and more positively, there is scope for multi-employer agreements that set rules rather than wage changes to be applied uniformly to all firms irrespective of their performance. Somewhat reminiscent of some modern <b>Scandinavian</b> practice, the <b>rules</b> in question would govern the proportion of operational value added going to workers. He argues that these reforms would provide a (better) means of reconciling microeconomic flexibility with macroeconomic stability than two-tier bargaining per se. But to repeat, whether multi-level bargaining as currently practiced might be an intermediate step in this direction or whether it can be construed as pursuing decentralization consistent with single-employer bargaining while preserving degrees of freedom in macro adjustment is nowhere addressed.|$|R
5|$|The {{agreements}} with Spanish authorities allowed only airlines {{from the country}} of origin or from Spain to fly charter flights. But because of the SAS-cooperation, an agreement was made where any Scandinavian airline could fly to Spain {{from any of the}} three Scandinavian countries. Domestically, Braathens SAFE received strong competition from Sterling Airways, {{but on the other hand}} this allowed Braathens SAFE to fly charter flights from Sweden. In 1968, the large Swedish–Danish charter airline Internord went bankrupt, giving Braathens SAFE increased charter traffic. The company also started purchasing a larger share of Altas Resor, until it took over all the whole company in 1978. In Sweden, Braathens SAFE used its partners to sell charter flights to Norway, and then continue their flights using scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE was hindered by the charter regulations from making intercontinental flights, as well as flights between the <b>Scandinavian</b> capitals. The <b>rules</b> also forced business travelers to use scheduled flights.|$|R
