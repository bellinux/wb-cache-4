25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and <b>strength</b> <b>properties</b> can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E

2500|$|Paper {{was made}} one sheet {{at a time}} by hand until {{development}} of the Fourdrinier paper machine (c. 1801) which made a continuous sheet. [...] Paper making was severely limited by the supply of cotton and linen rags {{from the time of}} the invention of the printing press until the development of wood pulp (c. 1850s)in response to a shortage of rags. [...] The sulfite process for making wood pulp started operation in Sweden in 1874. Paper made from sulfite pulp had superior <b>strength</b> <b>properties</b> than the previously used ground wood pulp (c. 1840). The kraft (Swedish for strong) pulping process was commercialized in the 1930s. [...] Pulping chemicals are recovered and internally recycled in the kraft process, also saving energy and reducing pollution. [...] Kraft paperboard is the material that the outer layers of corrugated boxes are made of. [...] Until Kraft corrugated boxes were available, packaging consisted of poor quality paper and paperboard boxes along with wood boxes and crates. Corrugated boxes require much less labor to manufacture than wooden boxes and offer good protection to their contents. [...] Shipping containers reduce the need for packaging.|$|E
