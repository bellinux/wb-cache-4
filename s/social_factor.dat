40|$|This {{thesis is}} in general an {{analysis}} of the factors that determine Kipps' language change used by Arthur Kipps, the main character in H. G. Wells' novel Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul. The topic is divided into four questions, that are the factors which influenc Kipps mostly and the changes have been made by him [...] The theory applied in investigating the matter is the theory of Janet Holmes which is concerned with the existance of two factors, language <b>factors</b> and <b>social</b> <b>factors.</b> As for the analysis, the writer examines the data. First, the writer deals with all kinds of language and <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> used by Kipps. Then, she will see the relationship between those factors through the table given. In this way, the writer finds out what language <b>factors</b> and <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> used most frequently by Kipps and show that <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> influence his language. Finally, she will show the changes of his language. To be able to do that, she uses the method of comparison. The result shows that Kipps' has undergone some changes in his language. The changes is influenced by the <b>social</b> <b>factors,</b> they are setting, participant, topic, and function. In conclusion, Holmes' theory about the relationship between language and <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> that <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> are more likely to affect the linguistic factors can be seen through this novel as all aspects in non-standard and standard English is really affected by the <b>social</b> <b>factors.</b> Thus, one may see the importance of the <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> on one's life as it can change someone's language...|$|R

40|$|While prior {{research}} testing Gottfredson and Hirschi's (1990) theory of low self-control had demonstrated {{a significant relationship}} between parenting and self-control, it had also recognized significant effects of other <b>social</b> <b>factors,</b> suggesting the etiology of self-control may be more complex than the theory specifies. In an effort to better understand this process, the current study examined first whether <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> other than parenting predicted self-control using both contemporaneous and lagged effects models, and second, whether the effect of parenting on self-control varied according to these <b>social</b> <b>factors.</b> Findings offered partial support for self-control theory. In implicit support of the theory, this study found that the effect of parenting on self-control was not conditioned by the competing <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> examined. Contrary to the theory, however, was the finding that self-control was predicted by both peer pressure and school <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> contemporaneously, even after controlling for parental monitoring. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} a behavioural {{model of}} the relation between <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> and obesity, in which differences in body mass index (BMI) across sociodemographic groups were hypothesized to be attributable to social group differences in health behaviours affecting energy expenditure (physical activity, diet and alcohol consumption and weight control). METHODS: A total of 8667 adults who participated in the 1995 Australian National Health and Nutrition Surveys provided data on a range of health factors including objectively measured height and weight, health behaviours, and <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> including family status, employment status, housing situation and migration status. RESULTS: <b>Social</b> <b>factors</b> remained significant predictors of BMI after controlling for all health behaviours. Neither <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> alone, nor health behaviours alone, adequately explained the variance in BMI. Gender-specific interactions were found between <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> and individual health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> moderate the relation between BMI and weight-related behaviours, and that the mechanisms underlying sociodemographic group differences in obesity may vary among men and women. Additional factors are likely to act in conjunction with current health behaviours to explain variation in obesity prevalence across sociodemographic groups. <br /...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor {{the first}} time in human history, more people across the world live in cities than in rural areas: In the U. S., {{approximately}} 80 % of the population live in cities. Socially vulnerable populations and complex infrastructure exist in higher numbers in cities significantly compounding risk. People facing these <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> have disproportionate exposure to risk and a decreased ability to avoid or absorb potential loss. However, the body of literature available on social vulnerability is disparate with fragmented insight into understanding the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> that increase vulnerability and practical approaches to reduce risk. This research focuses on developing a replicable, practical approach to understanding the complexity of social vulnerability in American cities while reducing the likelihood of civil rights violations. The Social Determinants of Vulnerability Framework (The Framework) was developed using a link analysis of <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> from existing literature. The Framework consists of seven interrelated <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> that seem to be driving vulnerability: children, people with disabilities, older adults, chronic and acute medical illness, social isolation, low-to-no income, and people of color. The Framework also includes specific poor outcomes that people with pre-emergency <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> are more likely to experience at disproportionately higher levels after emergencies: lack of access to post-incident services; displacement; injury, illness, and death; property loss or damage; domestic violence; and loss of employment. A quantitative analysis of those <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> based on City of Boston data confirmed many of the relationships among the <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> of vulnerability and the significance of social isolation...|$|R
