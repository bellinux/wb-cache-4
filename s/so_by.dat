It does <b>so</b> <b>by</b> binding to the 50S rRNA of the large bacterial ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others.|$|E

His commission was dated 7 March 1937. His service number was 40667. The commission enabled Braham to enter at the rank of pilot officer. His training mainly consisted of an introduction to flying by civilian organisations contracted to do <b>so</b> <b>by</b> the RAF. Successful candidates advanced to military training.|$|E

It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E

Although he was initially prevented from doing <b>so</b> <b>by</b> an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed.

Independiente was his first release as an independent artist, appearing on his Metamorfosis label, a company he created to refocus his career. The album was distributed by Warner.

5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County.

Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer {{in the absence of a}} request to do <b>so</b> <b>by</b> the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his own money.|$|E
