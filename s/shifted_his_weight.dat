5|$|On the November 29 {{episode of}} Raw, both Edge and Benoit competed {{in a number}} one contender's battle royal, but they {{eliminated}} each other simultaneously {{at the conclusion of}} the match, resulting in a draw. As a result, Triple H was forced to defend the title in a triple threat match. In the match, Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Edge, who <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> putting Benoit's shoulders on the mat for a pin. This match also ended in a draw for Benoit and Edge, as Benoit made Edge submit at the same time the referee counted a pinfall for Edge. As a result, the World Heavyweight title was vacated the following week on Raw. In January 2005, Edge competed in his first Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Shawn Michaels (acting as special guest referee) performed a superkick on Edge, in retaliation for an accidental spear by Edge, causing Edge to be the first eliminated. This led to a match at the Royal Rumble later in the month, in which Edge defeated Michaels.|$|E
500|$|With a wide batting {{stance and}} slight leg kick that [...] "allows him to {{maintain}} both incredible balance and timing", he <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{on his left}} (back) leg [...] "before connecting with the ball with an explosive, quick swing." [...] His combination of strong, quick hands and excellent hand-eye coordination allowed him to assert considerable bat control to make constant, square contact with the incoming pitch. [...] With an ability to drive the ball to all fields, his power ceiling was high, projected with 25 to 30 home runs in his peak. [...] His preparation also received high marks. [...] Through 2013, Taveras' career minor league batting average was [...]320 with 45 home runs and 275 RBIs in 374 games.|$|E
2500|$|... "He simply <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> more to {{one side}} than the other. This careened the ship {{to one side}}. She turned her nose away from the clump of sprouts when within fifty yards of them and took her course around them as prettily as a yacht on the sea avoids a bar. The ability to control the air ship in this manner {{appeared}} to give Whitehead confidence, for he was seen {{to take time to}} look at the landscape about him. He looked back and waved his hand exclaiming, 'I've got it at last.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They will {{be among}} the pitfalls presently," [...] sniggered Hans, <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> nervously from one leg on to the other. [...] "Hark! they are going into them." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the face}} of the stick blade strikes the puck, the player rolls <b>his</b> wrists and <b>shifts</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> so that the energy stored in the stick is {{released}} through the puck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Young blighted Albert," [...] said Keggs the butler, <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{so that it}} {{distributed}} itself more comfortably {{over the}} creaking chair in which he reclined, [...] "let this be a lesson to you, young feller me lad." ...|$|R
60|$|Laban <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{where he}} stood {{from one foot to}} the other.|$|E
60|$|The big Tahitian <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{and flashed}} {{his teeth in}} a conciliating smile.|$|E
60|$|He paused, {{licked his}} lips, and <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> uneasily from one leg to the other.|$|E
6000|$|Before she came, I had a mind {{to prove}} the celebrity of a poet on {{the spot where he}} lived and died,--on his very hearthstone, as it were. So I asked the lout, who stood gnawing a stick and <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{from one foot to the}} other,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is a day}} of drowsing heat, and the Emperor draws a {{deep breath}} [...] as he <b>shifts</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> from one puffed calf to the other. The [...] light cavalry, the foot, the {{artillery}} having passed, the heavy [...] horse now crosses, their glitter outshining the ripples on the [...] stream.|$|R
50|$|The {{spiral dive}} {{is the most}} rapid form of {{controlled}} fast descent; an aggressive spiral dive can achieve a sink rate of 25 m/s. This maneuver halts forward progress and brings the flier almost straight down. The pilot pulls the brakes {{on one side and}} <b>shifts</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> onto that side to induce a sharp turn. The flight path then begins to resembles a corkscrew. After a specific downward speed is reached, the wing points directly to the ground. When the pilot reaches his desired height, he ends this maneuver by slowly releasing the inner brake, <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> to the outer side and braking on this side. The release of the inner brake has to be handled carefully to end the spiral dive gently in a few turns. If done too fast, the wing translates the turning into a dangerous upward and pendular motion.|$|R
60|$|He <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> to {{his other}} foot and shrugged eloquently the {{shoulder}} near the passage.|$|E
60|$|One {{of the two}} flare bearers sighed at his elbow, and <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> to {{the other}} foot.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated, {{awkward and}} bashful, <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> from one leg to the other, then blunderingly gripped {{my hand in}} a hearty shake.|$|E
5000|$|In 1901 he {{conducted}} many trials in his [...] "No.21" [...] monoplane. On 18 August the Bridgeport Herald local newspaper published {{an account of}} a flight said {{to have taken place}} four days earlier. The machine was said to have risen to 50 ft and Whitehead later claimed that he could steer it by <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> to the left or right.|$|R
50|$|In competition, {{the term}} {{may have a}} {{distinct}} meaning. At a horse show, grooms outside of the ring perform standard grooming tasks, but if utilized inside the show ring are generally defined as an individual called in to assist an exhibitor with a horse while in competition. In combined driving the groom is the passenger and at speed is required to <b>shift</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> to balance the carriage.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{flexible}} {{wings are}} set up with near neutral roll due to sideslip (anhedral effect). In the roll axis, the pilot <b>shifts</b> <b>his</b> body mass using the wing control bar, applying a rolling moment directly to the wing. The flexible wing is built to flex differentially across the span {{in response to the}} pilot applied roll moment. For example, if the pilot <b>shifts</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> to the right, the right wing trailing edge flexes up more than the left, allowing the right wing to drop and slow down.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{from one}} foot to the other. [...] "Well, it's a pretty rough old village, Flo--a pretty rough place for you and mother." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} did not answer, though his fingers worked on the barrel of his musket, and he <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight,</b> from leg to leg, like one whose inward {{feelings}} were moved.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a wild}} boar. He {{peered at}} me curiously. He grunted once or twice and <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> from one foreleg to the other, {{at the same time}} moving his {{head from side to side}} and swaying the ferns. Still I sat as one petrified, my eyes unblinking as I stared at him, fear eating at my heart.|$|E
50|$|Bodacious {{is known}} for one precise {{deception}} that resulted in many injuries for riders. He would bring his head {{down to the ground}} and then rear up, which forced the rider to <b>shift</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> forward. At that point, he would throw his head back into the rider's face, smashing it. Bodacious was always a forceful bucking bull with an impressive vertical leap, which kept him from being conquered by {{more than a handful of}} riders.|$|R
50|$|At a {{time when}} most hang gliders used a {{flexible}} Rogallo wing, Icarus I used a rigid flying wing biplane configuration. Unlike other hang gliders of the time, the Icarus was not steered by the pilot <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> body <b>weight.</b> Instead, Icarus I had two large rudders mounted near the wing tips, controlled by hand levers. These rudders made Icarus I much more maneuverable than other hang gliders. Pitch was controlled by the pilot <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> body <b>weight</b> fore and aft. The pilot flew in a reclining position, rather than the prone position used by other hang gliders.|$|R
50|$|Side A {{depicts the}} moment when Apollo first grabs Heraklesâ€™ bicep {{to stop him from}} {{absconding}} with the tripod. With an open mouth, he seems to beseech Herakles to reconsider his actions. Herakles wrenches his arm from Apollo, <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{from one foot to the}} other. The sacred palm in the middle of the frame serves as a barrier between the two figures and as a marker of the sacred site of Delphi. The words HERAKLEOS, KALOS, and APOLLONOS which mean Herakles, Beautiful, and Apollo respectively.|$|R
60|$|Then I screamed...or shrieked--I cannot {{describe}} it, {{but it was}} {{a shrill}} and terrible cry. And it seems that it, too, {{at this stage of the}} proceedings, was the thing expected of me. From not far away came an answering cry. My sounds seemed momentarily to disconcert the boar, and while he halted and <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> with indecision, an apparition burst upon us.|$|E
6000|$|Lassiter had no ready response, and he uneasily <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{from one}} leg to another, {{and turned his}} sombrero round and round in his hands. [...] "Ma'am," [...] he began, presently, [...] "I reckon your {{kindness}} of heart makes you overlook things. Perhaps I ain't well known hereabouts, but back up North there's Mormons who'd rest uneasy in their graves {{at the idea of}} me sittin' to table with you." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} episode seemed merely funny to me. But {{when one of}} the vagrant impulses of fear, common in that age of {{perpetual}} insecurity, moved within me, I was struck with my own loneliness. I was made suddenly aware of Lop-Ear's remoteness out there on that alien element a few feet away. I called loudly to him a warning cry. He awoke frightened, and <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> rashly on the log. It turned over, sousing him under. Three times again it soused him under as he tried to climb out upon it. Then he succeeded, crouching upon it and chattering with fear.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{although}} some studies of open repair of the tendon of the quadriceps femoris have been published, {{there have been}} no reports in the literature on primary arthroscopic repair. In our present study, we present two cases of quadriceps tendon injury arthroscopically repaired with excellent results. Case 1 involved a 68 -year-old man who was injured while <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> to prevent a fall. MRI showed complete rupture at the insertion of the patella of the quadriceps tendon. The rupture was arthroscopically repaired using both suture anchor and pull-out suture fixation methods via bone tunnels (hereafter, pull-out fixation). Two years after surgery, retearing was not observed on MRI and both Japan Orthopedic Association (JOA) Knee and Lysholm scores had recovered to 100. Case 2 involved a 50 -year-old man who was also injured when <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> to prevent a fall. MRI showed incomplete superficial rupture at the insertion of the patella of the quadriceps tendon. The rupture was arthroscopically repaired using pull-out fixation of six strand sutures. One year after surgery, MRI revealed a healed tendon and his JOA and Lysholm scores were 95 and 100, respectively. Thus, arthroscopic repair may be a useful surgical method for repairing quadriceps tendon injury...|$|R
50|$|LOS: This {{is a more}} {{sophisticated}} tool than FRT used to measure balance under multi-directional conditions. The subject is asked to stand on force plates and intentionally <b>shift</b> <b>his</b> body <b>weight</b> in the cued direction.|$|R
60|$|Going {{into the}} parlor they found Mr. Wentworth {{performing}} introductions. A young man was standing before the Baroness, blushing a good deal, laughing a little, and <b>shifting</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> {{from one foot to}} the other--a slim, mild-faced young man, with neatly-arranged features, like those of Mr. Wentworth. Two other gentlemen, behind him, had risen from their seats, and a little apart, near one of the windows, stood a remarkably pretty young girl. The young girl was knitting a stocking; but, while her fingers quickly moved, she looked with wide, brilliant eyes at the Baroness.|$|R
60|$|She shook him, and {{he managed}} to grip the weapon. Then she pulled and tugged, as when {{awakening}} a heavy sleeper, till {{he was on his}} feet. But his face was livid, his eyes like a somnambulist's, and he was afflicted as with a palsy. Still holding him, she took a step backward for him to come on. He ventured it with a shaking knee. There was no sound save the heavy breathing of many men. A man coughed slightly and cleared his throat. It was disquieting, and all eyes centred upon him rebukingly. The man became embarrassed, and <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> uneasily to the other leg. Then the heavy breathing settled down again.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fourth}} match, AJ Styles defended the United States Championship against Kevin Owens. In the end, as Owens and Styles traded counters, Styles applied a crossface on Owens, who <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> on Styles into a pin {{to win the}} title for a third time.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Ah-Ha!" [...] moment struck Jim one {{day while}} gardening. As he <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> on his foam ground cushion, he heard the air {{escaping}} a closed chamber. A deduction was made that if open-cell foam could be secured in an airtight chamber, a valve could control internal air pressure. The combination of foam and air would protect and thermally insulate campers, keeping them warm and comfortable; plus, the tendency of open-cell foam to rebound would allow the pads to self-inflate.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the fans}} don't know this, but from 1993 to 1995, Bodacious was out of {{competition}} for long periods due to an injury. Despite that, the bull actually returned to action {{even more difficult to}} ride. During his absence, he developed an even more lethal bucking move. This move involves him bringing up his rear end with his head to the ground. This entices the rider to <b>shift</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> forward. Bodacious would then thrust his head up and use it to smash the rider in the face. In retrospect, Hedeman was brash and not well prepared. He lasted four seconds.|$|R

50|$|Shields {{has great}} command of his fastball and changeup. His four-seamer and two-seamer each are {{typically}} thrown 91-94 MPH. His changeup is top notch when he keeps {{it down in}} the zone and sits in the mid 80s. Shields also throws a cut fastball that has superb movement and is thrown in the high 80s. He also occasionally mixes in an average spiked curve {{in the mid to}} upper 70's. Shields also pitches with an awkward windup where he <b>shifts</b> <b>his</b> <b>weight</b> back toward second base by moving his left leg in the air and moving it behind him. He then pauses for about one second before pitching.|$|R
