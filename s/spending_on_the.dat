5|$|Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on {{the front}} line of the war, yet the New England colonies {{suffered}} less economic damage than other areas. Some of the costs of the war were offset by the importance of Boston as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown's military <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1711 Quebec expedition.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt at a}} school field trip, Edna Krabappel calls an {{emergency}} strike {{on behalf of the}} Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> school. The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the strike is over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the two sides are forced into talking and think of a resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 12th century, Southampton Castle was valued more for its role in coastal defence and as a coastal base for {{operations}} on the continent than for its value in ensuring internal security. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, and in 1187 the wooden keep was converted into a stone shell-keep. John increased <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> castle during his reign. Royal visits to Southampton were quite common, and additional royal accommodation, called the King's House, was built outside the castle.|$|E

Besides these sites, many open-air museums are located in the Commonwealth, such as Colonial Williamsburg, the Frontier Culture Museum, and various historic battlefields.

5|$|While, unsurprisingly, {{military}} spending constituted the largest {{part of the}} national government's budget {{over the course of the}} war, over time the payment of interest and principal on acquired debt grew as a share of the Confederate government's expenditure. While initially, in early 1861, war expenditure was 95% of the budget, by October 1864 that share fell to 40%, with the majority of the rest (56% overall) being accounted for by debt service.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the Ramsey model with the Becker-Mulligan’s time {{preference}} generation function.

Using the time preference, {{we discuss the}} effects of government expenditure, income tax rate, and consumption tax rate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steady-state capital stock, con-sumption level, and <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> imaging <b>the</b> future.

25|$|In 1929, federal {{expenditures}} {{accounted for}} only 3% of GNP. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditures tripled, but the national debt {{as a percent of}} GNP showed little change. <b>Spending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> war effort quickly eclipsed spending on New Deal programs. In 1944 government <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> war effort exceeded 40% of GNP. The US economy experienced dramatic growth during the Second World War mostly due to the deemphasis of free enterprise in favor of the imposition of strict controls on prices and wages. These controls shared broad support among Labor and Business, resulting in cooperation between the two groups and the Federal Government. This cooperation resulted in the government subsidizing business and labor through both direct and indirect methods.|$|E
