5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any <b>serious</b> <b>risks</b> {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|Life on {{the island}} was very {{isolated}} due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly {{on the beach and}} pulled up above the waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma could be cut off for weeks at a time. Such episodes posed <b>serious</b> <b>risks</b> to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90m) inland. Stroma's isolation came at an especially bad time, as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks' worth of mail.|$|E

25|$|Women {{in various}} {{countries}} face <b>serious</b> <b>risks</b> if they report rape. These risks include {{being subjected to}} violence (including honor killings) by their families, being prosecuted for sex outside marriage, or being forced to marry their rapist. This creates a culture of impunity which allows rape to go unpunished.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{comes through}} {{municipal}} recycling of wastewater into crop fields.

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and a dry mouth. Serious side effects can include liver {{problems}} and regular monitoring of liver function tests is therefore recommended. Other <b>serious</b> <b>risks</b> include pancreatitis {{and an increased}} suicide risk. It is known to cause serious abnormalities in the baby if taken during pregnancy. Because of this it is not typically recommended in {{women of childbearing age}} who have migraines.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} <b>serious</b> <b>risks</b> {{associated}} with {{manipulation of the}} cervical spine is uncertain, with little evidence of risk of harm but also little evidence of safety either. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of vertebral artery dissection, {{which can lead to}} stroke and death, from cervical manipulation. Several deaths have been associated with this technique and {{it has been suggested that}} the relationship is causative, but this is disputed by many chiropractors who believe it is unproven.|$|E
25|$|The fungi Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus tamarii, Aspergillus sulphureus, Aspergillus repens, Mucor hiemalis (not a human pathogen), Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium italicum and Rhizopus nigrans {{have been}} found in moldy cannabis. Aspergillus mold species can infect the lungs via smoking or {{handling}} of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly aspergillosis. Some of the microorganisms found create aflatoxins, which are toxic and carcinogenic. Researchers suggest that moldy cannabis should thus be discarded to avoid these <b>serious</b> <b>risks.</b>|$|E

Furthermore, there are presumably non-compliant products which were not detected by surveillance activities which can contain higher levels of harmful substances than allowed.|$|R
25|$|Clozapine is {{associated}} with a relatively high risk of low white blood cells which may result in death. To decrease this risk it is recommended that the blood be regularly monitored. Other <b>serious</b> <b>risks</b> include seizures, inflammation of the heart, high blood sugar levels, and, in older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, an increased risk of death. Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, low blood pressure, trouble seeing, and dizziness. The potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia occurs in about 5% of people. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear.|$|E
25|$|Subsidence has {{resulted}} in increased flood risk, as Bangkok is already prone to flooding due to its low elevation and inadequate drainage infrastructure resulting from rapid urbanization. The city now relies on flood barriers and augmenting drainage from canals by pumping and building drain tunnels, but parts of Bangkok and its suburbs are still regularly affected by flooding. Heavy downpours resulting in urban runoff overwhelming drainage systems, and runoff discharge from upstream areas, are major triggering factors. Severe flooding affecting {{much of the city}} occurred recently in 1995 and 2011. In the latter, most of Bangkok's northern, eastern and western districts became inundated, in some places for over two months. Coastal erosion is also an issue in the gulf coastal area, a small length of which lies within Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian District. Global warming poses further <b>serious</b> <b>risks,</b> and a study by the OECD has estimated that 5.138 million people in Bangkok may be exposed to coastal flooding by 2070, the seventh highest among the world's port cities.|$|E

2500|$|... 1,4-Butanediol is {{converted}} into GHB by the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase and differing levels of these enzymes {{may account for}} differences in effects and side effects between users. While co-administration of ethanol and GHB already poses <b>serious</b> <b>risks,</b> co-administration of ethanol with 1,4-butanediol will interact considerably and has many other potential risks. This is because the same enzymes {{that are responsible for}} metabolizing alcohol also metabolize 1,4-butanediol so there is a strong chance of a dangerous drug interaction. Emergency room patients who overdose on both ethanol and 1,4-butanediol often present with symptoms of alcohol intoxication initially and as the ethanol is metabolized the 1,4-butanediol is then able to better compete for the enzyme and a second period of intoxication ensues as the 1,4-butanediol {{is converted}} into GHB.|$|E
2500|$|The UNFPA warns about <b>serious</b> <b>risks</b> {{that faces}} more than 40,000 {{pregnant}} women in Gaza. Stress, trauma, and poor nutrition {{could result in}} life-threatening complications along with silent death and injuries for such population. Due {{to the lack of}} warm clothing or blankets among the increasing number of displaced people, shock and trauma, an alarming number of [...] premature labour and delivery and the exposure of newborn infants to hypothermia are reported. The organization has also voiced concerns about neonatal care post-crisis as many women who delivered their babies in hospitals during the crisis were sent home as early as 30 minutes after giving birth. The World Health Organization warns of the risk of an outbreak of epidemic disease due to unrecovered bodies, many severely decomposed, and due to the sewage flowing in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahya. With the help of the Unicef, two therapy centers are working at full capacity to provide services for 120 malnutritioned, a medical condition of inadequate diet, children per day. Injured patients needing referral outside Gaza for specialized care were evacuated exclusively through the Egyptian Rafah border crossing. Gaza Ministry of Health reported that between 29 December and 22 January 608 injured were evacuated through Rafah. The Israeli Erez crossing was closed much of the period and only 30 patients were able to exit during the crisis.|$|E

60|$|The {{scene of}} this story of boyish {{aspiration}} and adventure is laid among the granite piles and tors of Cornwall. Here amongst the hardy, honest fishermen and miners the two London boys are inducted into the secrets of fishing in the great bay, {{they learn how to}} catch mackerel, pollack, and conger with the line, and are present at the hauling of the nets, although not without incurring many <b>serious</b> <b>risks.</b> Adventures are pretty plentiful, but the story has for its strong base the development of character of the three boys. There is a good deal of quaint character throughout, and the sketches of Cornish life and local colouring are based upon experience in the bay, whose fishing village is called here Menhardoc. This is a thoroughly English story of phases of life but little touched upon in boys' literature up to the present time.|$|E
60|$|Caterpillars and {{butterflies}} often show us a further step in {{advance in the}} direction of minute imitation of ordinary surroundings. Dr. Weismann has published a very long and learned memoir, fraught with the best German erudition and prolixity, upon this highly interesting and obscure subject. As English readers, however, not unnaturally object to trudging through a stout volume on the larva of the sphinx moth, conceived in the spirit of those patriarchal ages of Hilpa and Shalum, when man lived to nine hundred and ninety-nine years, and devoted a stray century or so without stint to the work of education, I shall not refer them to Dr. Weismann's original treatise, as well translated and still further enlarged by Mr. Raphael Meldola, but will present them instead with a brief résumé, boiled down and condensed into a patent royal elixir of learning. Your caterpillar, then, runs many <b>serious</b> <b>risks</b> in early life from the annoying persistence of sundry evil-disposed birds, who insist at inconvenient times in picking him off the leaves of gooseberry bushes and other his chosen places of residence. His infant mortality, indeed, is something simply appalling, and it is only by laying the eggs that produce him in enormous quantities that his fond mother the butterfly ever succeeds in rearing on an average two of her brood to replace the imago generation just departed. Accordingly, the caterpillar has been forced by adverse circumstances to assume the most ridiculous and impossible disguises, appearing now {{in the shape of a}} leaf or stem, now as a bundle of dark-green pine needles, and now again as a bud or flower, all for the innocent purpose of concealing his whereabouts from the inquisitive gaze of the birds his enemies.|$|E
