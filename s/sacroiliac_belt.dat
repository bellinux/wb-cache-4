5000|$|If {{the pain}} does not resolve {{in the first}} 1-2 weeks, then the patient may benefit from a steroid and {{anesthetic}} mixture fluoroscopically injected into the joint (this also serves in confirming diagnosis), as well as manipulative or manual therapy. For the most severe and chronic forms of sacroiliac dysfunction, treatment should proceed {{with the support of}} a <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>belt,</b> injection therapy, and finally, surgery. [...] The anti-inflammatory effect of injection therapy is not permanent, and the injections do not offer an opportunity to stabilize an incompetent joint. Surgery is often considered a last resort, but for some patients, it is the only method of effectively stabilizing the loose joint. A fixation of the joint (screws or similar hardware only, without the use of bone grafting) is more common than a spinal fusion, as it is much less invasive, surgically straightforward, and results in a quicker recovery time for the patient. [...] Some experts in the field believe {{that it is important to}} make sure the sacroiliac joint is in an anatomically correct position prior to fixation or fusion, but published research contradicts this belief. The problem of alignment of the pelvis is that this does not accurately indicate the true status of the inside articular structure, the SIJ. After over 2 decades of pre-fusion pelvic alignment, there is no objective measure to indicate the utility. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that well intentioned clinicians blame the SIJ as causative for the patient's pelvic misalignment. Aligning the pelvis provides temporary relief or relief of pain may occur because multiple structures respond to malalignment such as the hip and lumbar spine; provoking a self-fulfilling prophecy of so-called [...] "SIJ instability." [...] Numerous studies have indicated poor to fair intertester reliability with pelvic palpation and the dubious nature of palpation and traditional gross motion testing was brought into question.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose. This {{case report}} {{describes}} the examination, eval-uation, and intervention by {{a physical therapist}} for a female collegiate tennis player with a right ilial anterior rotation hypermobility. Case Description. The patient was a 21 -year-old, female collegiate tennis player who developed a right anterior ilial rotation hypermobility {{as a result of}} her tennis stroke. Functional limitations were related to sitting, squatting, gait, and playing tennis. Treatment interventions consisted of massage, joint manipulation, stretching, stabilization exercises, sport-specific exercises and modification of tennis stroke, proprioceptive taping, and the use of a <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>belt.</b> Outcomes. After 26 weeks (33 treatments), tissue tenderness of the sacroiliac joint region was normalized, pelvic/trunk and lower-extremity mobility and flexibility were restored, sacroiliac symmetry and stability were regained, and the patient achieved her goal of returning to competitive tennis at the collegiate level. Discussion. The patient’s right ilial anterior rotation hypermobility was directly related to the mechanics of her tennis stroke. Her outcomes suggest that rehabilita-tion should focus on the entire abdomino-sacro-pelvic-hip complex, addressing ar-ticular, neural, and muscular inhibitions and deficiencies...|$|E
40|$|Back pain is {{a highly}} {{frequent}} condition due to many causes, although most of them cannot be established with certainty. It is also the current clinical and scientific belief that sacroiliac joint syndrome can be a specific low back pain cause. Nonetheless the existence of clinical tests aimed at highlighting the responsibility for lumbar pain secondary to sacroiliac dysfunction, {{it is not easy}} to diagnose it with either manual or instrumental means. Moreover, uncertainty is diffuse when facing a correct treatment for patients involved. The aim of this study was to verify, in patients with acute or sub-acute low back pain and positive sacroiliac signs, the efficacy of a stabilising therapy (orthosis and exercises, with previous mesotherapy) directly targeted to sacroiliac dysfunction versus a symptomatic usual care such as He-Ne laser therapy. Over a period of 14 months, we recruited 22 patients (10 females, mean age 44 +/- 11) with acute and sub-acute low back pain and symptoms and signs suggesting a sacroiliac dysfunction. They were randomised in a Group laser (GL), 11 patients treated with He-Ne laser therapy targeting the sacroiliac region, and a Group stabilisation (GS), 11 patients treated with mesotherapy, a specific dynamic sacroiliac support (ILSA) and specific exercises. Outcome criteria included VAS, and Mens and Laslett sacroiliac tests. Out of 449 acute and sub-acute low back pain out-patients, 22 (4. 9 %) had symptoms and signs suggesting a sacroiliac dysfunction. A reduction of pain was achieved only in the GS. All pain-provocation and stability tests were negative both after the end of treatment and at the follow-up only in the GS. A targeted approach based on mesotherapy, a specific <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>belt</b> and specific stabilizing exercises proved its efficacy in acute and sub-acute low back pain patients with symptoms and signs suggesting a sacroiliac dysfunction. As soon as it will be possible to identify particular spine syndromes in the universe of non specific low back pain, there will also be the possibility to employ specific therapies...|$|E
40|$|Background / aim: <b>Sacroiliac</b> (S. I) <b>belts</b> are {{commonly}} used sports medicine in both treatment and prevention {{of a range of}} pathologies, often associated with groin / hip pain. The aim of this pilot {{study was to examine the}} influence of S. I belt application on the performance of clinical, biomechanical and functional measures, related to groin / hip injury risk factors. Methods: Six participants (age 25. 1 ± 4. 1) completed each test with and without the use of an S. I belt. Hip Adductor and Abductor strength was measured by a Biodex Isokinetic machine. Dynamic hip to knee valgum during a Counter Movement Jump (CMJ) was analysed using a Vicon Motion Capture system. Bent Knee Fallout and Passive Hip Range of Motion were measured using hand-held goniometry and the Y-balance test was used to assess functional lower limb stability. Results: Initial analysis of results show that S. I belt application reduced Passive Hip ROM and BKFO scores. Conversely, S. I belt application improved both functional Stability and dynamic valgus during CMJ and improved both Adductor / Abductor muscle peak torque and percentage ratio. Conclusion: S. I belt application may reduce passive hip joint movement and active adductor flexibility. However, these did not adversely affect dynamic stability or Adductor / Abductor muscle strength. This interesting pattern may warrant future exploration to determine the clinical effectiveness and uses of S. I belt application in pathology related to hip and groin pai...|$|R
40|$|Background: Half {{or more of}} {{pregnant}} women experience back pain at some time during pregnancy. Even though back pain exists post partum, it is not well documented and detailed studies concerning different back pain localisations, experiences of pain and activity abilities are scarce. Thus, the prevalence of back pain post partum varies highly, between 2 % - 65 %, due to different follow-up times, methods and definitions of persisting back pain. Aim: The aim of this thesis was to 1) identify and classify back pain in women post partum {{and its relation to}} experience of pain and ability to perform daily activities; 2) quantify differences in kinematics above all with respect to joint co-ordination, temporal parameters and pelvic motion in a lifting task; 3) evaluate how different treatments performed during pregnancy affected pain and activities during pregnancy and in the post partum period. Methods: On average 7 months post partum 119 women were examined and interviewed. The spinal sagittal configuration and mobility were measured in the thoracic and lumbar spine, respectively, with a kyphometer. Eight pain provocation tests were performed for the lumbar spine, sacroiliac joints and symphysis and in addition hip movement and radiating pain were examined. Pain intensity was rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS 0 - 100 mm) and described with regard to localisation of pain and type of sensation on a pain drawing. Activity ability was scored using the Disability Rating Index (DRI) covering 12 items each rated on a VAS 0 - 100 mm. Based on clinical examination, 118 women with pelvic girdle pain diagnosed during pregnancy were randomised into three different treatment groups. They were followed throughout pregnancy and until 12 months post partum with respect to perceived pain and self-estimated activity limitations. All three groups received information about the condition and were provided with a non-elastic <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>belt</b> (Rehband®, Sweden). Group 2 received in addition a home training programme consisting of three exercises aiming to activate the muscles around the pelvic girdle and stretching exercises. Group 3 participated in addition in an individual training programme consisting of strengthening exercises. Seven women with low-back pain and nine women without low-back pain participated in a laboratory study on average 6 months post partum. The lifting task consisted of lifting an 8. 3 kg box with both hands. A two-camera opto-electronic system (ELITE, BTS, Milan, Italy) recorded the positions of 14 passive light- reflecting markers for calculations of joint and segment angles. Results: In 27 % of the women, pain could be provoked {{in the area of the}} posterior pelvic/sacroiliac joints, in 18 % in the lumbar spine, in 39 % in both areas and in 16 % no pain could be provoked in the defined areas. The spinal sagittal configuration or mobility and perceived pain intensity did not differ between the groups. In the three groups where pain was provoked in the lower back area, the ability to carry out above all movement related daily activities, was more limited than in the group where no pain could be provoked in that area. There was no significant difference between the three intervention groups during pregnancy or at the three follow-ups regarding pain and activity. In all groups, pain decreased and the activity ability increased between gestation week 38 and at three months follow-up. The performance of the lifting task differed between the women with and without low-back pain concerning the hip-pelvic-lumbar spine motions. The pain group had less hip joint flexion and more lumbar spine flexion at box lift-off. A large percentage in the pain group also showed a non-stop flexion-extension motion of the lumbar spine and an unsteady pelvis motion in space around lift-off. Conclusions: Pain could be provoked from different locations in the back and can thus not be seen as a unitary concept. The measuring of the spinal sagittal configuration and mobility did not further identify or classify post partum back pain. Pain is a symptom, but activity limitations seem to be important, since the findings showed limitations in movement related activities. Performing exercises had no additional value when compared to giving a non-elastic <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>belt</b> and information. During performance of a lifting task, dissimilar kinematics were shown in the motion of the hip-pelvis-lumbar movement. It seems important to pay attention to women with back pain post partum, in order to prevent prolonged pain. Sammanfattning:Syfte: Introduktion: Ca 50 % anger ryggbesvär någon gång under graviditeten och mellan 2 %- 65 % har också kvarstående besvär efter förlossningen. Trots att dessa kvinnor anger ryggbesvär efter förlossningen är problemet inte speciellt väl undersökt. Syfte: Det övergripande syftet med avhandlingen var att identifiera olika lokalisering av ryggbesvär hos kvinnor efter förlossningen, samt att beskriva upplevelsen av smärta och hur dessa kvinnor klarar av vanliga vardagliga aktiviteter. Dessutom jämfördes hur tre olika behandlingar påverkade smärta och funktion, dels under graviditeten, men också upp till 12 månader efter förlossningen. Slutligen utfördes en rörelseanalys av ett lyft. Material och Metod: I genomsnitt 7 månader efter förlossningen intervjuades och undersöktes 119 kvinnor med kvarstående ryggbesvär. Åtta vedertagna reliabilitetestestade smärtprovocerande test användes för att undersöka sacroiliacaleden, symfysen och ländryggen. Höftrörligheten testades och den utstrålande smärtan i benet. Den sagittella ryggkonfigurationen och rörligheten i länd- och thorakalryggen mättes med en kyfometer. Skattning av smärtintensitet gjordes på en visuell analog skala (VAS 0 - 100 mm) och smärtutbredning markerades på en smärtritning. Aktivitetsförmåga skattades med ett aktivitets index, DRI, Disability Rating Index, där tolv dagliga aktiviteter skulle bedömas (0 - 100 mm). Totalt 118 gravida kvinnor med smärta från bäckenlederna randomiserades till tre olika sjukgymnastiska behandlingar. Samtliga grupper erhöll information och ett sacroiliacaleds bälte (Rehband®, Sverige). Dessutom fick en grupp ett hemtränings program innehållande övningar för att aktivera de stabiliserande musklerna runt bäckenet samt stretching. Den tredje gruppen deltog i ett styrketränings program på en sjukgymnastmottagning. Utvärdering av smärta och funktion gjordes i graviditetsvecka 38 samt 3, 6 och tolv månader efter förlossningen. Sju kvinnor med resp nio kvinnor utan besvär i nedre delen av ryggen, utförde i två experimentella studier, ett lyft av en 8. 3 kg tung låda. Registrering av rörelsen gjordes med ett optoelektroniskt system (ELITE, BTS, Milano). Rörelsen i fot-, knä- och höftled samt i ländrygg, bäcken och bål analyserades. Rörelse- och tidsomfång registrerades samt koordinationen mellan de analyserade ledvinklarna. Resultat: Hos 27 % av kvinnorna kunde smärta provoceras i sacroiliacaleden, hos 18 % i ländryggen, hos 39 % i båda dessa områdena och hos 16 % kunde ingen smärta provoceras med de använda testerna. Det förelåg inga skillnader avseende den sagittella ryggkonfigurationen el...|$|E
