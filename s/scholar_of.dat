40|$|A {{careful study}} of {{national}} income must necessarily {{address the issue}} of localization of economic activities in each country. This aspect has been a primary focus since the first <b>scholars</b> <b>of</b> quantitative economics - the Political Arithmeticians - in setting the background for measuring income, paid large emphasis on the localization of firms. With the evolution of research and knowledge on how income is generated, distributed and used, a larger and larger set of evidence has been produced on per-capita income differences across and within countries. The awareness of the degree of income variability within a country has fostered the investigations aimed at identifying what can be defined as the "areas {{for the study of the}} circular flow of income". As a consequence, the <b>scholars</b> <b>of</b> economic statistics happened to conduct their research in a field where <b>scholars</b> <b>of</b> other disciplines were already contributing: it is the case of labor economists and/or economic geographers. Hence, in the last part of this essay, we compare the different approaches to analyzing the economic characterization of the territory taken by: a) <b>scholars</b> <b>of</b> the circular flow <b>of</b> income, b) <b>scholars</b> <b>of</b> local labor markets and c) <b>scholars</b> <b>of</b> firms' localization...|$|R

In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E
