5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include <b>sensory</b> <b>impairment</b> (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The {{type and}} degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis of ataxic {{cerebral}} palsy {{is based on}} clinical assessment using standardized assessment tools. Diagnosis begins with the observation of slow motor development, abnormal muscle tone, and unusual posture in children that fail to reach developmental milestones. [...] Diagnosis differs in adults and children because a child’s brain is still developing and acquiring new motor, linguistic, adaptive, and social skills. The testing strategy {{is based on the}} pattern of development of symptoms, the patient’s family history, and any factors that might influence the diagnosis, such as injury or trauma. Associated disabilities such as those previously described under symptoms associated with ataxic {{cerebral palsy}}, i.e., <b>sensory</b> <b>impairment</b> and cognitive dysfunction, are also helpful in diagnosing the disease.|$|E

[...] It, therefore, includes both the physiology of breath-hold diving in humans and other air-breathing animals, {{and the range}} of physiological effects generally limited to human ambient pressure divers either freediving or using underwater breathing apparatus. Several factors influence the diver, including immersion, exposure to the water, the limitations of breath-hold endurance, variations in ambient pressure, the effects of breathing gases at raised ambient pressure, effects caused by the use of breathing apparatus, and <b>sensory</b> <b>impairment.</b> All of these may affect diver performance and safety.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> are a {{substantial}} problem for older Americans: One {{out of six}} has impaired vision; {{one out of four}} has impaired hearing; one out of four has loss of feeling in the feet; and three out of four have abnormal postural balance testing. • <b>Sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> increase with age: Vision and hearing impairments each double, and loss of feeling in the feet increases by 40 % in persons aged 80 years and over compared with persons aged 70 – 79 years. • One in five Americans below the poverty threshold has impaired vision: 50 % higher than other Americans. Balance problems are also common among the poor. • Over one-half of those with impaired vision could improve their eyesight by using glasses or by getting a corrected prescription. For those with hearing problems, 72 % might benefit from a hearing aid but do not use one. <b>Sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> such as problems with vision, hearing, postural balance, or loss of feeling in the feet, are known to increase with age. The prevalence of <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> will increase as U. S. life expectancy increases. Important public health goals for older adults include maintaining independent living, health, and quality of life (1).

50|$|Median and {{posterior}} tibial SEPs {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} clinical settings. They can detect, localize and quantify focal interruptions along the somatosensory pathways, which may be due to any number of focal neurological problems, including trauma, compression, multiple sclerosis, tumor or other focal lesions. SEPs are also sensitive to cortical attenuation due to diffuse central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This is seen in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic problems such as vitamin B12 deficiency. When a patient suffers from <b>sensory</b> <b>impairment,</b> and when the clinical localization of the <b>sensory</b> <b>impairment</b> is unclear, SEPs can be helpful in distinguishing whether the <b>sensory</b> <b>impairment</b> is due to CNS problems as opposed to peripheral nervous system problems. Median nerve SEP is also helpful in predicting neurological sequelae following cardiac arrest: if the cortical N20 and subsequent components are completely absent 24 hours or more after the cardiac arrest, essentially all of the patients go on to die or have vegetative neurological sequelae.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which <b>sensory</b> <b>{{impairments}}</b> in the foot, ankle and lower limb persist into the chronic phase of stroke is unclear. Furthermore, the {{extent to which}} these impairments influence walking, balance and falls is not well understood. This thesis investigated the prevalence, functional importance and measurement of lower limb somatosensory impairments in ambulatory people with chronic stroke. Methods This thesis comprised three studies: the first, a qualitative investigation, explored the views and experiences of people with chronic stroke (n= 13). This led to the second study: a cross sectional observational study in which the prevalence, distribution and functional relevance of lower limb <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> were investigated in chronic stroke participants (n= 180) and healthy controls (n= 46). The final study, informed by the findings from the first two studies, a “synthesis” review of current sensory measures and patient and carer involvement, developed and evaluated three novel, functionally oriented measures of lower limb somatosensory discrimination in chronic stroke (n= 32) and healthy controls (n= 32). Results People with stroke felt problems with foot, ankle and lower limb sensation affected their walking, balance and contributed to falls. Furthermore, <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> in the lower limb are prevalent with up to 59 % of chronic stroke survivors having a deficit of one or more somatosensory modality. Despite this, weak associations between traditional measures of tactile and proprioceptive sensation and walking, balance and falls were demonstrated. Novel, functionally oriented measures of tactile and proprioceptive discrimination were developed and evaluated. These measures were reliable and valid, showing greater sensitivity to predicting the presence of <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> and had stronger associations with functional measures than traditional sensory tests. Conclusions This thesis has provided a comprehensive picture of lower limb somatosensory dysfunction in chronic stroke survivors. <b>Sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> persist into the chronic phase of stroke in the majority of stroke survivors. The extent to which such impairments influence functional ability warrants further investigation. The use of functionally oriented measures that assess higher-level somatosensation is encouraged.

50|$|Sensory-specific satiety varies {{depending}} on age, with the elderly experiencing decreased sensory-specific satiety and adolescents experiencing more. In a study focusing on age in sensory-specific satiety, {{it was hypothesized that}} the degree of sensory-specific satiety is affected by age due to the slow sensory loss that accompanies elderly people. By hypothesis, due to the <b>sensory</b> <b>impairment,</b> a natural, more monotonous diet would occur just due to lack of pleasantness from variety of foods. However, it was proven that <b>sensory</b> <b>impairment</b> did not greatly affect the decline in sensory-specific satiety; instead, there is an unclear cognitive process that relates to decline in sensory-specific satiety that just may be the decreased desire for overall change in the elderly as compared to adolescents.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain the {{calendar}} systems and their role in teaching deaf-blind children. Deaf-blind persons belong to a group of multiple disabled persons. This disability should not be observed as a simple composite of visual and hearing impairments, but as a combination of <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> that require special assistance in the development, communication and training for independent living. In our environment, deaf-blind children are being educated in schools for children with visual impairments or in schools for children with hearing impairments (in accordance with the primary impairment). However, deaf-blind children cannot be trained by means of special programs for children with hearing impairment, visual impairment or other programs for students with developmental disabilities without specific attention required by such a combination of <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments.</b> Deaf-blindness must be observed as a multiple impairment that requires special work methods, especially in the field of communication, whose development is severely compromised. Communication skills in deaf-blind people can be developed by using the calendar systems. They are designed in such a manner that they can be easily attainable to children with various <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments.</b> Calendars can be used to encourage and develop communication between adult persons and a deaf-blind child...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the relationship of disability (activities of daily living [ADL] and instrumental ADL [IADL]), self-rated health (SRH), and 6 -year mortality with co-existing impairments in vision (self-rated), hearing (self-rated), and/or cognition (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) in older adults. Method: The study sample comprised of 3, 871 participants from the North Carolina Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly study (NC EPESE). Results: Persons with all three impairments had increased odds of ADL/IADL disability and low SRH. Participants with combined visual and cognitive impairments had increased odds of mortality. Whereas <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> were associated with poor SRH, cognitive impairment was not unless both <b>sensory</b> <b>impairments</b> were present.
