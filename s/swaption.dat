50|$|The {{participants}} in the <b>swaption</b> market are predominantly large corporations, banks, financial institutions and hedge funds. End users such as corporations and banks typically use swaptions to manage interest rate risk arising from their core business or from their financing arrangements. For example, a corporation wanting protection from rising interest rates might buy a payer <b>swaption.</b> A bank that holds a mortgage portfolio might buy a receiver <b>swaption</b> to protect against lower interest rates {{that might lead to}} early prepayment of the mortgages. A hedge fund believing that interest rates will not rise by more than a certain amount might sell a payer <b>swaption,</b> aiming to make money by collecting the premium. Major investment and commercial banks such as JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America Securities and Citigroup make markets in swaptions in the major currencies, and these banks trade amongst themselves in the <b>swaption</b> interbank market. The market making banks typically manage large portfolios of swaptions that they have written with various counterparties. A significant investment in technology and human capital is required to properly monitor the resulting exposure. <b>Swaption</b> markets exist in most of the major currencies in the world, the largest markets being in U.S. dollars, euro, sterling and Japanese yen.|$|E

40|$|The {{rise and}} fall of US dollar {{interest}} rate volatility: evidence from <b>swaptions</b> 1 Interest rate volatility, as implied by <b>swaptions</b> prices, rose in all major economic areas between 2001 and early 2004. The increase was particularly sharp for US rates and was more sizeable for short-term rates and <b>swaptions</b> with short expiration. Since the spring of 2004, US dollar volatilities have declined to the values recorded for euro rates and their term structure has flattened. The {{rise and fall}} of US dollar implied volatility reflected changes both in expectations of realised volatility and in the compensation for volatility risk. JEL classification: G 120, G 130, G 140. The volatility of US dollar interest rates, as implied by the price of <b>swaptions,</b> increased substantially between 2001 and early 2004. The rise was much more marked than for euro rates, and increased especially for short-term rates and over short horizons, ie for <b>swaptions</b> with time-to-expiration of six months or less. However, both the higher average volatility of US rates and the relativ...|$|R
5000|$|Swaps are {{contracts}} to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date {{based on the}} underlying value of currencies exchange rates, bonds/interest rates, commodities exchange, stocks or other assets. Another term which is commonly associated with swap is <b>swaption,</b> a term for what is basically an option on the forward swap. Similar to call and put options, swaptions are of two kinds: receiver and payer. In {{the case of a}} receiver <b>swaption</b> there is an option wherein one can receive fixed and pay floating; {{in the case of a}} payer <b>swaption</b> one has the option to pay fixed and receive floating.|$|E

40|$|I {{develop an}} {{interest}} rate model with separate factors driving innovations in bond yields and their covariances. It features a flexible and tractable affine structure for bond covariances. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model with panel data on <b>swaptions</b> and discount bonds implies pricing errors for <b>swaptions</b> that are almost always lower {{than half of the}} bid-ask spread. Furthermore, market prices of interest rate caps do not deviate significantly from their no-arbitrage values implied by the <b>swaptions</b> under the model.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the non-arbitrage (fair) pricing of {{interest}} rate derivatives, in particular caplets and <b>swaptions</b> using the LIBOR market model (LMM) developed by Brace, Gatarek, and Musiela (1997) and Swap market model (SMM) developed Jamshidan (1997), respectively. Today, in most financial markets, interest rate derivatives are priced using the renowned Black-Scholes formula developed by Black and Scholes (1973). We present new pricing models for caplets and <b>swaptions,</b> which can be implemented in the financial market other than the Black-Scholes model. We theoretically construct these "new market models" and then test their practical aspects. We show that {{the dynamics of the}} LMM imply a pricing formula for caplets that has the same structure as the Black-Scholes pricing formula for a caplet that is used by market practitioners. For the SMM we also theoretically construct an arbitrage-free interest rate model that implies a pricing formula for <b>swaptions</b> that has the same structure as the Black-Scholes pricing formula for <b>swaptions.</b> We empirically compare the pricing performance of the LMM against the Black-Scholes for pricing caplets using Monte Carlo methods. ...|$|R

50|$|The fugit is the {{expected}} time to exercise an American or Bermudan option.

In addition we derive a new closed-form solution for Credit Default <b>Swaptions</b> which allows for time-dependent volatility and abitrary correlation structure of default intensities. ...|$|R
50|$|However, valuing vanilla {{instruments}} such as {{caps and}} <b>swaptions</b> is useful primarily for calibration. The real {{use of the}} model is to value somewhat more exotic derivatives such as bermudan <b>swaptions</b> on a lattice, or other derivatives in a multi-currency context such as Quanto Constant Maturity Swaps, as explained for example in Brigo and Mercurio (2001). The efficient and exact Monte-Carlo simulation of the Hull-White model with time dependent parameters can be easily performed, see Ostrovski (2013) and (2016).|$|R

Numerical results on pricing accuracy are presented, which strongly support the approximations made in deriving the formula.

50|$|Because {{interest}} rate caps/floors are equivalent to bond puts and calls respectively, the above analysis shows that caps and floors can be priced analytically in the Hull-White model. Jamshidian's trick applies to Hull-White (as today's {{value of a}} <b>swaption</b> in HW is a monotonic function of today's short rate). Thus knowing how to price caps is also sufficient for pricing swaptions.|$|E

50|$|Exotic {{is usually}} {{used to define}} a feature that is an {{extension}} to a IRD type.

Typically this would be referred to as a bespoke IRS (or customised IRS). Bermudan swaptions are examples of <b>swaption</b> extensions that qualify as exotic variants. Other products that are generally classed as exotics are;power reverse dual currency note (PRDC or Turbo), target redemption note (TARN), CMS steepener http://www.risk.net/asia-risk/feature/1496874/rate-steepeners-rise, Snowball (finance), Inverse floater, Strips of Collateralized mortgage obligation, Ratchet caps and floors, and Cross currency swaptions.|$|E
40|$|In this work, pricing {{models of}} {{corporate}} coupon-bonds and credit default <b>swaptions</b> are derivedand analyzed. Corporate coupon-bonds are priced incorporating both intensity models and structural models, and also jumps introduced by seasonal effects. In deriving the models, we form portfolios to hedge the risk incurred by the instruments, then derive PDE equations using the arbitrage principle and the Ito Lemma for jump processes. The mathematical models are the parabolic-type PDE equations with terminal conditions and boundary conditions. These PDE problems are analyzed and solved by various transformations and incorporation with probabilistic properties. Either a unique solution in the exponential form is obtained, {{or a particular}} solution in the separation formis acquired. Further, the pricing model of credit default <b>swaptions</b> is derived using the pricing of corporate coupon-bonds in the similar manner. The main idea of deriving the price of credit default <b>swaptions</b> {{is to use the}} price of existing products, i. e., corporate bonds, as opposed to the existing models, which use non-existing forward credit default swap price of the reference entity.
