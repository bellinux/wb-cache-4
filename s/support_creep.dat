40|$|High {{temperature}} creep {{is often}} dealt with simplified models {{to assess and}} predict the future behavior of materials and components. Also, for most applications the creep properties of interest require costly long-term testing that limits the available data to support design and life assessment. Such test data sets are even smaller for welded joints that are often the weakest links of structures. It is of considerable interest {{to be able to}} reliably predict and extrapolate long term creep behavior from relatively small sets of <b>supporting</b> <b>creep</b> data. For creep strain, the current tools for model verification and quality assurance are very limited. The ECCC PATs can be adapted to some degree but the uncertainty and applicability of many models are still questionable outside the range of data. In this thesis tools for improving the model robustness have been developed. The toolkit includes creep rupture, weld strength and creep strain modeling improvements for uniaxial prediction. The applicability is shown on data set consisting of a selection of common high temperature steels and the oxygen-free phosphorous doped (OFP) copper. The steels assessed are 10 CrMo 9 - 10 (P 22), 7 CrWVMoNb 9 - 6 (P 23), 7 CrMoVTiB 10 - 10 (P 24), 14 MoV 6 - 3 (0. 5 CMV), X 20 CrMoV 11 - 1 (X 20), X 10 CrMoVNb 9 - 1 (P 91) and X 11 CrMoWVNb 9 - 1 - 1 (E 911). The work described in this thesis has provided simple yet well performing tools to predict creep strain and life for material evaluation, component design and life assessment purposes. The uncertainty related to selecting the type of material model or determining weld strength factors has been reduced by the selection procedures and by linking the weld behavior to the base material master equation. Much of the resulting improvements and benefits are related to the reduced requirements for <b>supporting</b> <b>creep</b> data.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>support</b> {{material}} <b>creep</b> on failure of ceramic {{thermal barrier coating}} (TBC) was studied. A simplified cylindrical model TBC-system was used: Instead of Ni-superalloy and bond coat (BC) the substrates consisted of a Fe–Cr–Al–Y-alloy with BC-like chemical composition, namely Fecralloy with low creep strength and oxide dispersoid strengthened PM 2000 Fe–Cr–Al–Y samples. After sandblasting the substrates surface, yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings were applied by air plasma spraying. Slices were extracted from the cylindrical specimens and the lateral slice-surfaces were polished. Then they were thermally cycled to assess the effect of <b>support</b> material <b>creep</b> on delamination induced TBC failure. The damage evolution was examined at the lateral slice cross-sectional surface after different numbers of thermal cycles. The study shows a significant delay and deceleration of delamination crack growth for the low creep strength Fecralloy, in contrast to observations made for the high creep strength substrate material. The experimental results indicate that stresses which promote delamination failure are partially relaxed by creep deformation in the near interface regions, which {{appear to be more}} pronounced for support materials with low creep strength...|$|R

40|$|Different {{approaches}} for modelling creep–fatigue (CF) interaction are used on strain controlled creep fatigue data of 9 Cr– 1 Mo-VNb (P 91) steel and assessed with {{the target of}} finding suitable candidates for use in design rules. The assessed models include time, ductility, and strain energy-based creep-fatigue interaction methods and two simplified models. For the interaction diagrambased models, the challenge of acquiring representative creep damage fractions from the dynamic material response, i. e., cyclic softening with changing relaxation behaviour is addressed. In addition, the interaction diagram approaches {{are discussed in the}} light of known (fatigue) material scatter and defining representative cycles for CF data. The performance of the model are presented and also compared against the RCC–MR design code methodology. It is shown that the fitting accuracy of the complex interaction models vary significantly and that modified ductility based models seem to be less susceptible to changes in <b>supporting</b> <b>creep</b> and relaxation models. Successful and also superior prediction of the CF number of cycles to failure for Grade 91 steel was accomplished by simplified methods with much less fitting parameters.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that all creep data in metals {{ascribed}} to the Nabarro-Herring (N-H) diffusional creep mechanism cannot in fact be definitively described by the N-H creep theory. Rather, the creep mechanism is associated with either Harper-Dorn (H-D) dislocation creep or grain boundary sliding (GBS). Specific responses are presented to work by Fiala and Langdon (F-L) who have presented opposing views to the above conclusions. Creep data for copper used by F-L to <b>support</b> N-H <b>creep</b> are shown to be incompatible with the theory, since the experimental creep rates are about three orders of magnitude higher than predicted.

Topramezone-induced injury to creeping bentgrass increased from 22 % when applied alone to 79 and 41 % when applied with malathion or ABT, respectively.

The research project has been prompted by an investigation into creep, and ultimately, gross sliding, of rubber tyres fitted around steel wheels in earth moving equipment. In general, slippage between tyre and rim is experienced in common engineering applications employing tyred systems. A general and systematic approach for investigating the interfacial behaviour of tyred systems has consequently been proposed. Classical techniques together with novel numerical approaches based on advanced mathematical programming have been implemented to <b>support</b> the investigation. <b>Creep</b> between mating surfaces, frictional shakedown and measuring friction in partial slip condition are the main objects of investigation. The analytical and numerical models developed by the author have been complemented by experimental work, whose detailed description is also included in this thesis. Finally, further studies have been performed to shed light on some of the design issues offered by the threedimensional full-scale engineering application. The numerical approach based on finite element modelling used to tackle these aspects of the project and the experimental work carried out by the author to corroborate the numerical findings are also presented.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a fogou is no longer known. Their central {{location}} in settlements and the work that evidently went into constructing them is indicative of their importance to the community. It has been conjectured that they were used for religious purposes, as refuges, or for food storage. Many are oriented south-west-north-east, facing the prevailing wind. Their use as refuge during raiding trips was first suggested by Darvill in his book 'Prehistoric Britain' (London: Batsford. 1987, page 177). An argument was put forward by Kenneth L MacGregor; was that they mainly served as refuges since food storage is impractical due to the damp conditions and ritual use is unlikely because the Celtic Druid tradition focused more on the living world. Both documentary and archaeological evidence support their use as refuges. Nancy Edwards wrote that [...] "evidence would <b>support</b> this: <b>creeps,</b> hidden chambers and sally-ports, {{as well as the}} fact that most sonterrains were invisible above ground, would all have helped to provide protection in the case of sudden attack. They could, however, turn into death-traps if the aggression was prolonged." [...] Where they were open at both ends, a fogou could provide ideal conditions for food storage, especially the drying of meat or storage of dairy products such as milk, butter and cheese where natural moulds would assist in preservation of perishable foodstuffs. Ashpits found at Trewardreva and in the circular side-chamber at Carn Euny were probably for preserving gulls' eggs, as was done on Saint Kilda in Scotland. A layer of black greasy mould with charcoal, animals and bird bones at Treveneague is also very suggestive of food storage. Diodorus Siculus stated that Iron Age people in Britain stored their grain in [...] "underground repositories", adding contemporary evidence [...] to the speculation that they were mainly used for food storage. Excavated examples at Halliggye, Carn Euny and Boden suggest fogous may have been deliberately filled after use or upon abandonment of the associated settlements.|$|R

On this basis, a model which considers a change of the dislocation density/ velocity due to the presence of the Mg atoms in solid solution and the solute drag and climb forces for dislocation motion was assumed. The new model, which also takes into account published data of the dislocation density measured at different applied stress, describes naturally the curvature of experimental Al-Mg creep data, associated traditionally with the change in deformation mechanism from dislocation glide controlled (n = 3) to dislocation climb controlled (n = 3) mechanism. The model does not undermine the relevance of aluminum self diffusion for dislocation climb process (vacancy diffusion) as the creep controlling mechanism in this solid solution alloy.

The Armistice of Mudros, signed at the end of October, ended hostilities with the Ottoman Empire when fighting was continuing north of Aleppo.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Twenty eight Ossimi male lambs, with {{an average}} live body weight 4. 75 kg and 7 days age were {{randomly}} assigned to two feeding groups each of 14 animals to study the effect of pre-weaning diet on lamb's rumen development. Both the two groups suckled their dams until being weaned at 12 weeks of age (natural weaning). The first group depended completely on dam's milk as a solely available feed (control), while the other was supported by a starter ration which found the nutritive value to be 19. 1 % CP (14. 5 % DCP) and 81. 0 TDN, besides dam's milk. Supporting natural weaned lambs with creep feeding at an earlier age influenced (p> 0. 05) length of the alimentary canal, however different intestinal segments maintained to keep constant ratios. The small intestine represented the major length (about 80 % of the total length). <b>Supporting</b> lambs with <b>creep</b> feeding rations led also to higher volume displacement. However, different stomach compartments maintained to keep constant volumes. As shown the rumeno-reticulum indicated the higher volume capacity (nearly 80 - 84 %). Natural weaned lambs, depended solely on rearing milk, had higher (p> 0. 05) abomasum volume in comparison with the creep-feeding one. On contrast creep fed group tended to have higher (p> 0. 05) rumino-reticulum volume capacity. Supporting rearing lambs with creep feeding at an earlier age (2 wks) improved (p> 0. 05) ruminal papillary, being longer with more surface area in comparison with the solely feeding milk group. Key words: Pre-weaning Starter Lamb's Rumen Developmen...|$|R
5|$|On 19 September, the XXI Corps {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin had, with the <b>support</b> of a <b>creeping</b> barrage, broken through the Ottoman front line during the Battle of Sharon. In the afternoon the XX Corps {{commanded by}} Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode was then ordered to begin its own attack, supported by an artillery barrage. These attacks {{by both the}} XX and XXI Corps continued until midday on 21 September, when a successful flanking attack by the XXI Corps, combined with the XX Corps assault, forced the Seventh and Eighth Armies to disengage. The Seventh Army commanded by the Ottoman Army Ferik or Birinci Ferik, Mustafa Kemal retreated from the Nablus area towards the Jordan River, crossing at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge before the rearguard at Nablus was captured. The Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel advanced through the gap created by the XXI Corps infantry during the morning of 19 September to almost encircle the Ottoman forces fighting in the Judean Hills, capturing Nazareth, Haifa, Afulah and Beisan, Jenin and Samakh before advancing to Tiberias. During this time, Chaytor's Force commanded by Major General Edward Chaytor captured part of the retreating Ottoman and German column at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge to cut off this line of retreat across the Jordan River. To {{the east of the}} river, as the Fourth Army began its retreat, Chaytor's Force advanced to capture Es Salt on 23 September. Amman was captured on 25 September during the Second Battle of Amman where a strong Fourth Army rearguard was defeated on 25 September.|$|R
