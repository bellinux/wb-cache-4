40|$|To {{systematically}} {{study the}} mechanical {{properties of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> for tunnels of the passenger dedicated lines(PDL), in-site monitoring is {{used to measure the}} contact pressures between the primary lining and the <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> for some typical tunnels of different Lines, such as Guiguang Line, Lanyu Line and Jinghu Line. According to the research, the contact pressure reaches its maximum value at the moment when the tunnel lining trolley is removed. The load acting on <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> is the actual deformation pressure, which is totally different from the loose pressure prescribed in Chinese tunnel criteria. The safety factor for <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> under the measured load is higher than that under the criteria load and satisfies the safety requirements. It is therefore possible for the primary lining to sustain the entire surrounding rock pressure with the help of necessary auxiliary method and suitable installation time. The result given in this research enhances our understanding towards the mechanical characteristics of <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> for the PDL tunnel and it will be helpful for <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> design.

During tunnel construction process, heavy rain cause a landslide failure of tunnel (Located in DK 51 + 175 - DK 51 + 195). The mainly collapsed area is located in the position of DK 51 + 180. According to collapsing, we executed the settlement observation, cross-section deformation detection and upper crack observation. When collapse settlement is basically stable, the collapse is segmented to settle.

40|$|Spray-applied {{membranes}} for waterproofing of {{sprayed concrete}} tunnels {{have led to}} the possibility of shear transfer between primary and secondary linings through the membrane interface, with potential for reducing overall lining thickness. Laboratory tests have shown a reasonable degree of composite action in beam specimens. In this paper, a numerical model previously calibrated against such tests is applied to a whole tunnel, considering soil-structure interaction and staged lining construction. The model shows composite action and load sharing between the lining layers is expected in the tunnel as in the beams. Parametric studies over the practical range of interface stiffnesses show that composite action is maintained, although at high interface stiffness too much bending may be attracted to the <b>secondary</b> <b>lining,</b> requiring additional reinforcement. An efficient composite shell design with minimal additional reinforcement is achievable if the <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> thickness is reduced from current practice. Robustness of the system measured in terms of the interface’s ability to transfer stress under unequal loading, causing distortion on the tunnel, is found to be generally adequate. However, adjacent construction in close proximity may give insufficient margin on membrane tensile debonding, especially if membrane conditions are partially or fully saturated. ...|$|E
