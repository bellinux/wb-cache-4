5|$|Mr. Burns asks Homer to {{help him}} with a <b>speech</b> <b>for</b> a crisis {{shareholders}} meeting. Homer gives Smithers his last joint, and while Smithers is smoking it, Burns apparently drowns in his bathtub. For the meeting, Smithers and Homer make Mr. Burns into a marionette, and the movement of the marionette inadvertently gets Mr. Burns' heart working again. The meeting is a success, and another financial crisis at the power plant is avoided.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court has {{determined}} that the First Amendment also protects citizens from being compelled to say or pay for certain <b>speech.</b> <b>For</b> example, in West Virginia State Board of Education v.

5|$|The term {{is mostly}} used in {{historical}} contexts {{and not in}} daily speech. In Danish, Skånelandene is used more often. The terms have no political implications as the region is not a geopolitical entity but a cultural region, without officially established political borders.

5|$|By 1604, when Charles {{was three}} and a half, {{he was able to}} walk the length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance, and it was decided that he was strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family. In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend {{most of the rest of}} his life. In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier Sir Robert Carey, who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help {{strengthen}} his weak ankles.

Also that year, Sprigg received his party's nomination and unsuccessfully ran for election to the Maryland House of Delegates. In September 1908, Sprigg gave an introductory <b>speech</b> <b>for</b> William Jennings Bryan, who visited Cumberland on his Chautauqua circuit. In May 1908, the Cumberland city council appointed Sprigg as the city attorney, in which post he served during the mayoral administration of George A. Kean.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} member of Institut International de la Paix in 1913. He was a {{consultant}} for the Norwegian Nobel Institute from 1904 to 1913, with the task of examining proposed candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize. From 1918 to 1942 he served on the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In 1931, he gave the Award Ceremony <b>Speech</b> <b>for</b> the Nobelists Jane Addams and Nicholas Murray Butler, but was absent in the decisive meeting in 1936 that awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Carl von Ossietzky. He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940, but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957 (early in {{his second}} year of law school), Kennedy met Joan Bennett at Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York, {{following}} a dedication <b>speech</b> <b>for</b> a gymnasium that his family had donated at the campus. Bennett was a senior there, had worked as a model and won beauty contests, but she was unfamiliar with the world of politics. After the couple became engaged, she grew nervous about marrying someone she did not know that well, but Joe Kennedy insisted that the wedding should proceed. The couple was married by Cardinal Francis Spellman on November 29, 1958, at St. Joseph's Church in Bronxville, New York, with the reception being held at the nearby Siwanoy Country Club. Together, Ted and Joan had three children: Kara (1960–2011), Ted Jr. (b. 1961) and Patrick (b.1967). By the 1970s, the marriage was in trouble due to Ted's womanizing and Joan's growing alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|In September 1949, Mirta {{gave birth}} to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat. Castro {{continued}} to put himself at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the Partido Ortodoxo. The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. Castro volunteered to deliver a <b>speech</b> <b>for</b> the Movement on November 13, exposing the government's secret deals with the gangs and identifying key members. Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered the gangs, and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 2006, GMG Radio {{announced}} that it was requesting a change of format for 102.2 and 100.4 Smooth FM from Ofcom, to remove the stations' daytime soul and R licence commitments. GMG Radio proposed an easy listening music service mixed with <b>speech</b> <b>for</b> the over 50s, and an improved local news service. Ofcom approved the changes on 8 December 2006, with the condition that GMG retained the 45 hours of jazz per week that constituted part of the former licence requirement. As a result of the format change and to distance the station from its London rivals Magic and Heart 106.2, GMG Radio agreed that a minimum of 20% of its daytime music output would be over 40 years old.|$|E
5|$|Peng did {{not oppose}} Mao's collectivizations {{in the first}} phase of the Great Leap, from late 1957– early 1958, but he {{increasingly}} opposed it from spring-winter 1958, as the problems which Mao's policies had caused became more evident. In February 1958 Peng gave a <b>speech</b> <b>for</b> the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, in which he suggested increased military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao opposed this suggestion, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng for the position of Defense Minister. As part of the Great Leap Forward, Mao ordered the formation of a national militia that was controlled by Party members and independent of the PLA, eventually training and arming tens of millions of civilians.|$|E

5|$|Reverting to the pre-Roosevelt custom that presidents seeking {{re-election}} did not campaign, Taft spoke publicly only once, {{making his}} nomination acceptance speech on August 1. He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded {{he could not}} win, and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt. The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight, but had no illusions he would win his race. He had hoped to send his cabinet officers {{out on the campaign}} trail, but found them reluctant to go. Senator Root agreed to give a single <b>speech</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|E

Hank then kills Lou's wife with Lou's shotgun when she appears with another gun.

When the CNBC moderator commented that Carson was on Mannatech's website, Carson replied that he had not given his permission. Earlier, he had said that he was unaware of the company's legal history.|$|R
