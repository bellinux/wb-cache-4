50|$|The {{design of}} a manual <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> is {{generally}} determined by whether the soap comes in liquid, powder, or foam form.|$|E
50|$|Automatic <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> (also {{known as}} {{touchless}} or no-touch <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers)</b> dispense a controlled amount of soap solution (or a similar liquid {{such as a}} hand sanitizer). They are often {{used in conjunction with}} automatic faucets in public restrooms. They function to conserve the amount of soap used and stem infectious disease transmission.|$|R

50|$|When soap is {{dispensed}} {{in liquid}} form, {{it is generally}} in a squeeze bottle or pump. The most popular <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> of this type are plastic pump bottles, {{many of which are}} disposable.|$|R
5000|$|Piston pumps {{displacement}} pumps - usually simple devices for pumping {{small amounts of}} liquid or gel manually. The common hand <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> is such a pump.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> {{is specifically}} a hands-free dispenser of soap (both liquid soap and foaming soap), but generally {{can be used}} for other liquids such as hand sanitizers, shampoos, or hand lotions. Automatic dispensers are often battery-powered. The touch-free design dispenses the liquid when a sensor detects motion under the nozzle. The electronic components of an automatic <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> allow for a timing device or signal (sound, lights, etc.) which can indicate to the user whether they have washed their hands for the correct amount of time or not.|$|E
50|$|A <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> is {{a device}} that, when {{manipulated}} or triggered appropriately, dispenses soap (usually in small, single-use quantities). It can be manually operated {{by means of}} a handle, or can be automatic. Soap dispensers are often found in public toilets.|$|E
50|$|Foam <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> have {{dual pumps}} that when used move both air and soap, injecting both {{together}} through small openings {{to create a}} lather. They {{can be found in}} both manual and automatic varieties.|$|R
50|$|William Shepphard {{patented}} {{liquid soap}} on August 22, 1865. Minnetonka Corporation introduced {{the first modern}} liquid soap and cornered the market by buying up the entire supply of the plastic pumps needed for the liquid <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of manual foam <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> have the <b>soap</b> in a bladder in the dispenser in liquid form, as the pump is pressed the liquid soap is pushed {{through a small}} foaming nozzle which foams the soap.|$|R
50|$|His home {{includes}} {{many of his}} creations including a drivable motorized easy chair, a <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> that is a retractable hand {{that comes out of}} the wall on demand, dressers that slide away to reveal a hallway to another room and a ski slope from the roof.|$|E
50|$|GOJO {{invented a}} liquid <b>soap</b> <b>{{dispense}}r</b> in 1950 to dispense their product in limited quantities after realizing that users were using {{much more than}} was needed to clean their hands, hence causing buyers to think the product was too expensive. Jerry Lipmann filed a patent for this portion-limiting dispenser in 1952.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 Suggs's girlfriend Candace Williams filed a {{complaint}} against Suggs alleging he threw a <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> at her head, struck her in the chest with his hand and held a bottle of bleach over her and their 1-year-old son. No criminal charges were filed against Suggs, and Williams' subsequent lawsuit was dismissed.|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} offers sensor-activated flushometers and other {{plumbing}} fixtures, including water-efficient electronic faucets, solid-surface lavatory systems, stainless-steel scrub sinks and wash stations, and bedpan washer flushometers. Other restroom fixtures include sensor-activated hand dryers, low-flow showerheads, networked water-control systems, and electronic <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Manual <b>{{dispensers}}</b> of foam <b>soap</b> often {{consist of}} a large button which squeezes the foam out of a tube. Many liquid <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> operate in this way as well. A few dispensers operate with a lever that pulls forward and squeezes the soap out.|$|R
40|$|Hand hygiene {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} measures to prevent transmission of infectious agents and plays a major role in prevention of infection in any type of healthcare setting. While requirements for the efficacy of hand disinfectants are defined in European testing norms such as the EN 1500 for hygienic hand disinfection or EN 12791 for surgical hand preparation, no specific recommendations for hand rub <b>dispensers</b> and liquid <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> have been given yet. Therefore, the intention of the present recommendation on soap and hand rub dispensers in healthcare facilities is to close this gap and to enhance future improvement of dispenser functionality and design. Regardless of manufacture and design of a hand rub or liquid <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> the following requirements shall be met in healthcare facilities...|$|R
50|$|A {{soap dish}} holds {{a bar of}} soap when not in use for hand washing or other cleaning, near a washing area such as a bathtub or washbasin. Soap dishes are made from {{waterproof}} materials such as plastic, ceramic and metal. Soap dishes may be mounted on the wall. For liquid soap or foam soap a <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> may be used in place of a soap dish.|$|E
50|$|The {{pipeline}} and all {{milk handling}} systems are cleaned after every milking session using a washing system that first rinses out the remaining milk and then flushes cleaning solution through the piping to kill bacteria and remove milkstone, {{a layer of}} scale mainly formed by cations like calcium and magnesium. The entire washing mechanism is operated {{very much like a}} household dishwasher with an automatic fill system, <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser,</b> and automatic drain opener.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the possibilities in designing an artefact that will motivate {{high school students}} to wash their hands. The behavioural ideology called libertarian paternalism introduced in the book Nudge, will be the consistent theory throughout the design process. The theory originate from a wish that people should be better at making good decisions for themselves. A range of moral issues appear within this theory. Those will be discussed and result in a moral goal for the design in our project. With this theory in mind we came up with a concept containing music playing <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers.</b> The concept is that these <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> play music every time theyâ€™re used. The installation has been tested at Zahles high school where data have been collected and analyzed through observation and technological registration. We conclude that the design have increased the students interest in handwash...|$|R
5000|$|The central {{table in}} the Tejas Express also has {{infotainment}} screens. Equipped with <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers,</b> touch-less water taps, odour-control systems and occupancy indicators, the toilets in Tejas Express have been designed with modern standards in mind. In line with Indian Railways vision to make tracks defecation free, Indian Railways has installed bio-vacuum toilets in Tejas Express.|$|R
40|$|Black fungi {{reported}} as degraders of volatile aromatic compounds were isolated from hydrocarbon-polluted sites and indoor environments. Several {{of the species}} encountered are known opportunistic pathogens or {{are closely related to}} pathogenic species causing severe mycoses, among which are neurological infections in immunocompetent individuals. Given the scale of the problem of environmental pollution and the phylogenetic relation of aromate-degrading black fungi with pathogenic siblings, it is of great interest to select strains able to mineralize these substrates efficiently without any risk for public health. Fifty-six black strains were obtained from human-made environments rich in hydrocarbons (gasoline car tanks, washing machine <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers)</b> after enrichment with some phenolic intermediates of toluene and styrene fungal metabolism. Based on ITS sequencing identification, the majority of the obtained isolates were members of the genus Exophiala. Exophiala xenobiotica was found to be the dominant black yeast present in the car gasoline tanks. A higher biodiversity, with three Exophiala species, was found in <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> of washing machines. Strains obtained were screened using a 2, 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) assay, optimized for black fungi, to assess their potential ability to degrade toluene. Seven out of twenty strains tested were able to use toluene as carbon source...|$|R
50|$|The {{advancement}} of the automatic <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> further creates an even more sterile environment. When various individuals use the pump, they will leave behind a variety of bacterial colonies. These colonies will interbreed and {{lead to a more}} resistant strain of bacteria that can re-contaminate different hands and would not be completely eliminated by the anti-bacterial soap. Wider spectra or higher levels of resistance, in the colonies that are present, are due to interaction and/or complementation between the resistance genes. Without having a wide variety of individuals touching the pump, bacterial transmission will be eliminated.|$|E
50|$|A sink â€” {{also known}} by other names {{including}} sinker, washbowl, hand basin and wash basin â€” is a bowl-shaped plumbing fixture used for washing hands, dishwashing, and other purposes. Sinks have taps (faucets) that supply {{hot and cold}} water and may include a spray feature {{to be used for}} faster rinsing. They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself include a strainer and/or shut-off device and an overflow-prevention device. Sinks may also have an integrated <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser.</b> Many sinks, especially in kitchens, are installed adjacent to or inside a counter.|$|E
5000|$|The Lano soap bar was {{introduced}} in 1934, and is today dominant soap bar in the Norwegian market. In 1959, Lano introduced Lano-ungen, or [...] "the Lano-kid", a competition where one entered {{a picture of a}} child which could then be picked out to represent the soap for the whole coming year, as well as receive various prizes. Lano liquid hand soap was launched in 1989, with a compact <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> being introduced in 1993. Around the turn of the millennium, Lano introduced a liquid shower gel, packed in a special container with a plastic hook for easy hanging inside a shower enclosure.|$|E
5000|$|Stainless steel {{laboratory}} drying rack, {{which is}} also known as a 'Mod-Rack' pegboard, is the drying rack made of stainless steel that uses to drain laboratory accessories. The examples of stainless steel laboratory drying rack are flask holders, <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers,</b> paper towel dispensers, glove box holders, drain shelves. [...] Stainless steel pegboard installation is very easy and quick to set up with basic hand equipment's, and it does not damage the wall as mounting brackets and hardware are being used.|$|R
50|$|Aloft Hotels {{strive for}} a lowered {{environmental}} impact. An {{example is the}} Aloft Milwaukee Downtown, where outdoor landscaping was done {{to try to give}} a fresh, green image {{on the outside of the}} hotel. On the inside, engineers used natural wood treatments and materials such as cork to reduce negative effects on the environment. Guest rooms have <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> in the shower instead of bottles, and the option to keep towels for multiple uses. Parking spots are designated specifically for hybrid vehicles, encouraging guests to make environmentally responsible choices.|$|R

[...] Among the alleged corruption and defrauding of the games budget, toilet paper rolls valued at $2 were costed at $80, $2 <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> at $60, $98 mirrors at $220, $11,830 altitude training simulators at $250,190.|$|R
5000|$|The filth, poverty, {{disease that}} {{permeated}} nineteenth centuryâ€™s society was drastically reduced by revolutionary sanitation movements throughout the twentieth century. Although several other advances... can be etiologically and temporally related {{to some of}} these diseases, the causal evidence (e.g., temporal sequence, consistency, biologic plausibility) is consistent with the hypothesis that personal hygiene is one other factor that helped to determine the decline.The advances of hygiene, such as that of the automatic <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser,</b> can be considered as one of the more silent victories of public health and continues to be an important disease prevention strategy, even in this [...] "modern" [...] era when the [...] "gospel of germs" [...] has waned in popularity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coaches are}} {{equipped}} with [...] "controlled discharge toilet system" [...] (CDTS). By the means of this system, a toilet in the coach would become functional only when {{the speed of the}} coach crosses 30 kmph, which is said to help in avoiding the soiling of the track at the railway stations. Later on, CDTS was discarded for an environmental friendly alternative, [...] "Bio-Toilet", designed in collaboration with DRDO. Both eastern (squat) and western styles of toilets are provided. One side of the toilet is provided with a wash basin with water tap and sensor button, a <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser,</b> a mirror, an ash tray and a waste bin. On the other side there is the toilet itself, a water tap with mug, a handhold, the toilet paper holder and the sensor button for the toilet flush. The window in the toilet can be opened in the upper half. The toilet doors are of folding type to use the available space to an optimum.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of August 17, Conger and Bentz were removed from a flight while {{attempting}} {{to leave the country}} and their passports were seized in order to compel testimony about the incident. [...] A judge in Brazil also issued a search and seizure warrant for Lochte and Feigen; Feigen subsequently contacted the authorities, and said he would make a public statement when the matter was settled. Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro concluded that the athletes were not robbed, but instead had been involved in an incident at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca, west of the city. According to statements by the owner on August 18, they broke a <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> in the bathroom, damaged a door, tore down a sign and urinated around the premises. This investigation found that the swimmers stopped at a gas station near Casa FranÃ§a, where security guards detained the swimmers for vandalism perpetrated in a bathroom while intoxicated. [...] Rio's police chief Fernando Veloso stated that the swimmers handed over 100 reais ($31) and $20 in U.S. currency as compensation for objects damaged in the bathroom, such as a soap holder, a mirror, and a [...] "Please Do Not Enter" [...] sign.|$|E
50|$|Sensor-operated {{fixtures}} (faucets, <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers,</b> hand dryers, {{paper towel}} dispensers) {{prevent the spread}} of disease by allowing patrons to circumvent the need to touch common surfaces. Sensor-operated toilets also help conserve water by limiting the amount used per flush, and require less routine maintenance. Each sensor views through a small window into each fixture. Sometimes the metal plates that house the sensor windows are bolted on from behind, to prevent tampering. Additionally, all of the electrical equipment is safely behind the walls, so that there is no danger of electric shock. However, a RCCB must be used for all such electrical equipment.|$|R
