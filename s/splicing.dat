50|$|Special <b>splices</b> (two piece <b>splices)</b> are {{required}} on SD-type conductors as {{the gap between}} the trapezoidal aluminium layer and the steel core prevents the compression force on the <b>splice</b> to the steel core to be adequate. A two-piece design has a <b>splice</b> for the steel core and a longer and larger diameter <b>splice</b> for the aluminium portion. The outer <b>splice</b> must be threaded on first and slid along the conductor and the steel <b>splice</b> compressed first and then the outer <b>splice</b> is slid back over the smaller <b>splice</b> and then compressed. This complicated process can easily result in a poor <b>splice.</b>|$|R
5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; for very long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end is still being transcribed. In eukaryotes, transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase {{is known as the}} primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the <b>splicing</b> of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative <b>splicing</b> mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|PRKACA {{is found}} on {{chromosome}} 19 in humans. There are two well-described transcripts of this gene, arising from alternative <b>splicing</b> events. The most common form, called Cα1, is expressed throughout human tissue. Another transcript, called Cα2, is found primarily in sperm cells and differs from Cα1 {{only in the}} first 15 amino acids.|$|E
5|$|RNA <b>splicing,</b> {{carried out}} by a complex called the spliceosome, is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative <b>splicing,</b> and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.|$|E

5000|$|... long <b>splice</b> - A <b>splice</b> used to join two rope ends forming one rope {{the length}} of the total of the two ropes. The long <b>splice,</b> unlike most <b>splice</b> types, results in a <b>splice</b> that is only very {{slightly}} thicker than the rope without the <b>splice,</b> but sacrifices some of the strength of the short <b>splice.</b> It does this by replacing two of the strands of each rope end with those from the other, and cutting off some of the extra strands that result. The long <b>splice</b> allows the <b>spliced</b> rope to still fit through the same pulleys, which is necessary in some applications.|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} completed {{study in}} the field of concrete block construction by Ahmed and Feldman (2012) indicated that, on average, the reinforcing bars in non-contact lap <b>splices,</b> where the lapped bars are located in adjacent cells, only develop 71 % of the tensile resistance of <b>spliced</b> bars which are in contact. An experimental program was therefore initiated to design and evaluate remedial measures which can potentially increase the tensile resistance of non-contact lap <b>splices</b> to that of contact lap <b>splice</b> of the same lap length. Implementation of the proposed measures in various field situations was also analyzed. Six unique remedial <b>splice</b> details, along with standard contact and unaltered non-contact lap <b>splices</b> were evaluated and compared. The mitigative details included providing additional confinement, installing knock-out webs, placing <b>splice</b> reinforcement between the lapped bars, and combinations of these aforementioned details. Three replicates of each <b>splice</b> detail were constructed for a total of 24 wall <b>splice</b> specimens. Each wall <b>splice</b> specimen was reinforced with No. 15 Grade 400 deformed steel reinforcing bars with 200 mm lap <b>splice</b> lengths at located the midspan. The specimens were tested in a horizontal position under a monotonic, four-point loading geometry. Load and deflection data were collected throughout testing and were subsequently used in an iterative moment-curvature analysis to calculate the maximum tensile resistance of the <b>spliced</b> reinforcement. This was then used to compare the structural performance of each remedial <b>splice</b> detail to the standard contact and non-contact lap <b>splices.</b> The wall <b>splice</b> specimens which contained non-contact lap <b>splices</b> with knock-out webs, s-shaped, and transverse reinforcement in the <b>splice</b> region achieved similar tensile capacities as the wall <b>splice</b> specimens with standard contact lap <b>splices.</b> Industry professionals have indicated that the installation of the remedial measures evaluated in this study would not affect the constructability of masonry assemblages in field situations. The <b>splice</b> detail with knock-out webs confined within the lap <b>splice</b> length was determined to be the most viable procedure as it can be installed to increase the resistance of non-contact lap <b>splices</b> in almost all construction situations. This remedial procedure was able to improve the tensile resistance of the lapped reinforcement by 63 % compared to the wall <b>splice</b> specimens with standard non-contact lap <b>splices...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{compartmentalization}} {{allows the}} cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns {{that must be}} removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The <b>splicing</b> is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.|$|E
5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is replicated {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by <b>splicing.</b> Alternative <b>splicing</b> occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E

5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative <b>splicing</b> of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These <b>splicing</b> events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E

Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E

In comparison with other apolipoproteins, plasma concentration of APOA5 is very low (less than 1 μg/mL). This suggests that it has more catalytic than structural functions, since there is less than one APOA5 molecule per one lipoprotein particle. APOA5 is associated predominantly with TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) and has also been detected on HDL particles.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as the transcription {{of a gene}} terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative <b>splicing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Newly {{synthesized}} mRNA molecules {{are known}} as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA <b>splicing.</b> While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA {{is associated with a}} variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs).

In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include phosphodiesterase inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} performed for {{qualitative and quantitative}} comparison of the maximum tensile resistance of contact and non-contact lap <b>spliced</b> bars in reinforced concrete block masonry using double pullout and wall <b>splice</b> specimens. A total of 32 specimens were tested, consisting of {{an equal number of}} double pullout specimens and full-scale wall <b>splice</b> specimens. Both specimen types had the identical cross-section. Eight replicate specimens for each specimen type were constructed with both contact and non-contact lap <b>splice</b> arrangements. Grade 400 deformed reinforcing bars with a 300 mm lap <b>splice</b> length were provided in all specimens. The double pullout specimens were tested applying direct tension to the lapped reinforcing bars. The <b>splice</b> resistance and displacement were recorded during testing. All double pullout specimens with contact lap <b>splices</b> developed, as a minimum, the yield strength of the reinforcing bars and generally displayed evidence of a yield plateau. In contrast, the double pullout specimens with non-contact lap <b>splices</b> failed when only 46. 1 % of the theoretical yield strength of the reinforcing bars was recorded as the maximum <b>splice</b> resistance. The difference between the average value of the tensile resistance in the contact and non-contact <b>spliced</b> bars was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Wall <b>splice</b> specimens were tested under a four-point loading arrangement with the lapped bars located in the constant moment region. The applied load and specimen deflection were recorded until failure occurred. A numerical analysis was then performed to calculate the maximum resistance of the <b>spliced</b> bars. The specimens with contact lap <b>splices</b> developed the theoretical yield capacity of the reinforcing bars. In contrast, the wall <b>splice</b> specimens with non-contact lap <b>splices</b> developed an average tensile resistance of 78 % of the theoretical yield capacity. The difference between the average tensile resistances of the lapped bars in the two <b>splice</b> arrangements was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. On average, the contact and non-contact lap <b>spliced</b> bars in the double pullout specimens developed 8. 47 % and 41. 2 % less tensile resistance, respectively, as compared to the wall <b>splice</b> specimens with the identical <b>splice</b> arrangement. Both differences were identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Bond loss between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding grout was identified as the failure mode for both the double pullout and wall <b>splice</b> specimens with contact lap <b>splices.</b> In contrast, bond loss at the masonry block/grout interface was observed along the non-contact lapped bars in both specimen types, as identified by visual observations upon removal of the face shell and the surrounding grout. Based on the test results of the wall <b>splice</b> specimens with non-contact lap <b>splices,</b> a correction factor of 1. 5 is suggested when calculating the effective <b>splice</b> length for the non-contact <b>splice</b> arrangement as tested...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two major}} types of cis-acting RNA {{sequence}} elements present in pre-mRNAs and they have corresponding trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. <b>Splicing</b> silencers are sites to which <b>splicing</b> repressor proteins bind, reducing {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These can be located in the intron itself (intronic <b>splicing</b> silencers, ISS) or in a neighboring exon (exonic <b>splicing</b> silencers, ESS). They vary in sequence, {{as well as in the}} types of proteins that bind to them. The majority of <b>splicing</b> repressors are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) such as hnRNPA1 and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). <b>Splicing</b> enhancers are sites to which <b>splicing</b> activator proteins bind, increasing the probability that a nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These also may occur in the intron (intronic <b>splicing</b> enhancers, ISE) or exon (exonic <b>splicing</b> enhancers, ESE).

40|$|The tensile {{resistance}} of No. 15 lap <b>spliced</b> reinforcing bars with varying transverse spacing and lap <b>splice</b> length was evaluated in full-scale concrete block wall <b>splice</b> specimens. The {{range of the}} transverse spacing between bars was limited to that which allowed the bars to remain within the same cell, and included the evaluation of tied <b>spliced</b> bars in contact. Two-and-a-half block wide by three course tall double pullout specimens reinforced with contact lap <b>splices</b> were initially {{used to determine the}} range of lap <b>splice</b> length values to be tested in the wall <b>splice</b> specimens such that bond failure of the reinforcement occurred. The double pullout specimens were tested in direct tension with six replicates per arrangement. Three values of lap <b>splice</b> length: 150, 200, and 250 mm, were selected from the testing of the double pullout specimens and tested in the wall <b>splice</b> specimens in combination with three values of transverse spacing: 0, 25, and 50 mm, with three replicates per configuration. A total of twenty-seven two-and-a-half block wide by thirteen course tall wall <b>splice</b> specimens reinforced with two lap <b>splices</b> were tested in four-point loading. Both the double pullout and the wall <b>splice</b> specimens were constructed in running bond with all cells fully grouted. The tensile {{resistance of}} the lap <b>spliced</b> bars in the double pullout specimens was measured directly. The contact lap <b>splices</b> with a 150, 200, and 250 mm lap <b>splice</b> length developed approximately 38, 35 and 29 % of the theoretical yield load of the reinforcement, respectively. The difference between the mean tensile resistances of the three reinforcement configurations tested in the double pullout specimens was found to be statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Different than expected, the tensile resistance of the lap <b>spliced</b> reinforcing bars in the double pullout specimens was inversely proportional to the lap <b>splice</b> length provided. For the short lap <b>splice</b> lengths used in this investigation, the linear but not proportional relationship between bond force and lap <b>splice</b> length known from reinforced concrete is believed to have caused this phenomenon. An iterative sectional analysis using moment-curvature response was used to calculate the tensile resistance of the lap <b>spliced</b> reinforcement in the wall <b>splice</b> specimens. The calculated mean tensile resistance of the reinforcement increased with increasing lap <b>splice</b> length, and was greater when the bars were in contact. Securing the bars in contact may have influenced the tensile capacity of the contact lap <b>splices</b> as higher stresses are likely to develop {{as a result of the}} bar ribs riding over each other with increasing slip. Results of the data analysis suggest that the tensile resistance of non-contact lap <b>splices</b> within the same cell is generally independent of the spacing between the bars. A comparison of the experimental results for the wall <b>splice</b> specimens with the development and <b>splice</b> length provisions in CSA S 304. 1 - 04 and TMS 402 - 11 indicate that both the Canadian and U.
