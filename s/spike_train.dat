The study of neural coding involves measuring and characterizing how stimulus attributes, such as light or sound intensity, or motor actions, such as the direction of an arm movement, are represented by neuron action potentials or spikes.

40|$|Analysis of {{functional}} connectivity of simultaneously recorded multiple <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> {{is one of}} the major issues in the neuroscience. The progress of the statistical methods to the analysis {{of functional}} connectivity of multiple <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> is relatively slow. In this thesis two statistical techniques are presented to the analysis of functional connectivity of multiple <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> The first method is known as the modified correlation grid (MCG). This method is based on the calculation of cross-correlation function of all possible pair-wise <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> The second technique is known as the Cox method. This method is based on the modulated renewal process (MRP). The original paper on the application of the Cox method (Borisyuk et al., 1985) to neuroscience data was used to analyse only pairs and triplets of <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> This method is further developed in this thesis to support simultaneously recorded of any possible set of multiple <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> A probabilistic model is developed to test the Cox method. This probabilistic model is based on the MRP. Due to the common probabilistic basis of the probabilistic model and the Cox method, the probabilistic model is a convenient technique to test the Cox method. A new technique based on a pair-wise analysis of Cox method known as the Cox metric is presented to find the groups of coupled <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> Another new technique known as motif analysis is introduced which is useful in identifying interconnections among the <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> This technique is based on the triplet-wise analysis of the Cox method. All these methods are applied to several sets of <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> generated by the Enhanced Leaky and Integrate Fire (ELIF) model. The results suggest that these methods are successful for analysing functional connectivity of simultaneously recorded multiple <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> These methods are also applied to an experimental data recorded from cat’s visual cortex.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{statistical}} method for modeling the non-Poisson variability of <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> {{observed in a}} wide range of brain regions. Central to our approach is the assumption that the variance and the mean of interspike intervals are related by a power function characterized by two parameters: the scale factor and exponent. It is shown that this single assumption allows the variability of <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> to have an arbitrary scale and various dependencies on the firing rate in the spike count statistics, as well as in the interval statistics, depending on the two parameters of the power function. We also propose a statistical model for <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> that exhibits the variance-to-mean power relationship, and based on this a maximum likelihood method is developed for inferring the parameters from rate-modulated <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> The proposed method is illustrated on simulated and experimental <b>spike</b> <b>trains.</b> Comment: 23 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

50|$|The {{generation}} of the action potential is called the “firing.” The firing neuron described above is called a spiking neuron. We will model the electrical circuit of the neuron in Section 3.6. There {{are two types of}} spiking neurons. If the stimulus remains above the threshold level and the output is a <b>spike</b> <b>train,</b> it is called the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neuron model. If output is modeled as dependent on the impulse response of the circuit, then it is called the Spike Response Model (SRM) (Gestner, W. (1995)).|$|E
50|$|The {{temporal}} {{structure of a}} <b>spike</b> <b>train</b> or firing rate evoked by a stimulus is determined both by {{the dynamics of the}} stimulus and {{by the nature of the}} neural encoding process. Stimuli that change rapidly tend to generate precisely timed spikes and rapidly changing firing rates no matter what neural coding strategy is being used. Temporal coding refers to temporal precision in the response that does not arise solely from the dynamics of the stimulus, but that nevertheless relates to properties of the stimulus. The interplay between stimulus and encoding dynamics makes the identification of a temporal code difficult.|$|E
50|$|Rate coding is a {{traditional}} coding scheme, assuming that most, if not all, information about the stimulus is contained in the firing rate of the neuron. Because the sequence of action potentials generated by a given stimulus varies from trial to trial, neuronal responses are typically treated statistically or probabilistically. They may be characterized by firing rates, rather than as specific spike sequences. In most sensory systems, the firing rate increases, generally non-linearly, with increasing stimulus intensity. Any information possibly encoded in the temporal structure of the <b>spike</b> <b>train</b> is ignored. Consequently, rate coding is inefficient but highly robust {{with respect to the}} ISI 'noise'.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a {{clustering}} algorithm that learns {{the groups of}} synchronized <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> directly from data is proposed. Clustering of <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> based {{on the presence of}} synchronous neural activity is of high relevance in neurophysiological studies. In this context such activity is thought to be associated with functional structures in the brain. In addition, clustering has the potential to analyze large volumes of data. The algorithm couples a distance between two <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> recently proposed in the literature with spectral clustering. Finally, the algorithm is illustrated in sets of computer generated <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> and analyzed for the dependence on its parameters and accuracy with respect to features of interest.

40|$|AbstractIn the CA 3 {{region of}} the hippocampus, {{extensive}} recurrent associational/commissural (A/C) connections made by pyramidal cells may function as a network for associative memory storage and recall. We here report that long-term potentiation (LTP) at the A/C synapses can be induced by association of brief <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> in mossy fibers (MFs) from the dentate gyrus and A/C fibers. This LTP not only required substantial overlap between <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> in MFs and A/C fibers, but also depended on the temporal order of these <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> in a manner not predicted by the well-known rule of spike timing-dependent plasticity and requiring activation of type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors. Importantly, <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> in a putative single MF input provided effective postsynaptic activity for the induction of LTP at A/C synapses. Thus, the timing of <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> in individual MFs may code information that is crucial for the associative modification of CA 3 recurrent synapses...|$|R
50|$|The {{accommodation}} {{index is}} a metric {{used in the}} neurosciences for describing <b>spike</b> <b>train</b> data. Many methods of experimental neuroscience, such as voltage clamp recordings, give their output {{in the form of}} measured voltages of individual neurons. Generally, the only important element of these voltage traces is the occurrence of spikes in the voltage, representing action potentials. It is often useful to be able to describe the data in terms of the spike timings, for instance we wish to optimize a compartmental model towards observed behaviour, then metrics such as this would be used as error functions. Various metrics are used to do this, such as spike rate, average interspike interval and, the accommodation index.|$|E
50|$|The action {{potential}} or the spike does not itself carry any information. It is {{the stream of}} spikes, called <b>spike</b> <b>train,</b> that carry the information in its number and pattern of spikes and timing of spikes. The postsynaptic potential can be either positive, the excitatory synapse or negative, inhibitory synapse. In modeling, the postsynaptic potentials received by the dendrites in the postsynaptic neuron are integrated and when the integrated potential exceeds the resting potential, the neuron fires an {{action potential}} along its axon. This model is the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) model that was mentioned in Section 2.3. Closely related to IF model is a model called Spike Response Model (SRM) (Gerstner, W. (1995) Pages 738-758) that is dependent on impulse function response convoluted with the input stimulus signal. This forms a base for {{a large number of}} models developed for spiking neural networks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{correlation}} {{coding model}} of neuronal firing claims that correlations between action potentials, or [...] "spikes", within a <b>spike</b> <b>train</b> may carry additional information {{above and beyond}} the simple timing of the spikes. Early work suggested that correlation between spike trains can only reduce, and never increase, the total mutual information present in the two spike trains about a stimulus feature. However, this was later demonstrated to be incorrect. Correlation structure can increase information content if noise and signal correlations are of opposite sign. Correlations can also carry information not present in the average firing rate of two pairs of neurons. A good example of this exists in the pentobarbital-anesthetized marmoset auditory cortex, in which a pure tone causes {{an increase in the number}} of correlated spikes, but not an increase in the mean firing rate, of pairs of neurons.|$|E

The tempotron is a {{model of}} {{supervised}} learning that allows a spiking neuron to discriminate between different categories of <b>spike</b> <b>trains,</b> by firing or not as function of the category.

40|$|When {{periodic}} {{current is}} injected into an integrate-and-fire model neuron, the voltage {{as a function}} of time converges from different initial condi-tions to an attractor that produces reproducible sequences of spikes. The attractor reliability {{is a measure of the}} stability of <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> against intrinsic noise and is quantified here as the inverse of the number of dis-tinct <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> obtained in response to repeated presentations of the same stimulus. High reliability characterizes neurons that can support a spike-time code, unlike neurons with discharges forming a renewal pro-cess (such as a Poisson process). These two classes of responses cannot be distinguished using measures based on the spike-time histogram, but they can be identified by the attractor dynamics of <b>spike</b> <b>trains,</b> as shown here using a new method for calculating the attractor reliability. We applied these methods to <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> obtained from current in-jection into cortical neurons recorded in vitro. These <b>spike</b> <b>trains</b> did not form a renewal process and had a higher reliability compared to renewal-like processes with the same spike-time histogram. ...|$|R
