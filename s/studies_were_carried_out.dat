5|$|Airbus briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, {{a concept that}} requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. <b>Studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, Monsanto rented {{three floors}} of a {{warehouse}} at 601 East Third Street from General Electric. Initially {{it was used}} to receive and store equipment used by the Project. Later the fourth floor was used as office space, and a laboratory was established on the fifth floor where <b>studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on the effects of polonium on laboratory animals. Analysis of bioassay samples was carried out there to minimize the danger of polonium contamination of the samples.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the three}} telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several design <b>studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> and some scale models were made. This was {{partly due to the}} changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold Wilson to a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E

5|$|Uranium has {{the highest}} number (25) of both natural and {{synthetic}} isotopes. They have mass numbers of 217–242, and three of them, 234U, 235U and 238U, are present in appreciable quantities in nature. Among others, {{the most important is}} 233U, which is a final product of transformations of 232Th irradiated by slow neutrons. 233U has a much higher fission efficiency by low-energy (thermal) neutrons, compared e.g. with 235U. Most uranium chemistry <b>studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on uranium-238 owing to its long half-life of 4.4 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, with {{a return}} to {{normality}} after the First World War, Pick began developing plans to extend the Underground network out into suburbs that lacked adequate transport services. The only major extensions made to the Underground network since the three tube lines had opened were {{the extension of the}} District Railway to Uxbridge in 1910, and the extension of the Bakerloo tube to Watford Junction between 1913 and 1917. Approved schemes put on hold during the war were revived: the CLR was extended to Ealing Broadway in 1920, the Hampstead tube was extended to Edgware between 1923 and 1924 and the C was reconstructed and extended to Camden Town between 1922 and 1924. Finance for the latter two extensions was obtained through the government's 1921 Trade Facilities Act which underwrote loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. For new lines, Pick first considered extending Underground services to the north-east of London where the mainline suburban services of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and Great Eastern Railway (GER) were poor and unreliable. <b>Studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> for an extension of the Piccadilly tube on GNR tracks to New Barnet and Enfield or on a new route to Wood Green and plans were developed for an extension of the CLR along GER tracks to Chingford and Ongar, but both mainline companies strongly opposed the Underground's encroachment into their territories.|$|E

25|$|Several {{sites on}} the Nelson River, with {{potential}} of millions of horsepower, had been identified as early as 1911, but transmission of power to population centers in the south was beyond {{the state of the}} art of electric power transmission at that time. Between 1955 and 1960, <b>studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> to determine what resources would be available for future hydraulic generation in Manitoba. The stations at Kelsey, Kettle, Long Spruce and Limestone were built on the lower Nelson River to support both Manitoba load growth and export plans. Limestone, the largest generating station in Manitoba, is located on the Lower Nelson only 90km from Hudson Bay. Long-term firm power sales contracts were signed with Northern States Power Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Control dams and excavated channels have transformed Lake Winnipeg into a 25,000km2 reservoir for the Nelson hydroelectric system.|$|E
25|$|Since 1987, {{studies on}} {{breeding}} biology {{and growth of}} lizards, particularly the larger monitor lizards, were conducted in collaboration with researchers in the United Kingdom and Germany. During the period 1989-1991, amphibians <b>studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on the species Rana hexadactyla, which was featured in BBC Wildlife Magazine in 1996. In 1990, the MCBT newsletter {{was transformed into a}} scientific journal, with an international editorial board and a rigorous peer-review system for the acceptance of technical papers for publication. In 1992, a scientific committee consisting of scientists and trustees was instituted and is charged with directing and coordinating research. In 1993, the bank conducted surveys on wetlands and remote area sensing. This was followed by extensive studies on sea snakes, marine turtles, bats, and other small mammals and studies on herpetofauna, biogeography, resource use, land use, rain-water harvesting and coral reef socioeconomics, in addition to protected area management planning, ecologically suitable management planning.|$|E

25|$|Modern space {{research}} in India is most visibly {{traced to the}} 1920s, when the scientist S. K. Mitra {{conducted a series of}} experiments leading to the sounding of the ionosphere by application of ground based radio methods in Calcutta. Later, Indian scientists like C.V. Raman and Meghnad Saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences. However, it was the period after 1945 that saw important developments being made in coordinated {{space research}} in India. Organised space research in India was spearheaded by two scientists: Vikram Sarabhai—founder of the Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad—and Homi Bhabha, who established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1945. Initial experiments in space sciences included the study of cosmic radiation, high altitude and airborne testing of instruments, deep underground experimentation at the Kolar mines—one of the deepest mining sites in the world – and studies of the upper atmosphere. <b>Studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> at research laboratories, universities, and independent locations.|$|E
25|$|The {{planting}} of Eucalyptus sp. has been criticised {{because of concerns}} that soil would be degraded by nutrient depletion and other biological changes. During the last ten years, in the northwestern regions of Uruguay the Eucalyptus sp. plantations have reached annual forestation rates of 300%. That zone has a potential forested area of 1,000,000 hectares, approximately 29% of the national territory dedicated to forestry, of which approximately 800,000 hectares are currently forested by monoculture of Eucalyptus spp. It is expected that the radical and durable substitution of vegetation cover leads {{to changes in the}} quantity and quality of soil organic matter. Such changes may also influence soil fertility and soil physical and chemical properties. The soil quality effects associated with Eucalyptus sp. plantations could have negative effects on soil chemistry; for example: soil acidification, iron leaching, allelopathic activities and a high C:N ratio of litter. Additionally, as most scientific understanding of land cover change effects is related to ecosystems where forests were replaced by grasslands or crops, or grassland was replaced by crops, the environmental effects of the current Uruguayan land cover changes are not well understood. The first scientific publication on soil studies in western zone tree plantations (focused on pulp production) appeared in 2004 and described soil acidification and soil carbon changes, similar to a podzolisation process, and destruction of clay (illite-like minerals), which is the main reservoir of potassium in the soil. Although these <b>studies</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in an important zone for forest cultivation, they cannot define the current situation in the rest of the land area under eucalyptus cultivation. Moreover, recently Jackson and Jobbagy have proposed another adverse environmental impact that may result from Eucalyptus culture on prairie soils: stream acidification.|$|E
