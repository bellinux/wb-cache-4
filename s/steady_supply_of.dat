5|$|World {{demand for}} {{palladium}} increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300tons in 2000. The global production of palladium from mines was 222tonnes in 2006 {{according to the}} United States Geological Survey. Many are concerned about a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> palladium {{in the wake of}} Russia's military maneuvers in Ukraine, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports; any restrictions on Russian palladium exports would exacerbate what is already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing {{to give to the}} runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> goods to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E
5|$|Red wares were {{imported}} from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery {{was fired in}} the canyon, but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> firewood for their kilns. During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before. The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production is lacking, proficient local artisans supplied distant communities {{as well as their}} own.|$|E

50|$|Because Ohio is {{not entirely}} flat, the system of locks had to be {{designed}} {{to act as a}} staircase so boats could navigate the difference in elevation. To supply water for the canal, manmade reservoirs such as Grand Lake St. Marys and Lake Loramie in Shelby County were constructed, along with several feeder canals. Indian Lake in Logan County was greatly enlarged to provide a <b>steadier</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> water for the Sidney feeder canal.|$|R
30|$|Our {{hypothesis}} was that rumen-protected DL-methionine was degraded more slowly by rumen microorganisms, moderately in the abomasum, and {{fully in the}} small intestine of the ruminant, thereby providing a <b>steadier</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> methionine to the small intestine. Thus, {{the main purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of feeding different levels of rumen-protected DL-methionine supplementation with low crude protein (CP) on post-ruminal fermentation, disappearance, production of volatile fatty acids, and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) production.|$|R
5|$|To keep up morale {{following}} Amherst's departure, Maxwell began organising {{his remaining}} 200 men (and one woman) {{to secure their}} position and gather supplies. The men were divided into parties, with one ordered to dig a well while another returned to the wreck of Alceste to salvage what weapons and equipment they could. A third party was ordered to clear a path to the island's central hill, where a cool cave {{could be used as}} a larder and trees felled to form a protective stockade. By the end of the first day the well was producing a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{moved to}} the Cincinnati area in 1847, where {{he took over the}} {{management}} of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor goods. With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, Coffin rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> free-labor goods for the business. The enterprise's ongoing problem was the poor quality of its goods. Coffin had difficulty procuring free goods, such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with the goods produced by slave labor. With inferior quality goods to sell, he had a difficult time finding purchasers for the goods. The problem plagued the business for years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.|$|E
50|$|It was {{announced}} in September 2011 that GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy and Exelon commissioned a feasibility study into creating Molybdenum-99(Mo-99) at the reactor. Mo-99 decays to produce technetium-99m (Tc-99m) that is used in around 50 million medical diagnostic imaging procedures every year. With a half-life of only six hours, Tc-99m is too short-lived to be transported to hospitals so is produced where it is needed in generators containing Mo-99. As Mo-99 itself has a half-life of only 66 hours, the world needs reliable, <b>steady</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> the isotope, most of which is made by irradiating uranium-235 targets inside a research reactor.|$|R

5|$|The British ships {{set off in}} pursuit, and by 12:50, Sturdee's two battlecruisers had {{overtaken}} the Germans. A minute later, he {{gave the}} order to open fire at the trailing German ship, Leipzig. Von Spee ordered the three small cruisers to try to escape to the south, while he turned back with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{in an attempt to}} hold off the British squadron. Sturdee had foreseen this possibility, and so had ordered his armored and light cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers. The battlecruisers quickly overwhelmed von Spee's armored cruisers, and destroyed them with heavy loss of life. Dresden, with her turbine engines, was able to outpace her pursuers, and was the only German warship to escape destruction. LÃ¼decke decided to take his ship into the islands off South America to keep a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> coal available.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} obtaining good-quality free-labor {{products}} forced Coffin to travel south {{to seek out}} plantations that did not use slave labor to produce their goods. He met with only limited success. Coffin located a cotton plantation in Mississippi, where the owner had freed all his slaves and hired them as free laborers. The plantation struggled financially because it had no equipment to automate cotton production. Coffin helped the owner purchase a cotton gin that greatly increased the plantation's productivity and provided a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cotton for Coffin's association. The cotton was shipped to Cincinnati, where it was spun into cloth and sold. Other trips to Tennessee and Virginia were less successful, although he did succeed in spreading the word about the free-labor goods movement.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in {{the area}} was spurred by food and fodder {{shortages}} during the winters of 1913, 1915, and 1916. Fairbanks businessmen also encouraged the growth of farming. Wickersham provided more funding for the experimental farm, the Tanana Valley Railroad provided free grain seed acquired from an experimental farm in Sweden, and William Fentress Thompson, editor of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, wrote frequent editorials {{in favor of more}} farming. Prominent Fairbanks businessmen formed the Alaska Loyal League, a group that encouraged farming. Farmers also created the Tanana Valley State Fair in 1924 to demonstrate their agricultural success. It is Alaska's oldest state fair and still operates today. Despite these moves, the agriculture movement in Fairbanks had only limited success. A farmers' bank established in 1917 to provide loans for equipment purchases went out of business two years later, and although the Alaska Railroad allowed for cheaper shipment of tractors and other agricultural equipment, it also permitted a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> food shipments to Fairbanks. In 1929, Alaska farms met only about 10 percent of the state's food demand. By 1931, the University of Alaska had grown {{to the point that the}} experimental farm was annexed by the school.|$|E
40|$|Residents in Rhumsiki, Cameroon {{have water}} problems. Seasonal {{rainfall}} provides inconsistent amounts of water. But of even greater {{concern is the}} danger of water-borne diseases. Our project focused on providing a <b>steadier</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> water, and cleaning the dirty water {{from all of the}} sources to prevent people in Rhumsiki from getting fatal infectious diseases like cholera. After researching we came up with three possible solutions for cleaning the water: Lifestraw, Lifesaver bottle, and SODIS (SOlar water DISinfection); and one possible solution for extracting water from existing wells: The solar water pump. The least expensive of the filtration technologies is SODIS, so our recommendation for Rhumsiki is to implement this process. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Roman forces {{took the}} {{initiative}} in AD 9, and pushed into Dalmatia. Tiberius divided the forces into three divisions, two under Silvanus (south-east from Sirmium) and Lepidus (north-west from Siscia), and the third led by himself with Germanicus in the Dalmatian hinterland. The divisions under Lepidus and Silvanus easily defeated their foes, having nearly exterminated the Perustae and Daesitiate, two Dalmatian tribes held up in mountain strongholds. Roman forces captured many cities, with Germanicus himself taking Raetinum (which was lost in a fire set by the enemies during the siege; near Seretium), Splonum (in northern Montenegro), and Seretium (in western Bosnia). Meanwhile, Germanicus and Tiberius pursued Bato until he made a stand at a fortress called Adetrium near Salona, to which the Caesars laid siege. When it became clear he would not surrender, Tiberius attacked the fortress, using a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements. The fortress was overwhelmed and the defenders were killed. While Tiberius negotiated the terms of capitulation, Germanicus went on a punitive expedition across the surrounding territory in which he besieged the fortified town of Arduba, defeating it and obtaining their surrender and that of surrounding towns. He returned to Tiberius, and sent a Postumius to subdue the remaining districts.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were a {{formative}} decade: {{the increased}} optimism after {{the signing of}} the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cowâs milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, semi-dry and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs.|$|E
5|$|The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was {{established}} in 1988 in the United States by {{the passing of the}} National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and is funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose. The program's aims were to maintain a <b>steady</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> vaccines while, at the same time, allowing victims of vaccine injury to be compensated more efficiently than was previously possible. The program operates according to a no-fault principle. The family of Michelle Cedillo sought compensation from this program. Cedillo, a then 12-year-old female wheelchair user from Yuma, Arizona, was involved in the first of three test cases chosen by the government to represent the approximately 4,900 other vaccine-autism cases that had been brought before the court. Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994, and received thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first fifteen months of her life. On December 20, 1995, she received an MMR vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo filed a vaccine injury claim on behalf of their daughter on December 9, 1998 for encephalopathy, but on January 14, 2002, changed their petition to a causation-in-fact claim, meaning they were arguing that Michelle developed autism {{as a result of the}} combined effects of thimerosal and the MMR vaccine. They did this as a result of a meeting that had taken place the previous year, between Theresa Cedillo and Andrew Wakefield, at a Defeat Autism Now! conference.|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms are {{involved}} in the formation of soil fertility, both potential and effective. They facilitate the processes of humification and dehumification and {{play a key role in}} the cycling of nutrients - macro and microelements. Rhizosphere is the soil in direct contact with plant roots and influenced by plant exudates. Root exudates of maize significantly affect the composition and abundance of microorganisms in the rhizosphere. Bio-fertilizers are microbial fertilizers composed of highly effective strains of bacteria, algae and fungi isolated from soil. Their application activates microbial processes that secure a better and <b>steadier</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> plants with nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and some micronutrients. The application of PGPR-containing biofertilizers reduces the need for expensive nitrogen fertilizers, facilitates phosphorus uptake by plants and affects the direction and dynamics of microbial processes...|$|R

50|$|One {{component}} of this reform {{was the creation}} of an institution of regulated warfare called the Flower Wars. Mesoamerican warfare overall is characterized by a strong preference for capturing live prisoners as opposed to slaughtering the enemy on the battlefield, which was considered sloppy and gratuitous. The Flower Wars are a potent manifestation of this approach to warfare. These highly ritualized wars ensured a <b>steady,</b> healthy <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> experienced Aztec warriors as well as a <b>steady,</b> healthy <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> captured enemy warriors for sacrifice to the gods. Flower wars were pre-arranged by officials on both sides and conducted specifically for the purpose of each polity collecting prisoners for sacrifice. According to native historical accounts, these wars were instigated by Tlacaelel as a means of appeasing the gods in response to a massive drought that gripped the Basin of Mexico from 1450 to 1454. The flower wars were mostly waged between the Aztec Empire and the neighboring cities of their arch-enemy Tlaxcala.|$|R
25|$|The {{reign of}} Muzaffar Shah's son, Sultan Mansur Shah (r.1459â1477) {{witnessed}} the major {{expansion of the}} sultanate to reach its greatest extent of influence. Among the earliest territory ceded to the sultanate was Pahang, with its capital, Inderapura â a massive unexplored land with a large river and abundant source of gold which was ruled by Maharaja Dewa Sura, a relative of the King of Ligor. The Sultan dispatched a fleet of two hundred ships, led by Tun Perak and 19 Malaccan hulubalangs' ('commanders'). On reaching Pahang, a battle broke out in which the Pahangites were decisively defeated and its entire royal court were captured. The Malaccan fleet returned home with Dewa Sura and his daughter, Wanang Seri who were handed over to Sultan Mansur Shah. The Sultan appointed Tun Hamzah to rule Pahang. A policy of rapprochement with Ligor was later initiated by Mansur Shah to ensure <b>steady</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> rice.|$|R
