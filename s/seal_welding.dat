40|$|Excess {{plutonium}} {{materials in}} the DOE complex are packaged and stored in accordance with DOE-STD- 3013. This standard specifies requirements for the stabilization of such materials and subsequent packaging in dual nested seal-welded containers. Austenitic stainless steels have been selected for container fabrication. The inner 3013 container provides contamination control while the outer 3013 container is the primary containment vessel and {{is the focus of}} this paper. Each packaging site chose a process for <b>seal</b> <b>welding</b> the outer 3013 containers in accordance with its needs and expertise. The two processes chosen for weld closure were laser beam welding (LBW) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Following development efforts, each system was qualified in accordance with DOE-STD- 3013 prior to production use. The 3013 outer container closure weld joint was designed to accommodate the characteristics of a laser weld. This aspect of the joint design necessitated some innovative process and equipment considerations in the application of the GTAW process. Details of the weld requirements and the development processes are presented and several potential enhancements for the GTAW system are described...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Socket welds are {{commonly}} used to assemble small-bore carbon steel process piping systems {{because they can be}} fabricated fairly quickly and are somewhat tolerant of field fit-up issues. In the most simplistic terms, these welds are made by inserting the pipe into a socket and then <b>seal</b> <b>welding</b> using gas tungsten arc welding around the gap between the outside pipe wall {{and the end of the}} fitting. This leaves a notch in the root of the seal weld that is open to the process fluid. This notch can act both as a stress riser and a crevice capable of concentrating chemical species. In many process applications, these socket weld notches do not cause any in-service problems. However, in the case of sour service, these notches can become problematic because of the potential for sulphide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC). For SSCC to occur, the right combination of stress, environment, and material susceptibility must be present. Therefore, for socket welds to be used in sour service without the risk of failure, these parameters need to be controlled by proper design and fabrication of the welded joint. Since a crevice is created as a natural by-product of a socket weld geometry, where the SSCC environment will be present, the parameter most readily controlled to minimize susceptibility to SSCC is the microstructure and residual stress of the weld filler metal. As will be shown, this resistance to SSCC can b...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{incidents}} of SCC in Ni-base alloy weld metal of BWR components have been reported. When the defects are detected by inspection, structural integrity assessment {{should be performed}} for the technical judgment on continuous service based on the Rules on Fitness-for-Service for Nuclear Power Plants of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers Code (JSME FFS Code). The structural integrity assessment includes fatigue crack growth analysis. However, fatigue crack growth analysis for Ni-base alloy is impossible since the fatigue crack growth rate curves in air and the BWR environment are not prescribed yet in the JSME FFS Code. The curve in air environment is needed for the structural integrity assessment of the flaw when the embedded flaw repair {{which is one of}} the repair techniques to isolate the defect from water environment by <b>seal</b> <b>welding</b> is applied. In this study, fatigue crack growth tests in air environment were performed for Ni-base alloy weld metal. Based on the test data, fatigue crack growth rate curves with ΔKth of Ni-base alloy weld metal were investigated. It is found that fatigue crack growth data in the Paris region hardly depend on the test temperature and the stress ratio, whereas data around ΔKth are dependent on them. Hence, the curve in the Paris region was regarded as the same curve despite the difference of the test temperature and the stress ratio. The minimum ΔK of final crack growth data in the ΔK decreasing test was adopted as ΔKth of the curve...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{created the}} National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program (NSNFP) to manage DOE’s {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF). One of the NSNFP’s tasks is to prepare spent nuclear fuel for storage, transportation, and {{disposal}} at the national repository. As part of this effort, the NSNFP developed a standardized canister for interim storage and transportation of SNF. These canisters will be built and sealed to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section III, Division 3 requirements. Packaging SNF usually is a three-step process: canister loading, closure welding, and closure weld verification.

40|$|Selected {{components}} from a staianless steel nonregenerative {{heat exchanger}} {{removed from the}} U. S. S. Nautilus (SSN 571) have been examined for evidence of stress-corrosion cracking. The examination was conducted on three baffle plates, all primary-face <b>seal</b> <b>welds,</b> and the tubes and the surrounding tube sheets of 7 {{out of a total}} of 35 tubes. Maximum operating temperature of the heat exchanger was 260 ction prod- F for the inlet primary water and 164 ction prod- F for the exit secondary water. Chloride content of the secondary water averaged 5 ppm, with a maximum of 15 ppm. Only one suspected stress-corrosion crack was found in the components normally in contact with the secondary water. The crack, 2. 5 mils in depth, was located on a fully exposed tube. At the 95 per cent confidence level this represented a probability of finding cracking on fully exposed surfaces in 0 to 60 per cent of the rest of the tubes in the heat exchanger. Severe stress-corrosion cracking was found in tubes in the tube-sheet drain area at the juncture with the inner tube sheet at the inlet end, where secondary water seeped past the expanded tubes. Cracks were detected in five of seven tubes for a statistical probability of 25 to 96 per cent at the 95 per cent confidence level. Maximum depth of cracks was 28 mils or 80 per cent penetration of the 35 -mil-thick tubing wall. Stress-corrosion cracks also were found around several holes on the drain-side tube-sheet surfaces at the inlet end. Maximum depth was 12 mils, which did not seriously threaten penetration of the 9 / 16 -in. -thick tube sheet. Cracks were detected in 5 of 35 primary-face <b>seal</b> <b>welds</b> at the inlet end and in 11 of 35 at the outlet end. This behavior was attributed to hot-short cracking of the Type 347 stainless steel weldments rather than to stress corrosion. (auth...|$|R

The spent nuclear fuel will be encapsulated in copper canisters consisting of a graphite cast iron insert shielded by an outer 30 - 50 mm thick copper cylinder for corrosion and radiation protection. The cast iron insert provides the necessary strength and shielding of radiation.

40|$|Description of {{a simple}} and easily applied method of {{diffusion}} welding steel plate in air which {{does not require a}} vacuum furnace or hot press. The novel feature of the proposed welding method is that diffusion welds are made in air with deadweight loading. In addition, the use of an autogenous (self-generated) surface-cleaning principle (termed 'auto-vac cleaning') to reduce the effects of surface oxides that normally hinder diffusion welding is examined. A series of nine butt joints were diffusion welded in thick sections of AISI 1020 steel plate. Diffusion welds were attempted at three welding temperatures (1200, 1090, and 980 C) using a deadweight pressure of 34, 500 N/sq m (5 psi) and a two-hour hold time at temperature. Auto-vac cleaning operations prior to welding were also studied for the same three temperatures.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} a laser-based method for joining aluminium and steel was a possible weight reduction in automobile body constructions. In conventional welding technology, no method exists that allows to join aluminium and steel sheets as continuous <b>seal</b> <b>welds</b> to one another. By exploiting both the differences in the material characteristics of aluminium and steel, and the characteristics of Nd:YAG laser radiation, it was possible to develop a technology that allows for the first time to form fusion joints of aluminium-steel joints. This joints exhibit sufficient properties regarding strength and formability and will find applications for car body manufacturing. The brittle intermetallic phases, formed at temperatures above approx. 350 C on the contact plane of the two materials, are the most severe problem during thermal joining of aluminium and steel. The thickness of the intermetallic phases has a decisive effect upon the fitness characteristics of the joint. If the phase margins are less than about 10 mm, no harmful effect on the strength and workability must be expected. Using a newly developed, three-part FEM-calculation model, the thickness of the intermetallic phases is estimated as a function of the laser joining parameters; in this way statements regarding the expected fitness characteristics are possible. The calculation model was verified by testing. The laser-made aluminium-steel joints produced in this way have good shear tension and fatigue strength as well as sufficient workability. Therefore e. g. deep-drawing blanks from aluminium and steel or three-dimensional composite structures for the automobile body can be produced. The first tests on original components have been successfully performed. (orig.)
