25|$|If disturbed, {{woolly bear}} {{caterpillars}} will roll {{into a tight}} spiral or drop from their perch suspended by a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> Isabella tiger moths (Pyrrharctia isabella) overwinter in the caterpillar stage. They can survive freezing at moderate subzero temperatures by producing a cryoprotectant chemical. The larvae of another species, Phragmatobia fuliginosa, may be found on snow seeking a place to pupate. Species in Arctic and temperate belts overwinter in larval stage.|$|E
5000|$|Denier [...] or den (abbreviated D), {{a unit of}} {{measure for}} the linear mass density of fibers, is the mass in grams per 9000 meters of the fiber. The denier {{is based on a}} natural reference: a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> is {{approximately}} one denier; a 9000-meter <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> weighs about one gram. The term denier comes from the French denier, a coin of small value (worth [...] sou). Applied to yarn, a denier was held to be equal in weight to 1/24 oz. Microdenier describes filaments that weigh less than 1 g per 9000 m.|$|E
50|$|In the spring, {{the young}} spiders exit the sac. They are so tiny {{that they look}} like dust {{gathered}} inside the silk mesh. Some of the spiderlings remain nearby, but others exude a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> that gets caught by the breeze, carrying the spiderling to a more distant area.|$|E
5000|$|Invisible thread {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> Edges <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> that are fraying will reveal [...] "invisible thread".|$|R
50|$|The strings (弦) {{were made}} <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> {{in the old}} times. The number <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> {{determined}} {{the thickness of the}} string. Nowadays, metal wound polymer strings are used.|$|R
50|$|The larvae been {{recorded}} feeding on Euphorbia esula. They roll {{the leaves of}} their host plant. They produce <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> with which they tie together the leaves and terminal portions to create a protected area for feeding.|$|R
50|$|All {{members of}} this family produce a feathery, fuzzy silk called cribellate (or hackled) silk. These spiders do not use an {{adhesive}} on their orb webs, but rather the very fine fibers on each <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> tend to ensnare prey. Uloboridae webs often have a stabilimentum or zig-zag pattern through the center.|$|E
50|$|Skulltulas are giant spiders, {{named for}} the white, bony plate {{in the shape of}} a human skull that forms its carapace. Skulltulas and giant Skulltulas hang upside down in an upright position, {{suspended}} by a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> thread from a ceiling surface. Skulltulas appear in Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, and Skyward Sword.|$|E
50|$|Skulltulas (Sutaruwōru) are giant spiders, {{named for}} the white, bony plate {{in the shape of}} a human skull that forms its carapace. Skulltulas and giant Skulltulas hang upside down in an upright position, {{suspended}} by a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> thread from a ceiling surface. In Ocarina of Time, there is also a smaller variant called the Skullwalltula, which are also encountered first before the Skulltulas.|$|E
2500|$|Ballooning: {{being carried}} {{up into the}} air from the {{aerodynamic}} effect on long <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> in the wind. Certain silk-producing arthropods, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight gossamer silk for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude.|$|R
50|$|While capable <b>of</b> making <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk,</b> evidently to aid mobility, {{the spider}} {{is not known}} to {{construct}} webs or nets. It hunts and pounces on prey like a wolf spider. Also, like a wolf spider, it carries its newly hatched young on its back.|$|R
50|$|The female {{will die}} {{within days of}} laying a single egg sac with {{hundreds}} of eggs. Egg sacs can survive over winter, and the emerging spiderlings will eat their brothers and sisters. The babies ride <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> in warm air currents, able to transport them to locations miles away.|$|R
50|$|If disturbed, {{woolly bear}} {{caterpillars}} will roll {{into a tight}} spiral or drop from their perch suspended by a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> Isabella tiger moths (Pyrrharctia isabella) overwinter in the caterpillar stage. They can survive freezing at moderate subzero temperatures by producing a cryoprotectant chemical. The larvae of another species, Phragmatobia fuliginosa, may be found on snow seeking a place to pupate. Species in Arctic and temperate belts overwinter in larval stage.|$|E
50|$|Araneus mitificus builds orb webs {{that are}} {{characteristically}} missing a section. The spider does not {{rest on the}} center of the web, but instead builds a silk-lined sanctuary in a leaf at the margins. The leaf is bent at the edges and roofed with a mesh of silk. If a prey animal becomes entangled in the web, the vibrations from its struggle travel {{to the center of the}} web, then along a single long <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> (the signal line) positioned in the empty section. The strand is linked to the hidden spider. Once the spider feels the signal line vibrate, it will rush out to capture the prey.|$|E
50|$|Microfiber (or microfibre) is {{synthetic}} fiber finer than one denier or decitex/thread. This {{is smaller than}} the diameter of a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> (which is approximately one denier), which is itself about 1/5 the diameter of a human hair. The most common types of microfibers are made from polyesters, polyamides (e.g., nylon, Kevlar, Nomex, trogamide), or a conjugation of polyester, polyamide, and polypropylene (Prolen). Microfiber is used to make mats, knits, and weaves for apparel, upholstery, industrial filters, and cleaning products. The shape, size, and combinations of {{synthetic fiber}}s are selected for specific characteristics, including softness, toughness, absorption, water repellency, electrostatics, and filtering capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The cord {{is created}} from rice paper, that is tightly wound, starched {{to give it}} stiffness, and then colored. The ways of {{coloring}} include brightly colored Mylar (a very thin plastic), thin <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk,</b> or simply painted. The art form was used to tie up the hair of the samurai.|$|R
5000|$|This [...] large bodied, {{burrowing}} spider {{is commonly}} seen {{during the summer}} rainy season in southwestern deserts. The female is usually a uniform tan color. The male has black legs, a copper-colored cephalothorax and a reddish abdomen. Their burrows can be as large as [...] in diameter, with some <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> across the opening.|$|R
5000|$|A small thin spider {{resembling}} a twig. Often found resting {{on one or}} two threads <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> It eats wandering spiders, mostly juveniles (and some insects). The whip spider waits above the few <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> <b>of</b> its snare. When a small wandering spider hits the silk, this causes the whip spider to descend. The whip spider uses the [...] "comb foot" [...] of its end segment of the last pair of legs to wrap the meal in silk.|$|R
50|$|They {{make these}} tents by {{spinning}} silk threads between leaves and branches, which draws {{them into a}} compact nest. Each <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> is stretched slightly before it {{is attached to a}} leaf so that a tiny force (from axial retraction) will pull the leaf slightly towards the nest. When many strands of silk are spun to the surrounding leaves, the net forces will eventually drive all the leaves into the characteristic tent shape. The caterpillars usually stay within boundaries defined by the silk that envelops their shelter. They occasionally venture out of the nest, traveling only short distances to draw in new leaves. In most cases, the colony finds a sufficient number of leaves in its contiguous patch to complete larval development.|$|E
5000|$|The larvae {{have four}} instars, each {{with an average}} {{development}} time of about four days. The larval body form tapers at both ends. The larvae have a few short black hairs and are colourless in the first instar, but pale or emerald green with black heads in later instars. Of the five pairs of prolegs, one protrudes from the posterior end, forming a distinctive [...] "V". The larvae are quite active, and when disturbed, may wriggle violently, move backward, and spin a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> from which to dangle. The feeding habit of the first instar is leaf mining, although they are so small, the mines are difficult to detect. The larvae emerge from these mines to moult and subsequently feed on the lower surface of the leaf. Their chewing results in irregular patches of damage, though the upper leaf epidermis is often left intact.|$|E
5000|$|Up to 1000 ovules (potential kernels) form per ear of corn, each {{of which}} {{produces}} a strand of corn silk from its tip that eventually emerges {{from the end of}} the ear. The emergence of at least one <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> from a given ear of corn is defined as growth stage R1, and the emergence of silk in 50% of the plants in a corn field is called [...] "mid-silk". The silk lengthens from the basal ovules during the 10 to 14 days previous to growth stage R1; this is due to a change of shape of existing cells rather than their replication. The elongation progresses at 1.5 inches per day at first, but gradually slows as the full length is approached. Elongation of a corn silk strand stops soon after a grain of pollen is captured, or due to senescence of the silk 10 days after its emergence.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of {{pupation}} they descend close to the ground, looking for suitable spots to pupate. The caterpillar constructs a tubular cell from a leaf by drawing the edges together with thick <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> In this cell, the caterpillar prepares an extensive silk bed on which it sits awaiting pupation. The freshly formed pupa clings onto the silken pad almost immediately.|$|R
50|$|They are orb web weavers, weaving small orb webs {{with an open}} hub and few, wide-set radii and spirals. The webs have no {{signal line}} and no retreat. The web is a large horizontally-placed orb {{structure}} with a diameter {{of more than a}} metre. The entire web is often suspended by several long <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> attached to branches and leaves nearby.|$|R
25|$|Late in the period, fashionable {{young men}} wore a plain gold ring, a jewelled earring, or a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> black <b>silk</b> through one pierced ear.|$|R
50|$|Eggs hatch {{from early}} April to early June (earlier in the south) and larvae {{emerge from the}} carcass of their mother in her case. Newborn larva emerge {{from the bottom of}} the hanging case and drop down on a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> The wind often blows the larva to nearby plants where it begins its new case from silk and fecal {{material}} before beginning to add leaves and twigs from its host. When mature in mid-August, the larva wraps silk around a branch, hangs from it, and pupates head down. The silk is so strong that it can strangle and kill the branch it hangs from over the course of several years as the branch grows. Adult males transform into moths in four weeks to seek out females for mating. The female never leaves the cocoon, requiring that the male mate with her through the open end at the back of the case. She has no eyes, legs, wings, antennae, and can't eat, but she emits a strong pheromone to attract a mate. After her death with hundreds to several thousand eggs still inside, her offspring hatch and pass through her body, pupal shell and case over several months emerging to start their own cases. Later, her pupal case can be found, full of the yellow remains of eggshells.|$|E

50|$|Adults live {{in up to}} 30 cm deep tubes with a {{diameter}} of about 10 mm. The silken lining continues above ground for about 10 cm, where it is camouflaged with matter from the vicinity. The mating period is from June to July, when the males search for females. The spiderlings hatch during autumn and overwinter in the mother's burrow without feeding. After emerging in spring, they climb nearby plants and use <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> to fly away (ballooning).|$|R

50|$|Inner Mongolian wrestlers {{may also}} wear a jangga, a {{necklace}} decorated with <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> colorful <b>silk</b> ribbons. It is awarded {{to those who}} have gained considerable renown through contests.|$|R
50|$|Adults build a nest {{which is}} 40 - 50 mm long with an opening some 22 mm wide, from which six to ten <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> radiate out 12.5 - 15 cm in a semicircle. The {{movement}} of an insect against these threads is detected by the spider which then rushes out and captures the insect. Spiderlings build smaller nests, only 10 mm across, {{and seem to}} abandon these during development to build a bigger nest; intermediate sizes of nest are not seen.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the young}} foliage of Parinari curatellifolia. They are leaf green with a black to brown head. They spin leaf shelters {{held in place by}} <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> white <b>silk.</b>|$|R
5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b>|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the leaves}} of Odina wodier. Young larvae mine the leaf, {{ejecting}} a little heap of excrement at an open end of the mine. The larva then emerges and feeds externally under a little shelter formed of a partially cut circle of leaf and excrement. Eventually, it wanders to the long pointed tip of the leaf which it sews up with about five strong <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk,</b> and it lives in the tunnel thus formed under a stout web and emerges from this to {{feed on the}} cuticle.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the foliage}} and fruits of plants, and can {{completely}} defoliate small ones. Smaller larvae devour the parenchyma of leaves, so all that remains is the thin epidermis and veins. Larger larvae tend to burrow holes through thick areas of plants. For example, they burrow straight into a head of lettuce rather than neatly removing tissue from one particular leaf. This renders the produce unmarketable. They attack buds and new growth on plants, preventing flowers from opening, new leaves from sprouting, and vegetables from developing. As the smaller larvae move about they leave <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> behind, netting the leaves with a silvery film.|$|R
50|$|A {{single thread}} {{filament}} is too thin {{to use on}} its own, so Thai women combine many threads to produce a thicker, usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a wooden spindle to produce a uniform <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>silk.</b> The process is a tedious one as it takes nearly 40 hours to produce a half kilogram <b>of</b> Thai <b>silk.</b>|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{feed on the}} undersides of {{the leaves}} of various Polypodiophyta species, {{including}} Adiantum aethiopicum and Pteridium esculentum. They live in a sparse web. They are pale green with a transparent skin. Pupation {{takes place in a}} folded leaf of the food plant, held by <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> white <b>silk.</b>|$|R
