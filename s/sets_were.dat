5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} eleven <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> created {{for all of}} the filming schedules. Filming also took place in Chengalpattu, Tiruvannamalai and Pondicherry. Spoofs on Sivaji Ganesan, M.

50|$|Cylinder <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> clopen <b>sets.</b> As {{elements}} of the topology, cylinder <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> by definition open sets. The complement of an open <b>set</b> <b>is</b> a closed <b>set,</b> but the complement of a cylinder <b>set</b> <b>is</b> a union of cylinders, and so cylinder <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> also closed, and are thus clopen. As a result, the topology satisfies the axioms of a sigma algebra.|$|R
5000|$|The {{family of}} sets with the {{property}} of Baire forms a σ-algebra. That is, the complement of an almost open <b>set</b> <b>is</b> almost open, and any countable union or intersection of almost open <b>sets</b> <b>is</b> again almost open. [...] Since every open <b>set</b> <b>is</b> almost open (the empty <b>set</b> <b>is</b> meager), it follows that every Borel <b>set</b> <b>is</b> almost open.|$|R

5|$|Los Angeles was {{extensively}} researched for the game. The team {{spent the}} first year of development researching Los Angeles by using newspapers and magazines, organising field research field trips, and capturing photographs. A total of 180,000 photographs were available as resources throughout development, and over 1,000 newspapers were used for research. Both the interior and exterior of multiple <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> the result of researched reference material. For example, the Barclay Hotel in Los Angeles was used as a reference point when modelling an apartment building in the game. However, some <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> originally designed, {{in order to meet the}} gameplay or the narrative script.|$|E
5|$|Permission for Blyth A Power Station {{to be built}} {{was granted}} in February 1955, and its {{construction}} took place between 1955 and 1960. The station's first unit went into operation in December 1958, and the A Station was fully operational by June 1960. Its four 120MW <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> the first commissioned in Britain of what became for a time that standardised size. The construction of the B Station began on 4December 1961. Its first unit was commissioned in December 1962, {{and the rest of}} the station was fully operational by September 1966. The station had a total generating capacity of 1,730MW, the highest of any site in the UK until later in the same year, when Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation. Blyth B was the first power station in Britain to have 275MW sets installed. Its two 350MW <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> an intermediate stage toward the 500MW standard, so very few of the 350MW <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> ever commissioned in the UK. Both of the stations were designed by L J Couves & Partners. They were engineered by Merz & McLellan and built by the Cleveland Bridge Company.|$|E

5|$|The German {{tables were}} {{developed}} by Dr. Max Hahn using a derivative of the Bühlmann ZH-L16 model using half-times ranging from 2.65 to 635 minutes. Three <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> published for altitude ranges 0–200m, 201–700m, and 701-1,200m. The repetitive group designators {{are based on the}} 80-minute compartment.|$|E
5|$|The Little Shop of Horrors was {{developed}} when director Roger Corman was given temporary access to sets {{that had been}} left standing from his previous film, A Bucket of Blood.

5|$|The bats {{were entirely}} digital (except in shots {{containing}} {{only one or}} two bats), as it was decided directing larger numbers of real bats on set would be problematic.

5|$|The {{first two}} 1804 dollars (as {{well as the}} other coins for the <b>sets)</b> <b>were</b> struck in November 1834. Soon, Roberts' trip was {{expanded}} to Indo-China (then known as Annam) and Japan, so two additional <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> struck. The pieces struck {{under the auspices of the}} Mint are known as Class I 1804 dollars, and eight of that type are known to exist today. Roberts left for his trip in April 1835, and he presented one set each to the Sultan of Muscat and the King of Siam. The gift to the Sultan of Muscat was part of an exchange of diplomatic gifts that resulted in the Sultan presenting the Washington Zoo with a full-grown lion and lioness. Roberts fell ill in Bangkok and was taken to Macao, where he died in June 1835. Following Roberts' death, the remaining two <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> returned to the Mint without being presented to the dignitaries.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{inspired}} by Madame de Genlis's Adèle et Théodore (1782), Trimmer commissioned sets of illustrations of the Bible {{for which she}} provided the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and British history.

5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film.

5|$|At {{the taping}} of the episode, {{the cast and}} crew passed around yearbooks, {{custom-made}} by the production staff, and signed them for each other.

5|$|Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{equipped}} with {{two sets of}} Seetakt radar. One was mounted on the forward gun director, which was located {{on top of the}} bridge.
