40|$|Landscape metrics {{have often}} been used to analyse the spatial {{dynamics}} of habitat fragmentation accompanying forest loss. However, there are few studies of the spatial dynamics of natural forest succession, especially over periods longer than the operational period of imaging satellites. This study applies spatial metrics to understand the spatial processes of a 70 -year tropical secondary forest succession in Hong Kong, since World War 2. The highest rate of forest regeneration at 11 % a year from 1989 to 2001 occurred when the landscape achieved greatest habitat diversity and juxtapositioning of habitat patches. This rapid regeneration occurred by infilling from remnant forest in adjacent valleys rather than by an advance along a broad forest front, and led to simplification of the landscape and declining habitat diversity. It was also accompanied by declines in species richness and abundance in regenerated forest patches. Thus both habitat and woody plant species diversity show a humped trend over the successional period as disconnected forest patches amalgamate, and shade-intolerant pioneers are shaded out by taller pioneers. From this point onwards, the birds of mixed habitats including bulbuls and hwamei known to disperse seed in the study area, may become less effective as forest patches consolidate, {{and only a few}} forest mammals remain. The observed improved connectivity within forest patches and reduced edge disturbances accompanying landscape simplification provide better conditions for dispersion within forest of light-intolerant climax species from the oldest, species-rich valley sites to the newly regenerated areas. However, in addition to the loss of forest dispersal agents, other natural dispersal agents such as gravity, flash floods and slope wash involving downward processes may be ineffective, as forest has regenerated upwards to higher elevations. Progression to a mature, biodiverse and <b>stable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> may depend on introduction of dispersal agents other than those which have operated over recent decades. Forest patches with high internal connectivity, indicated by high Mean radius of Gyration (MRG) and low Mean Perimeter-to-Area Ratio (MPAR) would appear to offer the best movement opportunities and least disturbance to such introductions...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} the essential role of the bottom-up regulation induced mainly by herbivores of <b>stable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Most plants species are able to change {{the quality of their}} leaves after having been grazed by insect herbivores.

40|$|The {{forest cover}} of the Carpathians has been deeply {{transformed}} by productive activities over the past centuries. The forest cover, age and species structure of its ecosystems have been changed. Beech and fir forests were replaced by spruce monocultures.

These negative trends make it desirable to process the bioecological principles of maintenance the stability of mountain <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> The proposed bioecological principles of support and recovery of stability of <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{are part of the}} paradigm of mountain dendrology and silviculture.

40|$|Human-caused forest {{transitions}} {{are documented}} worldwide, especially during periods when land use by dense agriculturally-based populations intensified. However, {{the rate at}} which prehistoric human activities led to permanent deforestation is poorly resolved. In the South Island, New Zealand, the arrival of Polynesians c. 750 years ago resulted in dramatic forest loss and conversion of nearly half of native forests to open vegetation. This transformation, termed the Initial Burning Period, is documented in pollen and charcoal records, but its speed has been poorly constrained. High-resolution chronologies developed with a series of AMS radiocarbon dates from two lake sediment cores suggest the shift from forest to shrubland occurred within decades rather than centuries at drier sites. We examine two sites representing extreme examples of the magnitude of human impacts: a drier site that was inherently more vulnerable to human-set fires and a wetter, less burnable site. The astonishing rate of deforestation at the hands of small transient populations resulted from the intrinsic vulnerability of the native flora to fire and from positive feedbacks in post-fire vegetation recovery that increased landscape flammability. Spatially targeting burning in highly-flammable seral vegetation in forests rarely experiencing fire was sufficient to create an alternate fire-prone stable state. The New Zealand example illustrates how seemingly <b>stable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> can experience rapid and permanent conversions. Forest loss in New Zealand is among the fastest ecological transitions documented in the Holocene; yet equally rapid transitions can be expected in present-day regions wherever positive feedbacks support alternate fire-inhibiting, fire-prone stable states...|$|R

The study area (~ 2800 ha), included Tai Mo Shan and Shing Mun Country Parks in the NewTerritories of Hong Kong. A multi-scale object-based approach was applied to sequential aerial photographs and recent high-resolution satellite images to map structural changes in natural vegetation over the last 70 years, from 1945 to 2014. Temporal changes in the spatial extents of structural classes, and rates of change were determined {{for each of the}} periods; from 1945 to 1963, 1963 to 1989, 1989 to 2001, and 2001 to 2014. Also, spatial patterns of forest succession related to topography and morphology of the landscape were analyzed to determine the influence of changes in specific landscape structural parameters on forest succession. The mapping of structural changes associated with forest recovery over the past 70 years also enabled the recording and study of changes in species composition along the successional and environmental gradients for better understanding of the processes of ecosystem recovery in the degraded tropical landscape. Therefore, a forest inventory data consisting of 28 quadrats (20 x 20 m) was collected to analyze patterns of species composition associated with different stages of the succession, as well as explain the influence of topography, soil properties, and age of forest on the species assemblages. Spatial analysis of forest succession showed that natural forest has established rapidly in areas where a shrub cover was able to colonize in fire protected grasslands. The fastest period of forest regeneration, at 10. 9 % annually between 1989 and 2001, occurred when the landscape achieved greatest habitat diversity and juxtapositioning of habitat patches. This rapid regeneration occurred by infilling from the remnant forest in adjacent valleys rather than by an advance along a broad forest front, and led to a simplification of the landscape and declining habitat diversity. After 2001, succession to forest was slower, at 7. 8 % annually, as forest patches consolidated and edge habitats reduced. Significantly, the birds of open habitats including bulbuls and hwamei, known to disperse seed in the study area, may become less effective as forest patches consolidate, and this is a concern, given the loss of most forest mammals. Consequently, progression to a mature, biodiverse and <b>stable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> may depend on dispersal agents other than those which have operated over recent decades. Additionally, the practice of afforestation as a nursery stage on degraded hillsides, for the establishment of forest seedlings by natural invasion, is not supported by the evidence, as when the native Pinus massoniana plantations were eliminated by disease during the 1970 s, no forest or woody species were seen in the areas affected. In fact, there was a reversion to grassland, which persisted there for almost three decades, until recent shrub invasion. Secondary forest successions in Hong Kong starts with the transition of fire protected grassland into shrubland and colonization of early successional tree species that pave the way for intermediate or late successional tree species. Analysis of community data along the environmental gradients indicated that the topography and successional stages {{play an important role in}} the distributional patterns of species assemblages in the study area. At the landscape scale, elevation divided the species composition into two components, and these were further distinguished by successional stage at localized scale. Micro scale variations were further explained by convexity of terrain. Forest at higher elevation was found to be more diverse and had markedly higher concentration of soil carbon relative to nitrogen. Therefore, for restoration of the degraded ecosystem, it is recommended to recognize the distinctiveness of ecosystems at these two different elevations in the study area. Additionally, effective forest management policies could include sowing of native shrubs extending linearly from established forest, to maximize edge length between woody species and grasslands for better colonization, and planting of late successional species in areas where forest pioneers are dying out. Thus, for effective forest restoration, the roles of GIS and Remote Sensing are important in locating sites for assisting shrub encroachment, as well as for accelerating secondary succession where shrubland has already been established, and for managing natural succession by planting late successional tree species where the oldest forest pioneers are established.

40|$|Vegetation {{activity}} within continental Europe and the Mediterranean Basin {{is changing}} and extreme {{warm and dry}} events cause substantial reductions in vegetation activity. This region covers {{a wide variety of}} climate regimes, soil and land cover types. Distinguishing the response of the vegetation to extreme heat, drought and compound events as a function of land cover type, climate regime and soil type allows to better explain regional and local differences in vegetation response. This research analyses the temporal evolution of the impact of extreme heat, drought and compound events on the observed NDVI during the growing season, aggregated by land cover, soil and climate types. The results show 31 % reduction of the median vegetation activity, though highly variable depending on local conditions in climate, soil and vegetation type. The maximum impact was observed for extreme warm and dry compound events, one month after the extreme event occurrence, and recovery took up to 4 months. Furthermore, the impact of extreme heat and drought on vegetation activity increases when moving to colder climates with the largest change occurring in high latitude natural land cover types. The soil properties affecting the impact of extreme droughts on vegetation activity were mainly related to root depth limitations, water regulating properties and ecophysiological properties. Within a temperate climate, water availability and water regulating properties of the soil were found most important; in water limiting conditions those showing limiting root development con- ditions linked to abrupt textural changes (e. g. Luvisol), accumulated salts (e. g. Solonchak) or unfavorable soil structure (compaction, swelling/shrinking) were more impacted and had a slower recovery. Within a hot and dry temperate climate, there were major differences in the overall productivity rather than a different response to extreme events. These differences were mainly related to growth limiting conditions due to accumulated salts in the soil profile (e. g. Calcisol, Solonchak). Furthermore, it was found that vegetation activity of <b>stable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> was strongly impacted by extreme climatic events, especially in Northern Europe. The controlling fac- tors defining the impact of extreme warm and dry events were found to be a complex combinatory of soil, climate and ecophysiological properties (e. g. Podzols and mycorrhiza networks in Northern Europe). With the expected increase of extreme climatic events, the current stable and productive sys- tems will be most affected and large reductions in vegetation activity can be expected, partly {{due to the lack of}} ecophysiological adaptation of plants towards the change in climate...|$|R

Each year, approximately 600 ha of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in southwest Western Australia are mined and then rehabilitated. The mining and rehabilitation process {{is described by}} Koch (2007). Briefly, areas to be mined are defined and the vegetation cleared. The topsoil is then removed (top 100 mm) and respread on another area to be rehabilitated. The overburden is then scraped {{to a depth of}} 200 – 800 mm and stockpiled for later respreading. After this, the remaining caprocklayer is blasted and this, plus the underlying friable bauxite, is mined and taken away for processing. After ore extraction, pits are reshaped to integrate with the surrounding landscape and deep ripped to relieve mining-related compaction. Overburden and topsoil are returned, along with woody debris for fauna habitat, then areas are ripped again along the contour and seeded. Rehabilitation of Alcoa’s Western Australian bauxite mines has been, and continues to be, an evolving process. Environmental requirements are the subject of State Government Agreements, which have become progressively more stringent as each new agreement for a mine site has been drawn up. For instance, the first Agreement in 1961 for the Jarrahdale No. 1 mine simply required the mined area to be left tidy, the 1972 Agreement for the next mine site required the company to reafforest the area and prevent soil erosion, and later agreements bound the company to continuous research and monitoring to gauge the effectiveness of restoration techniques.

The amount of data, information and knowledge involved in the management process is often overwhelming. Integrated decision support systems may help managers make consistently good decisions concerning <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> management. Integrating computer systems using a system-specific or custom approach has many disadvantages. We compare a variety of current approaches, suggest characteristics that an approach should have, and propose that DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) is an approach that is very suitable for <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> decision support system integration...|$|R

40|$|Behaviour of radiocesium in {{ecosystems}} {{is described}} for two <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in the Federal State of Rhineland-Palatinate. The patterns of distribution of radiocesium in <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> mobility {{and availability of}} radiocesium in <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{and the role of}} different flows and processes of radiocesium transfer in <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are given special attention. Eventual correlations of distribution patterns and transfers of radiocesium and the closely related bioelement sodium are checked. The study also investigates in howfar soil liming has an influence on the bio-availability of radiocesium and whether sodium fertilization can reduce radiocesium fallout after accidents and thus reduce contamination of forest fruit, mushrooms and game. Studies were conducted in a pine stand on quartzite under clay in the upper regions of the Hunsrueck mountains and in an oak Quercus petraea stand with beech undercrop on medium vanegated sandstone. Both <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are typical for the Rhineland-Palatinate in terms of site, stocking, and immission.

Moso bamboo <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services value are divided into six groups: water storage, soil conservation, C fixation and O 2 release, nutrients accumulation, environment purification, biodiversity conservation in this study. Chinese Fir Plantation as the control was to compare. The results showed that: (1) The total value of Moso bamboo <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services in Suichang County was 1260. 40 million yuan/a, services values of water storage, soil conservation, C fixation and O 2 release, nutrients accumulation, environment purification, biodiversity conservation were respectively 741. 00 million yuan/a, 81. 00 million yuan/a, 331. 00 million yuan/a, 21. 6 million yuan/a, 32. 2 million yuan/a, 53. 6 million yuan/a. (2) The total value of Moso bamboo <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services in Suichang County has increased 302. 80 million yuan/a, the growth was about 31. 62 %. (3) In the six groups, all of Moso bamboo ecosystem services value more than the same area of Chinese Fir forest plantation.

Here, we estimated the spatial {{and temporal}} patterns of C storage from 1993 – 2008 in Hainan’s <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> by combining our measured data with four consecutive national forest inventories data. Forest coverage increased from 20. 7 % in the 1950 s to 56. 4 % in the 2010 s. The average C density of 163. 7 Mg C/ha in Hainan’s <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{in this study was}} slightly higher than that of China’s mainland forests, but was remarkably lower than that in the tropical forests worldwide. Total <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> C storage in Hainan increased from 109. 51 Tg in 1993 to 279. 17 Tg in 2008. Soil C accounted for more than 70 % of total <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> C. The spatial distribution of forest C storage in Hainan was uneven, reflecting differences in land use change and forest management. The potential carbon sequestration of <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> was 77. 3 Tg C if all forested lands were restored to natural tropical forests. To increase the C sequestration potential on Hainan Island, future forest management should focus on the conservation of natural forests, selection of tree species, planting of understory species, an...|$|R
