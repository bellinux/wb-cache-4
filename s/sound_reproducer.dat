50|$|Birmingham <b>Sound</b> <b>Reproducers</b> was a British {{manufacturer}} of record player turntables.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{the company}} became a {{subsidiary}} of BSR (Housewares) Ltd., originally Birmingham <b>Sound</b> <b>Reproducers,</b> manufacturers of turntables for playing records.|$|R
50|$|Daniel McLean McDonald founded Birmingham <b>Sound</b> <b>Reproducers</b> as {{a private}} company in 1932 in the West Midlands of England, UK. By 1947, the company chiefly {{manufactured}} communications sets (intercoms), laboratory test equipment, and sound recording and reproducing instruments, including phonographs.|$|R
2500|$|... 1932: The Birmingham <b>Sound</b> <b>Reproducers</b> {{company is}} {{set up in the}} West Midlands. In the early 1950s, Samuel Margolin begins buying auto-changing {{turntables}} from BSR, using them as the basis of his Dansette record player. Over the next twenty years, [...] "Dansette" [...] becomes a household word in Britain. By 1957, BSR has grown to employ 2,600 workers. In addition to manufacturing their own brand of player—the Monarch Automatic Record Changer that could select and play 7", 10" [...] and 12" [...] records at 33, 45 or 78 rpm, changing between the various settings automatically—BSR McDonald supplied turntables and autochangers to most of the world's record player manufacturers, eventually gaining 87% of the market. By 1977, BSR's various factories produced over 250,000 units a week.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, the Pico {{engineers}} jointly {{developed a}} LP record turntable, the ADC Accutrac 4000, with Birmingham <b>Sound</b> <b>Reproducers,</b> {{at the time}} the largest manufacturer of record changers in the world. It could be programmed to play selected tracks, and could be operated by a remote control using ultrasound signals, which sparked the idea of remote control for lights and appliances. By 1975, the X10 project was conceived, so named because it was the tenth project. In 1978, X10 products started to appear in RadioShack and Sears stores. Together with BSR a partnership was formed, with the name X10 Ltd. At that time the system consisted of a 16 channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} over 119% growth in {{bilateral}} trade in goods and services between 2007 and 2012. The UK exported £450 million {{of goods and services}} to Bangladesh in 2013. 71% of this was services. Exports of goods were £131 million in 2014. The UK’s main exports to Bangladesh in 2013 were nuclear reactors for medical purpose, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances / parts electrical machinery and equipment / parts; <b>sound</b> recorders and <b>reproducers,</b> television image and <b>sound</b> recorders and <b>reproducers,</b> and parts / accessories, iron and steel residues and waste from the food industries; prepared animal fodder.|$|R

5000|$|The {{tone arm}} {{got its name}} {{before the age of}} electronics. It {{originally}} served to conduct actual sound waves from a purely mechanical [...] "pickup" [...] called a <b>sound</b> box or <b>reproducer</b> to a so-described [...] "amplifying" [...] horn. The earliest electronic record players, introduced at the end of 1925, had massive electromagnetic pickups that contained a horseshoe magnet, used disposable steel needles, and weighed several ounces. Their full weight rested on the record, providing ample tracking force to overcome their low compliance but causing rapid record wear. The tone arms were rudimentary and remained so even after lighter crystal pickups appeared about ten years later. When fine-grooved vinyl records were introduced in the late 1940s, still smaller and lighter crystal (later, ceramic) cartridges with semi-permanent jewel styluses became standard. In the mid-1950s these were joined by a new generation of magnetic cartridges that bore little resemblance to their crude ancestors. Far smaller tracking forces became possible and the balanced arm came into use.|$|R
40|$|This study {{introduces}} Export (X) supply {{models to}} analyse {{the determinants of}} the X supply from the theoretical and empirical perspectives from Australia tothe Rest of the World (RoW) and to eight selected Trade Deficit (TD) countries in four selected TD categories. The eight selected TD countries are China, France, Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States of America and four TD categories are Category 30 - Pharmaceutical Products; Category 84 - Nuclear Reactors, Boilers, Machinery and Mechanical Appliances; Parts Thereof; Category 85 - Electrical Machinery and Equipment and Parts Thereof; Sound Recorders and Producers, Television Image and <b>Sound</b> Recorders and <b>Reproducers,</b> and Parts and Accessories of Such Articles and Category 87 - Vehicles Other Than Railway or Tramway Rolling-Stock, and Parts and Accessories Thereof. The total of 33 X supply models are estimated side-by-side, based on both the monetary – Australian Dollar (AUD) and Quantity (QTY) values, giving in total 66 X supply models. This study finds that the most significant variables in {{the determination of the}} X supply are real income followed by relative prices, while the X supply is mostly responsive to changes in real income and mostly unresponsive to changes in real prices. Finally, this study also finds that inconclusive evidence exists that capacity utilization increases the X supply, while some evidence exists that the X supply has considerably increased in most of the categories since the introduction of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) in Australi...|$|R
