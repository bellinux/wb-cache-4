40|$|The SimER (Simulation of Environmental Risks) {{code was}} {{developed}} over a four-year period, {{and the first}} version was released in June 2004. It has been designed for application in assessments of environmental remediation and other end points associated with contaminated land, and performance assessments for radioactive waste disposal. SimER represents a major advance in safety assessment modelling. It offers a unique range of functionality that, until now, has not been available in any <b>single</b> <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> tool. For {{the first time in}} a single application, it is possible to define a fully probabilistic three dimensional physical representation of an evolving landscape and engineered features, compute water and gas flows, model chemical reactions, calculate contaminant transport and evaluate a wide range of impacts. The capability to represent environmental change explicitly is particularly important for problems where impacts to humans and the environment may not occur for extended periods. Modern computing power, coupled with efficient model algorithms, means that complex environmental systems can now be assessed for periods of thousands of years in a few tens of minutes.

40|$|Safety of {{near surface}} {{disposal}} facilities {{is a primary}} focus and objective of stakeholders involved in radioactive waste management of low and intermediate level waste and <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> is an important tool contributing to the evaluation and demonstration of the overall safety of these facilities. It plays significant role in different stages of development of these facilities (site characterization, design, operation, closure) and especially for those facilities for which <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> has not been performed or safety has not been demonstrated yet and the future has not been decided. <b>Safety</b> <b>assessments</b> also create {{the basis for the}} safety arguments presented to nuclear regulators, public and other interested parties in respect of the safety of existing facilities, the measures to upgrade existing facilities and development of new facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has initiated a number of research coordinated projects in the field of development and improvement of approaches to <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> and methodologies for <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of near surface disposal facilities, such as NSARS (Near Surface Radioactive Waste Disposal <b>Safety</b> <b>Assessment</b> Reliability Study) and ISAM (Improvement of <b>Safety</b> <b>Assessment</b> Methodologies for Near Surface Disposal Facilities) projects.

40|$|ABSTRACTAlthough a <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of damaged ships, which {{considers}} {{environmental conditions}} such as waves and wind, is important in both the design and operation phases of ships, in Korea, rules or guidelines to conduct such assessments are not yet developed. However, NATO and European maritime societies have developed guidelines for a <b>safety</b> <b>assessment.</b> Therefore, it is required to develop rules or guidelines for <b>safety</b> <b>assessments</b> such as the Naval Ship Code (NSC) of NATO. Before the <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of a damaged ship can be performed, the available damage scenarios must be developed and the <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> criteria must be established. In this paper, the parameters related to damage by accidents are identified and categorized when developing damage scenarios.

This traditional approach {{plays a key}} role in the design of new dams, as well as the <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of existing dams.

In recent years, many developed countries have moved towards a risk-based approach in dam safety management. This approach overcomes the weaknesses of traditional approaches to dam safety evaluation; to serve this new model of practice, various dam <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> tools have been created.

40|$|Flow sliding of {{submerged}} slopes {{in front}} of dikes affects flood safety. The occurrence of flow sliding may result, sometimes with delay, in a failure mode and consequent flooding. The current <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> method for flow sliding does not consider the interaction between flow sliding and failure modes.

40|$|The high {{nonlinearity}} and nonstationarity {{has resulted}} in the huge challenge in structural <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of bridge in the health monitoring by using the traditional method. In this paper, a novel technique is introduced to solve the problem in the structural <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of bridge by the integration of the wavelet and the D-S evidential theory. In the context, the effects of live-load deflections and strains of the main girder are firstly extracted from the total measurement by wavelet analysis, and then they are used in the primary <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> associated with the change of inherent frequency of the bridge by using artificial neural networks. And futher the basic probability assignments are constructed according to results of the primary assessment through the relative artificial neural network. Finally, the integrated assessment of the bridge is completed by the information fusion based on the D-S evidential theory. The result from the application of a real bridge indicate that the proposed method is a promising way in the <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of large scale bridge in the future.

40|$|With the {{increased}} complexity and higher safety commitment of modern safety–critical systems, <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> models {{of these systems}} are increasingly complicated and obscure. In practice, however, there is insufficient guidance {{on how to improve}} the understanding and evaluation of these models, while they are often used as important items of evidence in safety cases. This significantly threatens the confidence we can have in the soundness of safety cases. In this thesis, a coherent, structured approach to establishing confidence in <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> evidence is developed. Firstly, a means for the structured documentation of the core data elements of <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> models is defined, to support the development of both primary safety arguments and confidence arguments. Secondly, a model of evidence is developed to support the interfacing of <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> evidence with <b>safety</b> arguments. Thirdly, a structured cross-model inconsistency analysis method is proposed as a means of scrutinizing potentially inadequate models. Finally, an expanded argument construction process is established to add rigour to safety case development, and a number of argument patterns are designed to guide and inspire structured justification of the adequacy of <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> models as evidence for safety critical systems. The evaluation of the approach is carried out primarily through examples and cases studies. It is demonstrated that the approach is feasible and the confidence issue in <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> evidence is addressed more explicitly and more rigorously by using the approach...|$|R
