25|$|Biofilms {{have become}} {{problematic}} in several food industries {{due to the}} ability to form on plants and during industrial processes. Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment. The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat flow across a surface and increase <b>surface</b> <b>corrosion</b> and frictional resistance of fluids. These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and overall loss of products. Along with economic problems biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due {{to the ability to}} make the food more resistant to disinfectants As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year. Biofilms have been connected to about 80% of bacterial infections in the United States.|$|E
500|$|For {{the last}} few decades the Burnside Fountain has been in disrepair. A 1986 {{inventory}} of public memorials in Worcester, compiled by the municipal parks and recreation department, listed the fountains problems as [...] "chipped stone, water system, bronze <b>surface</b> <b>corrosion,</b> rust staining, litter," [...] and the Smithsonian Art Inventories Catalog surveyed the fountain in September 1994 and listed its condition as [...] "treatment urgent." [...] With the one-hundredth anniversary of the Burnside Fountain coming in 2012, there has been renewed interest in restoring the fountain. Restoration estimates run between USD $40,000 to $60,000, which is more than the city is willing to spend. Probably because of this, there are no official plans to restore the fountain, as of June 2012.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} {{of water with}} oil {{continues to be a}} problem for engineers and the oil producers. Since 1865 when water was coproduced with hydrocarbons, it has challenged and frustrated the industry on how to separate the valuable from the disposable. According to Rehm et al (1983), innovation over the years has led from the skim pit to installation of the stock tank, to the gunbarrel, to the freewater knockout, to the hay-packed coalescer and most recently to the Performax Matrix Plate Coalescer, an enhanced gravity settling separator. The history of water treating for the most part has been sketchy and spartan. There is little economic value to the produced water, and it represents an extra cost for the producer to arrange for its disposal. Today oil fields produce greater quantities of water than they produce oil. Along with greater water production are emulsions and dispersions which are more difficult to treat. The separation process becomes interlocked with a myriad of contaminants as the last drop of oil is being recovered from the reservoir. In some instances it is preferable to separate and to remove water from the well fluid before it flows through pressure reductions, such as those caused by chokes and valves. Such water removal may prevent difficulties that could be caused downstream by the water, such as corrosion which can be referred to as being a chemical reactions that occurs whenever a gas or liquid chemically attacks an exposed metallic <b>surface.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> is usually accelerated by warm temperatures and likewise by the presence of acids and salts. Other factors that affect the removal of water from oil include hydrate formation and the formation of tight emulsion that may be difficult to resolve into oil and water. The water can be separated from the oil in a three-phase separator by use of chemicals and gravity separation. If the three-phase separator is not large enough to separatethe water adequately, it can be separated in a free-water knockout vessel installed upstream or downstream of the separators.|$|E

40|$|Cooling {{water systems}} are {{extremely}} vulnerable to microbial contamination. Problems occur when microbes begin to proliferate and attach to system <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> can also result from unchecked microbial growth. Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can combine with organic compounds to form biofilms. The microbes in these films produce products of metabolism that are corrosive in nature. The result is pitting and corrosion of metal components. To eliminate {{the threat of}} such potential problems and achieve optimum system efficiency, microbiological activity within a system must be properly controlled.
