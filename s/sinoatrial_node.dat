5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node,</b> a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of the}} pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
5|$|The normal rhythmical heart beat, called sinus rhythm, is {{established}} by the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node,</b> the heart's pacemaker. Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing the heart muscle to contract.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> {{is found}} in {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E

50|$|Abnormal {{development}} of the heart results in impaired doubles of conductive nodes, as well as faulty electrical fibers throughout the ventricles. Individuals with right atrial isomerism develop 2 <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>nodes,</b> as they have 2 mirrored right atria, whereas those with left atrial isomerism fail to develop a sinus node at all. Thus, patients with left atrial isomerism {{are more likely to}} experience atrial fibrillation, or irregular rapid heart beat, and abnormal heart rhythm, known as atrial flutter. Development of the atrioventricular node and bundle of His largely depends on physiological looping of the ventricles. Abnormal looping of the ventricles contributes to arrhythmia and heart block in fetuses.|$|R

5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node,</b> located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> uses calcium {{to cause}} a depolarising signal {{transduction}} pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.|$|E
50|$|In normal individuals, {{electrical}} {{activity in the}} heart is initiated in the <b>sinoatrial</b> (SA) <b>node</b> (located in the right atrium), propagates to the atrioventricular (AV) node, and then through the bundle of His to the ventricles of the heart.

The model provides a user-defined number of ionic currents, employing two-gate Hodgkin-Huxley type kinetics.

Using a multiobjective optimisation approach, the generic ionic model was optimised to accurately reproduce multiple action potential waveforms recorded from central and peripheral <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>nodes</b> and right atrial and left atrial myocytes from rabbit cardiac tissue preparations, under different electrical stimulus protocols and pharmacological conditions.

5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node.</b> These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E
25|$|While {{heart rhythm}} is {{regulated}} entirely by the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> under normal conditions, heart rate is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node.</b> The accelerans nerve provides sympathetic input {{to the heart}} by releasing norepinephrine onto {{the cells of the}} <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> (SA node), and the vagus nerve provides parasympathetic input to the heart by releasing acetylcholine onto <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> cells. Therefore, stimulation of the accelerans nerve increases heart rate, while stimulation of the vagus nerve decreases it.|$|E
25|$|Cells in the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node,</b> {{located in}} the right atrium of the heart, spontaneously {{depolarize}} approximately 100 times per minute. Although all of the heart's cells {{have the ability to}} generate action potentials that trigger cardiac contraction, the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> normally initiates it, simply because it generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas. Hence, these cells generate the normal sinus rhythm and are called pacemaker cells as they directly control the heart rate. In the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control, cells in the SA node will rhythmically discharge. The <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> is richly innervated by the autonomic nervous system, which up or down regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of the pacemaker cells.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sinoatrial</b> (SA) <b>node</b> {{is located}} in {{posterior}} aspect of the right atrium, next to the superior vena cava.

25|$|Electrical {{activity}} in the normal human heart begins when a cardiac action potential arises in the <b>sinoatrial</b> (SA) <b>node,</b> which {{is located in the}} right atrium. From there, the electrical stimulus is transmitted via internodal pathways to the atrioventricular (AV) node. After a brief delay at the AV node, the stimulus travels through the bundle of His to the left and right bundle branches and then to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular myocardium.|$|R
25|$|In AF, {{the normal}} regular {{electrical}} impulses {{generated by the}} <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> in the right atrium of the heart are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical impulses usually originating in {{the roots of the}} pulmonary veins.

25|$|The normal {{electrical}} conduction {{system of}} the heart allows the impulse that is generated by the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node</b> (SA node) of the heart to be propagated to and stimulate the myocardium (muscular layer of the heart). When the myocardium is stimulated, it contracts. It is the ordered stimulation of the myocardium that allows efficient contraction of the heart, thereby allowing blood to be pumped to the body.|$|E
50|$|A {{supraventricular}} extrasystole (SVES) is an extrasystole or premature electrical impulse in the heart, generated {{above the}} level of the ventricle. This can be either a premature atrial contraction or a premature impulse from the atrioventricular node. SVES should be viewed in contrast to a premature ventricular contraction which has a ventricular origin and the associated QRS change. Instead of the electrical impulse beginning in the <b>sinoatrial</b> (SA) <b>node</b> and propagating to the atrioventricular (AV) node, the signal is conducted both to the ventricle and back to the SA node where the signal began.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the circulatory re-sponse of the denervated heart to ex-ercise, the authors studied 15 patients with an orthotopic transplanted heart (TH). Mean age was 48 &plusmn; 10 (range twenty-five to sixty-two) years. All patients underwent a symptom-lim-ited bicycle stress testing following a continuous protocol increasing the work load by 30 watts every three minutes. Exercise test was performed 16 &plusmn; 9 months after operation. Fifteen healthy subjects matched for age {{were used as}} the control group. There were significant differences (p < 0. 01) in heart rate, at rest, peak exercise, and at five minutes of the recovery period, in maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and in dura-tion of exercise between TH patients and controls. Synchronization between recipi-ent and donor <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>nodes</b> was observed in 10 of 15 patients. A case at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 11, 2016 ang. sagepub. comDownloaded from 651 of silent myocardial ischemia was also observed in a patient with vascu-litis and acute rejection. In conclusion, the lack of neural control in TH patients allows them to maintain a normal resting cardiac output but precludes attaining a nor-mal maximum oxygen uptake, de-spite a normal contractile state. The high resting heart rate due to para-sympathetic denervation constitutes an important limiting factor for an adequate chronotropic reserve.

25|$|These purkinje fibers (p-fibers) {{found in}} the hearts {{moderator}} bands are a specialized cardiac muscle fiber that causes the heart to contract. The purkinje cells are mostly found within both the endocardium and the sub-endocardium.

25|$|The {{heart rate}} is rhythmically {{generated}} by the <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>node.</b> It is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata. The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.|$|E

This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system. Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of cardiac drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.|$|E
