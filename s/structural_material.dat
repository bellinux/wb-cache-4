5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E

One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E

40|$|Titanium {{aluminide}} (TiAl) alloys exhibit high specific strength, low density, good oxidation, corrosion, and {{creep resistance}} at elevated temperatures, making them good candidate materials for aerospace and automotive applications.

40|$|Hollow <b>structural</b> <b>materials</b> {{with low}} density and high surface area which can {{encapsulate}} small molecules, {{are widely used}} in environmental protection, drug delivery system, electronic and other fields. Because templating method is simple, and owns high repeat rate, good prediction and many other advantages, it is particularly interesting and frequently used to fabricate hollow <b>structural</b> <b>materials</b> with homogeneous, dense layers. Templating methods can be divided broadly into two classes according to the properties of templates used in synthesis, which can be called traditional templating methods and self-templating methods, respectively. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the preparation of hollow <b>structural</b> <b>materials</b> via templating methods was provided. The progress of two traditional templating methods: hard templates and soft templates were firstly summarized. The {{research and development of}} hollow <b>structural</b> <b>materials</b> prepared via four self-templating methods: Ostwald ripening, Kirkendall effect, galvanic replacement and chemical etching were mainly reviewed and commented in the later.

25|$|Plating, painting, and the {{application}} of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant material between the damaging environment and the <b>structural</b> <b>material.</b> Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise to plate with active metal such as zinc or cadmium.|$|E
25|$|Since 2001, {{expanded}} polypropylene (EPP) foams {{have been}} gaining in popularity and in application as a <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> in hobbyist radio control model aircraft.

In consequence, a radio-control model whose wings and fuselage are constructed from EPP foam is extremely resilient, and able to absorb impacts that would result in complete destruction of models made from lighter traditional materials, such as balsa or even EPS foams.|$|E

25|$|By 1895, steel had {{replaced}} cast iron as skyscrapers' <b>structural</b> <b>material.</b> Its malleability {{allowed it to}} be formed {{into a variety of}} shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections. The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks is that as more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable floor spaces are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.|$|E
25|$|Although silicon {{is readily}} {{available}} {{in the form of}} silicates, very few organisms use it directly. Diatoms, radiolaria and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> for skeletons. In more advanced plants, the silica phytoliths (opal phytoliths) are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell; some plants, for example rice, need silicon for their growth. There is some evidence that silicon is important to nail, hair, bone and skin health in humans, for example in studies that show that premenopausal women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density, and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis. Silicon is needed for synthesis of elastin and collagen, of which the aorta contains the greatest quantity in the human body.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by Abraham Darby, who made great strides using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale in 1709. However, the coke pig iron he made was used mostly {{for the production of}} cast iron goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs. Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron in forges until the mid-1750s, when his son Abraham Darby II built Horsehay and Ketley furnaces (not far from Coalbrookdale). By then, coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron. Since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it began being a <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> following the building of the innovative Iron Bridge in 1778 by Abraham Darby III.|$|E
