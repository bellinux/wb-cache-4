40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{processing}} {{and interpretation of}} data from a <b>seismological</b> <b>survey,</b> on Ekstroem Ice Shelf Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. This data was obtained with a new approach: using a vibrator to generate spatial waves on ice, Vibroseismics. one advantage is that more energy is transmitted into the subsurface with a deeper penetration than the typically used explosives in firn/ice covered areas. Seismic surveys are indispensable for investigations with sub-ice glaciological and geological objectives. Two profiles were shot, one is passing a shear zone of two different ice flows and the grounding line, where ice shields slide into water {{and contribute to the}} sea level. The second profile shows the buildup of the continental basement and shelf sediments. An outstanding problem during processing of this data was the removal of multiple reflections. Attenuation of multiples was reached and seismic cross sections about two profiles which outline glaciological and geological important features are presented and interpreted...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the catalog of recent (1974 - 1998) seismicity in Mexico, {{based on the}} automatically compiled reports of the Servicio Sismológico Nacional (Mexican <b>Seismological</b> <b>Survey).</b> To this end, we employed various tools developed {{for the analysis of}} seismic catalogs as well as for detailed studies of seismicity characteristics. Such tools comprise both newly developed techniques and traditional methods which deal with the subject of artificial and natural variations of seismicity. We found that the time characteristics of reporting suffered a drastic change during 1988. Before 1988 routine procedures involved locating a large number of events and assigning magnitude only to the largest. After 1988 a decrease in the location of small events and {{a significant increase in the}} number of magnitude determinations were noted. The minimum magnitude of completeness for the period 1988 - 1998 is Md = 4. 3. A comparison of the frequency-magnitude distributions for mb (PDE) and Md (SSN) indicates that mb magnitudes are basically equivalent to Md for the range M ≤ 5. 0. These results are important in that they show that when using statistics which do not take into consideration the period of reporting, serious biases could be introduced. Conversely, our results provide means to correct for the unhomogeneity of the catalog. In terms of the most significant seismicity variations in both space and time which could be due to natural causes we found several cases that need to be studied individually...|$|E

5000|$|It is a Ramform type ship-design with {{an unusual}} hull shape. The shape of the hull is {{characteristic}} with a sharp bow, sinusoidal waterline, a descending rear body that ends in a straight cut-off stern where the ship has the largest width. Because of the very large width of the ship it will have an operational metacentric height of about 16 meters. The ship can continue to operate even with {{large parts of the}} interior under the waterline, when the ship's exact trimming is uncritical. The same goes for cargo shift, if the ship is exposed to icing or large amounts of water on deck. This makes Marjata a very stable sensor platform, she is also built with a very low noise signature, so that the ship itself does not interfere with the onboard sensors. Marjata also has large internal bay for computing and analyzing of reconnaissance data. The ramform type ships are often used for <b>seismological</b> <b>surveys</b> of the seabed.

40|$|Nowadays, an {{increasing}} amount of seismic data is collected by daily observatory routines. The basic step for successfully analyzing those data {{is the correct}} detection of various event types. However, the visually scanning process is a time-consuming task. Applying standard techniques for detection like the STA/LTA trigger still requires the manual control for classification. Here, we present a useful alternative. The incoming data stream is scanned automatically for events of interest. A stochastic classifier, called hidden Markov model, is learned for each class of interest enabling the recognition of highly variable waveforms. In contrast to other automatic techniques as neural networks or support vector machines the algorithm allows to start the classification from scratch as soon as interesting events are identified. Neither the tedious process of collecting training samples nor a time-consuming configuration of the classifier is required. An approach originally introduced for the volcanic task force action allows to learn classifier properties from a single waveform example and some hours of background recording. Besides a reduction of required workload this also enables to detect very rare events. Especially the latter feature provides a milestone point {{for the use of}} seismic devices in alpine warning systems. Furthermore, the system offers the opportunity to flag new signal classes that have not been defined before. We demonstrate the application of the classification system using a data set from the Swiss <b>Seismological</b> <b>Survey</b> achieving very high recognition rates. In detail we document all refinements of the classifier providing a step-by-step guide for the fast set up of a well-working classification syste...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Asal-Ghoubbet (AG) Rift has {{sustained}} a major volcano-tectonic rifting episode in 1978 {{and has been}} subsequently monitored with continuous geodetic and <b>seismological</b> <b>surveys.</b> It is therefore an ideal place to study the transient magmato-tectonic processes that operate after a rifting episode. We examine the space-time evolution of ∼ 2500 Md ≤ 2. 8 earthquakes recorded in the rift from 1979 to 2001. We focus on the relationships between this seismic activity and both the three-dimensional structure of the rift and its postrifting behavior depicted from geodesy. The results highlight the major role of the central magmatic system (Fieale-Shark Bay) on the structure, seismic activity, and overall behavior of the rift. From 1978 to 1986, the rift opens at a fast rate, yet mainly aseismically; the opening is magmatically driven and accommodated. Since 1986, when the opening rate abruptly decreased, the seismicity is concentrated in {{the central part of}} the rift and reveals pulses of activity of the central volcanic system. These pulses result from that magmatic zone undergoing alternating stretching and inflating episodes. Thus, while the plate-driven induced stresses have been rebuilding in the rift since 1987, the rift opening is still essentially accommodated in the axial magmatic zone. The AG Rift has thus {{sustained a}} postrifting unsteady opening over more than 23 years following its stretching episode. That transient opening has essentially occurred aseismically, and most tectonic faults remain relaxed and locked...|$|R
40|$|This study {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} structural, geochemical and <b>seismological</b> <b>surveys</b> carried out at Nisyros volcano (Aegean Sea, Greece) during 1999 – 2001. Field mapping and mesostructural measurements at the summit caldera (Lakki plain) indicate that faults follow two main strikes: NE-SW and N-S. The N-S striking fault depicts extensional features accommodating the left-lateral component of motion of the NE-SW- striking main faults. The NE-SW preferred strike of the Lakki faults and of the mineral-filled veins {{as well as the}} distribution and NE-SW elongation of the hydrothermal craters indicate that tectonics {{plays a major role in}} controlling the fluid pathway in the Nisyros caldera. The same NE-SW trend is depicted by CO 2 anomalies revealed through detailed soil CO 2 flux surveys, thus indicating a structural control on the pattern of the hydrothermal degassing. Degassing processes account for a thermal energy release of about 43 MW, most of which occurs at Lofos dome, an area that was affected by hydrothermal eruptions in historical times. The seismic study was conducted in June 2001, using a deployment specifically aimed at detecting signals of magmatic-hydrothermal origin. Our instruments recorded local and regional earthquakes, a few local longperiod events (LP), and bursts of monochromatic tremor. Local earthquake activity is concentrated beneath the caldera, at depths generally shallower than 6 km. Planewave decomposition of tremor signal indicates a shallow (< 200 m) source located in the eastern part of the caldera. Conversely, LP events depict a source located beneath the central part of the caldera, in the area of Lofos dome, at depths in the 1 – 2 -km range. In agreement with geochemical and structural measurements, these data suggest that both the deeper and shallower part of the hydrothermal system are subjected to instability in the fluid flow regimes, probably consequent to transient pressurization of the reservoir. These instabilities may be related to input of hot fluids from the deeper magmatic system, as suggested by the variations in geochemical parameters observed after the 1997 – 1999 unrest episode. The significance of seismological and geochemical indicators as precursors of hydrothermal explosive activity at Nisyros is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{attenuation}} behaviour {{is controlled}} by {{a large number of}} wave modification mechanisms. The characteristics of some of these mechanisms are specific to a local area, whilst the remainder can be generalised to the entire seismic region. Factors representing these mechanisms are often not resolved. A new attenuation modelling approach is demonstrated in this paper (using Hong Kong as a case study), to evaluate individual regional and local wave modification factors. Shear wave velocity (SWV) information for the four prevalent geological formations found in Hong Kong was first obtained: (a) at shallow depths from instrumented boreholes; (b) at depths of up to 100 – 200 m from measurements using the Microtremor SPatial Auto-Correlation (SPAC) technique; (c) at depths of up to 1. 5 km from the monitoring of quarry blasts; and (d) at depths from 1. 5 to 8 km in the hard basement rock layers from results of <b>seismological</b> refraction <b>surveys.</b> The upper-crust amplification factor calculated from the four modelled rock SWV profiles was then combined with predicted attenuation parameters to determine the upper-crust modification factor (filter function) incorporating the local wave modification characteristics associated with Hong Kong geological formations. Such functions may then be combined with the regional attenuation characteristics {{in that part of the}} South China region. A seismic attenuation model was developed by combining the upper-crust modification factor with the regional source function of intra-plate earthquakes, based on stochastic simulations. The ground shaking model developed from the presented methodology is supported by the comparison with macro-seismic data of seven historical earthquake events affecting Hong Kong. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{first set}} of twenty {{uncorrected}} digitized earthquake accelerograms was published in July, 1969, as Volume I, Part A, of the present series. That volume also contained introductory material and background information describing the methods used, accuracies, etc., which should be referred to by all users of the data. The San Fernando Earthquake provided records of sufficient importance that the original plan was interrupted after two parts, and Part C contained {{the first of the}} San Fernando Earthquake accelerograms. This issue continues the San Fernando accelerograms and contains fifteen records consisting of three records each from four buildings, two ground level records at the Hollywood Storage Building and the record from the Old Ridge Route at Castaic. Some comments on these records follow. ID 056. Castaic, Old Ridge Route. At 0. 97 seconds after triggering the drive mechanism malfunctioned briefly and the film was stationary for a short length of time with the recording light on. The actual time is indicated by asterisks in the computer printout and by arrows in the computer plot. The lost portion of trace can be estimated to be one to two seconds long for the following reasons. The gap between the time marks is normally 0. 5 seconds, but the particular gap spanning the missing part measures only 0. 3 seconds. Hence at least 0. 2 seconds is missing. In addition, {{at least one of the}} time marks occurred during the pause, so that the possible lengths of the pause are 0. 7, 1. 2, 1. 7, 2. 2, [...] . seconds. The maximum amplitudes of the missing traces can be ascertained from the thickness of the recorded vertical line for two of the three traces and these are less than the peak amplitudes occurring during the following one or two seconds. The changes in density along the recorded vertical line indicate that not a great many of the large oscillations of the trace took place during the pause and that a duration of 1. 2 seconds is realistic. Also the records from the Lake Hughes Array Stations 4 and 12, within 26 km of Castaic, and a similar distance from the epicenter, 25 - 29 km, indicate that the strong motion portion in this vicinity was only a few seconds in duration. These complete records show a marked similarity to that portion of the Castaic record outside the lost part, further confirming that not more than one or two seconds was lost. As another means of estimating the time lost, a laboratory test was made on the Castaic accelerograph in which the recording paper was held stationary for various time intervals with the recording light on, The intensities of the resulting traces were compatible with the above estimates. ID 057, 58, Hollywood Storage Building, Basement and P. E, Lot. The total record length for the main shock is included. ID 059, 60, 61, 1900 Avenue of the Stars, Subbasement, 9 th and 21 st Floors. The instrument on the 9 th floor several times responded with a very high frequency, 80 - 100 cps, lightly damped oscillation, probably initiated by an impact loading on the structure near the instrument. Such impacts arise from dislodged material or equipment, or safety devices operating in elevator mechanisms. These were not digitized as part of the project. The instrument on the 21 st floor operated for the same 58 - 60 seconds as the other two, but the first 11 seconds were not recorded. ID 062, 63, 64. 1640 South Marengo Street, lst, 4 th and 8 th Floors. The 1 st and 8 th floor records were digitized to 54 seconds, by which time the first aftershocks had diminished. The 4 th floor record was digitized to 98 seconds, for the total length of the record. ID 065, 66, 67. 3710 Wilshire Blvd, Basement 5 th and 10 th Floors. The instrument on the 10 th floor faces a different direction from the other two instruments and the component directions are therefore different. ID 068, 69, 70. 7080 Hollywood Blvd., Basement 6 th and 12 th Floors. The total record length for the main shock is included.

Two further reports (see References) have been issued at the California Institute of Technology describing the San Fernando Earthquake. "The Engineering Features of the San Fernando Earthquake, February 9, 1971 " contains preliminary studies of some of the more important and interesting engineering features of the earthquake. The various chapters were prepared by staff and students working in Earthquake Engineering within the Division of Engineering and Applied Science.

40|$|Since {{the first}} strong-motion accelerographs for the {{measurement}} of the ground motion associated with destructive earthquakes appeared in the early 1930 's {{there has been a}} continual development of instruments and data handling techniques. These developments have resulted in improved field reliability, increased frequency response range, better resolution and accuracy, and reduced costs. As new instrument types appear it is necessary to carry out comprehensive programs of laboratory and field evaluation to ensure adequate performance capabilities. The advent of high speed digital computer systems has completely altered data processing procedures associated with strongmotion instrumentation. Modern digitization and digital filtering techniques, for example, have made it possible to use new approaches to transducer design, and to the optimal retrieval of information from instrument records. The Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology considers the continued reliable operation, expansion, and data processing functions of a network of strong-motion accelerographs {{to be one of the}} key requirements of earthquake engineering research. To this end, this laboratory has for many years conducted numerous studies and research programs aimed at improvements in all aspects of this subject. In cooperation with the <b>Seismological</b> Field <b>Survey</b> of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Caltech group has been engaged in accelerograph design, testing, network design and installation, accelerogram digitizing and corrections, and the use of accelerograms for structural response determinations. The present report brings together a number of special studies related to accelerograph evaluations and data processing, which may be of interest to others engaged in instrument development or in the use of accelerograph records. It is our feeling that the best use can be made of the basic data only by those persons thoroughly familiar with the details of instrument design, and the special problems that may be associated with both the basic measurements themselves and with the handling and interpretation of the data. Some repetition of test method descriptions has been retained to ensure a reasonable independence of the various sections...|$|R
40|$|Preface to the Series The {{object of}} the present series is to make {{available}} accurate digitized data prepared in a uniform way for all recorded strong-motion earthquakes. This first report is the initial step in a continuing data processing program which will ultimately include all past recorded earthquakes as well as current data as it is collected. In addition to digitized ground acceleration records, certain basic calculated information such as integrated velocity and displacement curves, response spectra, and Fourier spectra, will also be issued in a standard form. The existence of this standardized data will allow all investigators {{to begin with the}} same basic numerical data, and should thus reduce the scatter of numerical results, the meaning of which has sometimes been difficult to assess. In addition to an improvement in the consistency of numerical results, several other advantages will be derived from the standardized data. (1) A number of earthquake records will be available which have not hitherto been analyzed in any form; (2) Vertical component data will be available for all earthquakes, digitized on a simultaneous time basis with the two horizontal components; (3) A small overall improvement in data accuracy will result from the inclusion of corrections for baseline distortion on the original record, and for timing mark variations; (4) Basic accelerogram data uncorrected for base line adjustments will be available for research purposes, as well as corrected data using standard adjustments. Accurate measurements of the ground motions of destructive earthquakes form the indispensable starting point for invesitgations in earthquake engineering. The number of such measurements that {{have been made in the}} past is unfortunately very small, and there is thus a need to extract the maximum possible information from the relatively few records that do exist. Starting with the first earthquake accelerogram for a destructive earthquake obtained in Long Beach, California, in 1933, the network of accelerographs maintained by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey has gradually accumulated a very important series of accelerograms including some measurements of most of the strong earthquakes occurring in the Pacific Coast States since that time. Although for most of these earthquakes the number of accelerograph records is much smaller than would be desirable, the available records have formed a sound base for the development of current ideas as to the character of destructive earthquake ground motion. The number of such earthquake accelerograms now available for analysis is of the order of one hundred. The importance of the work of the <b>Seismological</b> Field <b>Survey</b> of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in the development, installation, and servicing of accelerographs and in the highly efficient and reliable collection of this basic data cannot be overestimated. In addition, this group has always made available accurate copies of the original accelerograms to interested investigators throughout the world. The size of the USCGS accelerograph network has gradually grown from about 40 instruments in 1935 to some 300 accelerographs in 19690 This has resulted in a gratifying increase in the number of accelerograms, but has emphasized the need for working out a more comprehensive program for the processing of this data. Both instruments and data processing methods have steadily evolved over the years since the beginning of the network, and the matter of establishing uniform procedures has now become of critical importance. Some of the factors which suggest that a uniform preparation of information is now essential are: (1) The basic accelerograph itself has gone through many stages of development, and the network now contains a wide variety of devices differing considerably in mechanical, electrical, and optical details. Although the basic physical parameters are approximately equivalent, there are significant differences which sometimes can be corrected for if the proper information is at hand. (2) A wide variety of recording media and record sizes are employed in the various accelerographs, and many different techniques have been used over the years to digitize the analog photographic traces for numerical work. (3) Various important earthquake accelerograms have been studied by different investigators using different interpretive techniques. In addition, various corrective methods have been employed, and it is not always clear for a given reproduced accelerogram just how the basic data has been treated. (4) As modern digital computing techniques have been developed, there has been a continuous evolution of the data processing techniques used. For example, response spectrum calculations have been carried out by desk calculators, by analog computer methods, and by digital computers. This may complicate the comparison of old spectrum curves with more recent calculations. Integrated velocity and displacement curves are well known to be particularly sensitive to this kind of computational variation. The foregoing factors, plus the fact that highly efficient digitizing and computing facilities are now available, have provided the motive for the present undertaking. The present series will be issued in the following volumes: Volume IDigitized Accelerograms, Uncorrected, with Print-outs and Plotted Records Volume IIDigitized Accelerograms, Base-line corrected. Integrated Velocity and Displacement Curves in Plotted and Digitized Form Volume IIIResponse Spectrum Curves Additional volumes now being planned will present other forms of the basic data of use in earthquake engineering such as Fourier Spectrum curves. Each volume will in turn be issued in parts A, B, C, etc., each containing 20 earthquakes. In this way it is hoped that useful information can be issued as it is prepared, without the delays associated with the completion of the whole project. The project has involved close cooperation at every stage with the <b>Seismological</b> Field <b>Survey</b> of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the methods and formats used have been arrived at after detailed consultation with Mr. William K. Cloud, Chief of the <b>Seismological</b> Field <b>Survey,</b> and his staff. A work of the present type naturally involves important contributions from a large number of people. Some of these will be identified in specific sections and in the reference material. Anything like a complete list of those who have in this way earned the gratitude of future earthquake investigators is obviously impracticable here. It is a pleasure to acknowledge at this point the support of the Engineering Division of the National Science Foundation for the long-range support which makes a project of the present type possible. Introduction to Volume I Uncorrected Digitized Data - Earthquake Ground Accelerations This volume contains the digitized accelerograms of strong earthquake ground motions as processed from records obtained from the strong-motion accelerograph network maintained by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. No base-line or instrumental corrections or adjustments have been made - the data may thus be regarded as "uncorrected" in the sense that no modifications have been introduced which involve any hypotheses as to the character of the ground motions or instruments involved. This digitized data is thus believed to be as close a representation of the original, raw information as it is feasible to achieve with a digital process. A significant feature of the compilation is the fact that uniform data processing methods have been applied to all earthquakes. These methods will now be briefly described. Additional details will be found in Appendix I, which reprints a paper presented at the Fourth World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, Santiago, Chile, in January 1969 As a first step, full size contact film negatives were prepared from the original records which were recorded in the field on photographic paper. This reproduction process was carried out by the staff of the <b>Seismological</b> Field <b>Survey</b> of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in San Francisco, using the original records from the Washington Office of the USCGS. From these film negatives, contact prints were made on a frosted, translucent, Mylar-based film. Measurements have shown that these prints differ in size from the film negatives by less than - 7 - 0. 1 %o, and the distortion involved in going from the original paper record to the contact negative is believed to be no larger than this. The translucent film is mechanically strong, dimensionally stable, and affords excellent optical contrast for setting the cross-hairs on the digitizing machine on a back-lighted glass table. Experiments on photographic development techniques resulted in standard methods for producing an optimum balance between contrast and trace width. Of the approximately one hundred records available, about fourfifths were of good to excellent quality, and permit an accurate digitization with relative ease. About one-fifth are of poorer quality, requiring greater judgment and more effort in the digitizing process, but nevertheless permitting results of satisfactory overall accuracy. The digitizing is performed on a Benson-Lehner 099 D Datareducer unit. The cross-hairs are manually set to successive x-y coordinates on the record trace. The coordinates are converted to digital position figures by means of a magnetic readout head, and are stored in a 6 -digit accumulator system from which they are automatically read out to an electric typewriter and a card punch. The maximum resolution of the system is about 800 digital counts per inch, corresponding to a least time interval on most records of 1 / 300 seconds. The 24 inch table length on the digitizer can accommodate 30 seconds of record at the fastest recording speeds. Most of the accelerograms could be digitized in one position on the digitizer table. For those records requiring repositioning, the points in the record at which changes have occurred are noted, using an arrow on the plotted accelerogram, and an asterisk in the print-out. The records have been digitized on an unequal time basis, which has been found to give the best definition of the trace for a given number of sections and in the reference material. Anything like a complete list of those who have in this way earned the gratitude of future earthquake investigators is obviously impracticable here. It is a pleasure to acknowledge at this point the support of the Engineering Division of the National Science Foundation for the long-range support which makes a project of the present type possible...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Pyrenees are a 400 -km-long {{mountain}} range located in southwest Europe along the French–Spanish border, and constitute {{one of the}} most earthquake-prone regions of mainland France and Spain. At the “observational” level, the Pyrenean region is monitored by several seismological networks {{on both sides of the}} French -Spanish border, counting in total around 120 seismic stations (of different types). Thanks to a progressive decrease of constraints associated to real-time seismology (generalization of low-cost robust data-transfer technologies, continuous increasing of data storage capacities, etc.), a growing proportion of these stations are progressively called to evolve toward real-time data transmission. Moreover, a recent project called “SISPyr” (www. sispyr. eu), involving the main owners of Pyrenean seismic stations, has notably allowed the establishment of a real-time pooling process of Pyrenean seismological data resulting in an improvement of the coverage of the massif. At the “operational” level also, each country has its own civil protection organization as well as specific earthquake crisis plans. However, big earthquakes in the Pyrenees can impact the two (or the three) borders. Moreover, systemic cross-border interactions are multiples (transport network, energy lifelines, hospitals access, cross-border populations, etc.). Rapid response overviewExperience of past earthquakes as well as "earthquake" civil-protection’s exercises underlines the need for crisis managers to have at their disposal rapid-response tools able to assess consequences caused by earthquakes, even for moderate events. SisPyr partnership has developed tools to meet these operational needs, in order to automatically and quickly ( 15 min) produce maps of seismic ground-motions. These “Shakemaps” integrate both seismological real-time data coming from observatories and internet citizen data (web-questionnaires). Exploratory tracks are also being considered in order to enrich the information feedback from the field by using techniques of "crowd-sourcing", thanks to the use of distributed "citizen" sensors or of social-networks. To go further in taking account operational requirements related to the management of seismic crisis, work is being done in order to provide the authorities with a quick assessment of the human tolls (potential victims or damages, needs for shelters) that may control their actions, structured within reports dedicated to civil-protection teams. Need for geospatial ICT supportMulti-actors contextPyrenean region disposes of several seismological networks on both sides of the Franco-Spanish border: CEA-LDG, OMP and BRGM for the French part (with stations belonging to the Seismic Monitoring National Network – RéNaSS, and to the French Permanent Accelerometric network – RAP), and the Spanish and the Catalan <b>seismological</b> <b>surveys</b> (respectively IGN and ICGC) for the Spanish part. It is also to notice the presence of a broad-band station in Andorra managed by Andorran Studies Institute (IEA). In case of earthquake, several of these institutes produce their own assessment of magnitude/location, while alert itself is assigned in France to CEA-LDG, and in Spain to IGN. At the same time, in case of great earthquakes, international organizations like JRC and CSEM (Europe), and even USGS (US), produces information bulletins, which are not really followed by national/regional crisis management community. Moreover in France Internet citizen data (macroseismic intensities) are collected by another institution, BCSF. In Spain these citizen data are collected both by ICGC and IGN. The Sispyr’s Shakemap system is triggered by alerts coming from IGN (disregarding ones coming from CEA-LDG), and uses IGN, ICGC, OMP and BRGM seismic data, as well as IGN, ICGC and BCSF citizen data. Input data interoperability Due to the multiplicity of data-producers, question of interoperability of input data is critical. Regarding real-time collection of instrumental data, different protocols are used (NAQS, Seedlink and Scream!), corresponding to well-known or accepted “standards” in the scientific community. In any case, the goal was to converge to shakemaps needed input files format and standards. Output data Shakemaps produces intensity maps, as image format or kmz files. This restitution format is not really adapted to crisis managers which work with own GIS platforms. Otherwise, intensity maps are still quite difficult to be interpreted in local-regional crisis management centers, for people which are not familiar with seismic risk. Thus, the incoming step is to produce automatically a “human tolls bulletins” estimating the level of the earthquake according to estimated potential victims or no-shelters populations. These bulletins follow a “light color code”. Red color signification for USGS, European Commission, Spanish and French Civil protection would be the same? Which coherence with other natural risks? (cf. discussions about natural risks zones maps in INSPIRE). Limits-Is Web diffusion of bulletins and maps well adapted for crisis management community?-How communicate in understandable and interoperable way information about outputs’ uncertainties? This issue also questions the notion of responsibility of broadcasters of these data with respect to crisis managers?-In case of significant earthquake, international organizations produce information bulletins, which are not really followed by national/regional crisis management community. -Input data interoperability: de facto standards are used, but are they international or own?-Output data: how to allow reuse of outputs...|$|R

Even though the large distance from the epicenter (135 miles) to the densest portion of the accelerograph network in the Los Angeles area resulted in many records of very low magnitude, significant studies of the distribution of ground motion can be made. In particular, the distribution pattern of the earthquake-triggered accelerographs gives valuable information on the characteristics and reliability of the starting devices incorporated into the instruments. It will be noted that in addition to a number of important ground motion records at El Centro, San Diego, San Onofre, etc., numerous accelerograms were obtained in upper floor positions in tall buildings in the Los Angeles region. Although these records show low acceleration levels, they permit accurate determination of building response period. It will be of great interest to compare these earthquake -excited period measurements with those obtained from other structural tests and from calculations. Because of the general interest in instrumental characteristics as well as in the distribution of ground motion, it has been decided to reproduce photographs of all record traces, no matter how small the indicated motions. It is realized that the small scale of many of the figures precludes their direct use for accurate measurements. It is intended that they will serve as an index to the available records, and will indicate to a prospective investigator the particular records which he might wish to obtain in the full-scale form from the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Since only a limited number of full-scale records can be so distributed, the present report should thus contribute to an optimum use of existing data-handling capabilities.... Since means have not yet been found to enable the <b>Seismological</b> Field <b>Survey</b> to expand its activities in the preparation and distribution of accelerograph records to the extent called for by the present size of the instrumental network, the present report is a cooperative effort with the California Institute of Technology under a grant from the Engineering Division of the National Science Foundation for basic studies in earthquake engineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{first set}} of 20 {{uncorrected}} digitized earthquake accelerograms was published in July, 1969 as Volume I, Part A of the present series. That volume also contained introductory material and background information describing the methods used, accuracies, etc. which should be referred to by all users of the data. Parts A and B have contained accelerograms from earthquakes dating from March 10, 1933, and are {{a portion of a}} complete series planned in 1969 covering all the important accelerograms to that time. The San Fernando Earthquake, however, provided {{more than twice as many}} records as previously available. In view of the importance of this earthquake, it was felt that we should interrupt the original plan and issue this and succeeding Parts containing San Fernando Earthquake accelerograms, before returning to the original series. The record from Pacoima Dam has received a great deal of attention. Included here are 42 seconds containing the main shock and the first clearly identifiable aftershock, together with six further aftershocks. Because of its importance and the high trace amplitudes involved, the Pacoima record was digitized from the original paper film. All the remaining paper film records were digitized from contactnegatives. Although most reproductions of the Pacoima record indicate some dim portions of the trace, the original trace was clearly distinguishable with no ambiguity. The special problems of this particular accelerogram are treated in the paper by Trifunac and Hudson listed in the references on page 5. The six portions of the Pacoima record containing the aftershocks have the following starting times, measured in seconds after the start of the main shock trace: 52. 6, 69. 6, 104. 6, 162. 0, 230. 1, and 309. 1 sec. These starting times are indicated by arrows on the reproduction of the Pacoima record appearing on page 6. Records from-buildings or arrays containing more than one instrument are included together in one. Part where possible. Part C contains records from Holiday Inn at 8244 Orion Blvd., L. A., the Kajima Building at 250 E. First St., L. A., (three records each) and the Union Bank at 445 Figueroa St., L. A. (two records.). As in previous reports the printout and plots contain asterisks and arrows, respectively,. indicating where the record was shifted in the digitizer when required. We should like to express our gratitude to personnel from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who have assisted so capably on the digitizing: Miriam Blount, Jeannyne Gunkel, Jo Jean Kos, Carolyn Level and Florence Sims. In. addition we should like to thank our regular digitizers and assistants, students and otherwise, for their conscientious. work: N. R. Bacheliri, D. A. Blount, Esther Dizack, R. C. Dullien, H. H. Kwai, H. H. Law, V. W: Lee, M. Y. -C. Ngan, W. J. Raymond and K. K. Tung. We would also like to acknowledge the general support off the Earthquake Research Affiliates. The whole program has at all stages been conducted through the generous help of grants from the National Science Foundation, and- we have enjoyed the close cooperation of the staff of the <b>Seismological</b> Field <b>Survey</b> of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration...|$|R
40|$|The San Fernando Earthquake of February 9, 1971 {{occurred}} virtually at {{the center}} of the Southern California strong-motion earthquake instrumentation network, and provided an unprecedented amount of valuable data on strong earthquake -generated ground motions, This data will be of key significance in interpreting the severe damage to many modern engineering structures which occurred, and marks a major development in the field of earthquake engineering. It was evident immediately after the event that the problems of recovering field records, of processing the information, and of disseminating the results as quickly and as widely as possible would severely tax the available resources. Fortunately, the close cooperation which had been built up over the years between the <b>Seismological</b> Field <b>Survey</b> of the U. S. Department of Commerce and the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology provided an operating group which could be quickly expanded to meet the challenge. In the days and weeks following the earthquake, each of these organizations issued numerous preliminary reports aimed at the quickest possible distribution of information. The present report up-dates and brings together a number of these initial releases, along with much new material. It is hoped that in this way a more complete picture of the overall instrumentation results can be presented in one convenient place. The report also makes available for the first time a complete description of the Southern California networks, and a detailed account of the performance of these networks during the earthquake, A notable feature of the present report is the reproduction in accurate scale form of the complete set of seismoscope records obtained during the earthquake. These seismoscope records offer an unparalleled picture of the complexity of the pattern of ground shaking throughout the Southern California region. The primary purpose of the present compilation is to make available the basic data itself, and no attempt has been made to add interpretive material. Many interpretive studies have, of course, already been made, and the full exploitation of this basic data to increase our knowledge of earthquake engineering will no doubt go on for a number of years. In reporting the accelerograph measurements, numerous examples of accelerograms have been given, and samples of standard data processing procedures leading to digitized print-outs and calculated velocity and displacement curves, and response spectrum curves, have been included. The complete set of accelerograms in computer -plotted form, along with the digital print-outs, are being issued by the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology as a part of the series "Strong-Motion Earthquake Accelerograms - Digitized and Plotted Data. " The first volume devoted to the San Fernando earthquake has already been issued as Vol. 1, part C, Report No. EERL 71 - 20. These volumes of digitized accelerograms will be followed during the next year by additional volumes containing integrated ground velocity and displacement curves, and response spectrum curves, which will be prepared for all of the records obtained during the San Fernando earthquake. The existence of this unusually complete ground motion data is a tribute to the cooperative efforts of a large number of people over a period of many years. Many of the individuals involved have been named in the acknowledgements included in the separate sections. Hundreds of individual accelerograph and seismoscope owners have pooled their resources to make the Southern California region the best instrumented area in the world for strong earthquake ground motion investigations. A complete list of organizations, building owners, and others who deserve thanks for making possible the acquisition and the operation of the instruments would be an imposing indication of the extent of the cooperative effort involved. Special mention should be -made of the very important contributions of the late John C. Monning, former general manager and superintendent of the Department of Building and Safety of the City of Los Angeles. It was Mr, Monning's vision and foresight, implemented with great energy and patience, which resulted in the code requirements for accelerographs in tall buildings which made this earthquake the most extensive structural dynamic test of full-scale buildings ever carried out. His colleagues and successors in the Department of Building and Safety have carried this work forward in a very effective manner, and have thus played a key role in the development of the accelerograph network...|$|R
