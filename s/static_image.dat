5|$|The seven-person {{development}} team {{started work}} on the sequel with the ideas that did not fit into the original. They also incorporated feedback from Killer Instinct players. Killer Instinct2 art, design, and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release. Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the game engine with feedback from Nintendo's Ken Lobb. Rare used compression technology to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo64 cartridge. While Killer Instinct was planned to showcase the Nintendo 64's power, the console was more limited than Rare's arcade setup, and Rare had to optimize the arcade version to run on the console. The arcade version used an animation to give the illusion of the camera panning horizontally, but the console version used <b>static</b> <b>image</b> files with less detail. Both the arcade and console versions use the same graphic engine and character roster.|$|E

25|$|An {{advanced}} {{application of}} DSA is road mapping. From the acquired DSA sequence, the image frame with maximum vessel opification is identified and assigned {{to be the}} so-called road-map mask. This mask is continuously subtracted from live fluoroscopy images to produce real-time subtracted fluoroscopic images overlaid on a <b>static</b> <b>image</b> of the vasculature. The clinical benefit is better visualization of small and complex vascular structures without distracting underlying tissue to support the placement of catheters and wires.|$|E

25|$|By default, DirectShow {{includes}} {{a number of}} filters for decoding some common media file formats such as MPEG-1, MP3, Windows Media Audio, Windows Media Video, MIDI, media containers such as AVI, ASF, WAV, some splitters/demultiplexers, multiplexers, source and sink filters and some <b>static</b> <b>image</b> filters. Since the associated patented technologies are licensed in Windows, no license fees are required (e.g., to Fraunhofer, for MP3). Some codecs such as MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile, AAC, H.264, Vorbis and containers MOV, MP4 are available from 3rd parties. Incorporating support for additional codecs such as these can involve paying the licensing fees to the involved codec technology developer or patent holder.|$|E
25|$|Since LCD screens {{do not use}} phosphors, they do {{not suffer}} image burn-in when a <b>static</b> <b>image</b> is {{displayed}} on a screen {{for a long time}} (e.g., the table frame for an aircraft schedule on an indoor sign). LCDs are, however, susceptible to image persistence. The LCD screen is more energy-efficient and can be disposed of more safely than a CRT can. Its low electrical power consumption enables it to be used in battery-powered electronic equipment more efficiently than CRTs can be. By 2008, annual sales of televisions with LCD screens exceeded sales of CRT units worldwide, and the CRT became obsolete for most purposes.|$|E

40|$|When a {{video of}} someone {{speaking}} is paused, the stationary image of the speaker typically appears less flattering than the video, which contained motion. We call this the frozen face effect (FFE). Here we report six experiments intended to quantify this effect and determine its cause. In Experiment 1, video clips of people speaking in naturalistic settings {{as well as all}} of the static frames that composed each video were presented, and subjects rated how flattering each stimulus was. The videos were rated to be significantly more flattering than the <b>static</b> <b>images,</b> confirming the FFE. In Experiment 2, videos and <b>static</b> <b>images</b> were inverted, and the videos were again rated as more flattering than the <b>static</b> <b>images.</b> In Experiment 3, a discrimination task measured recognition of the <b>static</b> <b>images</b> that composed each video. Recognition did not correlate with flattery ratings, suggesting that the FFE is not due to better memory for particularly distinct images. In Experiment 4, flattery ratings for groups of <b>static</b> <b>images</b> were compared with those for videos and <b>static</b> <b>images.</b> Ratings for the video stimuli were higher than those for either the group or individual static stimuli, suggesting that the amount of information available is not what produces the FFE. In Experiment 5, videos were presented under four conditions: forward motion, inverted forward motion, reversed motion, and scrambled frame sequence. Flattery ratings for the scrambled videos were significantly lower than those for the other three conditions. In Experiment 6, as in Experiment 2, inverted videos and <b>static</b> <b>images</b> were compared with upright ones, and the response measure was changed to perceived attractiveness. Videos were rated as more attractive than the <b>static</b> <b>images</b> for both upright and inverted stimuli. Overall, the results suggest that the FFE requires continuous, natural motion of faces, is not sensitive to inversion, and is not due to a memory effect...|$|R

The participants were then divided into higher proficient listeners group (HPL) and the lower proficient listeners group (LPL) {{on the basis of their}} performance on a general listening module of the IELTS examination. The HPL was subsequently divided into two groups: one receiving <b>static</b> <b>images</b> with verbal stimuli, another receiving script presentations with the same verbal stimuli. The LPL was also divided into two groups with the same procedure. The analysis of results showed that listening tests with <b>static</b> <b>images</b> yielded better performance than script presentations, visual aids were more advantageous to lower proficient listeners while textual aids were more advantageous to higher proficient listeners, and tests with more <b>static</b> <b>images</b> yielded much better performance than those with fewer <b>static</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} was to study the {{physiopathology}} of tumoral uptake of '"In-pentetreotide using factorial analysis of dynamic series (FADS) and to assess the usefulness of this analysis in somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Methods: Forty-one patients were included, 24 women and 17 men. After intravenous injection of 111 MBq 1 " In-pentetreotide, dynamic image acquisition (68 images of 30 s) began in front of the suspected tumoral site: thoracic in 10 patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and 2 patients with bronchogenic carcinoid, and abdominal in 12 cases of midgut carcinoid and 17 cases of other gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. FADS was performed with FAMIS software. <b>Static</b> <b>images</b> were obtained 4 h and 24 h later. For every patient, surgery and/or clinical follow-up (4 y) was used to classify results as true (T) or false (F) positive (P) or negative (N) and to evaluate both the sensitivity of <b>static</b> <b>images</b> and the usefulness of FADS. Results: Of the 14 cases of carcinoid tumor, 5 patients were TN; 9 patients were TP with <b>static</b> <b>images</b> but only 8 were TP with FADS (a bronchogenic carcinoid of 6 mm was missed). Of the 17 cases of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, static Â¡mageswere TP in 9 patients, and FADS were TP in 5 of these patients (and 4 FN). <b>Static</b> <b>images</b> and FADS were FN in 4 patients and TN in 3 patients, and in the 2 last patients <b>static</b> <b>images</b> were FP, but FADS were TN. Of the 10 cases of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, <b>static</b> <b>images</b> and FADS were TN in 1 patient, <b>static</b> <b>images</b> were TP in 3 patients and FADS were TP in 2 of these patients (and 1 FN). In the six last cases, <b>static</b> <b>images</b> were FN, but FADS were FN in 3 patients and TP in 3 patients, showing an infiltrate. Conclusion: FADS demonstrates that tumoral kinetics {{are similar to those of}} the spleen. FADS can show a diffuse tumoral uptake corresponding to tumoral infiltrate in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid or in hepatic miliaria, whereas static Â¡mageswere normal or doubtful.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate grading performance when estimating the severity of <b>static</b> versus dynamic <b>images</b> of contact lens-related ocular pathology. METHODS: Thirty-eight subjects used the Efron Grading Scales for Contact Lens Complications to grade the severity of ocular pathological changes depicted in static and dynamic (movie clip) computer-displayed images of each of the following contact lens complications: bulbar conjunctival redness, limbal redness, papillary conjunctivitis, corneal staining, corneal infiltrates and meibomian gland dysfunction. The viewing of <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>images</b> was separated by seven weeks. RESULTS: Grades assigned to dynamic images were 0. 6 and 0. 7 grading scale units higher than those assigned to <b>static</b> <b>images</b> for limbal redness and papillary conjunctivitis, respectively (p < 0. 0001 for both). No difference was observed for the other four complications.
