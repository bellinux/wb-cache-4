Subsequently, Feyenoord has yet to reach any more finals or to win any more Dutch Championship titles.|$|E

25|$|Alwar is {{the first}} major city when {{travelling}} from Delhi en route to Rajasthan. Its heritage is a major draw for tourists. The fort of Alwar, known as Bala fort, is about 595 meters high. It was constructed in the tenth century, making it the oldest building in the city. Despite {{being one of the}} princely states of Rajputana, the rulers here had left no stone unturned in building many forts. Seeing the fort of Baala, there is an impression that sometimes {{it would have been a}} very inaccessible fort, where there would have been many turrets, a large gate, a temple and a residential area. There is a state museum in the City Palace, where there is a rare collection of miniature paintings. Near the corner are Mousi's umbrella, Vinay Palace, Vijay Mandir Palace and Moti Dungri. In other tourist spots, the lake is situated in Silasedh Lake and Jaisamand Lake. Sariska, which is at a distance of 36 kilometers, after rain, for its green trees and greenery of bushes, is seen differently. In its beautiful valley, visions are visible with blue cow, chital, wild pig, other animals. Sariska is counted in old Tiger-projects. Due to poaching sighting tigers has unfortunately become rare. Do not be discouraged but go Sariska, which is <b>still</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> beautiful natural scenery and colorful birds. Historical significance of the nearby Biratnagar or Barrath, is due to the stupa and established inscription made by Emperor Ashoka the Great. According to legendary belief, Pandavas spent some time in their ignorance here. There is a large number of religious devotees on the Pandupole-Bhardhari Loktirtha. You can also experience unlimited peace by traveling here. Alwar is also famous for its famous sweet kalakand (Mauva of Alwar), this milk made from milk is not only nearby but also famous. The items made of paper-potter are also very much appreciated here.|$|E

During the recording process, the band traveled to four different continents to accommodate Jared Leto's acting career. A Beautiful Lie was notably different from the band's debut album, from both musical and lyrical aspect. [...] "On the first record I created a world, then hid behind it," [...] Leto said. [...] "With A Beautiful Lie, {{it was time to}} take a more personal and less cerebral approach. Although this record is <b>still</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> conceptual elements and thematic ideas it is ultimately much more wrapped around the heart than the head. It's about brutal honesty, growth, change. It's an incredibly intimate look into a life that is in the crossroads. A raw emotional journey. A story of life, love, death, pain, joy, and passion.

Such planets would have to orbit very closely to their stars; so closely that their atmospheres would be gradually stripped away by solar radiation. There is no consensus on how to explain these so-called hot Jupiters, but one leading idea is that of planetary migration, similar to the process which is thought to have moved Uranus and Neptune to their current, distant orbit. Possible processes that cause the migration include orbital friction while the protoplanetary disc is <b>still</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen and helium gas ...|$|E

He had already finished his Concluding Postscript and delivered it to Luno, his printer, by December 1845. The Corsair Affair occupied some of his time and caused him some anxiety after 1845. Later, February 7, 1846, {{he wrote in his}} diary [...] "it is now my intention to qualify as a pastor. For several months I have been praying to God to help me ..."

[...] By the end of the 14th century, counter to the earliest formulations, many French and English romances combined courtly love, with love sickness and devotation on the man's part, with the couple's subsequent marriage; this featured in Sir Degrevant, Sir Torrent of Portyngale, Sir Eglamour, and William of Palerne. [...] Ipomadon even explicitly describes the married couple as lovers, and the plot of Sir Otuel was altered, to allow him to marry Belyssant. [...] Similarly, Iberian romances of the 14th century praised monogamy and marriage in such tales as Tirant lo Blanc and Amadis of Gaul.|$|E
