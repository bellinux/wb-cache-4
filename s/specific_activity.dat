Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the <b>specific</b> <b>activity</b> (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll).

25|$|The viral {{thymidine}} kinases differ completely {{from the}} mammalian enzymes both structurally and biochemically and are inhibited by inhibitors {{that do not}} inhibit the mammalian enzymes. The genes of the two human isoenzymes were localized in the mid-1970s. The gene for TK1 was cloned and sequenced. The corresponding protein has a molecular weight of about 25 kD. Normally, it occurs in tissue as a dimer with a molecular weight of around 50 kD. It can be activated by ATP. After activation, is a tetramer with a molecular weight around 100 kD. However, the form of enzyme present in the circulation does not correspond to the protein as encoded by the gene: the main fraction of the active enzyme in the circulation has a molecular weight of 730 kD and is probably bound in a complex to other proteins. This complex is more stable and has a higher <b>specific</b> <b>activity</b> {{than any of the}} lower molecular weight forms.|$|E

Axelrod’s group in Bethesda wished to clarify the in vivo fate of catecholamines using radioactively labelled catecholamines of high <b>specific</b> <b>activity,</b> which had just become available. 3H-adrenaline and 3H-noradrenaline given intravenously to cats were partly O-methylated, but another part was taken up in the tissues and stored unchanged.-epinephrine and its metabolite metanephrine|journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|volume =127 |pages = 251–256}}-norepinephrine in animals |journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume =132 |pages = 193–201|pmid=13784801 }} Erich Muscholl (born 1926) in Mainz, {{who had worked with}} Marthe Vogt in Edinburgh, wished to know how cocaine sensitized tissues to catecholamines – a fundamental mechanism of action of cocaine discovered by Otto Loewi and Alfred Fröhlich in 1910 in Vienna. Intravenous noradrenaline was taken up into the heart and spleen of rats, and cocaine prevented the uptake, ″thus increasing the amount of noradrenaline available for combination with the adrenergic receptors″. The uptake of 3H-noradrenaline was severely impaired after sympathectomy, indicating that it occurred mainly into sympathetic nerve terminals. In support of this, Axelrod and Georg Hertting (born 1925) showed that freshly incorporated 3H-noradrenaline was re-released from the cat spleen when the sympathetic nerves were stimulated. A few years later, Leslie Iversen (born 1937) in Cambridge found that other cells also took up catecholamines. He called uptake into noradrenergic neurones, which were cocaine-sensitive, uptake1 and uptake into other cells, which were cocaine-resistant, uptake2. With the reserpine-sensitive uptake from the cytoplasm into the storage vesicles there were thus three catecholamine membrane passage mechanisms. Iversen’s book of 1967 “The Uptake and Storage of Noradrenaline in Sympathetic Nerves” was successful, showing the fascination of the field and its rich pharmacology.|$|E

500|$|Lanthanum-140 {{was chosen}} because it emits gamma rays in the desired energy range (1.60megaelectronvolts (MeV), with {{fraction}} of 0.49MeV), and has very high <b>specific</b> <b>activity,</b> thus providing sufficient radiation intensity to produce usable signals from the ionization chambers. After a test, dispersed La-140 rapidly decays into stable cerium-140, reducing the radiation hazard for the operators after several half lives. It was also potentially available in larger quantities because its parent nuclide barium-140 is an abundant fission product of uranium. As a consequence, lanthanum-140 samples contained traces of barium-140, caesium-140, and especially strontium-90, which still presents a radioactive contamination problem {{in the area of}} the tests. Lanthanum-140 has a <b>specific</b> <b>activity</b> of 5.57×105Ci/g (20.6PBq/g); a [...] La-140 source therefore equals about 1.8mg of lanthanum.|$|E

Thus {{it is the only}} promethium isotope with an experimentally observed alpha decay. Its partial half-life for alpha decay is about 6.3years, and the relative probability for a 145Pm nucleus to decay in this way is 2.8%.
