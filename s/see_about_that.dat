6000|$|... "We'll <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> my bonny Jenny;" [...] and {{the soldier}} resumed his march, humming, {{as he walked}} to and fro along the gallery, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I don't know what's in the trunks. I never pack anything. My dear brother, what do I have maids for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Matter? Oh, {{they have}} been stupid in marking the ground, and Hector is gone to <b>see</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That's</b> all. He {{is not at all}} tired.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>see</b> here, <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Noo York Limited. Chauncey Depew himself couldn't hitch {{his car to}} her," [...] Miss Kinzey suggested, {{recovering}} herself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not he,' {{replied the}} landlord. 'He'll like {{your way of}} talking, I know. But we'll soon <b>see</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Just wait a minute.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> later, Crowden," [...] put in Dick, sternly. [...] "Now you sit {{perfectly}} still or else maybe you'll go overboard and be drowned." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, what I had {{foreseen}} had occurred. The {{town was}} actually {{occupied by the}} British. And {{they thought it was}} the end! We would <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> next," [...] Barbara replied and {{indicated}} {{a cloud of}} dust rolling along the road. [...] "There's the steam tram. Don't talk; hustle!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We'll <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> By the Lord, I've a good mind {{to wring}} {{the life out}} of you. That bullet of yours might have been in my temple." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll have to <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> lion, {{and about}} that hermit," [...] {{declared}} Shep. [...] "Supposing {{we leave you}} and Tommy in camp this time, and take Giant along?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "If {{you begin}} {{calling me a}} stranger--but there, never mind! We'll <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> after dinner. Now what is the other cause for depression?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is too {{dangerous}} a matter to be <b>seen</b> loitering <b>about</b> <b>that</b> place, {{especially for a}} lad like me, whose father {{is known to be}} a Son of Liberty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strange {{look for}} an honest, kindly man," [...] thought Mr Jack, [...] "but we must never judge from the outward appearance;" [...] then he said aloud, [...] "I went to <b>see</b> her <b>about</b> <b>that</b> bank failure--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is true," [...] {{answered}} the young man. [...] "I came to <b>see</b> you <b>about</b> <b>that</b> very thing, {{and to tell}} you that there is to be a meeting outside the big hut to-day. We shall want your advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> later," [...] cried our hero, hotly, and {{catching}} the rascal {{by the collar}} the youth yanked him to a standing position. [...] "Now come on, and no nonsense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> But here I am again, at any rate. The {{mischief}} {{take them}} for interfering old fools! When they had got me {{they had nothing}} to say against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> presently," [...] Mr. Hebblethwaite declared, leaning back. [...] "Let {{me think}} over {{what you have}} told me. It comes to this, Norgate. You've {{practically}} encouraged Germany to risk affronting us." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{went to bed}} wakeful. It was marvellously {{like being}} at school again. What could Flossie want to <b>see</b> her <b>about</b> <b>that</b> was so important? She tried to pretend to herself that she didn't know. After all, perhaps it wasn't that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ahem [...] . Anne, I've {{been wanting}} to <b>see</b> you <b>about</b> <b>that</b> little matter we were {{discussing}} the other day. I've decided not to let my fences to that company after all. A society with an aim like yours ought to be encouraged." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “I’m {{going over}} to the office to <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> telephone,” said Arthur. “I believe I’ll do the errand while Castro is {{preparing}} his compounds. I’m always uneasy when the telephone is out of order.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> to-morrow," [...] the constable said, collaring him. [...] "At present you've {{got to go}} {{off with}} me quietly to the station, where these gentlemen will enter up the charge against you." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{dedication}} {{of a great}} town-hall, a public building, and we were there in the afternoon. This great building was filled, like this great theatre, with rejoicing villagers, and my friend and I started down the centre aisle. He saw a man standing in that aisle, and he said [...] "Now, look at that bronzed veteran--at that mahogany-faced man. Now, tell me, do you <b>see</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>that</b> man's face that is emotional? Do you <b>see</b> anything <b>about</b> it <b>that</b> suggests that inside that man anywhere there are fires that can be started? Would you ever imagine {{that that is a}} human volcano?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{this time}} Allen will {{have had to}} put the kiddies to bed," [...] she said. [...] "Christina, as you might have borne in mind, goes over to Branstock's every evening.

6000|$|... 'He only {{wished to}} try them,' said Adeline, 'and he always meant {{to come and}} <b>see</b> <b>about</b> them; besides, <b>that</b> eldest son has been begging of him on false pretences all along.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> yet a while," [...] says I. [...] "And first, I'll {{show you}} that I know what I am talking. You have orders to detain me here till after Thursday, 21st September." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We shall <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> after we've broken it open,' I {{answered}} grimly. 'Here, this screw-driver will do. The back's not strong. Now, your help, Mr. Hayes--one, two, three; we can prise {{it apart}} between us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We shall <b>see</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> before long,” {{the other}} said. “Some {{of the others}} {{thought they were going}} to rule the roost when they joined a few days ago, but I soon taught them their place.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{you don't}} know Tom Merwin," [...] said Longley, almost genially. [...] "Yes, I know <b>about</b> <b>that</b> loan. It hasn't any {{security}} except Tom Merwin's word. Somehow, I've always {{found that when}} a man's word is good it's the best security there is. Oh, yes, I know the Government doesn't think so. I guess I'll <b>see</b> Tom <b>about</b> <b>that</b> note." ...|$|R
