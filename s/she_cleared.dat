25|$|After a brief {{return to}} Attu, Watts {{departed}} the Aleutians on 22 February {{and headed for}} Hawaii with Jarvis (DD-799). The two destroyers reached Pearl Harbor on 1 March and began a fortnight of training and voyage repairs. On the 15th, Watts stood out of Pearl Harbor {{and headed back to}} the Aleutians for less than a month of operations. On 18 April, DesDiv113 left the northern Pacific for good. From there, Watts and her division mates headed for Hawaii and three weeks of training in preparation for duty in the recently launched Okinawa invasion.

25|$|Born in Pinar del Río in Cuba, Silva {{began to}} {{participate}} in pole vault competitions {{from the age of}} twelve. Many women in her family took part in athletics and her mother was a javelin thrower. In spite of its strong traditions in track and field, pole vaulting was a discipline in which Cuba had not historically been successful. As a result, Silva quickly established herself nationally at the age of sixteen, coming second at the Cuban Athletics Championships and winning the Barrientos Memorial in 2003. In 2004, <b>she</b> <b>cleared</b> four metres for the first time, which was a Central American and Caribbean junior record. She improved this to 4.10m at the 2005 Barrientos meet, winning the competition again.|$|E

60|$|Mabel {{certainly}} felt distrust and apprehension; but {{her entire}} situation was so novel, and her reliance on her guide so great, that she retained a self-command which {{might not have}} existed had <b>she</b> <b>clearer</b> perceptions of the truth, or been better acquainted with the helplessness of men when placed {{in opposition to the}} power and majesty of Nature.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{refusal to}} allow Dwight to {{publicize}} their relationship {{prevented him from}} exonerating himself against suspicion of disloyalty and forced his resignation.

25|$|<b>She</b> <b>cleared</b> the Gulf of Tonkin on 4 May, {{headed back}} to the United States, and made Long Beach on the 23d. Somers resumed {{operations}} out of Long Beach until 9 July when she began a month of pre-overhaul preparations. On 9 August, the guided-missile destroyer entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard to commence regular overhaul. The overhaul lasted until 3 December and, following that, she went into a period of restricted availability which carried her through 31 December. Somers completed her restricted availability on 3 January 1972 and began trials, tests, and exercises which lasted through 31 March. After nine days of preparations, she headed west on 10 April to rejoin the 7th Fleet.|$|E
25|$|Ordered to the Pacific, Hall {{departed}} Charleston, South Carolina on 21 December {{and arrived}} at Pearl Harbor 11 January 1944. On 22 January, <b>she</b> <b>cleared</b> Hawaii with Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner's Expeditionary Force bound for the capture and occupation of the Marshall Islands, a giant step across the Pacific toward Japan. Sent with three cruisers and three other destroyers on a special mission to wreck the airfields on Tarao Island during the invasion, Hall joined in the devastating bombardment of that island 30 January. Her guns knocked out a gasoline dump with a tremendous explosion, hit several gun emplacements, and then screened the larger ships during {{the remainder of the}} firing. Tarao effectively neutralized, the ships then sailed for Kwajalein and the main assault.|$|E
25|$|Recommissioned 8 September 1951, <b>she</b> <b>cleared</b> San Diego on 4 January 1952 for her {{new home}} port, Newport, Rhode Island. In September 1952 she entered Dry Dock #1 in the Boston Navy Yard {{for the first of}} four major {{overhauls}} she would undergo in this shipyard. At this time the ship was updated to its current configuration. Two Hedgehog anti-submarine (ASW) launchers and two torpedo carriages for the Mark 32 torpedo were added, with one 21 inch (533 mm) quintuple torpedo tube mount removed. Also, four 40 mm Bofors twin mounts were replaced by two quadruple mounts. The forward pole mast was replaced by a tripod mast to accommodate improved radar and electronics systems. Local operations and refresher training in the Caribbean preceded a period of antisubmarine exercises off Florida from 7 May to 12 June 1953. Her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean took place from 16 September to 30 November 1953. After another period of local operations, and exercises in the Caribbean Sea early in 1954, <b>she</b> <b>cleared</b> Newport on 3 May for a round-the-world cruise, which included exercises with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific, patrols off Korea, and good-will visits to Far Eastern and Mediterranean ports. She returned to Newport on 28 November 1954. Her operations from that time until 1960 included training exercises in the Caribbean and off the eastern seaboard as well as tours of duty in the Mediterranean in 1956, winter 1956-57, and 1959, and a round of visits to ports of northern Europe in 1958. During that last overseas deployment an issue was discovered with her rudder that put her into dry dock in France. At that point the repair costs outweighed retaining the aging ship. On 6 February 1960 she arrived at Norfolk Naval Shipyard to be decommissioned because of that. The ship was put into long-term storage at the Philadelphia Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility 29 April 1960.|$|E

25|$|Her first {{international}} appearances came in 2011. At the 2011 World Youth Championships in Athletics she placed ninth in the heptathlon. <b>She</b> <b>cleared</b> six metres {{in the long}} jump {{for the first time that}} year and surpassed that mark to win the gold in the event at the 2011 Commonwealth Youth Games. She was also a 4×100 metres relay champion with England at that event. She was also approached by the British Bobsleigh Association that year to train for the inaugural Youth Winter Olympics. Acting as brakewoman, she formed a two-man bob team with Mica McNeil. In January 2012 she represented Great Britain at the bobsleigh at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics and Sawyers and McNeil became the country's first ever medal-winning team at the competition (and the only medallists for Britain that year), taking the silver medals behind the Dutch team. As a result, she was chosen as one of the carriers for the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.|$|E
25|$|Robinson joined Task Group 78.2 at Mangarin Bay on 10 April 1945 {{and sailed}} 4 days later. She rescued two Marine aviators {{from the sea}} on the 16th. The next day, the task group entered Polloc Harbor of Mindanao and Army troops were landed for the assault against the Malabang-Parang-Catobato area of Mindanao. Robinson {{returned}} to Mangarin Bay with the empty shipping on 24 April and sailed the next day escorting a convoy carrying reinforcements to Polloc Harbor. <b>She</b> <b>cleared</b> that port on 28 April escorting oiler Winooski (AO-38) via Tawi Tawi, Sulu Archipelago, Philippine Islands, to Muara Batagao, Tarakan, Borneo. She reached her destination on 2 May, {{the day after the}} initial assault on Tarakan, and bombarded an enemy-defended ridge north of the airfield and a supply road junction. She got underway from Tarakan Island on 8 May, escorting amphibious ships to the Netherlands East Indies, arriving at Morotai 2 days later.|$|E
25|$|She was the runner-up at the 2002 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships behind Mary Sauer and {{improved}} her outdoor best to 4.50m.

This gained her {{a place on the}} team for the 2003 World Championships in Athletics and she came eighth in the qualifying round of the vault. The 2004 season proved to be her breakthrough year as she was runner-up to Stacy Dragila at the USA Indoor Championships and then placed fourth at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships, vaulting a personal best mark of 4.60m. She achieved the same mark outdoors to take second at the Prefontaine Classic and was runner-up to Dragila at the 2004 Olympic Trials, securing her first Olympic berth. <b>She</b> <b>cleared</b> 4.30m in the qualifying rounds of the 2004 Athens Olympics, but this was not enough to make the final.|$|E
