40|$|ABSTRACT. Meiofauna {{collected}} during May 1982 {{in the soft}} bottom layer of nearshore landfast ice at Cape Hatt, northern Baffin Island, were dominated by cyclopoid copepods, harpacticoid copepods, nematodes and polychaete larvae (73. 5, 15. 4, 6. 3 and 3. 5 % of total numbers respectively). Also included were otifers, gastropod veligers and calanoid copepod nauplii; calanoid nauplii were probably present in the near-ice water and not on or in the ice. Average abundance of all ice meiofauna was 54 OOO individuals. m-*. Densities of all meiofauna groups were spatially variable, but only nematodes and cyclopoid copepods showed evidence of progressive temporal change between 18 May and 2 June. Undisturbed, enclosed areas of the under-ice surface were treated with o l on 23 - 24 May. Dispersed oil (Venezuela Lagomedio + Corexit 9527, BP CTD or BP 1100 WD) was {{in contact with the}} ice for 5 hours, whereas untreated oil and <b>solidified</b> <b>oil</b> (BP treatment) remained in the enclosures {{for the duration of the}} study (12 days post-treatment). Sampling was carried out in areas where oil contacted the ice and moved away or in areas near oil that remained in contact with the under-ice surface. Five hours after treatment, oil concentrations in the water within the enclosures were similar (0. 15 - 0. 28 ppm) in untreated oil, <b>solidified</b> <b>oil</b> and control enclosures. In contrast, dispersed oil concentrations were 5. 8 - 36. 5 ppm. Densities of all copepods and polychaetes decreased dramatically in each dispersed oil enclosure by the second post-spill day, and slight density increases were evident by the tenth post-spill day. Harpacticoid copepods apparently were more sensitive to dispersed oil than were cyclopoid copepods. Densities of nematodes and cyclopoid copepod nauplii were not affected by dispersed oil.

40|$|One {{category}} of mechanical systems that contains power-transferring point contacts is traction drive variators. These variators {{can be used}} in different concepts for Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) and in vehicle applications, in order to achieve optimum engine operating conditions leading to improved driveability, reduced fuel consumption and an increase in overall vehicle performance. The purpose of this work is to present an efficient computational module which generates the tractive forces occurring at the point contact and to show how it can be used within modern simulation software to enable fully dynamic analysis of mechanical traction drive systems. The constitutive relationship between traction and motion is based on a simple concept of dry friction and Hertzian pressure distribution. The relative motion is described by using the fundamental form of the pole concept which requires the presence of rotational motion (spin). This relationship {{can also be used to}} display the isothermal behaviour of contacts, where a <b>solidified</b> <b>oil</b> film is present. The present work is general in the sense that it can handle bi-directional slip conditions, i. e., slip along and perpendicular to the direction of rolling. Earlier efficient methods of analysis only considered slip in the rolling direction. A close study of different numerical methods has been conducted to find the most efficient methods for computation of the general relationships between traction and motion. This has resulted in the following three groups of methods: low slip conditions with fully analytical solutions, moderate slip conditions with partially analytical solutions, and large slip conditions with fully numerical solutions. The required input parameters are the relative motion, the shape of the elliptical contact and the accuracy requested. The corresponding output parameters are the equivalent tractive force and spin torque at the theoretical point of contact. To cover thermal effects at high slip conditions, the isothermal coefficient of friction can be corrected by means of an extension of a simple method by Tevaarwerk for the correction of large spin traction curves to cover the bi-directional slip conditions. This method is verified against experimental data produced by Gaggermeier. Experimental investigations have been conducted on a modified KOPP type traction drive variator to investigate the robustness of the contact module under operating conditions where thermal effects are apparent and the slip conditions are bi-directional. An important finding was that the torque losses are underestimated with the contact model. To cover that a simple formula for rolling resistance was included into the analysis. The contact module comprises general functions for calculation of the contact properties, relative sliding conditions, rolling resistance and tractive effort. It can also be customized with specific functions for detection of the point of contact. This has resulted in a contact module that can be used either in simple simulation software for analysis of simple applications, or in powerful Multi-Body System simulation packages for analysis of more complex applications. Both simple and complex implementations are presented. The new computational module efficiently evaluates the tractive forces for a given arbitrary relative sliding motion as well as the existing rolling resistance in a Hertzian point contact. This has not been available until now. By combining this contact subroutine with a powerful simulation tool such as ADAMS, DADS, Mechanica/MOTION, etc., the mechanical systems investigated can now be modelled in a more realistic way than before. This enables also an introduction of virtual prototyping into the product development process since the iteration between modelling and simulation is fast and the overview of the system is good in spite of the complexity...|$|E
40|$|Plastics are non-biodegradable {{polymers}} {{of mostly}} containing carbon, hydrogen, and few other {{elements such as}} chlorine, nitrogen etc. Due to its non-biodegradable nature, the plastic waste contributes significantly {{to the problem of}} Municipal Waste Management. The production of plastics is significantly growing. Nowadays the plastic production is more than 200 MT worldwide annually. According to a nation wide survey, conducted in the year 2004, approximately 10, 000 tones (ten thousand tones) of plastic waste were generated every day in our country (India), and only 60 % of it was recycled, balanced 40 % was not possible to dispose off. So gradually it goes on accumulating, thereby leading to serious disposal problems. Plastic is derived from petrochemical resources. In fact these plastics are essentially <b>solidified</b> <b>oil.</b> They therefore have inherently high calorific value. Waste Plastics are mostly land filled or incinerated; however, these methods are facing great social resistance because of environmental problems such as air pollution and soil contamination, as well as economical resistance due to the increase of space and disposal costs. In a long term neither the land filling nor the incineration solve the problem of wastes, because the suitable and safe depots are expensive, and the incineration stimulates the growing emission of harmful and greenhouse gases e. g. NOx, SOx, COx etc. Accordingly, recycling has become an important issue worldwide. This method can be classified as energy recovery, material recycling and chemical recycling. Among them one of the prevalent alternative methods is the production of converted fuel and chemicals by means of the thermal or catalytic degradation of polymers. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of catalyst amount, reaction temperature, plastic type (especially HDPE) and weight ratio of waste plastic to catalyst, with a semi-batch reactor, based on the results of yields and yield distributions of liquid product as a function of lapsed time. And to study the product yields and their distribution with different types of catalysts (Silica- Alumina, Activated Carbon, Mordenite) in the catalytic degradation of waste plastics with respect to time and temperature. And also for finding the effect of particle size and structure of the catalyst on product distribution and yield. One more objective is quantitative analysis of gaseous, liquid and solid products from thermal and catalytic degradation of HDPE and the comparison of the physical properties of the liquid products and to suggest the best reactor design along with the economical factors effecting the commercialization of this technique. We have studied extensively the catalytic nature of HDPE both under catalytic and noncatalytic methods with the application of some important suitable catalysts, and about the catalyst characterization by the application of SEM and XRD.

The coating was then scraped off and boiled with benzene or similar solvents to form a varnish. Walton initially planned to sell his varnish to the makers of water-repellent fabrics such as oilcloth, and patented the process in 1860. However, his method had problems: the cotton cloth soon fell apart, and it took months to produce enough of the linoxyn. Little interest was shown in Walton's varnish.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a study {{which has been}} carried out to use coconut oil as insulation in transformers. Among the important properties considered are the dielectric strength of coconut oil which corresponds to less than 20 kV for a 2. 5 mm sphere gap and the pour point which is approximately 23 °C. To retain the oil in liquid form at low temperatures, several pour point depressants were tried. Some of them depressed the pour point, but also lowered the dielectric strength and proved unsatisfactory. In order to have improved properties, a purified form of coconut oil was used in the investigation. In this, the free fatty acids have been neutralized (reduced to 0. 02 %). Deodorization by steam distillation at 200 °C has removed odorizing and tasting compounds of lower boiling points. The moisture has been reduced by heating to over 100 °C. The demoisturized coconut oil sample showed promising results. The dielectric strength improved to 60 kV or even higher dependant on the moisture reduction of the sample. Since the distribution transformer tank (manufactured by Lanka Transformers Ltd) is a sealed container and oil is filled inside a vacuum chamber, moisture inclusion after manufacture is prevented.

So the alloying elements can segregate and even effect the distribution of other elements in rapid solidified steel samples.

40|$|Magma {{transport}} in volcanic plumbing systems induces surface deformation, {{which can}} be monitored by geodetic techniques, such as GPS and InSAR. These geode- tic signals are commonly analyzed through geodetic models in order to constrain the shape of, and the pressure in, magma plumbing systems. These models, how- ever, suffer critical limitations: (1) the modelled magma conduit shapes cannot {{be compared with the}} real conduits, so the geodetic models cannot be tested nor validated; (2) the modelled conduits only exhibit shapes that are too simplistic; (3) most geodetic models only account for elasticity of the host rock, whereas substantial plastic deformation is known to occur. To overcome these limitations, one needs to use a physical system, in which (1) both surface deformation and the shape of, and pressure in, the underlying conduit are known, and (2) the mechanical properties of the host material are controlled and well known. In this contribution, we present novel quantitative laboratory results of shallow magma emplacement. Fine-grained silica flour represents the brittle crust, and low viscosity vegetable oil is an analogue for the magma. The melting temperature of the oil is 31 ◦C; the <b>oil</b> <b>solidifies</b> in the models {{after the end of the}} experiments. At the time of injection the oil temperature is 50 ◦C. The oil is pumped from a reservoir using a volumetric pump into the silica flour through a circular inlet at the bottom of a 40 x 40 cm square box. The silica flour is cohesive, such that oil in- trudes it by fracturing it, and produces typical sheet intrusions (dykes, cone sheets, etc.). During oil intrusion, the model surface deforms, mostly by doming. These movements are measured by an advanced photogrammetry method, which uses 4 synchronized fixed cameras that periodically image the surface of the model from different angles. We apply particle tracking method to compute the 3 D ground deformation pattern through time. After solidification of the oil, the intrusion can be excavated and photographed from several angles to compute its 3 D shape with the same photogrammetry method. Then, the surface deformation pattern can be directly compared with the shape of underlying intrusion. This quantitative dataset is essential to quantitatively test and validate classical volcano geodetic models...|$|R
40|$|Svenska kraftnät is the Swedish {{transmission}} system operator, {{responsible for the}} national electrical grid with power lines of 220 kV and 400 kV, and the electrical substations of the grid. In this master thesis an old substation located in a sensitive environmental area is inspected and its environmental risks defined and assessed. From this “worst case scenario” measures are recommended, that should be applicable on other existing substations, and for new constructed substations. This thesis {{is limited to a}} more detailed analysis on how oil spill can be handled. The insulating oil is used in different machines and equipment on the substation to avoid electrical charges. The inspected substation has a special feature; a pipe system that connects wells on the substation area, water pipes from the substation house, and transformer pits to an oil-water separation house. The oil pits are made of concrete and placed under machines with large amounts of oil to capture the oil in case of a breakdown or leakage. In the oil-water separation house oil is separated from water and the clean water is sent to a lake in the vicinity. The most severe environmental risks found are the filter in the oil-water separation house and the risk of oil leakage from the open water-cooling system of the synchronous generator. In addition, {{there is no way to}} catch oil spill from current and voltage transformers and it is not known if the pipe system that transports water and oil spills is completely sealed. Finally, there is no permanent installation to catch spills from tank filling areas and Svenska kraftnät does rarely follow up the environmental work of the entrepreneurs. Svenska kraftnät is recommended to use the products and services from the companies Qlean Scandinavia AB and TTL Miljöteknik AB to attend to the noted environmental risks. Qlean Scandinavia AB offers an environmental friendly cleaning procedure with ultraclean water and sealing of concrete, which can be used for the transformer pits and oil-water separation house. They also sell profile planks as a fire-extinguishing layer for transformer pits. These are considered better and safer than the conventional stones used. The price is almost the same, however the maintenance costs are lower for the profile planks, since they are easier to clean and do not require heavy transports to landfill. They also require less space than the stones, therefore a smaller transformer pit can be built, and cost savings can be made on concrete. TTL Miljöteknik AB has products based on environmental friendly <b>oil</b> <b>solidifying</b> polymers placed in different textiles and filters. They let water and other substances pass, but react with hydrocarbons, like oil, forming a tight rubberlike mass. These installations are new to Europe, but more than 12 000 installations have been made, mainly in the United States and Australia. For the inspected substation in this thesis it is recommended to manage oil spill at each machine and to clean the pipe system. An HFF-filter should be installed in cleaned and sealed transformer pits. The filter lets water from precipitation pass, but binds oil, thanks to the solidifying polymers. The clean water is further transported through the pipe system to the oil-water separation house and from there water is pumped to the lake. Wells must be sealed and the pipes from the substation house led to a septic tank. Agent X, a type of filter mat, should be placed on the substation area to catch oil spills from current and voltage transformers, since previous breakdowns show that oil can be spread over a large area. For plants without a pipe system the water will be released outside the transformer pits. For new constructions it is suggested that transformer pits are built with a polyvinyl mat in the bottom and a filter on the sides, which will capture the oil. A concrete fundament still needs to be built to support the machine; therefore the price will almost be the same as for the conventional transformer pit in concrete, although less concrete is needed. However, with this technique the transformer pit will not require any maintenance...|$|R
