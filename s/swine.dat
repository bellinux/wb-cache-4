5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and <b>swine,</b> have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and <b>swine</b> which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in <b>swine,</b> led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and <b>swine</b> caught the disease from humans.|$|E
5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and <b>swine</b> influenza, <b>swine</b> fever and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E

5|$|Despite these atrocities, {{the main}} cause of the {{population}} decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably African sleeping sickness, smallpox, <b>swine</b> influenza and amoebic dysentery, ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that half-a-million Congolese had died from sleeping sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while excess deaths rose.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{rationing}} {{was imposed}} almost immediately. Restrictions were immediately more stringent {{than in the}} Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration. By August 1940, legislation was passed that made the wasting of food a prisonable offence. Posters encouraged kitchen waste {{to be used for}} feeding animals, primarily <b>swine</b> but also poultry.|$|E

The consequences of this game would be felt as part of the 2009 <b>swine</b> flu pandemic in Australia.

5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 <b>swine</b> flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic <b>swine</b> flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E

5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because {{of the impact of}} previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. Some thought the cancellation was because of the recent <b>swine</b> flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the Conservancy {{started the}} Rare Breed <b>Swine</b> Initiative, which, in {{cooperation}} with other organizations, assists in training breeders and cultivating the rare breed pig market. The three main foci of the initiative are marketing breeding stock and products, conserving bloodlines and supporting breed associations. As of 2010, proposals were {{in place for the}} funding of a study of porcine genetics, including variability and relationships among breeds, with the aims of maintaining genetic variability among rare pig breeds and releasing a definition of heritage pork.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and <b>swine</b> breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.|$|E

5|$|The Slavic people cremated their dead, {{typical for}} the {{inhabitants}} of their region for centuries. The burials were usually single, the graves grouped in small cemeteries, with the ashes placed in simple urns more often than in ground indentations.

The food production economy was based on millet and wheat cultivation, hunting, fishing, gathering and cattle breeding (<b>swine,</b> sheep and goats bred to a lesser extent).|$|E

One exception was Mexico, however, because of the <b>swine</b> flu outbreak in the country, which forced Sony to push the release date to July 31, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} food {{eaten in}} Sihanaka {{has long been}} rice, which they cultivate heavily. The rice based diet was supplemented by {{a wide range of}} game and other meats, including lemurs, wild boars, snakes, owls, rats, cats and crocodile, the latter having at one time been protected by a fady that was eventually abandoned. Use of tobacco or marijuana and consumption of pork were commonly forbidden in Sihanaka families. Many believed that transporting <b>swine</b> across Lake Alaotra would bring storms. Their traditional dress consisted of clothing woven of raffia fibers.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Valnemulin, a semisynthetic pleuromutilin {{derivative}} {{related to}} tiamulin, is broadly {{used to treat}} bacterial diseases of animals. Despite its widespread use, metabolism in animals {{has not yet been}} fully investigated. To better understand valnemulin biotransformation, in this study, metabolites of valnemulinin in in vitro and in vivo rats, chickens, <b>swines,</b> goats, and cows were identified and elucidated using ultraperformance liquid chromatography−quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS). As a result, there were totally 7 metabolites of valnemulin identified in vitro and 75, 61, and 74 metabolites detected in in vivo rats, chickens, and <b>swines,</b> respectively, and the majority of metabolites were reported for the first time. The main metabolic pathways of valnemulin were found to be hydroxylation in the mutilin part (the ring system) and the side chain, oxidization on the sulfur of the side chain to form S-oxides, hydrolysis of the amido bond, and acetylization in the amido of the side chain. In addition, hydroxylation in the mutilin part was proposed to be the primary metabolic route. Furthermore, the results revealed that 2 β-hydroxyvalnemulin (V 1) and 8 α-hydroxyvalnemulin (V 2) were the major metabolites for rats and <b>swines</b> and S-oxides (V 6) in chickens...|$|R
