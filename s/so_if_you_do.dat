6000|$|... "Well; I can't {{say that}} I shall be shot if it be not so; {{but if it}} be not <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not agree that it shall be so, I shall be turned out of Greshamsbury." ...|$|E
60|$|LINA. Thank you: I'm quite {{comfortable}} as I am. I am {{not accustomed to}} gowns: they hamper me and make me feel ridiculous; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>dont</b> mind I shall not change.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was horridly improper; and Tom {{ought to}} have told <b>you</b> <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> n't know any better. I should be mortified to death if any of my friends saw you," [...] added Fan, much disturbed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} don't. You wouldn't be <b>so</b> good <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> You're awfully lucky, you know, {{to be able}} to pour {{yourself}} down your flute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{shall be}} disappointed {{if you decide}} against me; but not more violently <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it next week than {{if you do it}} now. But I do hope that you will not decide against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am going}} out now, Jacob, and as I shall be calling at several places, {{you had better}} go your own way. Remember this street is Broadway; it is the {{principal}} street here, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> by any chance lose yourself any one {{can tell you the}} way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} that things are wrong that {{is no reason why}} you should not be punished for them; though not as much, not as much, my little man" [...] (and the lady looked very kindly, after all), [...] "as if you did know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! but {{not like}} a company luncheon,' said Harriet; 'besides, Mr. Somerville will be <b>so</b> {{disappointed}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not come. Poor Mr. Somerville, won't you be sorry for him, Dora?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'DO {{you know}} better though?' said Bella. 'Do you really believe {{you know better}}? Oh, I should be <b>so</b> glad <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> know better, but I am so very much afraid that I must know best!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will put}} them in a safe place, or get a friend to <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> your duty, <b>you</b> will go to your wife and beg her pardon for having even for an instant thought of leaving her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush," [...] Irene said, laying {{her hand}} on mine persuasively. [...] "You're excited to-night, Harry. You are flushed and feverish. You don't know what you're saying. You mustn't talk <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you'll make me hate you and despise you. You must keep your word now, and marry Miss Vivian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Losing a prize {{sometimes}} {{makes one}} happier than gaining it. You have proved {{that you could}} do better than most of them; <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not beat, you may still feet proud," [...] answered Miss Celia, giving back the bow with a smile that said more than her words.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{meaning is}} that I {{am about to}} turn you out. I am coming back here, {{and there is not}} room for both of us. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not see your way to going quietly, I shall take you by {{the back of the neck}} and run you out. Do I make myself fairly clear now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Master Ormskirk," [...] he said, folding his arms, [...] "you {{can kill}} me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will, {{and it will}} be best <b>so,</b> for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not I shall live but the life of a hunted dog, and sooner or later fall into their hands." ...|$|R
60|$|Mar. Fear you, sir! what {{is there}} dreadful in you? You've all the graces that can crown mankind; Yet wear them <b>so,</b> as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not know them; So stainless, fearless, free in all your actions, As <b>if</b> heaven lent <b>you</b> to the world to pattern.|$|R
60|$|If my {{antagonist}} be necessitous, {{where is}} the merit? he does it for his own sake, not for the public. If he be not necessitous, what a sordid wretch is he to withhold his scheme for lucre? putting it up at public sale; <b>so</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not give him his price you shall not have it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' {{said the}} robber, {{grasping}} Oliver's wrist, {{and putting the}} barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start; 'if you speak a word when you're out o'doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without notice. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{make up your mind}} to speak without leave, say your prayers first.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I found Anita {{in earnest}} {{consultation}} with her maid Maria and {{the mistress of}} the hotel, {{and it was at}} least an hour before she could see me. When I told her I had secured the cot, or at least arranged to do so, she was pleased and grateful, especially as I had had {{to go out into the}} rain to do it. 'I knew, of course,' she said, 'that Baxter would settle that all right, and so I have been making my arrangements. But there is one favor I want you to grant me: I don't want you to ask me anything about how I am going to manage matters. I don't want to deceive you in any possible way, and <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not ask me any questions it will make it easier for me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{deep red}} colour flushed all over Kate's {{face and neck}} in her angry shame and confusion, burning darker and more crimson, so that Mr. Wardour was very sorry for her, and added, [...] "I am obliged to say this, because {{you ought to know}} that it is both very wrong in itself, and will be {{regarded}} by other people as more terrible than what you are repenting of more. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> find yourself distrusted and in disgrace, you must not think it unjust and cruel, but try to submit patiently, and learn not to be reckless and imprudent. My poor child, I wish you could have so come to us that we might have been happier together. Perhaps you will some day; and in the meantime, if you have any troubles, or want to know anything, you may always write to me." ...|$|E
3000|$|American {{universities}} and colleges should ensure that Chinese international students are provided with directions to the university or college prior to their arrival in the States. As one freshman in this study noted, “You don’t want {{to figure out how}} to go to your school when you landed at the airport. It’s <b>so</b> frustrating <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not how to get to your school.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! now I {{shall be}} so wretched. It is his invitation, not hers: Mr Gresham could not ask me. As for her, {{do not think}} of her; but do, do go when he asks you like that. You will make me <b>so</b> miserable <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not. And then Sir Louis cannot go without you,"--and Mary pointed upstairs--"and you may be sure that he will go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then, gentlemen, {{shall we}} {{try a little}} walk? Quick march! Thank you, gentlemen. Sorry to trouble you, {{but it may be}} {{necessary}} to run--forward I mean, of course.. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really <b>do</b> not mind, we will now do the double quick. Halt! And <b>if</b> next time <b>you</b> can keep a little more in line--it has a more imposing appearance, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> understand me. The breathing comes with practice." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{when two}} brethren {{were coming to}} him, and water failed them on the journey, one of them died, {{and the other was}} about to die. In fact, being no longer able to walk, he too lay upon the ground expecting death. But Antony, as he sat on the mountain, called two monks who {{happened}} to be there, and hastened them, saying, [...] "Take a pitcher of water, and run on the road towards Egypt; for of two who are coming hither one has just expired, and the other will do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not hasten. For this has been showed to me as I prayed." [...] So the monks going found the one lying dead, and buried him; and the other they recovered with the water, and brought him to the old man. Now the distance was a day's journey. But if any one should ask why he did not speak before one of them expired, he does not question rightly; for the judgment of that death did not belong to Antony, but to God, who both judged concerning the one; and revealed concerning the other. But this alone in Antony was wonderful, that sitting on the mountain he kept his heart watchful, and the Lord showed him things afar off.|$|E
6000|$|... “Time {{enough when}} you get back, Stephen. But if you have got any money to spend you had better go with me to a stall where, the last two voyages I have been here, I laid in a stock of {{articles}} useful for trading with the Malays—looking-glasses, beads, brass buttons, bright handkerchiefs, {{and things of that}} sort. I don’t say but that one might get them cheaper in London; but in the first place, one always finds plenty of things there to spend one’s money on; and in the second place, the people here know exactly the sort of goods needed in the islands, and one can get them all at one stall instead of having to hunt about in a dozen shops for them. We are each allowed to trade on our own account up to a certain amount; and, as a rule, I find that when I get back here I can sell the curiosities I buy down in the islands, for about four times as much as the goods cost me, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> the same you will have more money to buy things with here than if you bought them now. But for most of the things you pick up you will find you can get a much better price in London than you can here.” ...|$|E
6000|$|My dear Taylor--This morning I {{received}} yours of the 2d, {{and with}} it a letter from Hessey enclosing a Bank post Bill of £30, an ample sum I assure you--more I had no thought of.--You should not have delayed so long in Fleet St.--leading an inactive life as you did was breathing poison: {{you will find the}} country air do more for you than you expect. But it must be proper country air. You must choose a spot. What sort of a place is Retford? You should have a dry, gravelly, barren, elevated country, open to the currents of air, and such a place is generally furnished with the finest springs--The neighbourhood of a rich enclosed fulsome manured arable land, especially in a valley and almost as bad on a flat, would be almost as bad as the smoke of Fleet St.--Such a place as this was Shanklin, only open to the south-east, and surrounded by hills in every other direction. From this south-east came the damps of the sea; which, having no egress, the air would for days together take on an unhealthy idiosyncrasy altogether enervating and weakening as a city smoke--I felt it very much. Since I have been here at Winchester I have been improving in health--it is not so confined--and there is {{on one side of the}} City a dry chalky down, where the air is worth Sixpence a pint. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not get better at Retford, do not impute it to your own weakness before you have well considered the Nature of the air and soil--especially as Autumn is encroaching--for the Autumn fog over a rich land is like the steam from cabbage water. What makes the great difference between valesmen, flatlandmen and mountaineers? The cultivation of the earth in a great measure--Our health temperament and disposition are taken more (notwithstanding the contradiction of the history of Cain and Abel) from the air we breathe, than is generally imagined. See the difference between a Peasant and a Butcher.--I am convinced a great cause of it is the difference of the air they breathe: the one takes his mingled with the fume of slaughter, the other from the dank exhalement from the glebe; the teeming damp that comes up from the plough-furrow is of great effect in taming the fierceness of a strong man--more than his labour--Let him be mowing furze upon a mountain, and at the day's end his thoughts will run upon a..axe[104] if he ever had handled one; let him leave the plough, and he will think quietly of his supper. Agriculture is the tamer of men--the steam from the earth is like drinking their Mother's milk--it enervates their nature--this appears a great cause of the imbecility of the Chinese: and if this sort of atmosphere is a mitigation to the energy of a strong man, how much more must it injure a weak one unoccupied unexercised--For what is the cause of so many men maintaining a good state in Cities, but occupation--An idle man, a man who is not sensitively alive to self-interest in a city cannot continue long in good health. This is easily explained--If you were to walk leisurely through an unwholesome path in the fens, with a little horror of them, you would be sure to have your ague. But let Macbeth cross the same path, with the dagger in the air leading him on, and he would never have an ague or anything like it--You should give these things a serious consideration. Notts, I believe, is a flat county--You should be on the slope of one of the dry barren hills in Somersetshire. I am convinced there is as harmful air to be breathed in the country as in town. I am greatly obliged to you for your letter. Perhaps, if you had had strength and spirits enough, you would have felt offended by my offering a note of hand, or rather expressed it. However, I am sure you will give me credit for not in anywise mistrusting you: or imagining that you would take advantage of any power I might give you over me. No--It proceeded from my serious resolve not to be a gratuitous borrower, from a great desire to be correct in money matters, to have in my desk the Chronicles of them to refer to, and know my worldly non-estate: besides in case of my death such documents would be but just, if merely as memorials of the friendly turns I had done to me--Had I known of your illness I should not have written in such fiery phrase in my first letter. I hope that shortly you will be able to bear six times as much. Brown likes the tragedy very much: But he is not a fit judge of it, as I have only acted as midwife to his plot; and of course he will be fond of his child. I do not think I can make you any extracts without spoiling the effect of the whole when you come to read it--I hope you will then not think my labour mis-spent. Since I finished it, I have finished Lamia, and am now occupied in revising St. Agnes's Eve, and studying Italian. Ariosto I find as diffuse, in parts, as Spenser--I understand completely the difference between them. I will cross the letter with some lines from Lamia. Brown's kindest remembrances to you--and I am ever your most sincere friend ...|$|E

60|$|As to the ballad, dearest Miss Mitford, {{which you}} and Mr. Kenyon are indulgent enough to like, {{remember}} that he passed his criticism over it--before it went to you--and <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not find as many obscurities {{as he did in}} it, the reason is--his merit and not mine. But don't believe him--no!--don't believe even Mr. Kenyon--whenever he says that I am perversely obscure. Unfortunately obscure, not perversely--that is quite a wrong word. And the last time he used it to me (and then, I assure you, another word still worse was with it) I begged him to confine them for the future to his jesting moods. Because, indeed, I am not in the very least degree perverse in this fault of mine, which is my destiny rather than my choice, and comes upon me, I think, just where I would eschew it most. So little has perversity to do with its occurrence, that my fear of it makes me sometimes feel quite nervous and thought-tied in composition....|$|R
