5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> of the transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, {{though it is}} unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using oxyacetylene torches ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|E

25|$|On 20 October 1827, as {{the weather}} got worse, the British, Russian and French fleets entered the Bay of Navarino in {{peaceful}} formation to shelter themselves {{and to make sure}} that the Egyptian-Turkish fleet did not <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> and attack Hydra. When a British frigate sent a boat to request the Egyptians to move their fire ships, the officer on board was shot by the Egyptians. The frigate responded with musket fire in retaliation and an Egyptian ship fired a cannon shot at the French flagship, the Sirene, which returned fire.|$|E
25|$|As the Ring {{contained}} {{a large part}} of Sauron's power, it was endowed with a malevolent sentience of sorts. While separated from Sauron, the Ring would strive to return to him by manipulating its bearer to claim ownership of it, or by abandoning the bearer at an opportune moment. For example, it slipped from Isildur's finger during the ambush at Gladden Fields; moments later he was killed by orcs, leaving the Ring's whereabouts unknown to Sauron's enemies. It also slipped off Gollum's finger when the time was right for it to be brought back into the world at large. Warned by Bilbo of the Ring's tendency to <b>slip</b> <b>off,</b> Frodo carried the Ring on a chain.|$|E

25|$|David Warner (6) fell {{early in}} the run chase and was {{followed}} by Shane Watson (0) just before tea as Australia reached 2/25 at the break. Steve Smith and Rogers steadied the Australian innings after tea, {{and put on a}} 63-run stand before Rogers (55) was caught at <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> Ishant Sharma. Shaun Marsh was caught behind shortly after for 17. Smith (28) was run-out by Yadav and India had a slight chance when Haddin (1) was caught off the bowling of Yadav. But Mitchell Marsh (6*) scored the remaining runs required as Australia won by 4 wickets and took a 2-0 series lead. Steve Smith was named Man of the Match for his century in the first innings, the ninth captain on debut to do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} play was again delayed on day 2, but Samuels took {{little time to}} {{complete}} his century. However, he was out shortly afterwards, caught by Ian Bell at second <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> Anderson, and the West Indies were 223/6. Three quick wickets from Stuart Broad followed, taking Ramdin, Jason Holder and Kemar Roach, before a fifty partnership from Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel for the final wicket took their score to 299 all out. England had 26 overs left {{in the day to}} begin their response, and they managed to close out the day with both Alastair Cook – who surpassed Alec Stewart as England's second-highest Test run scorer – and Jonathan Trott still at the crease, reaching 74/0 at stumps.|$|E
25|$|Blignaut {{was strangely}} subdued for the 33 {{deliveries}} he faced, {{and although he}} did attempt some ODI-style heaves, they mostly missed both his bat and the off stump. Blignaut was eventually lbw for 4, but Keith Dabengwa {{came to the rescue}} with an entertaining 35 to bat out the day. He yielded a catch to VVS Laxman at first <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> Irfan Pathan in the second over of the morning, however, as Zimbabwe only managed to add ten to their overnight score for the loss of three wickets. Pathan was the pick of the Indian bowlers, swinging the ball well to dismiss Gavin Ewing and Blessing Mahwire as well, as Zimbabwe were all out for 279 – with Tatenda Taibu left not out for 71.|$|E

25|$|The One Ring possessed {{something}} of a will of its own. Its only accepted master was Sauron himself, and it would seek to leave any other bearer when it would cause the greatest harm, or when it might return to Sauron. Bilbo warned Frodo of this, and Frodo kept it on a chain {{so that it would}} not <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> unnoticed. In the end, Gollum succumbs to the malevolent influence of the ring, defies Frodo, and takes the ring for himself. While dancing with joy over the recovery of the ring, Gollum falls into the Cracks of Doom in Orodruin, where the ring is destroyed. With the destruction of the Ring, Gandalf explains that Sauron is weakened to the point that he {{will never be able to}} materialize again.|$|E
25|$|Many {{displacements}} (~96% of LDD, 64% of RDD) resolve {{with medical}} management that includes fluids (oral or intravenous) to rehydrate {{the horse and}} soften any impaction that may be present. Systemic analgesics, antispasmodics, and sedation are often used to keep the horse comfortable during this time. Horses with left dorsal displacement are sometimes treated with exercise and/or phenylephrine—a medication that causes contracture of the spleen and may allow the bowel to <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> the nephrosplenic ligament. At times anesthesia and a rolling procedure, in which the horse is placed in left lateral recumbency and rolled to right lateral recumbency while jostling, {{can also be used}} to try to shift the colon off of the nephrosplenic ligament. Displacements that do not respond to medical therapy require surgery, which generally has a very high success rate (80–95%).|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} has been used at least for millennia if not longer since it is also used by the great apes, {{as well as other}} primates. Robert Francoeur notes that evidence of the missionary position's use appears in ancient pottery and art in the Fertile Crescent {{as well as in the}} art of Early Greeks, Romans, Peruvians, Indians, Chinese and Japanese. The majority of the positions described in the Kama Sutra involve the woman lying on her back with her legs in a variety of positions. According to Canongate, ancient art shows missionary as being less popular than woman-on-top positions in Ur, Greece, Rome, Peru, India, China and Japan. But Francoeur states that the ancient Chinese preferred male-on-top because of their belief that males are born face down and women face up. Kagaba natives in Colombia preferred missionary because of the stability it offers; they believed that if the woman moved during intercourse, the earth would <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> the shoulders of the four giants who held it up above the waters. Some Kerala tribes believe that the male-on-top position is the only way to conceive warriors.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{advanced}} to a commanding {{lead on the}} fourth and final day, Hayden becoming only the fourth Australian to score a century in both innings of a Test match with his 103. Waugh once again went cheaply but Adam Gilchrist weighed in with 60 not out from just 59 balls to take the Aussies to 296 for 5. Giles and Caddick were the only England bowlers to have any success: Giles taking the wickets of both Hayden and Ponting to finish with figures of 2 for 90 and Caddick taking 3 for 95. Waugh's declaration left England an imposing target of 464 runs for victory. It was a target that quickly looked far out of reach as England crumbled to 79 all out in just 28 overs, with only Mark Butcher's 40 troubling the scorers. Michael Vaughan departed LBW to McGrath on just the third ball of the innings and Trescothick soon followed, caught at <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> Jason Gillespie. Brief partnerships between Hussain and Butcher, then Butcher and Craig White were soon taken apart by strong bowling from McGrath (4 for 36) and Warne (3 for 29).|$|E
25|$|Australia {{started the}} day slowly as the Indian pace pair of R. P. Singh and Sharma bowled accurately. After a short rain delay, the Australians began {{to seize the}} {{initiative}} and soon wiped out their first innings deficit. Approaching lunch, Jaques was out to Kumble after a lofted sweep went to the fielder on the fence. Ponting came to the crease but was caught at silly point off the first ball he faced from Harbhajan, sparking major celebrations among the Indians, including two half-commando rolls from Harbhajan. After lunch, Hayden and Hussey rebuilt Australia's innings with the former scoring another hundred. Ponting acted as his runner due to an injury he collected while batting. Hayden was eventually dismissed by Kumble for 123 while attempting a reverse sweep. The very next ball Kumble claimed Clarke for a golden duck. Clarke stood his ground as he was caught at <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> the glove, and only walked after the umpire had given him out. On a hat trick, Kumble hit Symonds on the pads sparking a loud appeal which was turned down. Symonds and Hussey saw Australia to stumps with a healthy lead.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting, {{the next}} man in, {{had a great}} start to his innings, {{creaming}} a boundary off only the second ball he faced. When Ponting had added just six to his tally, Virender Sehwag dropped a chance at third <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> Pathan, and when he reached 12, a close lbw decision against him off Ajit Agarkar's bowling was turned down. Overcoming these hiccups, Ponting strove on further with his innings, reaching his fifty off 64 balls, with a four off Ashish Nehra's bowling, in the 23rd over of Australia's innings. One over later, Langer joined the party, too, amassing 20 runs off Anil Kumble's sixth over with two boundaries and two sixes apiece. However, Kumble {{was to have the}} last laugh, as he trapped Langer, who nevertheless, made a dominating and attacking 58 from a mere 72 deliveries in the fifth ball of the 26th over, when Australia were cruising along at a run-rate of above five per over. The dismissal occurred shortly before lunch, providing the Indians with a vital breakthrough, but the relief was a short one, as Langer was replaced by Martyn, who proved to be a thorn in the Indian team's flesh. Martyn seemed to be in a graceful touch from his first ball, stroking some good shots to the fence against the pace duo of Agarkar and Pathan, the latter being unable to replicate his good start with the new ball. Just when he seemed set for a big score, Martyn threw away his wicket when he chased a wide ball from Nehra to VVS Laxman. Steve Waugh the next batsman also played a few through the off-side for his 30 before he was bowled by a clever piece of bowling from Nehra. Simon Katich came in at the fall of the fourth wicket at 252, and then he proceeded to add 138 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. Katich started slowly, but gained momentum and proceeded to pepper shots all over the wicket once he settled down, the most memorable shot being a six of Nehra. The partnership ended in the 88th over of the Australian over of the day, when he top-edged a pull from Agarkar, only to be caught by a spectacular catch by Sehwag, who came in diving full-length and held on to the cherry with both hands.|$|E

25|$|Despite the England {{collapse}} {{the pitch}} was losing its moisture and looked better for runs. Colin McDonald and Neil Harvey saw the day out with 96/1 {{for the loss}} of Jim Burke, bowled by Statham for 3 when he left the ball alone. Lacking the pace of the Australian bowlers Statham and Loader could not make the ball lift as they had done and Trevor Bailey and Jim Laker suffered as Harvey struck 10 fours in his 60 not out by the end of New Year's Day. They returned to the fray the following morning with May setting only one slip as he tried to stop the flow of runs, which saved Harvey when he edged to the vacant second slip on 67. Bailey bowled down the leg side with a leg field while Harvey watched the balls go by, but he and McDonald were able to run quickly between the wickets and keep the score ticking over, but only 39 runs were made off 18 eight–ball overs before lunch. Soon after the break Tom Graveney took a juggled catch at first <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> Statham to dismiss McDonald for 47 after four hours. Norm O'Neill came into a defensive field to Tony Lock bowling round the wicket and found it difficult to make runs, but tried one cracking drive that was stopped by the bowler and hurt his hand. Harvey tok 267 minutes to make his century, but there was a huge roar round the giant Melbourne Ground when he reached three figures. With his hundred up he attacked Laker and Lock, but with tight fields and accurate bowling he was unable to get away. The new ball was taken after tea and Statham had O'Neill (37) caught behind trying a powerful stroke off his back foot. Peter Loader, who had been plundered for 36 runs in 8 overs bowled Harvey (167) when he missed an on–drive. Considering the quality and the accuracy of the bowling Alec Bedser thought this was Harvey's best century and it was greatly appreciated by the 71,000 crowd. They could not have enjoyed what followed as Bobby Simpson and Richie Benaud went for ducks and Australia crashed from 255/2 to 262/6. Ken Mackay (18) and Alan Davidson (25) pulled the score to 282/6 {{by the end of the}} day, but Statham (7/57) had them out in the morning, then cleaned up tail for 308. He became only the sixth England bowler to take seven wickets in a Test innings in Australia after Tom Richardson (8/94), George Lohmann (8/35 and 8/58), Wilfred Rhodes (7/56 and 8/68), Doug Wright (7/105) and Frank Tyson (7/27). Once again Neil Harvey had scored over half the innings for Australia, but they were only 49 runs ahead.|$|E

500|$|England lost opener Kieswetter in {{the first}} over; caught at first <b>slip</b> <b>off</b> the third ball of the innings, having been dropped by the keeper the ball before. Pietersen and Collingwood were both trapped LBW by Abdur Razzak without passing 20, and Morgan joined Cook in the middle with the score at 68/3. Initially, Morgan {{supported}} his captain by rotating the strike, but when Cook was dismissed for a 61-ball 60, he played with more freedom. A partnership of 90 with wicket-keeper Prior brought England close to 200, but Wright, Bresnan and Swann all fell cheaply, leaving England requiring 31 runs off 26 balls with only two wickets remaining. With England [...] "seemingly in disarray", Morgan {{took control of the}} match, and completed the run-chase with three boundaries in five balls.
