5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which <b>structural</b> <b>data</b> about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression was embedded within the southwesterly flow between a ridge over the eastern Caribbean Sea and a mid-latitude trough, which caused a steady east-northeast motion. The convection organized into a central dense overcast with a well-defined cloud band wrapping partially around the center, and based on satellite imagery estimates the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status; late on December 4, the National Hurricane Center named the storm Odette. After being named, the storm intensified despite moderate southwesterly wind shear, and an eye feature became evident on microwave satellite imagery. Additionally, about three–fourths of a mid-level eyewall developed. The storm was assessed with winds of 40–50mph (65–85km/h), though the National Hurricane Center remarked the winds could have been stronger {{due to lack of}} <b>structural</b> <b>data.</b> The eye feature diminished as the convective structure deteriorated slightly, and Hurricane Hunters first flew into the storm at around 1200UTC on December 5. Odette tracked over an area of warm sea surface temperatures, and the overall cloud pattern gradually improved; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the storm to attain hurricane status. Early on December 6, a TRMM overpass showed an 80% closed eyewall, and at 0600UTC Odette attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) while located about 245miles (395km/h) southwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.|$|E

The performance function of an RC system is configured such that it may appositely take into account the existent safety redundancy in the system. With a nonparametric statistical inference technique, simulated and field-collected <b>structural</b> appraisal <b>data</b> are then used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the formulated framework for the reliability analyses...|$|R

Recent studies demonstrate that artificial neural networks {{can be used to}} detect sensor faults. In this paper, decentralized artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied for autonomous sensor fault detection. On each sensor node of a wireless SHM system, an ANN is implemented to measure and to process <b>structural</b> response <b>data.</b> <b>Structural</b> response <b>data</b> is predicted by each sensor node based on correlations between adjacent sensor nodes and on redundancies inherent in the SHM system. Evaluating the deviations (or residuals) between measured and predicted data, sensor faults are autonomously detected by the wireless sensor nodes in a fully decentralized manner. A prototype SHM system implemented in this study, which is capable of decentralized autonomous sensor fault detection, is validated in laboratory experiments through simulated sensor faults. Several topologies and modes of operation of the embedded ANNs are investigated with respect to the dependability and the accuracy of the fault detection approach. In conclusion, the prototype SHM system is able to accurately detect sensor faults, demonstrating that neural networks, processing decentralized <b>structural</b> response <b>data,</b> facilitate autonomous fault detection, thus increasing the dependability and the accuracy of structural health monitoring systems...|$|R

This unique combination of contacts and conformations of TPP leads to formation of the reactive C2-carbanion, eventually.

25|$|Tertiary {{structure}} of MTs is also highly heterogeneous. While vertebrate, echinoderm and crustacean MTs show a bidominial structure with divalent metals as Zn(II) or Cd(II) (the protein is folded {{so as to}} bind metals in two functionally independent domains, with a metallic cluster each), yeast and procariotyc MTs show a monodominial structure (one domain with a single metallic cluster). Although no <b>structural</b> <b>data</b> is available for molluscan, nematoda and Drosophila MTs, it is commonly assumed that the former are bidominial and the latter monodominial. No conclusive data are available for Plant MTs, but two possible structures have been proposed: 1) a bidominial structure {{similar to that of}} vertebrate MTs; 2) a codominial structure, in which two Cys-rich domains interact to form a single metallic cluster.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative statistical approach to evaluating seismic structural safety using incomplete appraisal data. Despite the continuous improvement to traditional structural assessment procedures {{and the recent}} progress in structural health monitoring (SHM) methodologies, practically acquired <b>structural</b> appraisal <b>data</b> may often be incomplete. The occurrence of the appraisal data missingness could be ascribed to the malfunction of data acquisition systems, the abnormality during data transfer, and the inaccessibility of critical quantities, among other reasons. The study begins with a quantitative investigation into {{the sensitivity of the}} seismic fragility evaluation with respect to the <b>structural</b> appraisal <b>data</b> missingness through the defined additional information loss and probability of noninformativeness. Subsequently, a remedy for the missingness of the <b>structural</b> appraisal <b>data,</b> instead of a precaution against it, is formulated by employing the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. With synthetic or real seismic ground accelerations involved, the efficacy of the EM algorithm embedded remedy is demonstrated by examples of typical linear or nonlinear hysteretic systems in the framework of statistical hypothesis testing. Resorting to the bootstrap technique, the influence of the related correlations and missingness probability is also examined...|$|R
500|$|Having {{proposed}} {{a model of}} globular proteins, Wrinch investigated whether it {{was consistent with the}} available <b>structural</b> <b>data.</b> [...] She hypothesized that bovine tuberculin protein (523) was a C1 closed cyclol consisting of 72 residues and that the digestive enzyme pepsin was a C2 closed cyclol of 288 residues. [...] These residue-number predictions were difficult to verify, since the methods then available to measure the mass of proteins were inaccurate, such as analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical methods.|$|E
500|$|However, as {{algorithmic}} {{improvements and}} computer performance have erased purely technical deficiencies in older approaches, {{it has become}} clear that there is no one universal criterion for the 'optimal' structural alignment. TM-align, for instance, is particularly robust in quantifying comparisons between sets of proteins with great disparities in sequence lengths, but it only indirectly captures hydrogen bonding or secondary structure order conservation which might be better [...] metrics for alignment of evolutionarily related proteins. Thus recent developments have focused on optimizing particular attributes such as speed, quantification of scores, correlation to alternative gold standards, or tolerance of imperfection in <b>structural</b> <b>data</b> or ab initio structural models. An alternative methodology that is gaining popularity is to use the consensus of various methods to ascertain proteins structural similarities.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a number}} of enzymes, the moiety {{that acts as a}} {{cofactor}} is formed by post-translational modification of a part of the protein sequence. [...] This often replaces the need for an external binding factor, such as a metal ion, for protein function. [...] Potential modifications could be oxidation of aromatic residues, binding between residues, cleavage or ring-forming. [...] These alterations are distinct from other post-translation protein modifications, such as phosphorylation, methylation, or glycosylation in that the amino acids typically acquire new functions. [...] This increases the functionality of the protein; unmodified amino acids are typically limited to acid-base reactions, and the alteration of resides can give the protein electrophilic sites or the ability to stabilize free radicals. [...] Examples of cofactor production include tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ), derived from two tryptophan side chains, and 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO), derived from an Ala-Ser-Gly motif.
