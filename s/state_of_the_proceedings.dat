6000|$|The {{spirit of}} those agents {{will be fully}} comprehended from a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> before Mr. Rouse and Council, on the {{complaint}} of a Mr. Cree, an English free merchant at Dacca, who had been twice treated in the same injurious manner by the agents of Mr. Hurst, the Commercial Chief at that place. On his complaint {{to the board of}} the seizure of the goods, and imprisonment of his agents, Mr. Hurst was called upon for an explanation. In return he informed them that he had sent to one of the villages to inquire concerning the matter of fact alleged. The impartial person sent to make this inquiry was the very man accused of the oppressions into which he was sent to examine. The answer of Mr. Hurst is in an high and determined tone. He does not deny that there are some instances of abuse of power. [...] "But I ask," [...] says he, [...] "what authority can guard against the conduct of individuals? but that a single instance cannot be brought of a general depravity." [...] Your Committee have reason to believe these coercive measures to have been very general, though employed according to the degree of resistance opposed to the monopoly; for we find at one time the whole trade of the Dutch involved in the general servitude. But it appears very extraordinary that nothing but the actual proof of a general abuse could affect a practice the very principle of which tends to make the coercion as general as the trade. Mr. Hurst's reflection concerning the abuse of authority is just, but in this case it is altogether inapplicable; because the complaint was not of the abuse, but of the use of authority in matters of trade, which ought to have been free. He throws out a variety of invidious reflections against the Council, as if they wanted zeal for the Company's service; his justification of his practices, and his declaration of his resolution to persevere in them, are firm and determined,--asserting the right and policy of such restraints, and laying down a rule for his conduct at the factory, which, he says, will give no cause of just complaint to private traders. He adds, [...] "I have no doubt but that they have hitherto provided investments, and it cannot turn to my interest to preclude them now, though I must ever think it my duty to combat the private views of individuals who set themselves up as competitors under that very body under whose license and indulgence only they can derive their privilege of trade: all I contend for is the same influence my employers have ever had." [...] He ends by declining any reply to any of their future references of this nature.|$|E

40|$|Although {{as early}} as 1464 Matthias Corvinus had {{separated}} {{the part of the}} Hungarian Chancery that dealt with judicial affairs (cancellaria minor, tabula regia) from the rest, the Hungarian Court Chancery (cancellaria maior, Ungarische Hofkanzlei) in the Habsburg era still exercised some competences in this field.

40|$|The book {{focuses on}} the {{definition}} of lex concursus' scope of application {{as well as the}} co-ordination between this law and the different laws applicable in accordance with the conflict of laws system set forth by the EC Regulation No. 1346. 		The analysis encompasses the problem of the co-ordination between the national laws and the uniform rules laid down by the Regulation. 	The study has been carried out by having regard to the main theoretical opinions developed in the literature and in the case-law on the reasons for applying the lex fori concursus in matter of insolvency (the view according to which the lex concursus has to be applied because of procedural aspects of the insolvency proceedings, the view which emphasizes the link of instrumentality between proceedings/law of the State of the opening/purposes of the proceedings, and the view which justifies the lex concursus applicability {{in the context of the}} Regulation assuming that this latter would be inspired to the private international law method known as jurisdictional approach). 	On these basis, the book faces with the problem of the lex concursus applicability within the three main private international law fields relevant in the Regulation: jurisdiction (by solving the procedural aspects arising in the State of the opening), law applicable on the effects of the opening and the proceedings (both in the Member State of the opening and in the EU territory as a whole in compliance with the principle of mutual recognition) and enforcement of judgments. 	After having analysed the relevant international and domestic case-law, the book clarifies that the role of the lex concursus and its co-ordination with rules (uniform or foreign) aim to balance the several interests at stake in the proceedings and, accordingly, to achieve the main purposes of the Regulation. The balancing moment occurs before the court of the proceedings, while the mutual recognition of judgments and proceedings (as well as the mutual trust between the judicial bodies of the Member States) allows it to spread effects in the EU territory. 	The complex system of co-ordination between lex concursus, foreign laws and uniform rules allows achieving such outcome: although the court (<b>State)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> is the «unavoidable and mandatory place for the insolvency administration», it can't only rely on «its» lex concursus, but it has to consider the relevant different rules imposed directly or indirectly by the Regulation for protecting creditors and third parties...|$|E

6000|$|Last Monday, what {{is called}} a Press Act, was passed by <b>the</b> Government <b>of</b> India, in {{connection}} with, and simultaneously with, an Explosives Act which ought to have been passed, I should think, twenty years ago. What is <b>the</b> purport <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Press Act? I do not attempt to give it in technical language. Where the Local Government finds a newspaper article inciting to murder and violence, or resort to explosives for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> murder or violence, that Local Government may apply to a Magistrate of a certain status to issue an order for <b>the</b> seizure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Press by which that incitement has been printed; and if <b>the</b> owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Press feels himself aggrieved, he may within fifteen days ask the High Court to reverse the order, and direct <b>the</b> restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Press. That is a statement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law that has been passed in India, and to which I do not doubt we shall give our assent. There has been the usual outcry raised--usual in all these cases. Certain people say, [...] "Oh, you are too late." [...] Others say, [...] "You are too early." [...] I will say to you first of all, and to any other audience afterwards, that I have no apology to make for being a party to <b>the</b> passing <b>of</b> this law now; and I have no apology to make for not passing it before. I do not believe in short cuts, and I believe that the Government in these difficult circumstances is wise not to be in too great a hurry. I have no apology to make for introducing executive action into what would normally be a judicial process. Neither, on the other hand, have I any apology to make for tempering executive action with judicial elements; and I am very glad to say that an evening newspaper last night, which is not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> politics to which I belong, entirely approves of that. It says: [...] "You must show that you are not afraid of referring your semi-executive, semi-judicial action to the High Court." [...] This Act meddles with no criticism, however strong, of Government measures. It discourages <b>the</b> advocacy <b>of</b> no practical policy, social, political, or economic. Yet I see, to my great regret and astonishment, that this Act is described as an Act for judging cases of seditious libel without a Jury. It is contended by some--and I respect the contention--that the Imperial Parliament ought to have been consulted before this Act was passed, and ought to be consulted now. (Cries of [...] "No, no.") My veteran friends lived before <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> household suffrage. Well, it is said that <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Parliament ought to be heard in so grave a matter as this. But <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposals were fully considered, as was quite right, not only by <b>the</b> Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> in Council, but by the Cabinet. It was a matter of public urgency. I stand by it. But it is perfectly natural to ask: Should the Imperial Parliament have no voice? I have directed <b>the</b> Government <b>of</b> India to report to <b>the</b> Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> all <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> taken under this Act; and I undertake, as long as I hold <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> to present to Parliament from time to time <b>the</b> reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> taken under this somewhat drastic Act.|$|R
