25|$|A <b>suppression</b> <b>capacitor</b> is an {{effective}} interference reduction component because its electrical impedance decreases with increasing frequency, so that at higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground. They therefore prevent equipment and machinery (including motors, inverters, and electronic ballasts, as well as solid-state relay snubbers and spark quenchers) from sending and receiving electromagnetic and radio frequency interference as well as transients in across-the-line (X capacitors) and line-to-ground (Y capacitors) connections. X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential interference. On the other hand, Y capacitors are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or common-mode interference.|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} a new {{implementation}} of a compact smart resistive sensor based on a microcontroller with internal ADCs is proposed and analysed. The solution is based only on a (already existing in the system) microcontroller and a simple sensor interface circuit working as a voltage divider consisting of a reference resistor and a resistive sensor connected in parallel with an interference <b>suppression</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The measurement method is based on stimulation of the sensor interface circuit by a single square voltage pulse and on sampling the resulting voltage on the resistive sensor. The proposed solution is illustrated by a complete application of the compact smart resistive sensor used for temperature measurements, based on an 8 -bit ATxmega 32 A 4 microcontroller with a 12 -bit ADC and a Pt 100 resistive sensor. The results of experimental research confirm that the compact smart resistive sensor has 1 °C resolution of temperature measurement for {{the whole range of}} changes of measured temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Metallized {{polymer film}} {{capacitors}} are important passive electrical components nowadays, which are currently used in any electronic devices and circuits without hesitation. Amongst other components, {{they are used}} in EMC-filters as X- and Y-capacitors, so-called RFI/EMI <b>suppression</b> <b>capacitors.</b> The latest results of studies show that under critical operating conditions, the reliability of those components is called into question. In one case an Inverter supplier was forced to call back a number of inverters, {{because one of the}} capacitors used has degraded. "This process results in outgassing within the wiring component of the inverter itself, possibly causing the compartment's cover to pop off with enough force to cause injury or property damage". This circumstance suggests, that the requested quality tests, according to the standard IEC 60384 - 14 : 2005 "Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 14 : Sectional specification - Fixed capacitors for electromagnetic interference suppression and connection to the supply mains" are not sufficient. There are no sufficient tests, specific to capacitors exposed to the conditions corresponding, when they are used in solar inverters for the outdoor area. The norm only includes a general climate test for the RFI/EMI <b>suppression</b> <b>capacitors</b> in all range of applications. At Fraunhofer IWES an accelerated aging test has been conducted for 1, 000 hours, at a defined temperature and relative humidity with different voltage stress conditions (d. c., a. c. and without voltage), after a short time a degradation of some metallized polymer film capacitors was observed. The ageing of RFI/EMI <b>suppression</b> <b>capacitors</b> cause, not only the rise of the electrical disturbances above the permitted limits, but could also affect the leakage currents at the event of a fault in a negative way, so that the isolation ability of the capacitors in case of failure is severely limited and thereby a risk for humans could occur...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalized {{space vector modulation}} (SVM) method for any modular mul-tilevel converter (MMC). The proposed SVM method produces the maximum level number (i. e., 2 n+ 1, where n {{is the number of}} submodules in the upper or lower arm of each phase) of the out-put phase voltages and a higher equivalent switching frequency than other modulation methods, which consequently leads to reduced harmonics in the output voltages and currents. Compared with earlier modulation methods for MMCs, the proposed SVM method provides two more de-grees of freedom, i. e., the redundant switching sequences and the adjustable duty cycles, thus offering significant flexibility for optimizing the circulating current <b>suppression</b> and <b>capacitor</b> voltage balancing. This SVM method is a useful tool for further studies of MMCs, as it can be conveniently extended for any control objectives. The demonstrated results validate the analysis. IECON 201...|$|R
