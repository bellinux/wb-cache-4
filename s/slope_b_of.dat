40|$|Abstract—Significant {{discrepancies}} {{are often}} observed among {{the values of}} the mean magnetic field (MMF) of the Sun as a star observed by various instruments using various spectral lines. This is conventionally attributed to the measurement errors and “saturation ” of a solar magnetograph in fine-structure photospheric elements with a strong magnetic field. Measurements of the longitudinal MMF performed in 1968 – 2006 at six observatories are compared in this paper. It is shown that the degree <b>of</b> discrepancy (<b>slopes</b> <b>b</b> <b>of</b> linear regression lines) varies significantly over the phase of the 11 -year cycle. This gives rise to a paradox: the magnetograph calibration is affected by the state of the Sun itself. The proposed explanation is based on quantum properties of light, namely, nonlocality and “coupling ” of photons whose polarization at the telescope–spectrograph output is determined by spacious parts of the solar disk. In this case, the degree of coupling, or “identity, ” of photons depends on the field distribution in the photosphere and the instrument design (as Bohr said, “the instrument inevitably affects the result”). The “puzzling ” values <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> <b>b</b> are readily explained by the dependence of the coupling on the solar-cycle phase. The very statistical nature of light makes discrepancies unavoidable and requires the simple averaging of data to obtain the best approximation of the actual MMF. A 39 -year time series of the MMF absolute value is presented, which is indicative of significant variations in the magnitude of the solar magnetic field with a cycle period of 10. 5 (7) yr.

The typical value of B is close to 700 (cm*eV)− 0.5 for pure a-Si:H [18]. The higher the B factor, the higher is the structural order of the film [25].

The rapid increase of anodic current after E u {{may be due to the}} desorption of PEIMPA molecules adsorbed on the electrode. This means that the inhibition mode of PEIMPA depends on electrode potential. In this case, the observed inhibition phenomenon is generally described as corrosion inhibition of the interface associated with the formation of a bidimensional layer of adsorbed inhibitor species at the electrode surface [34]. Note that the potential E u is also denoted E 1 in Bartos and Hackerman’s paper [30]. Figure  1 shows also that, at potentials higher than E corr, PEIMPA affects the anodic reaction.

In this paper we used a denoising technique based on thresholded Zernike reconstructor to minimize the effects due to readout and background noise. At low signal to noise ratio, this denoising technique can be improved further by taking the advantage of the shape of the spot.

The relationships between shell size and total weight and between shell size and ¯esh weight were all highly signi®cant on logarithmic scales with the slopes having values of about three. The arcsine-transformed proportion of shell weight out of total weight varied among and within different morphological/taxonomic groups, ranging from 58. 6 % in Acanthochiton de®lippi to 76. 4 % in Nerita albicilla. The allometry of shell weight was analysed by regressing the arcsine transformed values of the proportion of shell weight against total weight in each species.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{interaction}} region of colliding protons looks com-pletely absorptive (black) at the impact parameters up to 0. 4 - 0. 5 fm at the LHC energy 7 TeV. It is governed by {{the ratio of the}} elastic diffraction peak slope to the total cross section. The corresponding parameter is approximately equal to 1 at the LHC. The behavior of this ratio at higher energies will show if this region will evolve to the black disk or to the black torus. Recent fits at 7 TeV can not distinguish between these possibilities within the limits of experimen-tal indefiniteness and of extrapolations in the regions of unmeasured transferred momenta. The shape of the interaction region of colliding protons changes with increase of their energies. There were arguments that it looks like the com-pletely black disk at asymptotically high energies. Recently it was shown that this conclusion could be misleading. The black region of the size about 0. 4 - 0. 5 fm is formed at the LHC energy 7 TeV. Its further evolution depends on the energy behavior of the ratio of the elastic diffraction peak slope to the total cross section.

Hypothesis (3) implies that events are small or intermediate and break on a square plane (i. e., M 0 L 3). Nevertheless, for large events, this hypothesis is not satisfied because the shape of large events is a rectangle and not a square (i. e., M 0 L 2). Therefore, for large events the formula D 3 b/c should not be used; the formula D 2 b/c should be used instead. In hypothesis (2), c depends upon event sizes: c 1, 1. 5, and 2 for small, inter-mediate, and large events, respectively, therefore resulting in D 3 b, D 2 b, and D b, respectively. As a consequence, small earthquakes (or small faults) are dis-tributed within volumes, whereas large earthquakes (or large faults) are distributed along lines...|$|E
40|$|Data on sex ratio, length-weight relationship, age, {{growth and}} {{survival}} rate were analysed for peacock wrasse, Symphodus (Crenilabrus) tinca L., (total = 1443; males = 848, females = 595) collected in the eastern middle Adriatic island area during the reproductive period (April and May) from 1995 to 1999. The total length of sampled specimens ranged from 8. 9 to 42. 5 cm and the weight from 7. 9 to 764. 2 g. The overall sex ratio was 1. 43 : 1 in favour of males. All individuals larger than 28. 9 cm were males as an effect of faster growth. The oldest females were 12 and the oldest males 13 years old. The von Bertalanffy growth formula was estimated for females (L∞ = 28. 14; k = 0. 294; t 0 = - 0. 775) and males (L∞ = 42. 24; k = 0. 214; t 0 = - 0. 628). The <b>slopes</b> (<b>b</b> values) <b>of</b> total length - weight regressions indicated allometric growth for males (b = 2. 7205) and both sexes (b = 2. 8147) and isometric growth for females (b = 2. 9901). Survival rate of males (S = 0. 80) was slightly greater than that for females (0. 756) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 240 three-component {{recordings}} from 80 rockbursts, which occurred in various coal mines in the Ostrava-Karviná Coal Basin (Czech Republic) between 1993 and 2005, {{was used to}} examine the decrease in maximum particle velocities ui (m/s) with a scaled distance of d = d/√E (m/√J) or d/ 3 √E (m/ 3 √J) and the rate of predominant frequencies of body waves. The energetic span of rockbursts was within the interval of E = 6. 2 × 103 − 5. 0 × 108 J, while calculated hypocentral distances d of four underground seismic stations varied from 0. 6 to 7 km. The <b>slopes</b> <b>b</b> <b>of</b> regression straight lines for the maximum particle velocities ui (m/s) of P- and S-waves in the bilogarithmic scale correspond to the values of − 1. 004, − 1. 297, − 1. 183 and − 1. 527. The results of the linear regression are as follows: Pmax-waves ui = 1. 184 × 10 − 4 × d− 1. 004 (m/s) (square root scaling) Pmax-waves ui = 3. 055 × 10 − 3 × d− 1. 297 (m/s) (cube root scaling) Smax-waves ui = 5. 280 × 10 − 4 × d− 1. 183 (m/s) (square root scaling) Smax-waves ui = 2. 397 × 10 − 2 × d− 1. 527 (m/s) (cube root scaling). The evaluation of the abovementioned dynamic parameters was based on seismic events data gathered in the database of the regional seismic array, and calculations were carried out either by using special programs applied as part of the automated data processing in the computation center, or by usual linear regression approaches. The aim of the detailed analysis of the maximum particle velocity and predominant frequencies was a) to set up input data from underground seismological observations for laboratory experiments dealing with the comparison of rock mass behaviour under modeled laboratory conditions simulating manifestation <b>of</b> rockbursts, and <b>b)</b> to incorporate particle velocity into the design of support in order to control damage and evident devastation of workings by rockbursts. The investigation of peak particle velocities was based on the recognition that they are the best criterion to assess vibration damage to surface structures and in mines...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} renewal in {{interest}} in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at transition metal oxide based electrodes in alkaline solution, {{the details of the}} mechanism remain controversial. While most studies focus on a particular oxide in isolation, a consistent experimental examination of the oxides of adjacent elements is likely to be fruitful with respect to mechanistic elucidation. In the present comprehensive work, the kinetics of the OER proceeding on the anodic passive oxides of iron, cobalt and nickel are probed using steady state polarisation to ascertain values <b>of</b> the Tafel <b>slope,</b> <b>b,</b> and the OH? ion reaction order, mOH-. The critically important matter of the interplay between the observed OER kinetic parameters and the electrochemistry and structure of the underlying oxide, is explored using cyclic voltammetry. Tafel <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>b</b> ? 46 mV dec? 1 observed for pre-reduced Fe and Co anodes, are rationalised {{on the basis of a}} ?barrier oxide? associated with the inner anhydrous region of the passive film. A reaction path involving the rate determining formation of a superoxy (OOH) intermediate is proposed. A meaningful comparison of the catalytic performances of the oxides is facilitated by the estimation of active surface areas, using a transient decay measurement technique...|$|R
