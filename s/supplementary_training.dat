40|$|UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVE (OF THE STUDY) : To provide data on {{the views}} of chief pharmacists (CPs) and primary care trust pharmacists (PCTPs) on the risks and {{concerns}} surrounding supplementary prescribing. SETTING: Secondary and primary care within England. METHOD: Postal questionnaire surveys of chief pharmacists and primary care trust pharmacists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Significance of the association between the extracted factors. RESULTS: The response rate was 68 % for both the primary care (183 / 271) and secondary care surveys (97 / 143). The survey tool was subjected to factor analysis and reliability testing. For both sectors, the three factors that were extracted described concerns over the <b>training</b> model for <b>supplementary</b> prescribing, concerns about the professional competency/responsibility of the <b>supplementary</b> prescribers once <b>trained,</b> and positivity about the implementation of supplementary prescribing. For both sectors, as trusts have more experience of supplementary prescribing by nurses, the respondents had less concerns about the <b>supplementary</b> prescribing <b>training</b> model. For secondary care, as {{the total number of}} pharmacists employed within the trust increases, the respondents had less concerns over the limitations of the <b>supplementary</b> prescribing <b>training</b> model. CONCLUSION: Although both sectors have concerns over the <b>training</b> model for <b>supplementary</b> prescribing and also professional competence and responsibility once trainees qualify, there is overall a positive attitude towards supplementary prescribing and there is a belief that pharmacists wish to take this role on...|$|R

40|$|In 2002 {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 1. 5 million people admitted into casualty emergency units within the Republic of South Africa. Many of these admissions dealt with events that were traumatic for both families and practitioners and these traumatic events have effects on the biological, psychological and social wellbeing of these individuals. Coupled with this is an ever increasing demand for mental health services and a worldwide shortage of qualified individuals to provide these services. Registered nurses in casualty units deal {{with the majority of}} these issues and the effect of these traumatic events. The crisis intervention model may provide these registered nurses with the necessary skills to deal with these problems not only for patients but possibly for themselves. Furthermore the biopsychosocial model of health allows these registered nurses {{to assess the impact of}} these events on the individuals. Yet, some registered nurses feel that they lack the necessary skills to deal with and assess these problems and intervene in these crisis situations. This study was exploratory descriptive in nature and aimed to examine whether there was a perceived need for registered casualty unit nurses to engage in <b>supplementary</b> counselling skills <b>training.</b> These perceptions were obtained through purposively sampled interviews and analysed qualitatively, using Tesch’s model of content analysis. Findings indicated that the registered nurses do perceive a need for <b>supplementary</b> counselling <b>training,</b> both for use with the patients and for themselves, and are willing to engage in this training although there are problems that inhibit this willingness. Recommendations regarding the implementation of a <b>supplementary</b> counselling skills <b>training</b> course as well as future research in the field were mad...|$|R
