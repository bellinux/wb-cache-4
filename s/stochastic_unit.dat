40|$|Unit {{commitment}} {{decisions made}} in the day-ahead market and during subsequent reliability assessments are critically based on forecasts of load. Tra- ditional, deterministic unit commitment is based on point or expectation-based load forecasts. In contrast, <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> commitment relies on multiple load sce- narios, with associated probabilities, that in aggregate capture the range of likely load time-series. The shift from point-based to scenario-based forecasting necessi- tates a shift in forecasting technologies, to provide accurate inputs to <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> commitment. In this paper, we discuss a novel scenario generation method- ology for load forecasting in <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> commitment, with application to real data associated with the Independent System Operator for New England (ISO- NE). The accuracy of the expected scenario generated using our methodology is consistent with that of point forecasting methods. The resulting sets of realistic scenarios serve as input to rigorously test the scalability of <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> com- mitment solvers, {{as described in the}} companion paper.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new class}} of <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> root (STUR) processes, where the randomness of the autorregresive unit root is driven by a threshold variable. These new models, the threshold autorregresive <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> root (TARSUR) models, are stationary in some regimes and mildly explosive in others. TARSUR models are not only an alternative to fixed unit root models but present interpretation, estimation and testing advantages with respect to the existent STUR models. The paper analyzes the stationarity properties of the TARSUR models and proposes a simple t -statistic for testing the null hypothesis of a fixed unit root versus a <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> root hypothesis. It is shown that its asymptotic distribution (AD) depends on the knowledge we have about the threshold values: known, unknown but identified, and unknown and unidentified. In the first two cases the AD is a standard Normal distribution, while in the last one the AD is a functional of Brownian Motions and Brownian Sheets. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed tests behave very well in finite samples and that the Dickey-Fuller test cannot easily distinguish between an exact unit root and a threshold <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> root.

We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process, which is "weakly-coupled" {{in the sense that}} if the demand constraint is relaxed, the problem decomposes into a separate, low-dimensional, Markov decision process for each generator. We demonstrate how the dual approximate dynamic programming method of Barty, Carpentier, and Girardeau (RAIRO Operations Research, 44 : 167 - 183, 2010) can be adapted to obtain bounds and a policy for this problem. Previous approaches have let the Lagrange multipliers depend only on time; this can result in weak lower bounds. Other approaches have let the multipliers depend both on time and the entire history of past random observations; though this provides a strong lower bound, its ability to handle a large number of sample paths or scenarios is very limited. We demonstrate how to bridge these approaches for the <b>stochastic</b> <b>unit</b> commitment problem by letting the multipliers depend on the current observed demand. This allows a good tradeoff between strong lower bounds and good scalability with the number of scenarios.

This inverted operation of Boolean gates is particularly striking: They provide inputs consistent to a given output along with unique outputs to a given set of inputs. The existing demonstrations of accurate invertible logic are intriguing, but will these striking properties observed in computer simulations carry over to hardware implementations?
