40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{the most}} common genetic respiratory disease in the west, which is due to a malfunction in protein of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). <b>Since</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> the effect of vitamin D supplementation and increment in 25 OHD serum level in these patients, this study aimed to conduct a review in this scope. For reaching the available studies, a search was conducted on the studies published between 2009 to 2014 in English language with the key words of vitamin D deficiency, 25 OHD serum level, vitamin D supplementation and relationship with cystic fibrosis in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. In Most studies conducted on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on 25 OHD serum level, an increment in 25 OHD serum level was observed, though it did not reach the therapeutic target level (> 75 nmol / l or> 30 ng / ml). As a matter of fact, few studies reached the therapeutic targets. Therefore, supplementation with vitamin D in patients with CF may assist to increase the level of serum 25 OHD, though achieving appropriate levels of serum 25 OHD depends on conducting more studies...|$|E

40|$|SummaryExposure to ototoxic {{chemical}} {{products in the}} presence or absence of noise can cause irreversible injury to the hearing of workers for a significantly short period of exposure period. Aim: to perform a comparative study, through audiometric tests, in workers exposed to noise only and noise associated with {{chemical products}}. Materials and Methods: 155 steel workers (18 - 50 years) exposed to noise (group I), and exposed to noise and chemical products (group II) for a period that varies from 3 to 20 years. Results: significant difference in the rate of occupational hearing loss in the right ear between groups I (3. 6 %) and II (15. 5 %). A significantly higher rate of occupational hearing loss in group II (18. 3 %) and I (6 %). With respect to the average time of exposure to aggressive agents, group I was exposed by a significantly higher time. Retrospective study. Discussion: The fact that the right ear was more affected in group II is controversial and should be better investigated in the future, <b>since</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> that the left ear would be more prone to noise-induced hearing loss. Conclusion: group II had proportionally a higher rate of hearing loss when compared with group I, even after having been exposed to aggressive agents for a lower average time...|$|R
50|$|In {{previous}} years, {{some have}} felt that the Special Olympics in itself are a form of segregation. This {{is because of the}} necessity to have a disability to participate. Storey argues that <b>since</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> have <b>shown</b> that Special Olympic events do not lead to the reduction of prejudice and also reinforces negative stereotypes of people with intellectual disabilities. One of the main arguments against the Special Olympics organization, according to Storey, {{is that there is a}} lack of normalization and promotion of negative images. The lack of normalization comes from the differences in reaction to events. For example, in previous years the Special Olympics would find people to stand at the finish line to hug the athletes once they've completed a race. Also, the Special Olympics do not announce anyone who's lost a race.|$|R

The test is designed primarily intended to serve as a pretext to collect data related to interaction design in this population, and developed from the disaggregated mental model of the interaction with a specific technological equipment, although uses conventions and implicit concepts in designing of various digital interfaces to enable intuitive navigation to other models.

This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of home bleaching agents on the surface hardness of two different commercially available GICs containing hydroxyapatite. 80 disk-shaped specimens were made from two different GICs, including resin modified glass-ionomer and Zirconomer. Each material was divided into four groups (n= 10) : 1. control, 2. 20 %wt. hydroxyapatite-containing, 3. bleached and 4. bleached 20 %wt. hydroxyapatite-containing. Group 1 and 2 specimens were stored in distilled water for 2 weeks while group 3 and 4 specimens were treated with 15 % carbamide peroxide in that period. Surface hardness was tested with Vickers surface hardness tester. Data were analyzed with 3 -way ANOVA and mean comparison done by post hoc Tukey tests (p< 0. 05). In general RMGI had a significantly highest Vickers surface hardness value among all groups. 15 % carbamide peroxide reduced surface hardness compared to control groups (RMGI and Zr) significantly. In the HA-containing GICs groups, bleaching agent did not significantly changed the surface hardness value. In this study we concluded that applied treatments (bleaching and adding HA) in implicit percentages reduced surface hardness of GICs. Also we suggest more studies in clinical conditions be done to verify these results...|$|R

Consequently, a questionnaire has been developed on internet, where people were asked to evaluate their agreement in regard to 47 statements on a Likert scale. From 200 participants, 5 groups have been revealed. For the greatest group of persons, the presence of typical sources, such as water or birds, is the most important characteristic of quiet areas. This profile brings together persons who mostly live in town. Another group gathers people who seek to escape from the daily life. Another group of persons focuses on their psychological rest.

40|$|Introduction. Only a small {{proportion}} of women with oncogenic HPV infections will eventually progress to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or invasive cervical cancer (ICC), although the reasons why are not well understood. Additional knowledge about viral transmission and persistence is still needed, <b>since</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> have <b>shown</b> that certain environmental co-factors, such as previous STDs or alcohol use may facilitate the sexual transmission of HPV or the persistence of an established HPV infection. The objectives of this study were to: 1) Describe the incidence and clearance rates of type-specific HPV infections; 2) Identify determinants of high- (HR) and lowrisk (LR) HPV acquisition and clearance, and; 3) Identify viral determinants of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). Methodology. In a prospective cohort of 621 Montreal university students, cervical specimens were collected for cytology and HPV DNA detection. Information on potential risk factors was obtained by interview at baseline, and at return visits. Follow-up visits were scheduled every 6 months over 2 years, for a total of 5 visits. Results. The two-year cumulative incidence of any HPV infection was 36 % and the mean duration of an episode with a type-specific HR- or LR-HPV infection was 16. 3 and 13. 4 months, respectively. After adjusting for age and sexual activity, co-factors for HPV acquisition included a recent Chlamydia infection, oral contraceptive use, alcohol use and washing after sex. Some determinants of HPV clearance included tobacco and alcohol use, in addition to use of tampons, daily vegetable consumption and condom use. Slightly different sets of the aforementioned co-factors or predictors were observed for HR- and LR-HPV infections. Non-European HPV 16 or - 18 variants appear to be strongly associated with incident low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). Conclusion. HPV infections occurred frequently in this cohort, and 24 % or 12 % of the women remained positive after 24 months with an incident type-specific HR- or LR-HPV infection. Some modifiable co-factors, independent of sexual activity, may facilitate transmission or persistence of certain HPV infections. These results may have implications for public health education and cervical cancer screening programmes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are closely {{associated}} with the production of the Aβ 1 – 42 peptide, loss of synapses and gradual cognitive decline. <b>Since</b> <b>some</b> epidemiological <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> that EGb 761, an extract from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, had a beneficial effect on mild forms of AD, the effects of some of the major components of the EGb 761 extract (ginkgolides A and B, myricetin and quercetin) on synapse damage in response to Aβ 1 – 42 were examined. Results The addition of Aβ 1 – 42 to cortical or hippocampal neurons reduced the amounts of cell associated synaptophysin, a pre-synaptic membrane protein that is essential for neurotransmission, indicating synapse damage. The effects of Aβ 1 – 42 on synapses were apparent at concentrations approximately 100 fold less than that required to kill neurons; the synaptophysin content of neuronal cultures was reduced by 50 % by 50 nM Aβ 1 – 42. Pre-treatment of cortical or hippocampal neuronal cultures with ginkgolides A or B, but not with myrecitin or quercetin, protected against Aβ 1 – 42 -induced loss of synaptophysin. This protective effect was achieved with nanomolar concentrations of ginkgolides. Previous studies indicated that the ginkgolides are platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonists and here we show that Aβ 1 – 42 -induced loss of synaptophysin from neuronal cultures was also reduced by pre-treatment with other PAF antagonists (Hexa-PAF and CV 6209). PAF, but not lyso-PAF, mimicked the effects Aβ 1 – 42 and caused a dose-dependent reduction in the synaptophysin content of neurons. This effect of PAF was greatly reduced by pre-treatment with ginkgolide B. In contrast, ginkgolide B did not affect the loss of synaptophysin in neurons incubated with prostaglandin E 2. Conclusion Pre-treatment with ginkgolides A or B protects neurons against Aβ 1 – 42 -induced synapse damage. These ginkgolides also reduced the effects of PAF, but not those of prostaglandin E 2, on the synaptophysin content of neuronal cultures, results consistent with prior reports that ginkgolides act as PAF receptor antagonists. Such observations suggest that the ginkgolides are active components of Ginkgo biloba preparations and may protect against the synapse damage and the cognitive loss seen during the {{early stages of}} AD. </p...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{alternative}} {{model for the}} holographic dark energy in a non-flat universe. This new model differs from the previous one in that the IR length cutoff L is taken to be exactly the event horizon size in a non-flat universe, which is more natural and theoretically/conceptually concordant with the model of holographic dark energy in a flat universe. We constrain the model using the recent observational data including the type Ia supernova data from SNLS 3, the baryon acoustic oscillation data from 6 dF, SDSS-DR 7, BOSS-DR 11, and WiggleZ, {{the cosmic microwave background}} data from Planck, and the Hubble constant measurement from HST. In particular, <b>since</b> <b>some</b> previous <b>studies</b> have <b>shown</b> that the color–luminosity parameter β of supernovae is likely to vary during the cosmic evolution, we also consider such a case that β in SNLS 3 is time-varying in our data fitting. Compared to the constant β case, the time-varying β case reduces the value of χ 2 by about 35 and results in that β deviates from a constant at about 5 σ level, well consistent with the previous studies. For the parameter c of the holographic dark energy, the constant β fit gives c= 0. 65 ± 0. 05 and the time-varying β fit yields c= 0. 72 ± 0. 06. In addition, an open universe is favored (at about 2 σ) for the model by the current data...|$|R

Na Mata Fresca, área situada na divisa dos Estados do Rio Grande do Norte e Ceará, pequenos agricultores têm como fonte de renda a obtida com a produção de raízes de mandioca, usando densidades de plantio em torno de 5. 000 plantas ha- 1. Esse procedimento pode estar limitando a obtenção de maiores rendimentos de raízes, pois alguns trabalhos demonstraram que é possível a obtenção de rendimentos maiores da mandioca, com maiores densidades.
