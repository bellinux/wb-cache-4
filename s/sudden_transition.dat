500|$|At {{the end of}} the tadpole stage, a frog {{undergoes}} metamorphosis {{in which}} its body makes a <b>sudden</b> <b>transition</b> into the adult form. This metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours, and is initiated by production of the hormone thyroxine. This causes different tissues to develop in different ways. The principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch, making the front legs visible. The lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult, and the long, spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator. The nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision, and for new methods of locomotion and feeding. The eyes are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelids and associated glands are formed. The eardrum, middle ear, and inner ear are developed. The skin becomes thicker and tougher, the lateral line system is lost, and skin glands are developed. [...] The final stage is the disappearance of the tail, but this takes place rather later, the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limbs. Frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis. At this time, the tail is being lost and locomotion by means of limbs is only just becoming established.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale <b>sudden</b> <b>transitions</b> in {{ecosystems}} are expected as result of changing global climate or land use. Current theory predicts such <b>sudden</b> <b>transitions</b> especially {{to occur in}} spatially homogeneous ecosystems, whereas transitions in spatially heterogeneous systems will be more gradual. The spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems is determined as result of opposing spatial processes that are either increasing or decreasing heterogeneity. Hence, the relative strength of these opposing processes is expected to determine how sensitive the system is to transitions, {{which has not been}} explored to date. In our study, fire, as a spatially heterogenising process, and plant dispersion, as a spatially homogenising process, in tropical savannas were modelled to analyse how these processes affect the occurrence of <b>sudden</b> <b>transitions</b> from grass dominance to tree dominance. Savannas are expected to change due to precipitation or land use changes towards either tree dominance or grass dominance. We found that high rates of grass dispersion can create homogeneous grass patches, but only when the spatial extent of fire is limited to small patches that are spread across the landscape. When fires occur in larger patches, a heterogeneous pattern is generated. In spatially heterogeneous savannas, we found a more gradual responses to increasing grazing pressure compared to the <b>sudden</b> <b>transitions</b> when savannas are spatially homogeneous. The most <b>sudden</b> <b>transitions</b> were found in near-homogeneous grass distributions where the interaction between grazing, grass dispersion and fire led to a few homogeneous patches. Within these homogeneous patches, transitions were complete and sudden. We conclude that when spatially heterogenising processes are stronger than spatially homogenising processes, heterogeneous systems are created. In these systems large-scale <b>sudden</b> <b>transitions</b> are less likely to occur, because transitions at smaller scales are averaged over space. We discuss how this has implications for responses of savannas to climatic and land use change...|$|R

The Stübenwasen would not be {{treeless}} just on account of its height; the treeline here, about 100 kilometres north of the nearest north Alpine peak could be expected to lie at about 1,650-.

This theoretical treatment is able to take the system-bath interaction into consideration carefully. It is shown that crosses and sudden changes of classical and quantum correlations can happen if we gradually reduce the strength of the interactions between qubits. For some special initial states, <b>sudden</b> <b>transitions</b> between classical and quantum correlations even occur. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the Universe {{reheating}} in bouncing cosmologies could be explained via gravitational particle production, as due to a <b>sudden</b> phase <b>transition</b> in the contracting regime. To this end, it is shown that gravitational production of massive particles conformally coupled with gravity in a matter-ekpyrotic bouncing Universe, where the <b>sudden</b> phase <b>transition</b> occurs in the contracting regime, yields a reheating temperature which is in good agreement with cosmological observations.

30|$|In limited {{training}} sets, HSMM produces <b>sudden</b> <b>transitions</b> between adjacent states. This {{drawback is}} the result of decision tree-clustered context-dependent modeling. More specifically, when few data are available for training, the number of leaves in the decision tree is reduced. As a result, the distance between the mean vectors of adjacent states can be large. Even the parameter generation algorithm proposed by [26 – 28] cannot compensate such jumps. In such cases, the quality of synthetic speech with HSMM is expected to deteriorate.|$|R

To illustrate these ideas, we use synchronized behavior from an Integral-and-Fire oscillators (IFO) system and SOC in the Bak-Sneppen model. Comment: paper accepted in CCAC 201...|$|R

40|$|Bred vectors {{characterize}} the nonlinear instability of dynamical systems {{and so far}} have been computed only for systems with known evolution equations. In this article, bred vectors are computed from a single time series data using time-delay embedding, with a new technique, nearest-neighbor breeding.
