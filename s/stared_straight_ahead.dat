60|$|Mary Louise {{pushed forward}} and {{sat beside her}} friend. Josie <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> stolidly.|$|E
60|$|I {{waited for}} him to unleash the topic of the day, but he didn't seem to want to get going. Conversation languished. He <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> of him in a glassy sort of manner.|$|E
60|$|This naive {{suggestion}} did {{not affect}} {{him as much as}} the fact that this fair young girl had confessed herself his friend. He did not look at Myrtle now; he <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> at the wall paper, and his brow was furrowed as if he was thinking deeply.|$|E
50|$|The {{terracotta}} group {{appears to}} be the earliest work of Greek art in which the eyes are depicted in an expressive way and the figures do not simply <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> as previously the norm.|$|R
5000|$|The General {{has come}} to ask Vorenus to stand for {{magistrate}} on his slate. Vorenus <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> in shock before boldly declining the offer. [...] "Sir, respectfully, your politics are not mine...I'll not speak against my belief." ...|$|R
50|$|A bronze bust of Edwin Barret Hay {{with close}} cut hair he <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> He wears a coat with wide lapels with an {{insignia}} {{on the proper}} left lapel and an ascot around his neck. The bust sits on a three-tiered granite base and the top tier is adorned with decorative scroll work.|$|R
60|$|Rose {{sank back}} into her seat, and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> She felt as if {{something}} hot and withering were blowing {{on that side of}} her face which was exposed to the audience. She wished she had not allowed the neck of her dress to be widened an inch. She vowed never again to get into such a trap.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Mr. Wrenn; he had {{not gone}} to enough parties in Parthenon, and he hadn't gone to any in New York. At nearly forty he was just {{learning}} the drab sulkiness and churlishness and black jealousy of the lover.... To her: [...] "Why didn't you go out with that guy with the black mustache?" [...] He still <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E
6000|$|As for responding, {{or taking}} the least account of it, Jacob <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> of him, fixed, monolithic--oh, very beautiful!--like a British Admiral, exclaimed Bonamy in a rage, rising {{from his seat}} and walking off; waiting for some sound; none came; too proud to look back; walking quicker and quicker until he found himself gazing into motor cars and cursing women. Where was the pretty woman's face? Clara's--Fanny's--Florinda's? Who was the pretty little creature? ...|$|E

Caption: "White Persian Simbelair Carla of Northbrook <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> while owner Peggy Blackburn of Winston-Salem, N. C. smiles and displays the ribbon her pet won at the 65 th Annual Championship cat Show that was held Sunday at Madison Square garden in new York. ...|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of songwriter Cary Jacobs Bond in Hollywood, California, [s. d. ]. Here, the composer of "A Perfect Day", "I Love You Truly" and "Just a Wearying for You" {{sits in a}} lavish gown made of {{what appears to be}} satin and lace, holding sheet music with her left hand and supporting herself to the side with her right. Her hair is up. She wears a bracelet on her left wrist, and <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> with her upturned features...|$|R
50|$|The statue is a {{full body}} {{portrait}} of the Saint standing at 6 feet tall. It is made of Indiana limestone and shows her wearing a traditional Catholic nun’s habit. A rosary hangs from her waist and she <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> Her proper left arm is pulled to her chest holding the cross that hangs from her neck. Her proper right arm is outstretched {{in front of her}} with her hand open as if reaching out to hold someone's hand. Her proper right foot steps out in front her. The statue stands on top of a limestone base which stands on a granite base and is surrounded by flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{sounded as}} if {{something}} dreadful might happen, so everybody sat perfectly still looking straight before them. Some of them {{felt as if they}} would die of curiosity to know what Old Mother Nature was doing, but for a while no one thought of disobeying. Old Mr. Rabbit just itched all over with curiosity. It seemed to him that he just must turn his head. But for once he managed to get the best of his curiosity and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Susanna was shaken. She {{looked hard}} at him, {{wondering}} {{whether he was}} deceiving her or not. [...] "Look me in the face, Bob," [...] she said. If he had complied, {{she would not have}} believed him. But he treated the challenge with supreme disdain and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> obeying his male instinct, which taught him that the woman, with all the advantages on her side, would nevertheless let him win if he held on. At last she came caressingly to his shoulder again, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were to have}} Ingua's dress fitted by Miss Huckins that morning, and as Josie {{was fast}} asleep Mary Louise went across to the cottage {{to go with the}} girl on her errand. To her {{surprise}} she found old Mr. Cragg sitting upon his little front porch, quite motionless and with his arms folded across his chest. He <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> and was evidently in deep thought. This was odd, because he was usually at his office an hour or more before this time.|$|E
5000|$|Munch's {{painting}} Puberty {{depicts a}} young naked girl {{sitting on the}} edge of a bed. Her legs are pressed together. She holds her hands in front of her body; one lies between her knees, while the other rests on her right thigh. She <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> with eyes wide open. Her mouth is closed and her long hair hangs down over the shoulders. The light enters from the left, and behind her a dark, ominous shadow is visible. The motif is often regarded as a symbol of anxiety and fear, a young girl's awakening sexuality and the changes a young person experiences physically and psychologically on the path towards adulthood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those, big ears," [...] {{continued}} Jumper, [...] "heard {{every little}} sound that Old Mother Nature made, and they sounded queer to Mr. Owl. 'If I roll back my eyes without turning my head, I believe I {{can see what}} she is doing, and she won't be any the wiser,' thought he. So {{he rolled his eyes}} back and then looked <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> again. What he had seen made him want to see more. He tried it again. Just imagine how he felt when he found that his eyes wouldn't roll. He couldn't move them a bit. All he could do was to <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> It frightened him dreadfully, and he kept trying and trying to roll his eyes, but they were fixed fast. He could see in only one direction, the way his head was turned.|$|R
6000|$|... (He {{goes to the}} scales. Eileen {{keeps her}} back turned. Her body [...] stiffens rigidly in the {{intensity}} of her conflicting emotions. [...] She <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> her eyes full of anguish. Murray [...] steps on the scales nervously. The balance rod hits the top [...] smartly. He has gained. His face lights up and he heaves a great [...] sigh of relief. Eileen seems to sense this outcome and her head [...] sinks, her body sags weakly and seems to shrink to a smaller [...] size. Murray gets off the scales, his face beaming with a [...] triumphant smile. Doctor Stanton smiles and murmurs something [...] {{to him in a}} low voice. Murray nods brightly; then turns back [...] to Eileen.) ...|$|R
60|$|It was all {{surrounded}} by a tall hedge and within the enclosure grew several enormous rosebushes having thick green leaves of the texture of velvet. Upon these bushes grew {{the members of the}} Royal Family of the Rose Kingdom--men, women and children in all stages of maturity. They all seemed to have a light green hue, as if unripe or not fully developed, their flesh and clothing being alike green. They stood perfectly lifeless upon their branches, which swayed softly in the breeze, and their wide open eyes <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> unseeing and unintelligent.|$|E
60|$|When {{the girl}} detective {{had been at}} Cragg's Crossing for a week she was a {{familiar}} figure to the villagers--every {{one of whom was}} an acquaintance--and had gleaned all the information it was possible to secure from them, which was small in amount and unsatisfactory in quality. Two or three times she had passed Old Swallowtail on the street, but he had not seemed to notice her. Always the old man <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> walking stiffly and with a certain repellent dignity that forbade his neighbors to address him. He seemed to see no one. He lived in a world known only to himself and neither demanded nor desired association with his fellows.|$|E
60|$|Miss Virginia Carvel {{came down}} the steps in her riding-habit. And Ned, who had been waiting in the street with the horses, obsequiously held his hand while his young {{mistress}} leaped into Vixen's saddle. Leaving the darkey to follow upon black Calhoun, she cantered off up the street, greatly to the admiration of the neighbor. They threw open their windows to wave at her, but Virginia pressed her lips and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> She was going out to see the Russell girls at their father's country place on Bellefontaine Road, especially to proclaim her detestation for a certain young Yankee upstart. She had unbosomed herself to Anne Brinsmade and timid Eugenie Renault the day before.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{opens with}} a title card reading [...] "Once upon a time". A middle-aged man (Luis Buñuel) sharpens his razor at his balcony door and tests the razor on his thumb. He then opens the door, and idly fingers the razor while gazing at the moon, about to be engulfed by a thin cloud, from his balcony. There is a cut to a {{close-up}} {{of a young woman}} (Simone Mareuil) being held by the man. She calmly <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> as he brings the razor near her eye. Another cut occurs to the moon being overcome by the cloud, then a cut to a close up of a hand slitting the eye of an animal with the razor (which happens so quickly the viewer may believe it was the woman's eye), and the vitreous humour spills out from it.|$|R
500|$|During {{one scene}} at the art show, a {{character}} named Orin {{stands in front of}} a blank canvas and <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> without moving. This style of art exhibition {{is similar to that of}} Marina Abramović, a Yugoslavian performance artist who sits or stands silently and immobile at some of her art exhibits. After seeing herself as a goddess in Jerry's painting, Leslie starts responding when people nickname her Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, beauty and sexuality. While speaking to Ben, Tom describes his seduction ritual with women as turning the lights off with the Clapper, a sound-activated electrical light switch, and then putting on music by Boyz II Men, an R vocal group. This was previously demonstrated in the second-season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", when the group's song [...] "On Bended Knee" [...] was playing while Tom has his girlfriend at his apartment.|$|R
50|$|To reenter the theater, Longworth and Rocheville {{walked around}} {{to the front of the}} cinema and found the front doors locked. They motioned to James Todd Greene, 24, a cinema {{employee}} to whom they had waved when they initially entered the theater, and Greene opened the door. At that point, Longworth drew his gun and demanded that Greene open the safe in the ticket booth. Longworth took several money bags from the safe and ascertained from Greene that there were more bags in Greene’s automobile, ready for deposit. After retrieving those bags, Longworth and Rocheville forced Greene into their minivan, which Longworth drove. Longworth again handed his gun to Rocheville and instructed him to shoot Greene if he moved. After driving away from the theater, Longworth stopped the vehicle and instructed Greene to get out, walk five paces, get on his knees, and <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> At that point, Rocheville shot Greene in the back of the head.|$|R

5000|$|Angela Burdett-Coutts - Flashman {{finds an}} image of her in Brooke's possession, and finds out that Brooke has a crush on her. Flashman remembers her not as fondly - [...] "I'd taken a loving fumble at her myself...but she'd simply <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> of her and dislocated my thumb. Wasteful little prude." ...|$|E
50|$|During a {{televised}} debate on March 5, 1998, MacLellan stumbled badly when Progressive Conservative Leader John Hamm {{asked if he}} would resign if he failed to bring in a balanced budget. Instead of responding, MacLellan <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> and did not speak for seven seconds. MacLellan blamed the pause on rigid debate rules. This moment marked a turning point in a race that saw the Liberals barely retain power.|$|E
50|$|They {{beat the}} bald man into submission. The police arrive but are quickly killed when the bald man reawakens, and Nikolai is {{rendered}} unconscious. Madison attempts {{to protect her}} children in the basement but is fatally wounded. Her son receives a cut above his lip that instantly appears on the bald man's face, and Madison realizes that the bald man is her son Jacob from the future. Nikolai regains consciousness and shoots the bald man {{in the back with}} one of the dead police officers' guns. Madison lies next to the bald man and is transported to the future. There it is explained that her son was captured trying to burn the lab down because of something CamSET did to his mother. He was subsequently lobotomized and used as a test subject in Project ECHO forty years in the future. Madison is healed and sent back to her own time, where she <b>stares</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> while her son embraces her.|$|R
6000|$|... "When at last Old Mother Nature {{told all}} the little people that they might look, Mr. Owl didn't want to look. He didn't want to face Old Mother Nature, for he knew {{perfectly}} well {{what had happened to}} his eyes. He knew that Old Mother Nature had seen him roll them back, and that as a punishment she had fixed them so that he would always <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> He didn't say anything. He was too ashamed to. He flew away home the very first chance he got. For a long time after that, Mr. Owl never could see behind him at all. He could only turn his head part way, the same as most folks, and he couldn't roll his eyes to see the rest of the way. It made him dreadfully nervous and unhappy. He felt all the time as if people were doing things behind his back. But he didn't complain. He was ashamed to do that.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of an Apache Indian scout, ca. 1880. From the chest up. He is wearing a turban-like headdress with a floppy white feather {{sticking out of the}} top. Tassles from the ends of the cloth headdress hang to his shoulders just behind his long dark hair. He wears a vest over a pin-striped shirt. A round button or pin on his left breast has two triangular cut outs in it. He <b>stares</b> placidly <b>straight</b> <b>ahead...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hunter {{was also}} found guilty of first-degree murder of all six victims, conspiring to commit aggravated battery, {{tampering}} with physical evidence, abuse of a dead human body, and armed burglary of a dwelling. [...] He closed his eyes as the first [...] "guilty" [...] verdict was read, and <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> as he was further condemned to death. Hunter was {{at one point the}} youngest inmate on death row in Florida, and is currently the second-youngest. A September 2008 appeal by Hunter was rejected ...|$|E
50|$|According to Wohlfart's {{account of}} one patient, onset is {{sometimes}} characterized by absentmindedness: the patient K.R. <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> and only responded in monosyllables in the minutes {{leading up to}} the incident. An oculogyric spasm then developed, during which he demonstrated echolalia. After 15 minutes, further motor symptoms arose, with the patient making small jerky motions with his arms that developed into larger, circular movements. At 20 minutes, the attack reached its peak, with the patient becoming bright red and making large compulsive movements with his arms and kicking his legs. He began swearing, shouting, screaming, grunting and barking loudly, with intermittent bouts of heavy panting. He remarked upon the people present, with his comments being related to the situation in question. He attempted at times to excuse his behavior. Afterwards the patient was able to provide an account of what had happened. Wohlfart et al. concluded that the patient was aware of his surroundings during the attack, with the patient even expressing concern over missing a scheduled appointment; the patient demonstrated some ability to control his behavior when spoken to in a sharp tone, but he would inevitably return to his shouting and movements after a few seconds of stillness. The episode lasted {{an hour and a half}} and was accompanied by salivation, sweating, and tachycardia. The peak of the attack lasted 30 minutes; the intensity then started to subside, though the patient still exhibited bouts of shouting and movement after several minutes of remission. The remission periods between the shouting episodes became longer, until the entire attack was over in about an hour and a half.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the role of neutral, happy, fearful, and angry facial expressions in enhancing orienting to the direction of eye gaze. Photographs of faces with either direct or averted gaze were presented. A target letter (T or L) appeared unpredictably {{to the left or}} the right of the face, either 300 ms or 700 ms after gaze direction changed. Response times were faster in congruent conditions (i. e., when the eyes gazed toward the target) relative to incongruent conditions (when the eyes gazed away from the target letter). Facial expression did influence reaction times, but these effects were qualified by individual differences in self-reported anxiety. High trait-anxious participants showed an enhanced orienting to the eye gaze of faces with fearful expressions relative to all other expressions. In contrast, when the eyes <b>stared</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> trait anxiety was associated with slower responding when the facial expressions depicted anger. Thus, in anxiety-prone people attention {{is more likely to be}} held by an expression of anger, whereas attention is guided more potently by fearful facial expressions...|$|E
5000|$|Denys was a {{successful}} portrait painter who served an elite clientele in his hometown and abroad. His clientele included mainly aristocrats and townsmen of the middle class. He also {{made a number of}} portraits of fellow artists including of Jan van Balen and Alexander Adriaenssen. In his time, he was regarded as being on a par with his contemporaries such as Justus Sustermans. He was seen as a follower Anthony van Dyck because he was a portrait painter of the elite. [...] His work was forgotten until he was rediscovered by the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Antwerp. [...] The more traditional and severe style of his work probably explains why his work fell into oblivion. He usually depicted his sitters in a sitting or standing position and turned three-quarter. The portraits represent the subjects invariably in static poses. Only in the hands did Denys introduce some variation by painting them in different twisted positions and spreading of the fingers, although these gestures do not appear to bear any specific meaning. The overall setting of the portrait paintings is sober and {{the focus is on the}} execution of the faces and representation of the clothing, which is sometimes quite sumptuous. The facial features are usually rather sharp. The portraits show little individual expression while the sitters appear impassive and serious and <b>stare</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|R
