25|$|Godwin {{augmented}} {{the influence}} of Political Justice {{with the publication of}} a novel that proved equally popular, Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams. This {{tells the story of a}} servant who finds out a dark <b>secret</b> <b>about</b> Falkland, his aristocratic master, and is forced to flee because of his knowledge. Caleb Williams is essentially the first thriller: Godwin wryly remarked that some readers were consuming in a night what took him over a year to write. Not the least of its merits is a portrait of the justice system of England and Wales at the time and a prescient picture of domestic espionage. His literary method, as he described it in the introduction to the novel, also proved influential: Godwin began with the conclusion of Caleb being chased through Britain, and developed the plot backwards. Dickens and Poe both commented on Godwin's ingenuity in doing this.|$|E
