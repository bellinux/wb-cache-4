5|$|<b>Shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film {{were drawn}} {{directly}} from panels in the graphic novel, illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner.

5|$|Although the Sabres {{held the}} Flyers to two <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first period of game one, {{eight in the}} second, and were the {{beneficiaries}} of a 1:04 two-man advantage at one point, the game remained scoreless until the third period when the Flyers connected four times in a 4–1 victory. In game two, the Sabres were held to 19 shots on goal with none coming after Bobby Clarke scored at the 6:43 mark of the third period.|$|E
5|$|British {{shooters}} won {{a single}} {{medal at the}} Games, a gold for Matt Skelhon in the mixed R3–10m air rifle prone SH1. With his first six <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> qualification round he equalled the world record with a perfect score of 600 out of 600. Of the other six events {{in which there was}} a British competitor only Nathan Milgate, in the men's R1-10m air rifle standing SH1, advanced to the final.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> climactic battle.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002 Olympics at Salt Lake City, Utah, Brodeur was {{initially}} named the backup behind Curtis Joseph. But following Joseph's losing the tournament opener against Sweden, Brodeur {{was named the}} starting goaltender {{the rest of the}} way, and won gold for Canada. He went undefeated in the tournament, stopping 31 of 33 <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gold-medal victory over Team USA.|$|E
5|$|The film saw {{breakthrough}} in computer generated effects. About 1,950 of the <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Phantom Menace have visual effects. The {{scene in which}} toxic gas is released on the Jedi is the only sequence with no digital alteration. The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselvesJohn Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, Dennis Muren supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and Scott Squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature effects and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.|$|E

50|$|Several {{films have}} been (partially) <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Hague, {{including}} Hum Tum (2004), Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Zwartboek (2006). An alternative music video of Coldplay's Viva la Vida was also <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Hague.|$|R
5|$|His {{first victory}} came on March 8, 1991, in a 5–3 {{performance}} over the Buffalo Sabres, and on January 9, 1992, he recorded his first shutout in a 2–0 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs. During {{this time with}} the Blackhawks, his goaltending coach was Vladislav Tretiak, who was selected in the 1983 draft but was barred from playing in the NHL by the Soviet government. Hašek appeared in game 4 of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins, after Belfour allowed two goals on four <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening 6:33, and had 21 saves. Although the Penguins won to clinch the Stanley Cup, Hašek's performance attracted the attention of the Sabres, who had considered trading for him earlier that season.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 and 1998, the Bulls met the Utah Jazz in the Finals twice. Led by Olympians John Stockton and Karl Malone, the Jazz were {{defeated}} in both Finals by the Bulls in six games. In both series, Chicago won by hitting winning <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixth and deciding game — the first by Steve Kerr in 1997 in Chicago, {{and the second}} by Jordan in Utah in 1998. This saw Chicago winning their sixth NBA championship, and managing their second three-peat. However, prior to the 1999 season, Jackson decided to retire, which set off a chain reaction that resulted {{in most of the}} team, including Jordan and Pippen, requesting to leave the Bulls. With no foundation of youth to build upon, the Bulls became a lottery-bound team for the next six seasons.|$|E
5|$|Jean, who had adapted and {{directed}} Hogfather in 2006, was keen {{to return to}} some of the locations used in that film to provide continuity. The scenes in the Great hall of the Unseen University were filmed in the crypt of the Guildhall in the City of London, and the same Victorian country home was used for Death's house as had been seen in Hogfather. This time around, Jean was able to film more extensive panoramic <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter location, thanks to The Colour of Magic's larger budget. Other filming locations included Anglesey and Snowdonia for exterior shots, Gloucester docks as the docks of Ankh-Morpork, and the Royal Courts of Justice as the Patrician's Palace.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{said the}} murders were a targeted, execution-style attack and not {{associated}} with a robbery; Clemmons did not aim at any other customers or the two baristas working at the time. The four slain officers were Mark Renninger, 39 (killed with a shot to the head); Ronald Owens, 37 (<b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck); Tina Griswold, 40 (<b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head); and Greg Richards, 42 (<b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head).|$|R

5|$|The {{first to}} arrive at the crime scene were the {{municipal}} authorities of Los Cabos, followed by the Mexican Armed Forces and the federal and state police forces. Upon the arrival of the authorities, Francisco Rafael's wife—in between tears—informed them of the former drug lord's identity. The autopsy revealed that Francisco Rafael died of severe traumatic brain injury from <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thorax and head with a FN Five-seven pistol. The murder of Francisco Rafael initially fell under state jurisdiction because he was not wanted by the federal government when he was killed. Therefore, the murder investigation was started by the Baja California Sur authorities and not by the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). However, the PGR joined the case after it was requested by the state authorities.|$|E
5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of}} the other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E
5|$|During this stage, Antoine Fauré lead {{close to}} his hometown, and 200 fans {{tried to stop the}} rest of the cyclists from {{following}} him. Garin hurt his hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi was knocked unconscious, and had to give up with broken fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials fired <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires. Because of this help, Fauré was the first on top of the Col de la République, but was taken over by the favourites later. Aucouturier won the sprint. When the riders reached Marseille, they complained that there had been too many incidents in this stage, and the stage results should be cancelled. In the last part, they had been stopped by a large group of cyclists. Maurice Garin had been attacked, and his arm had been injured: he finished the stage steering with only one hand. There was so much confusion at the last controle post, that the exact arrival times of the cyclists were not recorded.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{two other}} people were wounded. They were Sergeant DeMonte Cheeley, a Marine {{recruiter}} who was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leg, treated, and released; and Dennis Pedigo, Jr., a police sergeant who was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ankle.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{episodes of}} the hit TV show Ugly Betty were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school. One was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lunch room. The episode {{featured}} Lindsay Lohan who visited the school. The episode was called [...] "Granny Pants".|$|R
50|$|The living victims {{included}} a woman {{seven months pregnant}} who was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck, another who was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thigh, a third who was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand, and a fourth whose injuries were not further specified; all were expected to survive.

5|$|In early 1934, {{the ship}} and her crew were {{featured}} in a James Cagney film for Warner Brothers, Here Comes the Navy, which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on-board location <b>shots.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early morning of 26 July, Arizona collided with a fishing trawler, Umatilla, that was under tow by another trawler off Cape Flattery. Two men aboard the Umatilla {{were killed in the}} collision and the Navy convened a Court of Inquiry to investigate the incident. The court recommended that the ship's captain, Captain MacGillivray Milne, be court-martialed. This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, while the ship was participating in that year's Fleet Problem off the East Coast. Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel W. Bryant assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September, with Arizona as his flagship.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, {{he felt that the}} multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have the same problems with the controls. 1UP.com editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer editor Matthew Kato described the controls as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described the controls as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her <b>shots.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first four days of the Wii version's release in Japan, Mario Power Tennis sold 56,000 copies. By January 3, 2010, it had sold 205,070 copies in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 4 June 1979. The scenes featuring the film team were shot first with handheld 16mm cameras in a cinéma vérité style that mimicked an observational documentary. After shooting {{with the film}} team was completed, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest and then to New York to film exterior <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. The interior shots of New York were later filmed in a studio in Rome. Production on the film was delayed numerous times while filming in the Amazon. After the original actor to play Alan Yates dropped out, filming was halted for two weeks as new casting calls began, and the crew awaited the arrival of Yorke from New York City. During principal filming with Kerman, {{the father of the}} actor who played Miguel was murdered, and production was again halted as the actor flew back to Bogotá to attend his father's funeral.|$|E

5|$|The {{first signs}} of panic were seen {{when a group of}} {{passengers}} attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No.14 as it was being lowered with 40people aboard. Fifth Officer Lowe, {{who was in charge of}} the boat, fired three warning <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air to control the crowd without causing injuries. No.16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of Titanics sister ships, , in the First World War. Collapsible boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most of those on deck had moved to the stern of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director J. Bruce Ismay, Titanics most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} 2015–16 season, Durant and Russell Westbrook reached several {{historical}} milestones together, including {{becoming the first}} pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points in a single game since 1996, doing so in a win over the Orlando Magic on October 30. On April 11, Durant scored 34 points against the Lakers, setting an NBA record for consecutive games scoring 20 or more points with 64. For the year, Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game, leading the Thunder to 55 wins and the third seed in the West. In Game 2 {{of the first round}} of the playoffs against the Mavericks, he scored 21 points but made just 7-of-33 <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> worst postseason shooting performance, both by percentage and number of misses, of his career. After defeating Dallas, Oklahoma City moved on to face the Spurs in the second round, falling behind 2–1 to start the series. In Game 4, Durant tied his playoff career high with 41 points in a Thunder win. Oklahoma City eventually defeated the Spurs in six games, drawing a matchup with the record-setting 73-win Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals. Despite going up 3–1, the Thunder were ousted in seven games, with Durant providing 27 points in Game 7.|$|E
5|$|On December 2, Michigan {{defeated}} Syracuse in a ACC-Big Ten Challenge {{game that}} {{went down to the}} wire. After blowing a 10-point second half lead Michigan needed a three point shot from Albrecht with 31 seconds remaining for the victory. On December 6, Michigan suffered its first home loss of the season to the New Jersey Institute of Technology by a 72–70 margin, despite a career-high 32 points by Levert. With the loss, Michigan's 30-game home win streak versus unranked opponents was snapped. NJIT shot 11-for-17 on its three-point <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. The team lost its three subsequent games to Eastern Michigan, (#3) Arizona, and SMU. The loss to Eastern Michigan, which is separated from the University of Michigan by a 6-mile stretch of Washtenaw Avenue, ended a Big Ten-high 59-game streak without consecutive losses. Eastern Michigan was led in assists (6) by Michael Talley, son of Michigan Basketball point guard and alum Michael Talley, Jr. The December 9 80–53 loss to #3 ranked Arizona was one point shy of being the largest defeat of the Beilein era. The December 20 SMU game marked the first career start by Ricky Doyle. On December 22, the team snapped its 4-game losing streak with a victory over Coppin State who was coached by Michael Grant, the brother of former Wolverine and Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Gary Grant. One of the game's big storylines was the first regular season point by Austin Hatch. Doyle's game-high 16 points marked the first time he led the team in scoring. Michigan won its Big Ten Conference home opener against Illinois in overtime on December 30 on the day it announced Jim Harbaugh would become the new Michigan Wolverines football head coach. Aubrey Dawkins, who had a career total of 15 points entering the game, scored a game-high 20-points.|$|E
