He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure {{there was no}} poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pistol under his pillow. Even so, a maid tried to poison him {{with a piece of}} cake. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide; all shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed.|$|E
25|$|It is daytime {{again and}} Vladimir begins singing a {{recursive}} round {{about the death}} of a dog, but twice forgets the lyrics as he sings. Again, Estragon claims to have been beaten last night, despite no apparent injury. Vladimir comments that the formerly bare tree now has leaves and tries to confirm his recollections of yesterday against Estragon's extremely vague, unreliable memory. Vladimir then triumphantly produces evidence of the previous day's events by showing Estragon the wound from when Lucky kicked him. Noticing Estragon's barefootedness, they also discover his previously forsaken boots nearby, which Estragon insists are not his, although they fit him perfectly. With no carrots left, Vladimir is turned down in offering Estragon a turnip or a radish. He then sings Estragon to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lullaby before noticing further evidence to confirm his memory: Lucky's hat still lies on the ground. This leads to his waking Estragon and involving him in a frenetic hat-swapping scene. The two then wait again for Godot, while distracting themselves by playfully imitating Pozzo and Lucky, firing insults at each other and then making up, and attempting some fitness routinesall of which fail miserably and end quickly.|$|E
25|$|Joan Harris (n√©e Holloway) (Christina Hendricks): Office {{manager and}} head of the {{secretarial}} pool at Sterling Cooper. She had a long-term affair with Roger Sterling until his two heart attacks (Season 1) cause him to end the relationship. In Season 2, she becomes engaged to Dr. Greg Harris (Samuel Page). By Season 3, they are married and at Greg's request Joan quits her job at Sterling Cooper. Their marriage is tested when Greg's lack of skill as a surgeon and consequent difficulties securing work force Joan to return to work at a department store, prompting her to call Roger Sterling to ask for his help in finding an office job. Because of her invaluable organizational and managerial skills, she is later hired for the new agency formed by Don, Roger, Bert, and Lane. Meanwhile, Greg's desire to further his career as a surgeon leads him to obtain a commission in the Army, and early in Season 4 he is sent to basic training and then to Vietnam. While her husband is deployed, Joan and Roger have one sexual encounter, which results in her becoming pregnant. Joan initially decides to terminate the pregnancy, but changes her mind and gives birth shortly before the beginning of Season 5, with her husband unaware he is not the father. Greg returns from Vietnam during Season 5, but he and Joan separate, after he announces to Joan that he is returning to Vietnam for another tour of duty regardless of her feelings on the matter, and are divorced {{by the end of the}} season. By the close of Season 5, Joan has become a full partner at SCDP in exchange for agreeing to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Jaguar executive to help land the account. This leads to conflict with Don in the sixth season, during which Don ends the account with Jaguar just before SCDP makes a public offering. Joan is furious over the loss of potential earnings and the fact that her sacrifice has been for nothing. At the close of the series, she is subject to harassment by McCann executives and agrees to a buyout of her partnership stake. She starts a production company called Holloway Harris.|$|E

A later friend of Ulam's, Gian-Carlo Rota, wrote: [...] "They would spend hours on end gossiping and giggling, swapping Jewish jokes, and drifting {{in and out of}} mathematical talk." [...] When von Neumann was dying in hospital, every time Ulam would visit he would come prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer up his friend. He believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively, and he would often go to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> problem unsolved, and know the answer immediately upon waking up. Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more of an aural one.|$|E

500|$|Several {{television}} critics had a {{more negative}} response to Simone's storyline as a lesbian and to Doe's performance. Warn criticized Simone's relationship with Rae as poorly developed, believing her {{to be limited to}} [...] "a one-dimensional character who happened to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl", and argued that viewers never had the opportunity to [...] "see this woman through her eyes" [...] since the character's sexuality and past relationships with men, and her possible bisexuality, were never addressed on screen. Warn also derided the lack of chemistry between Doe and Jossara Jinaro, who plays Rae. Herndon L. Davis of Windy City Times felt the representation of Simone as daytime's first African-American lesbian was overshadowed by the show's poor portrayal of Vincent Clarkson. Davis discussed Simone's story arc in his wider criticism of race in daytime television. Rae's death following the reveal of Chad's affair with Vincent was heavily criticized by Mike Perigard of the Boston Herald, who believed that her removal was only written to maintain a low quota of gay characters on the show.|$|E

To find Lane, Walter uses this bond, putting Olivia under the effect of drugs so she experiences Lane's emotions. She sees Lane <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stripper, who then is influenced to kill herself in a mirror of Lane's depressed thoughts; afterwards, Olivia discovers where Lane lives. While they explore his apartment, a suicidal Lane walks down a sidewalk, influencing others to mirror his emotions, so that they follow him {{to the top of a}} building. Because of her past in the trials, Walter believes Olivia won't be influenced by these suicidal thoughts, and she goes to encounter Lane alone. While Olivia does not remember him, he remembers her and the nickname he gave her: [...] "Olive."

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show, Simone was played by three actresses: Lena Cardwell (July 5, 1999 to April 16, 2001), Chrystee Pharris (April 17, 2001 to April 2004), and Cathy Jen√©en Doe (July 23, 2004 to September 4, 2007). The program made history as the first daytime serial to show two women having sex in bed. She is also the first African-American lesbian {{character}} to appear in a daytime serial. When discussing the decision to portray Simone as a lesbian, Kalouria emphasized [...] "sexual identity isn't a passing fancy" [...] and [...] "this is where [...] is [...] I can assure you we're not going to make light of this particular topic." [...] The storyline about Simone's lesbianism, and the representation of her sexuality, received mixed feedback from critics and media outlets, as did Cathy Jen√©en Doe's performance. Passions won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality, and her relationship with Rae. Despite the award, Sarah Warn, former editor of entertainment website AfterEllen.com, criticized the lesbian reveal as having [...] "reduced Simone to a one-dimensional character who happened to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Davies {{sought to}} {{continue}} the Doctor's long association with music in this special after he realised the Tenth Doctor had yet to show [...] "any aptitude for music". In his introductory note, Davies cites as examples of the Doctor's previous associations with music: the First Doctor disguising himself as Ancient Rome's most famous lyre-player in Emperor Nero's court in The Romans; the Second Doctor playing his recorder; the Third Doctor singing Aggedor to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Venusian lullaby in The Curse of Peladon; the Fourth Doctor shattering glass by singing {{in the style of}} Dame Nellie Melba in The Power of Kroll; the Fifth Doctor playing a harp on Gallifrey in The Five Doctors; the Sixth Doctor singing opera; the Seventh Doctor playing the spoons; the Eighth Doctor admiring composer Giacomo Puccini; and the Ninth Doctor dancing with Rose Tyler to [...] "In The Mood" [...] by Glenn Miller in [...] "The Doctor Dances". In writing the episode, Davies expressed hope that [...] "this mini-adventure [...] that music can take any shape or form, whether it‚Äôs singing, or playing the recorder, or even the spoons." [...] He states that [...] "music can go anywhere, reach anyone, and make better people of us all. Just like the Doctor." ...|$|E
500|$|Steph {{then had}} a short lived {{relationship}} with Cameron Clark (Ben Gerrard) which was plagued by his OCD problems. She failed her exams in college and had to retake them, before appearing in a fictional television show, [...] "Bid Crazy TV", where she brawled with the presenter. Later with stepbrother, Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson), as her agent, she first auditioned for a girl band, (X-Pose) {{and it turned out}} to be a money scam. Steph's next escapade saw her doing a [...] "kiss and tell story" [...] on fictional celebrity Joe Jones, whom she met after an audition to become one of his backing singers. Steph failed the audition. Jealous of her sister's success in the West End, resolved to find fame by any means possible. She promptly slept with Joe, believing he would invite her on tour with him. Joe subsequently ignored and humiliated Steph. Outraged, Steph sold her story to a tabloid and a TV show, angering her family and causing Debbie to lose her job. By late 2006, Steph's fame had fizzled out. Darren then arranged for her to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> footballer, in the hopes of extending her celebrity status. Steph's brother Craig was furious, and tried to talk her out of prostituting herself. Steph went along with the plan. The next morning, Steph realised the man had lied to Darren and was actually just a mascot for a football team. A humiliated Steph quit.|$|E

500|$|At trial, {{it emerged}} that Capper had been kidnapped for [...] "insubstantial, even trivial" [...] reasons: Jean Powell claimed that Capper {{had tried to}} persuade her to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man for money; McNeilly and Dudson had {{contracted}} pubic lice which they believed were from a bed that Capper had also used; and McNeilly believed that she had taken a pink duffle coat that belonged to her. In November 1992, when Dudson had contracted pubic lice and had his pubic hair shaved, McNeilly told him she {{thought that he had}} caught them from Capper. Dudson believed otherwise, and said later: [...] "I told Jean [...] I thought I got them from Bernie [...]" [...] On 7 December 1992, Capper was lured to Jean Powell's home, where Glyn Powell and Dudson were already waiting. She was grabbed as soon as she arrived and held down while Glyn Powell shaved her head and her eyebrows and then made her clean up the hair and place it in a bin. Then he placed a plastic bag over her head and walked round her while hitting her on the head. She was then kicked by Jean Powell and McNeilly as she lay curled up on the floor and both women took turns beating her with a three-foot-long (1 m) wooden instrument and a belt. She was then taken to the bathroom and forced to shave off her own pubic hair as [...] "ritual humiliation in revenge for having caused, as they claimed, Dudson and McNeilly themselves to be shaved." [...] Afterwards Jean Powell locked her in a cupboard overnight. The following morning she was taken upstairs and locked in another cupboard. On 8 December she was transferred to McNeilly's house because of concern that Powell and McNeilly's six children were disturbed by Capper's crying. There she was tied spreadeagle to an upturned bed with electrical flex in a downstairs back room.|$|E
