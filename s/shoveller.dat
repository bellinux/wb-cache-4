5|$|The Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake Local Nature Reserve, {{southeast}} of the town centre {{and close to the}} Nailsea and Backwell railway station, was constructed as a balancing pond in the mid-1970s, and has since become home to various wildfowl and dragonflies and a foraging area for bats. Bird species seen on the reserve include gadwall, <b>shoveller,</b> pochard, tufted duck, grey heron and mute swans.|$|E
5|$|Wildlife abounds in the valley, {{particularly}} the water birds around {{the rivers and}} lakes, with Chew Valley Lake considered the third most important site in Britain for wintering wildfowl. In addition to the water birds including ducks, <b>shoveller</b> (Anas clypeata), gadwall (Anas strepera) and great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus), {{a wide variety of}} other bird species can be seen. These range from small birds such as tits (Paridae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) to mistle thrush (Turdidae). Larger birds include woodpeckers (Picidae) and common buzzard (Buteo buteo).|$|E

5000|$|The lake is an {{important}} site for Australasian <b>shovellers.</b> A 19 km2 area {{of the lake and}} its immediate surrounds has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it regularly supports significant numbers of near threatened blue-billed ducks and over 1% of the world population of Australasian <b>shovellers.</b> It is {{an important}} drought refuge, sometimes supporting over 1% of the world populations of freckled ducks, black swans, chestnut teals and sharp-tailed sandpipers.|$|R
25|$|Cranbury was {{originally}} an important hamlet of Hursley, with many distinct farms and cottages, {{but now the}} name belongs only to Cranbury House and Park.

25|$|The medieval Baldrick was {{probably}} the only Baldrick of the four who could really be described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung <b>shoveller</b> (a respected position, which he had {{worked very hard to}} get – earlier jobs include milking pigs and mucking out lepers) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met Prince Edmund at the feast before the Battle of Bosworth Field and using flattery became his Squire.

25|$|T. stagnalis is {{the only}} Anostracan species to occur in Ireland, and {{one of only two}} in the British Isles (the other being Chirocephalus diaphanus which occurs in a few sites in {{southern}} England). It was discovered in Rahasane turlough in 1974, and was soon discovered at six other sites, in temporary pools in fields, which {{may be more likely to}} represent the species' usual habitat. T. stagnalis is thought to have arrived in Ireland in mud on the legs of a migratory bird, or on the footwear of a wildfowler; various ducks such as mallard, teal and <b>shoveller,</b> and waders such as lapwing and curlew have been observed in Ireland after migrating from areas with T. stagnalis populations, such as Scandinavia and France.|$|E
25|$|The black-necked stork is a {{carnivore}} and its diet includes water-birds such as coots, little grebes, northern <b>shoveller,</b> pheasant-tailed jacana, and a {{range of}} aquatic vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates such as crabs and molluscs. They also prey on the eggs and hatchlings of turtles. In the Chambal River valley they have been observed to locate nests of Kachuga dhongoka buried under sand (presumably by moistness of the freshly covered nest) and prey on the eggs of the turtle. In Australia, they also forage at night feeding on emerging nestlings of marine turtles. Stomach content analyses of nine storks in Australia showed their diet to contain crabs, molluscs, insects (grasshoppers and beetles), amphibians, reptiles and birds. The storks had also consumed a small piece of plastic, pebbles, cattle dung, and plant material. In well-protected wetlands, both in Australia and India, black-necked storks feed almost exclusively on fish but in the agriculture-dominated landscape of Uttar Pradesh in India they feed on a wider range of prey that include frogs and molluscs; storks obtained fish in wetlands, frogs from roadside ditches and molluscs from irrigation canals.|$|E

60|$|Nones ended, Father <b>Shoveller,</b> {{with many}} a halt for {{greeting}} or for gossip, took the lads {{up the hill}} towards the wide fortified space where the old Castle and royal Hall of Henry of Winchester looked down on the city, and after some friendly passages with the warder at the gate, Father <b>Shoveller</b> {{explained that he was}} in quest of some one recently come from court, of whom the striplings in his company could make inquiry concerning a kinsman in the household of my Lord Archbishop of York. The warder scratched his head, and bethinking himself that Eastcheap Jockey was the reverend. Father's man, summoned a horse-boy to call that worthy.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they took}} their first night's rest away from home, in a small guest-chamber, with a good bed, though bare in all other respects.

50|$|The reserve {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of habitats which include grazed pasture with hedgerows, ditches, reens, reed beds and grasslands.
