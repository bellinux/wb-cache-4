25|$|The {{controversy}} raged {{within the}} navy and in public for about {{a decade after the}} war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and <b>so</b> <b>keep</b> out of range of the torpedoes. Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian Cyril Falls, pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when one already has command of the sea. Jellicoe himself, {{in a letter to the}} Admiralty seventeen months before the battle, said that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practised by all the major navies of the world). He said that, in the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away, he would assume they intended to draw him over mines or submarines, and he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (October 1914).|$|E
500|$|With {{the sound}} mix being {{completed}} in LA, Harrison {{spent most of}} September 1971 in New York working on the problematic film footage of the concert, before heading to London. There he attended the re-opening of Apple Studio on 30 September and produced new signing Lon & Derrek Van Eaton's debut single, as well as enduring a fruitless meeting with the British Treasury's financial secretary – the latter activity {{in an attempt to}} have the government waive its standard purchase tax, and <b>so</b> <b>keep</b> the album affordable to record-buyers. Harrison returned to New York on 5 October and announced that the Bangladesh live album would be issued during the following month. At this time, with concert bootlegs now on the market, posters were placed in record shops bearing the slogan: [...] "Save a starving child. Don't buy a bootleg!" ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Panic of 1837, Keep {{would buy}} {{purchased}} depreciated Watertown banknotes in Rochester, then travel to Watertown (where the notes were worth more) and cash {{them for a}} profit. He quickly quadrupled his net worth. [...] He then invested in notes issued by the state, which were trading at a discount due to the economic recession. He then began traveling around upstate New York, where he would approach people carrying Canadian banknotes. These were worthless in the United States, <b>so</b> <b>Keep</b> would exchange his state notes for the Canadian banknotes (at yet another heavy discount). [...] When he had enough Canadian banknotes in hand, Keep would travel to Canada and cash the banknotes at par. He made $500 to $1,000 a week ($ to $ in [...] dollars) a week in these exchanges.|$|E
2500|$|Ali {{typically}} portrayed {{himself as}} the [...] "people's champion" [...] and his opponent {{as a tool of}} the (white) establishment (despite the fact that his entourage often had more white faces than his opponents'). During the early part of his career, he built a reputation for predicting rounds in which he would finish opponents, often vowing to crawl across the ring or to leave the country if he lost the bout. Ali adopted the latter practice from [...] "Gorgeous" [...] George Wagner, a professional wrestling champion who drew thousands of fans to his matches as [...] "the man you love to hate". When Ali was 19, Wagner, who was in town to wrestle Freddie Blassie and had crossed paths with Clay, told the boxer before a bout with Duke Sabedong in Las Vegas, [...] "A lot of people will pay to see someone shut your mouth. <b>So</b> <b>keep</b> on bragging, keep on sassing and always be outrageous." ...|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "All-England" [...] {{took on a}} {{specific}} meaning in 1846 when William Clarke's All-England Eleven, {{commonly known as the}} AEE, was founded as a touring team of leading players, its purpose being {{to take advantage of the}} new railway network and play matches at city venues, mainly in the North of England. Clarke's team was indeed a top-class side worthy of its title as, in 1846, it consisted of himself, Joe Guy, George Parr (all of Nottinghamshire), William Lillywhite, Jemmy Dean (both Sussex), William Denison, Will Martingell (both Surrey), Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Nicholas Wanostrocht (aka [...] "Felix") and William Hillyer (all Kent). Their matches in Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds were a huge success and very profitable, especially for Clarke himself who was careful to pay his players more than Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) did (from £4 to £6 per week) and <b>so</b> <b>keep</b> them interested. He kept the surplus for himself.|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad Ali and James Brown {{acknowledged}} {{that their own}} approach to flamboyant self-promotion was influenced by George. A 19-year-old Ali met a 46-year-old George at a Las Vegas radio station. During George's radio interview, the wrestler's promo {{caught the attention of}} the future heavyweight champion. If George lost to Classy Freddie Blassie, George exclaimed, [...] "I'll crawl across the ring and cut my hair off! But that's not gonna happen because I'm the greatest wrestler in the world!" [...] Ali, who later echoed that very promo when taunting opponent Sonny Liston, recalled, [...] "I saw 15,000 people comin' to see this man get beat. And his talking did it. I said, 'This is a gooood idea!'"
