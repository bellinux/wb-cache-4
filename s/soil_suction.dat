First, the residual conditions were used for the calculation of the minimum value of kw. The values of kw at the residual conditions were found to provide an inappropriate lower limit for kw. The second approach was based on the water vapour flow theory. A vapour permeability function was developed and used to determine the change in water vapour permeability with suction.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{effect of}} <b>soil</b> water <b>suction</b> and <b>soil</b> {{temperature}} on rates of transpiration, photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen fixation of soybean (Glycine max. Merrill, var. Chippewa 64) seedlings was studied. A special apparatus {{was developed in}} which the <b>soil</b> water <b>suction</b> of several cells with soybeans growing in them could be maintained independently at a selected temperature. Transpiration was determined by a constant-water level device which recorded {{the amount of water}} used over a period of time. Photosynthesis and respiration were measured using an infra-red gas analyzer. The total nitrogen content of plants was measured by the micro-Kjeldahl method {{at the beginning and end}} of a ten-day experimental period. Leaf surface areas were determined with an air flow planimeter. In general with increasing soil temperature rates of transpiration, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation increased slowly at first and then rapidly until a certain optimum range was reached and decreased at higher temperatures. Maximum rates occurred around soil temperatures, of 30, 27 and 27 °C, respectively. The rate of respiration also increased with increasing soil temperature until an optimum range around 27 °C was reached and then dropped rapidly as the soil temperature further increased. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and N-fixation decreased steadily with increasing <b>soil</b> water <b>suction.</b> The decrease in the rate of these metabolic processes with increased <b>soil</b> water <b>suction</b> was attributed to effects of changes in viscosity and root cell permeability, stomatal movement and translocation of metabolic substrates. At low soil temperatures the dry matter accumulation seemed to be controlled by the water supply. At higher than optimum soil temperatures the dry dry matter accumulation was very sensitive-to temperature changes and less soil water dependent.

The {{shear strength}} prole of unsaturated soil is dictated by the suction prole. This prole depends on the evaporation rate, depth of the water table and the soil water retention curve.
