GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|E
40|$|Framed in {{the context}} of the ongoing {{revision}} of the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA), this note proposes a new presentation of the National Accounts. While it does not require new information, nor difficult calculations, it is suggested to be conceptually clearer and practically simpler. The changes concern the treatment of taxes and government in the national accounts which imply that: (i) GDP, measured at basic price, is now exactly the sum of all value added, which is split in the compensation of employees and an enlarged operating surplus; (ii) the two functions of government are clearly distinguished in a modified <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts,</b> that is, as producing non-market services up to the allocation of primary income account, and then as redistributing the national income; and (iii) with a conventional allocation of government services and GDP broken down between market GDP and non-market GDP, households remain the only final consumer and the so called question of consumption subsidies is resolved.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} integrated macroeconomic {{accounts for}} the United States for the period 1985 to 2002 and discusses issues related to their construction and use. Specifically, it focuses on tying together the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) and international transaction accounts (ITA) published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the flow of funds accounts (FFA) published by the Federal Reserve Board. The paper provides integrated accounts for seven sectors: households and nonprofit organizations serving households, nonfinancial non-corporate businesses, nonfinancial corporate businesses, financial businesses, federal government, state and local governments, {{and the rest of}} the world. Each sector table has a full complement of accounts: current accounts (production and income accounts), accumulation accounts (capital account, financial account, and other changes in volume account), revaluation account, and balance sheet account. As a result, the sector statements trace the factors leading to changes in sector net worth. Relative to current publications of the two agencies, the tables go quite a bit further toward providing for the United States the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> suggested in the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93), the recognized international standard. The tables use official data as of June 10, 2004; however, a few series have been created by the authors, and they are unofficial preliminary estimates at this time. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the processes of representation and translation involved in the practice of the Validation des Acquis de l’Expérience (VAE), or Recognition of Prior Experiential Learning, in a French University. This analysis is based on a qualitative research using semi-structured interviews with VAE candidates, advisers and academic staff, and recorded interactions between candidates and their advisers, and the validation juries. The research was at first influenced by the life history and educational biographies perspective (Josso 2001; Dominicé 2002; Pineau 2002), which privileged a dialogic approach. This has led to the decision to let the candidates tell their story of ordering struggle, where the resistance, dissidence and controversies circulate within and around the VAE ‘object’. This study is interested in the ordering modes enacted through the VAE and their relational effects with subjectivities. The analysis draws on Callon’s (1986) four moments of translation, as a way to give an initial frame of reference for the research. It presents the actors’ voices in a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts,</b> disrupted by the researcher’s running commentaries. It also focusses on the role the portfolio plays in ‘ordering’ the heterogeneous elements of the candidates’ lives, subjecting them to a form of ‘disciplinary writing’ through ‘technologies of the self’, whereby subjectivities are mobilised into specific modes of ordering. It analyses how the VAE becomes a stabilized network (Star 1991), insisting on speaking with a unitary voice, erasing the multiplicity of selves and the messy realities of the candidates’ lives, until the heterogeneous elements of the network escape again. Finally the study seeks to investigate further the recognition of heterogeneity, the possibility of multiplicity of cultures and agencies, multiple identities...|$|E

In the case of China, the liberalization <b>of</b> the capital <b>account</b> should be conditioned on domestic financial sector reform and market-determined interest rate mechanism and exchange rate regime.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to launch a {{discussion}} on the general treatment of provisions and impairment of assets in the National Accounts, in the context of the review of the SNA. The paper argues that the SNA should recognize the provisions and impairment of assets that are recognised by business <b>accounting</b> standards, instead <b>of,</b> as currently, rejecting these items outside the scope <b>of</b> the <b>accounts.</b> The paper proposes the creation of new lines in the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>account,</b> located just before the balance sheet accounts, where the SNA would record changes in provisions and impairment of assets. Also, the stock of provisions and impairment of assets would be available in the annual balance sheet accounts. Both these pieces of information would come as an additional information to the existing tables. Far from being a revolution, this proposal would simply allow users to compile alternative values for the net worth of institutional sectors, including or excluding these items. One specific property of this additional information is that the tables would not be fully symmetrical. It is a small price to pay compared to the advantage of extending the scope of the SNA to these important accounting entries. By including these categories into the framework of the SNA, a new flexibility is introduced which will, first, help to clarify the treatment of some transactions and, more important, allow producers <b>of</b> national <b>accounts</b> to elaborate macro-economic information on “quasi-liabilities ” and “quasi-assets”, in particula...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a financial sector necessarily involves {{a wide range of}} policy actions, and structural and institutional reforms. Those actions and reforms cover the design of instruments and operational arrangements for markets; the licensing and restructuring of institutions; and the {{development of}} the associated legal, information, and liquidity infrastructure. Given the multitude of policy actions and operational reforms to be implemented, the following question naturally arises: What principles and criteria should be considered in setting policy priorities among various policy and institutional reforms? All financial sector assessments present the findings in priority, showing high-priority actions of some urgency for the short term and then listing medium- and long-term structural measures. How should such priorities be set? Sequencing is the setting of priorities among financial sector measures, and the appropriate <b>sequencing</b> and coordination <b>of</b> reforms is important for the following reasons: Inappropriate <b>sequencing</b> <b>of</b> reforms could cause excessive risk taking and financial instability. 1 • Limited institutional capacity necessarily requires some prioritization of reform elements. • Given the numerous policy and operational reforms in each area of financial policy, setting priorities could facilitate and encourage the adoption of reforms; hence, this aspect of financial sector assessments is important. The <b>sequencing</b> <b>of</b> financial sector policies assumes great importance when issues <b>of</b> capital <b>account</b> liberalization (capital account opening) are under consideration.

First, our model shows the two-way capital flows between developing and de-veloped countries, i. e., financial capital flows from the country with less developed financial sector to the country with more developed financial sector, while foreign direct investment flows in the opposite direction. Second, our model shows that capital flows “uphill ” from the poor country with less developed financial sector to the rich country with more developed financial sector in the net term. Financial capital and FDI flows affect aggregate investment and output in the different way. The unequal or even opposite welfare effects exist within as well as across generations in the same country.

40|$|We {{survey the}} ongoing debate on {{pros and cons}} for an early and {{comprehensive}} liberalization of capital flows by emerging economies. We examine the main theoretical assumptions {{that would lead to}} positive effects on output growth and consumption volatility and reflect them with recent literature on market imperfections and information deficiencies. We find little evidence for a positive effect of free capital flows on economic growth and stability for emerging economies. We apply these main results to Vietnam as an example for an open emerging economy and discuss the main explanatory factors that may lead to negative impacts of an early and premature liberalization of capital flows. For small, open economies, absorption capacity for capital is limited. Excessive capital inflows might cause Dutch disease phenomena and asymmetric information might trigger an inefficient use of capital. In particular, we stress potential negative impacts of capital flows on the currency risk premium. Finally, we argue that for a partly dollarized economy as Vietnam a premature liberalization of capital flows might significantly increase financial sector instability. In conclusion, we emphasize the importance <b>of</b> a prudential <b>sequencing</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>account</b> liberalization and strong domestic institutions such as an independent central bank, proper financial regulation and supervision and macroeconomic stability as necessary pre-conditions. ...|$|R

Currently, almost all human genome has been sequenced {{and now it}} is time to identify the functionality of each gene. The <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> base pairs <b>accounts</b> for approximately 3 billion elements. While there are many efficient algorithms and implementations to mine this information, doing it privately is a great challenge. Current state-of-the-art methods have improved their efficiency, but they are not practical yet. In this article, we introduce several protocols to drastically boost the performance of genome mining processes while guaranteeing privacy, thus, enabling practical implementations. We describe how to solve the private set intersection problem and a set of pattern matching queries with privacy. The proposed protocols are server-assisted and we prove that they are secure under the semi-honest model. We report the assessment of our solution using synthetic datasets and prove their efficiency.
