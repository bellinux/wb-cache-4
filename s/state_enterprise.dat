5|$|Norsk Spisevognselskap A/S, often {{abbreviated}} NSS or shortened to Spisevognselskapet, was a Norwegian <b>state</b> <b>enterprise</b> which operated restaurant carriages on Norwegian {{trains and}} restaurants at railway stations and railway hotels. The company {{was established in}} December 1918, and started a catering service in 1919. Originally owned by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, it was acquired by the state in 1926. Meals served in the restaurant carriages were relatively expensive, although they were available to all passengers. In the 1950s, the company began using serving trolleys on trains.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 1926, Parliament {{voted to}} nationalise the Trunk Railway. During the debate, the {{organisation}} of Spisevognselskapet was criticised; with the nationalisation, the state became the sole owner of Spisevognselskapet. On 31 March 1927, the Ministry of Labour {{recommended that the}} company remain a state-owned limited company; the minority in parliament wanted a <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> During the 1930s, Sigurd Astrup was managing director of Norsk Spisevognselskap. In 1948, Erling Mossige was appointed {{managing director of the}} company. He was succeeded by Knut Tvedt in 1960. The company had 75 employees in 1919, and 591 in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov and Gorbachev {{continued}} {{their work on}} economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the Law on the <b>State</b> <b>Enterprise,</b> which restricted the authority of central planners.

Current reform consists of making state-owned enterprises and banks more efficient and functioning like private enterprises, and gradual privatization of some large <b>state</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Bureaucrats managing <b>state</b> assets and the selling of assets take advantage of such power to benefit themselves, including embezzlement of public funds and taking bribes from citizens needing their help, as can be found in <b>state</b> <b>enterprises,</b> state-owned commercial banks and in government projects.

25|$|Steel {{production}} was prioritized. A <b>State</b> <b>enterprise,</b> SOMISA, {{was established in}} July 1960, completing a steel mill in San Nicolás de los Arroyos. Steel production tripled to 700,000 tons (40% of the local market), {{and the production of}} pig iron, from 30,000 to 400,000 tons. The segment of GDP most tied to industrial growth, capital goods investment (CGI), grew substantially during Frondizi's tenure. While the overall economy grew by 8% from 1958 to 1961 (Frondizi's last full year in office), CGI nearly doubled in real value.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{to devolve}} {{economic}} decision making to the enterprise level began in 1986, {{when more than}} 100 enterprises began experimenting with financial autonomy (before then, enterprises operating with a deficit had been subsidized by the <b>state).</b> <b>Enterprises</b> were accountable for their own losses, and they were responsible for fulfilling sales contracts and export orders. The draft law on <b>state</b> <b>enterprises,</b> presented to the People's Great Hural in December 1988, was to extend greater independence in economic matters to all <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> and to lead to an economy that combined planning and market mechanisms.|$|R

During a raid on the Byzantine Empire, Roger II's admiral George of Antioch had transported the silk weavers from Thebes, Greece, where they had formed a part of the, until then, closely guarded monopoly that was the Byzantine silk industry.|$|E

25|$|France has a {{mixed economy}} that {{combines}} extensive private enterprise with substantial <b>state</b> <b>enterprise</b> and government intervention. The government retains considerable influence over key segments of infrastructure sectors, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, nuclear power and telecommunications. It has been relaxing its control over these sectors {{since the early}} 1990s. The government is slowly corporatising the state sector and selling off holdings in France Télécom, Air France, {{as well as in}} the insurance, banking, and defence industries. France has an important aerospace industry led by the European consortium Airbus, and has its own national spaceport, the Centre Spatial Guyanais.|$|E

His mother, Jutta Fuhrken, was born in Germany and, from her, Batista says he learned self-esteem and discipline, attributes he considers crucial to his formation as an entrepreneur. After spending his childhood in Brazil, Batista and his family moved to Europe when he was a teenager, due to his father's occupation. They lived in Geneva, Düsseldorf and Brussels.|$|E

Catalinas Norte was later chosen as the site for the Hotel de Inmigrantes, a facility built to temporarily house the over 100,000 annual immigrant arrivals, and completed in 1911. Following the construction of the modern Port of Buenos Aires from 1911 to 1925, both Catalinas docks fell into disuse, and October 31, 1945, the Catalinas Warehouses properties were sold to Yatahí, S.A. A lot facing Córdoba Avenue was, in turn, resold in 1949 to a <b>State</b> <b>enterprise</b> created during the administration of Juan Perón: Atlas, S.A.

25|$|Helpful here is J. K. Gibson-Graham's complex {{topology}} of {{the diversity}} of contemporary market economies describing different types of transactions, labour, and economic agents. Transactions can occur in black markets (such as for marijuana) or be artificially protected (such as for patents). They can cover the sale of public goods under privatization schemes to co-operative exchanges and occur under varying degrees of monopoly power and state regulation. Likewise, there are a wide variety of economic agents, which engage in different types of transactions on different terms: one cannot assume the practices of a religious kindergarten, multinational corporation, <b>state</b> <b>enterprise,</b> or community-based cooperative can be subsumed under the same logic of calculability. This emphasis on proliferation can also be contrasted with continuing scholarly attempts to show underlying cohesive and structural similarities to different markets.|$|E

500|$|Until around 1990, the North Korean state {{required}} every able-bodied male to {{be employed}} by some <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> However, some 30% of married women of working age were allowed {{to stay at home}} as full-time housewives (less than some countries in the same region like South Korean \Japan and Taiwan, more than Soviet Union\Mainland China or Nordic countries like Sweden, about the same as Today's United States).) In the early 1990s, an estimated 600,000-900,000 people perished in the famine, which was largely a product of the North Korean government's unwillingness to reform the economy, and the old system began to fall apart. In some cases women began by selling household items they could do without or homemade food. Today at least three-quarters of North Korean market vendors are women.

50|$|Growth {{and changes}} in the {{structure}} and ownership pattern of the economy also have changed the labor force. By 1958 individual private farmers, who once constituted more than 70% of the labor force, had been transformed into or replaced by state or collective farmers. Private artisans, merchants, and entrepreneurs had joined <b>state</b> or cooperative <b>enterprises.</b> In the industrial sector in 1963, {{the last year for which}} such data are available, there were 2,295 <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> and 642 cooperative enterprises. The size and importance of the <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> can be surmised by the fact that <b>state</b> <b>enterprises,</b> which constituted 78% of the total number of industrial enterprises, contributed 91% of total industrial output.|$|R
50|$|One measure {{regarding}} <b>state</b> owned <b>enterprises</b> was Decree 217-HDBT in November 1987. This was {{a crucial}} part of Doi Moi as they enjoyed more independence and autonomy with full rights over capital. The Decree would change operations of <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> in a number of ways; to introduce an accounting system based on profits, to replace output targets with profit targets for most enterprises, to provide more autonomy to managers in <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> in relation to production, human resources and financial decision making, to eliminate allocation of budgets and inputs to <b>state</b> <b>enterprises,</b> as well as restrictions on selling on the free market, to provide subsidies only in the form of loans by state-owned commercial banks, and to allow for retaining depreciation charges other than large public projects.|$|R
50|$|With {{regard to}} the impact on <b>state</b> <b>enterprises,</b> initial {{measures}} such as a pilot equitisation program did result in little progress {{in terms of the}} number of <b>state</b> owned <b>enterprises</b> equitised; they were only 15 <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> equitized by 1997. In order to speed up the process, the state established a Central Steering Committee on Equitisation chaired by the Ministry of Finance. Moreover, the state transferred to relevant ministries or provincial leaders decisions on the equitisation of SOEs with a total of VND 10 billion. As a result, <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> were constantly equitized between 1998 and 2000; over 100 in 1998, 250 in 1999, and 210 in 2000.
