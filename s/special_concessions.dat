25|$|Bismarck acted {{immediately}} {{to secure the}} unification of Germany. He negotiated {{with representatives of the}} southern German states, offering <b>special</b> <b>concessions</b> if they agreed to unification. The negotiations succeeded; patriotic sentiment overwhelmed what opposition remained. While the war was in its final phase, Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors in the Château de Versailles. The new German Empire was a federation: each of its 25 constituent states (kingdoms, grand duchies, duchies, principalities, and free cities) retained some autonomy. The King of Prussia, as German Emperor, was not sovereign over the entirety of Germany; he was only primus inter pares, or first among equals. However, he held the presidency of the Bundesrat, which met to discuss policy presented by the Chancellor, whom the emperor appointed.|$|E

50|$|Due {{in large}} part to the prosperous silver mines, the viceroyalty of New Spain {{generated}} the most income for the Spanish crown of all the colonial holdings. Mines in Mexico were the most profitable {{in large part}} because government expenditures were less compared to that of the mines in Peru and other colonies. This was for two reasons: one, that higher-grade mercury was accessible and therefore implemented in Mexican mines and not Peruvian ones, and two, the Spanish Crown granted Mexican mines a <b>special</b> <b>concession</b> in 1548, lowering the royalty percentage they were required to pay (Richard Garner, 906). Because of this, mine owners and overseers in Mexico, such as the Count de Regla, became much more independently wealthy, and more politically powerful, than their Peruvian counterparts.|$|R

50|$|The capitanei were a {{group of}} {{prominent}} noble families who emerged in the early Middle Ages and led Locarno. The term is first mentioned in a document granting market rights to the town by the Emperor Frederick I in 1164. This title was originally reserved only the direct vassals of the king's fief. The lower vassals were known as valvassores, but could have been awarded the title of capitanei as a <b>special</b> <b>concession.</b> The original capitanei were probably descendants of the old Lombard noble family of Da Besozzo from the county of Seprio, a historic region of Lombard Italy which comprised areas in southern Ticino and modern day Italian provinces of Varese and Como {{on the western side}} of Lake Maggiore, and was centered in Castelseprio, some 20 kilometres south of Locarno.|$|R
5000|$|In Germany, {{through most}} of the 19th century the Kommanditgesellschaft (société en commandite in France) was the typical form of {{business}} organisation. A [...] "KG" [...] had at least one member with unlimited liability, but other investors' liability was limited to their contribution. A <b>special</b> <b>concession</b> was not required for setting up this company. The first German public company statute was the Prussian Act of 1843. In 1861 the Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch or the General Commercial Code for all of Germany, as well as Austria, was enacted, which devoted a section to joint stock companies. This allowed incorporation with limited liability. Companies would be constituted with a single board of directors, though they had the option of a two-tiered board system, involving shareholders appointing a supervisory board, which could in turn elect the management board.|$|R

The lots are to be laid off in rectangular blocks, and as the valley is narrow and winding, that takes in a proportion of heavy timber on the hill bench, and will not include quite a strip of natural prairie, which remains with the Crown. The cost of the land alone runs close on twenty thousand dollars, of which, one way or another, I can raise about eight thousand." ...|$|R

50|$|Grape {{growing and}} wine {{production}} in the area was practiced by the ancient Iberians and of course by the ancient Romans.

Towards the end of the 18th century annual production was around 200,000 arrobas (3.2 million litres). Fermentation was carried out in enormous earthenware vats (with capacities of up to 1,600 litres) which were partially buried in the ground to help keep the temperature down. During the winter months the lees would fall to the bottom naturally and it was not necessary to clarify the wine.|$|R
