Lennon Goldsmith who {{discovered}} the <b>socket,</b> <b>head</b> and lower part of the shaft in 1903, making it the last major discovery of a cross on the moor. He reported his find to William Crossing whose detailed book on the crosses of Dartmoor had just been published. Crossing was unwilling to believe in its existence, so Goldsmith re-erected it with the help of four sailors from his ship. He passed the details to Crossing who conceded and included it in the 1910 edition of his Guide to Dartmoor. The cross is short and stumpy because {{the upper part of the}} shaft was never found.|$|E

50|$|Most medieval European battle axes had a <b>socketed</b> <b>head</b> (meaning {{that the}} thicker, {{butt-end}} {{of the blade}} contained an opening into which a wooden haft was inserted), and some included langets—long strips of metal affixed to {{the faces of the}} haft to prevent it from being damaged during combat. Occasionally the cheeks of the axehead bore engraved, etched, punched or inlaid decorative patterns. Late-period battle axes tended to be of all-metal construction.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the harpoon heads excavated from the Moyoro Shell Mound, a famous archaeological {{site of the}} Okhotsk culture in Abashiri City, Hokkaido Prefecture. The site {{is located on the}} left bank of the Abashiri River, which flows into the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1). Archaeological finds from the Moyoro Shell Mound, which were excavated from the Pit-dwelling No. 10 in 1948 (Komai ed. 1964), are preserved by the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Letters, the University of Tokyo. In this paper, harpoon heads made of bone and antlers in this collection will be described and discussed. In addition, some harpoon heads {{in the collection of the}} Hakodate City Museum will also be discussed; these specimens were unearthed from the Moyoro Shell Mound in 1941 and 1942. From the Pit-dwelling No. 10, 23 harpoon heads were excavated (Fig. 2 - 5, PL. 1 - 4). They are classified by the way they are hafted and connected to the line. While only one male harpoon head was found from the floor of the dwelling, 22 female harpoon heads were unearthed from the floor and upper layers, including five unfinished specimens. The female-toggle harpoon heads are subdivided into four types. Type I is an open <b>socket</b> harpoon <b>head,</b> with a line groove also used for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft. Type II is an open <b>socket</b> harpoon <b>head</b> with two line holes to hold the harpoon head and a groove for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft. Type III is a closed <b>socket</b> harpoon <b>head</b> with a thin body. Type IV is an open <b>socket</b> harpoon <b>head</b> with two line holes, which belongs to the Ainu period. The number of harpoon heads of each type found from each layer is shown in Table 2. Type I harpoon heads constitute a large proportion of the unearthed harpoon heads, while only one specimen for each of Type II, Type III, and Type IV was found from the topsoil. Some of the Type I harpoon heads show the traces of reprocessing (Fig. 6). The reduction process of this type of harpoon heads was reconstructed based on these materials (Fig. 7). The Type II harpoon heads in eastern Hokkaido, distributed from Tokoro to Nemuro, are typologically different from the Type II harpoon heads in Southern Kuriles (Fig. 8). Some of the Type III harpoon heads are made of the ribs of sea mammals; this technique is characteristic of this site (Fig. 9) ...|$|R
50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} hex <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> set screws, and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar {{was soon copied}} by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|E

5000|$|Hex <b>socket</b> screw <b>heads</b> {{are usually}} made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R

5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square head set screw refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a hexagon <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> hollow set screw, for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly." [...] (These transitional growing pains echo those experienced many decades later with the adoption of the Torx drive).|$|E
5000|$|Specialized [...] "wobble" [...] or swivel sockets {{are made}} {{that have a}} {{separate}} <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> and socket wrench connection that allows the socket to wobble or swivel over a limited range independent of the socket wrench or tool position when it {{is attached to the}} bolt or nut. This may be a distinct advantage in some applications with restricted access. These [...] "wobble/swivel" [...] sockets, with their typical ball and socket joint swivel attachments, are made {{in a wide variety of}} types and sizes including deep, shallow, impact, triple square. They are often found in impact sets since they can be built sturdier than a common universal joint socket.|$|E
50|$|Two metal cams, one {{stationary}} and one movable, {{are used}} to immobilize the rope. The position of the movable cam {{is controlled by the}} locking handle. When the handle is raised, the movable cam is pressed towards the stationary cam so as to grip the rope by compressing it between the cams. Conversely, the lock is released by lowering the handle, thus retracting the movable cam away from the stationary cam and releasing the grip on the rope. The position of the stationary cam can usually be adjusted with a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> adjustment screw. This enables the spacing between the cams to be adjusted so that, when locked, the rope lock can accommodate ropes of different diameters.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Stretch dolls which {{contained}} a syrup-like liquid inside a rubber sheath, Vac-Man (and associated models like the Vac-Pac {{which were the}} heroic enemies of Vac-Man) contained a grainy solid, produced from ground-up corn cobs. By attaching the provided pump to a <b>socket</b> on Vac-Man's <b>head,</b> air could be sucked out until the body became rigid. It could then be stretched, but unlike Stretch Armstrong, it would retain its stretched shape until air was let back in.|$|R
50|$|For {{the last}} 45 years the most {{successful}} and common form of arthroplasty is the surgical replacement of arthritic or destructive or necrotic joint or joint surface with prosthesis. For example a hip joint that is affected by osteoarthritis may be replaced entirely (total hip arthroplasty) with a prosthetic hip. This would involve replacing both the acetabulum (hip <b>socket)</b> and the <b>head</b> and neck of the femur. The purpose of this procedure is to relieve pain, to restore range of motion and to improve walking ability, thus leading to the improvement of muscle strength.|$|R

50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> screws that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot head screws and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|E
5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a hex socket drive in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety set screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the hex <b>socket</b> <b>head,</b> beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|E
50|$|Warrenisuchus {{is known}} from several fossil specimens. The holotype {{skeleton}} preserves {{most of the}} skull and lower jaws, the pectoral girdle, the forward-most vertebrae and ribs, and the right hind limb and the paratype specimen includes a partial skull and pectoral girdle. All known specimens of Warrenisuchus are very small; the largest skull is only 3.9 cm long and the smallest is 1.1 cm long (adult capitosaurs can have skulls over a meter in length). They show many characteristics of juvenile individuals such as large eye <b>sockets,</b> rounded <b>heads</b> (adult capitosaurs typically have triangular heads), loose joints between skull bones, small tabular horns, and pineal foramina close {{to the back of}} the eye sockets (as opposed to farther back on the skull table). The smallest specimens seem to represent the stage of development immediately after metamorphosis when gills have been lost and the skull bones have thickened but the vertebrae remain poorly developed.|$|R
2500|$|Multifocal electroleucoagulation, {{in which}} white matter is {{gradually}} destroyed by passing electric current through electrodes {{implanted in the}} frontal lobes, was the invention of doctors at the Burden Neurological Institute in 1959. Ten sheaths, each containing six or seven electrodes, were implanted {{in the brain and}} connected to a <b>socket</b> on the <b>head.</b> Every week direct currents of 10–20 mA were passed for about 3 minutes through [...] 2–4 selected electrodes to make electrolytic lesions. These experiments continued throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. In the mid-1990s there were plans to re-introduce multifocal electrocoagulation but they came to nothing.|$|R
5000|$|An {{espagnolette}} is a locking device, normally {{mounted on}} the vertical frame of a French door or casement window.

Operating the handle rotates the rod, which has hooks at each end that fit into <b>sockets</b> at the <b>head</b> and sill of the opening. This type of lock is often used on a semi-trailer truck to fasten the rear doors. It can be identified by the use of a round bar, instead of a half-round bar used on a crémone bolt.|$|R
