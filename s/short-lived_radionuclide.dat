50|$|NAA {{can vary}} {{according}} {{to a number of}} experimental parameters. The kinetic energy of the neutrons used for irradiation will be a major experimental parameter. The above description is of activation by slow neutrons, slow neutrons are fully moderated within the reactor and have KE <0.5 eV. Medium KE neutrons may also be used for activation, these neutrons have been only partially moderated and have KE of 0.5 eV to 0.5 MeV, and are termed epithermal neutrons. Activation with epithermal neutrons is known as Epithermal NAA (ENAA). High KE neutrons are sometimes used for activation, these neutrons are unmoderated and consist of primary fission neutrons. High KE or fast neutrons have a KE >0.5 MeV. Activation with fast neutrons is termed Fast NAA (FNAA).Another major experimental parameter is whether nuclear decay products (gamma rays or particles) are measured during neutron irradiation (prompt gamma), or at some time after irradiation (delayed gamma). PGNAA is generally performed by using a neutron stream tapped off the nuclear reactor via a beam port. Neutron fluxes from beam ports are the order of 106 times weaker than inside a reactor. This is somewhat compensated for by placing the detector very close to the sample reducing the loss in sensitivity due to low flux. PGNAA is generally applied to elements with extremely high neutron capture cross-sections; elements which decay too rapidly to be measured by DGNAA; elements that produce only stable isotopes; or elements with weak decay gamma ray intensities. PGNAA is characterised by short irradiation times and short decay times, often in the order of seconds and minutes.DGNAA is applicable to the vast majority of elements that form artificial radioisotopes. DG analyses are often performed over days, weeks or even months. This improves sensitivity for long-lived radionuclides as it allows <b>short-lived</b> <b>radionuclide</b> to decay, effectively eliminating interference. DGNAA is characterised by long irradiation times and long decay times, often in the order of hours, weeks or longer.|$|E

40|$|High {{temperature}} condensates {{found in}} meteorites display uranium isotopic variations (235 U/ 238 U) that complicate dating {{of the formation}} of the Solar System and whose origin remains mysterious.

Recent observations that 26 -Al was homogeneously distributed in the inner solar system prove that this SLR has a stellar origin. In this Letter, we address the issue of the incorporation of hot 26 -Al-rich stellar ejecta into the cold protosolar nebula. We first show that the 26 -Al atoms produced by a population of massive stars in an OB association cannot be injected into protostellar cores with enough efficiency. We then show that this SLR likely originated in a Wolf-Rayet star that escaped from its parent cluster and interacted with a neighboring molecular cloud. The explosion of this runaway star as a supernova probably triggered the formation of the solar system. This scenario also accounts for the meteoritic abundance of 41 -Ca.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} puzzling {{properties}} {{of the solar system}} is the high abundance at its birth of 26 Al, a <b>short-lived</b> <b>radionuclide</b> with amean life of 1 Myr. Now decayed, it has left its imprint in primitive meteoritic solids. The origin of 26 Al in the early solar systemhas been debated for decades and strongly constrains the astrophysical context of the Sun and planets formation. We show that,according to the present understanding of star-formation mechanisms, it is very unlikely that a nearby supernova has delivered 26 Alinto the nascent solar system. A more promising model is the one whereby the Sun formed in a wind-enriched, 26 Al-rich dense shellsurrounding a massive star (M > 32 M). We calculate that the probability of any given star in the Galaxy being born in such asetting, corresponding to a well-known mode of star formation, is of the order of 1 %. It means that our solar system, though not therule, is relatively common and that many exo-planetary systems in the Galaxy might exhibit comparable enrichments in 26 Al.

40|$|Through the {{laboratory}} study of ancient solar system {{materials such as}} meteorites and comet dust, we can recognize evidence for the same star-formation processes in our own solar system as those that we can observe now through telescopes in nearby star-forming regions. High temperature grains formed in the innermost region {{of the solar system}} ended up much farther out in the solar system, not only the asteroid belt but even in the comet accretion region, suggesting a huge and efficient process of mass transport. Bi-polar outflows, turbulent diffusion, and marginal gravitational instability are the likely mechanisms for this transport. The presence of <b>short-lived</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in the early solar system, especially 60 Fe, 26 Al, and 41 Ca, requires a nearby supernova shortly before our solar system was formed, suggesting that the Sun was formed in a massive star-forming region similar to Orion or Carina. Solar system formation may have been “triggered” by ionizing radiation originating from massive O and B stars at the center of an expanding HII bubble, one of which may have later provided the supernova source for the <b>short-lived</b> <b>radionuclides.</b> Alternatively, a supernova shock wave may have simultaneously triggered the collapse and injected the <b>short-lived</b> <b>radionuclides.</b> Because the Sun formed in a region where many other stars were forming more or less contemporaneously, the bi-polar outflows from all such stars enriched the local region in interstellar silicate and oxide dust. This may explain several observed anomalies in the meteorite record: a near absence of detectable (no extreme isotopic properties) presolar silicate grains and a dichotomy in the isotope record between 26 Al and nucleosynthetic (nonradiogenic) anomalies...|$|R

40|$|Two {{explanations}} {{exist for}} the <b>short-lived</b> <b>radionuclides</b> present {{in the solar system}} when the CAIs first formed. They originated either from the ejecta of a supernova or by the in situ irradiation of nebular dust by energetic particles. With a half-life of only 53 days, Beryllium- 7 is then the key discriminant, since it can be made only by irradiation. We calculate the yield of Be- 7. Within model uncertainties associated mainly with nuclear cross sections, we obtain agreement with the experimental value. Moreover, if Be- 7 and Be- 10 have the same origin, the irradiation time must be short. The x-wind model provides a natural astrophysical setting that gives the requisite conditions. The decoupling of the Al- 26 and Be- 10 observed in some rare CAIs receives a quantitative explanation when rare gradual events are considered.

40|$|A current {{emphasis}} in nuclear medicine is to better match the physical lifetime of the radionuclides used in vivo for {{diagnosis and treatment}} to the biological lifetime of the diagnostic procedure or to minimize radiation dose to areas other than those to be treated. In many cases the biological lifetime is {{on the order of}} minutes. Since the direct production of radionuclides with half lives of minutes requires the user to be near a suitable reactor or accelerator, this study was undertaken to produce short-lived radionuclides indirectly. If a long-lived radionuclide decays into a <b>short-lived</b> <b>radionuclide,</b> quick separation of the daughter activity from the parent enables the user to have a short-lived daughter while freeing him from the constraint of proximity to a cyclotron. Systems where a short-lived daughter is separated from a long-lived parent are called radionuclide generators. Two generator systems were developed for use in nuclear medicine, one in diagnostic work and the other for therapeutic work.

40|$|In {{agreement}} with previous work, {{we show that}} the presence of the <b>short-lived</b> <b>radionuclide</b> 26 Al in the early Solar System was unlikely (< 2 % a priori probability) {{to be the result of}} direct introduction of supernova ejecta into the gaseous disk during the Class II stage of protosolar evolution. We also show that Bondi-Hoyle accretion of any contaminated residual gas from the Sun’s natal star cluster contributed negligible 26 Al to the primordial Solar System. Our calculations are consistent with the absence of the oxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova ejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of 26 Al in the oldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its apparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical 26 Al / 27 Al ratio of (4. 5 − 5) × 10 − 5 support the inheritance of 26 Al from the Sun’s parent giant molecular cloud.
