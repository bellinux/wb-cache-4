500|$|Sinatra started 1967 with {{a series}} of {{recording}} sessions with Antônio Carlos Jobim. He recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Jobim, the Grammy-nominated album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim, {{which was one of the}} best-selling albums of the year, behind the Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. According to Santopietro the album [...] "consists of an extraordinarily effective blend of bossa nova and slightly swinging jazz vocals, and succeeds in creating an unbroken mood of romance and regret". Writer Stan Cornyn noted that Sinatra sang <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> on the album that it was comparable to the time that he suffered from a vocal hemorrhage in 1950. Sinatra also released the album The World We Knew, which features a chart-topping duet of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] with daughter Nancy. In December, Sinatra collaborated with Duke Ellington on the album Francis A. & Edward K.. According to Granata, the recording of [...] "Indian Summer" [...] on the album was a favorite of Riddle's, noting the [...] "contemplative mood [...] is heightened by a Johnny Hodges alto sax solo that will bring a tear to your eye". With Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter Paul Anka wrote the song [...] "My Way", using the melody of the French [...] "Comme d'habitude" [...] ("As Usual"), composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. Sinatra recorded it just after Christmas 1968. [...] "My Way", Sinatra's best-known song on the Reprise label, was not an instant success, charting at #27 in the US and #5 in the UK, but it remained in the UK charts for 122 weeks, including 75 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 40, between April 1969 and September 1971, which was still a record in 2015. Sinatra told songwriter Ervin Drake in the 1970s that he [...] "detested" [...] singing the song, because he believed audiences would think it was a [...] "self-aggrandizing tribute", professing that he [...] "hated boastfulness in others".|$|E
2500|$|Caillat, in contrast, cites Fleetwood as [...] "still one of {{the most}} amazing drummers I've ever met. He had his rack of tom drums {{arranged}} back to front. Most drummers place them from high to low (in pitch) from their left to right, but Mick chose to place his mid, high, low. I think perhaps this helped him develop his unique style. He hit his drums very hard, except for his kick drum. For some reason, when he played his high hat, it distracted him. He would keep perfect beat with his kick, but he played it <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> that we could hear his mouth noises through his kick mic." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} advanced <b>so</b> <b>softly,</b> that Alroy did {{not perceive}} him, until the Prince again rose.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{rule against}} that--at least none {{that he knew}} of--and <b>so,</b> {{slipping}} <b>softly</b> to the cellar-door, over in the darkest corner of the kitchen, he opened it, and went softly down the steps.|$|R
60|$|Piz. What friends we have, {{and how we}} came <b>so</b> strong, We'll <b>softly</b> {{tell you}} as we march along.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Saxton {{leaned over}} to her {{daughter}} and said <b>softly,</b> <b>so</b> {{that he should not}} hear, that George was pulling the flesh out of the raisins.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes to his. Her whispered words came <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> that they were almost inaudible.|$|E
60|$|Her {{words were}} <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> spoken {{that they seemed}} to melt away. She leaned forward to look in his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>softly</b> had she whispered, {{that the}} others who stood so near were not aware that she had spoken at all.|$|E
6000|$|She spoke <b>so</b> {{modestly}} and <b>softly</b> and her trembling hand expressed such agitation as {{it moved}} to and fro upon the silent notes! My dear, dear girl! ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the sight}} of this strange figure the queen thought she must be dead, and gazing on an {{inhabitant}} of another world. <b>So</b> she murmured <b>softly</b> to herself: ...|$|R
60|$|With {{a gesture}} of acquiescent anguish and despair, he let her pass, held open the door, and closed it <b>softly,</b> <b>so</b> as not to awaken the happy sleeper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night, Scaramouche," [...] she said, but <b>so</b> <b>softly,</b> so tenderly, that {{he caught}} his breath, and stood conning her, {{his dark eyes}} aglow.|$|E
60|$|ROSAMUND. I {{have saved}} many of 'em. You catch 'em, <b>so,</b> <b>Softly,</b> and fling {{them out to}} the free air. They burn {{themselves}} within-door.|$|E
6000|$|... "God's Death, Robin!" [...] There was a harsh note in {{the voice}} that lately had cooed <b>so</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "You are strangely free, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{much like}} the tone, but I did not let on; for he was excited, you know. But I was calm; <b>so</b> I said <b>softly,</b> and without acrimony: ...|$|R
6000|$|Out {{there was}} her ideal. [...] "Out {{there is the}} man who is to fill out my life," [...] she uttered to herself <b>softly,</b> <b>so</b> that only her inner ear heard.|$|R
60|$|I {{laid down}} my head again <b>softly,</b> <b>so</b> {{as not to}} disturb him. My {{thoughts}} wandered backward once more, and showed me another picture in the golden gallery of the past.|$|R
60|$|Cummings {{had hardly}} ceased {{speaking}} before the Indian appeared in their midst, having come <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> {{that no one}} heard him until he stood before them.|$|E
60|$|His voice seemed {{choked with}} emotion {{and he did}} not finish his sentence. She spoke to him, but <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> that I could not hear the words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{she steps}} {{so quickly and}} <b>so</b> <b>softly,</b> like the {{twinkling}} of a star, and because her eyes are so bright and sparkling," [...] answered the Wax Doll.|$|E
6000|$|He {{started at}} those dreadful words--so <b>softly,</b> <b>so</b> patiently spoken. [...] "You will live," [...] he said. [...] "My Carmina, what am I here for but {{to bring you}} back to life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{had found}} a place, near {{to the point where}} he stood, where there was a deep hollow in the rock, so he put his face into this hollow and whispered <b>softly,</b> <b>so</b> he would not be heard: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, <b>so,</b> then; <b>softly,</b> now, softly!" [...] {{said the}} strange clear voice. The Oomgar caught {{up the slack}} end of the noose and wound it deftly around him, binding him hand and foot together. Then {{he took a long}} steel knife from his {{breeches}} pocket, cut the cord round Nod's neck, and let him drop heavily to the ground. [...] "Poor little Pongo! poor leetle Pongo!" [...] he said craftily, and cautiously stooped to pick him up.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] he {{continued}} sadly, [...] "I {{do not understand}} him, he whispers <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> that, though I hear, I cannot comprehend. I wonder why this is so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll set {{the canoe}} adrift, and float down the stream with it," [...] whispered Stover, <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> that Dan could {{scarcely}} hear him. [...] "It's our one chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where are you stopping? What are you doing? How are {{you getting}} along on the case?" [...] pleaded Mary Louise, <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> {{that no one else}} could overhear.|$|E
60|$|During the night, light, {{baffling}} airs {{blew out}} of the south, and the frantic captain, with his cargo of fire, watched and measured his westward drift and went off by himself at times to curse <b>softly</b> <b>so</b> that McCoy should not hear.|$|R
60|$|We insensibly {{approached}} the old boat, and entered. Mrs. Gummidge, no longer moping in her especial corner, was busy preparing breakfast. She took Mr. Peggotty's hat, {{and placed his}} seat for him, and spoke <b>so</b> comfortably and <b>softly,</b> that I hardly knew her.|$|R
50|$|The dink {{is another}} very {{effective}} offensive shot designed {{to end the}} point. It is a shot very low to the front wall hit very <b>softly</b> <b>so</b> as to bounce twice before the opponent can get to it. Dinks are most effective when the opponent is positioned deep in the court.|$|R
60|$|All {{remained}} perfectly {{quiet in}} the dark woods around. The babbling rivulet alone broke {{the silence of the}} night. Bevan seemed to glide over the ground, he trod <b>so</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|E
60|$|The closing {{words were}} not <b>so</b> <b>softly</b> and blushingly said but that John heard them, {{and showed that}} he heard them by again {{assisting}} Bella to another of those mysterious disappearances.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me there was little need for such caution. The traitor was yet gagged, and strive as he might {{could not have done}} other than moan ever <b>so</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Sir Jasper turned hastily on {{his heel}} and went to remake his toilet; Mrs. Snowdon bit her lip, but thanked Treherne sweetly and begged him to fasten her glove. As he did <b>so,</b> she said <b>softly,</b> [...] "Be more careful next time. Octavia has keen eyes, and the major may prove inconvenient." ...|$|R
60|$|Gabriel rose swiftly, and {{disappeared}} behind the screen. As he did <b>so,</b> the door <b>softly</b> opened, {{and a man}} stepped into the cabin. The new-comer cast a rapid glance around the dimly-lighted room, and then remained motionless in the doorway. From behind the screen came the sound of voices. The stranger hesitated, and then uttered a slight cough.|$|R
6000|$|A scratch, no more. The torch was in mine eyes. Do {{not look}} sad, Bianca. It is nothing. Your husband bleeds, 'tis nothing. Take a cloth, Bind it about mine arm. Nay, not <b>so</b> tight. More <b>softly,</b> my good wife. And be not sad, I pray you be not sad. No; take it off. What matter if I bleed? [Tears bandage off.] ...|$|R
