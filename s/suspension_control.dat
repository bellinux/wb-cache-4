50|$|The LC8 motor {{was based}} on the {{powerplant}} in the RC8 sportbike. Like the RC8, and unlike its predecessor the 990 Adventure, the 1190 Adventure uses ride-by-wire throttle. Cycle World and Motor Cycle News noted the electronic rider aids including ride-by-wire and electronic <b>suspension</b> <b>control,</b> up till now foregone by KTM to emphasize off-road performance, were intended to position the 1190 Adventure against technologically advanced streetgoing rivals like the Ducati Multistrada 1200.

50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} multi-link <b>suspension,</b> <b>Control</b> Blade {{features a}} wide, simple, uniform thickness, pressed steel trailing arm with hub carrier - taking {{the place of}} two longitudinal locating rods, eliminating an expensive cast knuckle, and offering {{the same level of}} body control - with a lower center of gravity, reduced road noise, and at lower production cost. The long rear lateral arm controls toe, a pair of shorter front lateral arms, vertically above each other, control the camber, and the Control Blade reacts to brake and traction loads.|$|E

The vehicles also run a uniform body kit consisting of front splitter/air dam, side skirts, and rear wing. Body modifications {{are allowed to}} present a more race oriented look (such as flared wheel arches and widened bodies), but this is also strictly controlled to keep all the vehicles even.|$|E
5000|$|Two primary {{versions}} were produced. The XVZ12 (Mk1) from 1983 through 1985 had a [...] (referred to as 1,200 cc) {{engine and}} removable trunk and bags. The XVZ13D (Mk2) was produced from 1986 through 1993 {{and had a}} [...] (referred to as 1,300 cc) engine with the trunk and side bags rigidly mounted. Both models had a full frame mounted fairing with an AM/FM cassette stereo, an air <b>suspension</b> <b>control</b> system with on board compressor and electronic cruise control (1984-1993).

50|$|Changes {{occurred}} for the 1987 model year. On the interior, the 1987 944 Turbo for North America {{became the first}} production car {{in the world to}} be equipped with driver and passenger side air bags as standard equipment. A low oil level light was added to the dash as well as a 180 mi/h km/h speedometer as opposed to the 170 mi/h km/h speedometer on the 1986 model Turbos. Also included is the deletion of the transmission oil cooler, and a change in <b>suspension</b> <b>control</b> arms to reduce the car's scrub radius. The engine remained the same M44/51 as in the 1986 model.|$|E

The control system had a major update, with Volvo's TEA electronics architecture {{to bring it to}} line with the rest of its bigger cousins. Inline fuel injection pump was replaced with the EDC rotary distributor pump from Bosch with the identical horsepower; despite the loss of supercharger from the previous D6A engine. The cruise control, automatic exhaust brake and accelerator now became the so-called fly by wire as standard.

50|$|Team Associated {{took the}} realm of the race buggy further when they {{introduced}} the Roger Curtis designed RC10, a car that established the layout (motors and batteries on a flat tub chassis) that became an industry standard for all off-road buggies by industry insiders. Taking inspiration from real off-road buggies, Curtis looked at how the suspension could be designed to cope with the high demands of off-road racing. The chassis was made from anodized, aircraft grade aluminum alloy, it also featured machined, oil-filled aluminium shock absorbers that can be adjusted with high-impact nylon <b>suspension</b> <b>control</b> arms, ball differentials and two-piece wheels. It primarily proved that designs based on its real life counterpart was not the way to win races, as a result, manufacturers began to break away from realism. Before this, cars sold had to be heavily modified from its stock format in order to be competitive.|$|E
50|$|All of this {{technology}} came {{at a very high}} price. At a time when the most expensive Cadillacs, the mid-sized Seville and full-sized Cadillac Fleetwood Series Seventy-Five limousine each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most Rolls-Royces. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull <b>suspension</b> <b>control</b> knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled walnut veneer on the dash and console. The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated zebrano veneer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the comparative study on semi active <b>suspension</b> <b>controlled</b> by Skyhook and Semi Active Damping Force Estimator (SADE) algorithms. The damping element {{used in the}} semi active suspension is a commercial magnetorheological (MR) damper, produced by Delphi Automotive PLC. The performance of the magnetorheological semi-active <b>suspension</b> system is <b>controlled</b> both by the Skyhook and SADE algorithms and are evaluated {{in comparison with the}} normal suspension system, which act as a benchmark. The study is focusing on the effects of the parameter values used in skyhook and SADE algorithm on vehicle's ride comfort performances. The studied aspects are the overall ride comfort performance, current consumptions used by the MR damper, as well as the force tracking error. The vehicle ride comfort performances are evaluated based on the vehicle's vertical motions (jerk, acceleration, displacement) and pitch motions (pitch rate and pitch angle). It is shown that magnetorheological semiactive <b>suspension</b> system <b>controlled</b> both by the Skyhook and SADE systems are able to improve vehicle's ride comfort significantly compared to passive suspension (50. 7 percent and 48. 6 percent respectively), with the SADE system performance is just 2. 1 percent less than the Skyhook system performance...|$|R

50|$|The chassis {{was based}} on a 1979 Grand Prix and {{maintained}} the original brakes and <b>suspension</b> <b>control</b> arms {{in an effort to keep}} cost down. At 2,600 lbs and over 400 horse power on hand it should be fast. First time out was at the demanding Sear Point Raceway (Infenion). Test Drivers were Brandon Kraus and Miguel Caparros. It was fast with predictable handling, in short time both drivers were setting fast laps for the day. The Young Mr Kraus got to test his abilities and brute strength when the engine pulley came off and the vehicle lost the power steering in the middle of the infamous Turn 2. Kraus was able to spin and avoid contact and brought the truck in for the day. It was a good day all in all.Next test was 3 weeks later at Laguna Seca. The high speeds attainable at Laguna Seca, played into the strengths of the truck. The Truck was the fastest car on the track. It was decided at the last minute to enter the 3 hour enduro that afternoon.Starting from the last position, Brandon Kraus was at the lead by the end of the first lap.Pulling away to a two lap lead after the first hour. At the first pit stop the lead was given back as the crew was not prepared for fast refueling and the drivers change in a race truck is rather tedious. Rich Rogers took off and drove at a more conservative pace and lost two laps to the leading BMW M3's. The second pit stop and driver change went better and only one additional laps. Now down 3 laps former Trans Am driver Lou Lerner took off matching earlier lap times. On the last lap Lou passed the lead BMW for the lead having made up all the lost laps. At Laguna's turn 11 with the checker in sight, leading by 100 yards, the heat and exhaustion caused Lou to go into the turn too fast and spun into the sand trap.|$|E
