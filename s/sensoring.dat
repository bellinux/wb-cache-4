However, Logan quickly dislikes and distrusts Carson, who talks way too much about Logan's heroic Vietnam War service and self-imposed exile from {{high-level}} government activities, and who later appears to deliberately blow Wyatt's cover when the team members are moving in to arrest the trafficker. Later on, Logan and Wyatt learn that their unlikable supervisor has been promoted to a job in Washington, leaving Carson as temporary head of the station. They then see an Army team taking custody of the Jeep and securing the area, and then drive to a nearby location where an old man was killed and his trailer burnt down. They figure out that two BP agents (played by Guy Boyd and Miguel Ferrer) were at the trailer site and are now missing, and find their vehicles at a house where the agents have been tortured and killed inside.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} collecting <b>sensoring</b> information from wireless sensor networks using mobile robots. We consider that sensors may {{interact with each other}} only to maintain the network topology. Because transmitting <b>sensoring</b> data over the network to a remote base is a very power consuming operation, we deploy mobile robots through the sensor field in order to collect such information. We present a multi-target, dynamical, potential field strategy where a robot is attracted to the sensors that have less remaining data storage capacity. Moreover, the robot is also attracted to other sensors in its path without compromising its principal mission. Our controllers guarantee the robot will never get stuck in undesirable local minima.

40|$|Abstract—Constructing a <b>sensor</b> {{network with}} a mix of mobile and static <b>sensors</b> can achieve a balance between <b>sensor</b> {{coverage}} and <b>sensor</b> cost. In this paper, we design two bidding protocols to guide the movement of mobile <b>sensors</b> in such <b>sensor</b> networks to increase the coverage to a desirable level. In the protocols, static <b>sensors</b> detect coverage holes locally by using Voronoi diagrams and bid mobile <b>sensors</b> to move. Mobile <b>sensors</b> accept the highest bids and heal the largest holes. Simulation results show that our protocols achieve suitable trade-off between coverage and <b>sensor</b> cost.

40|$|Abstract. Ambient agents react {{on humans}} {{on the basis}} of partial {{information}} obtained by <b>sensoring.</b> Appropriate types of reactions depend on in how far an ambient agent is able to interpret the available information (which is often incomplete, and hence multi-interpretable) {{in order to create a}} more complete internal image of the environment, including humans. This interpretation process, which often has multiple possible outcomes, can make use of an explicitly represented model of causal and dynamic relations. Given such a model representation, the agent needs a reasoning method to interpret the partial information available by <b>sensoring,</b> by generating one or more possible interpretations. This paper presents a generic model-based default reasoning method that can be exploited to this end. The method allows the use of software tools to determine the different default extensions that form the possible interpretations. ...|$|E

40|$|Operational and {{commercial}} optimization for monitoring and <b>sensoring</b> ions in {{water is a}} challenging task for the current scientific and industrial world. For resolving this issue sensor could help identify new viable water sources that can mitigate today's global water crisis. The current water crisis primarily correlates to the increasing water demand due to burgeoning population, accelerated industrialization and urbanization. The about six-fold increase in water consumption with a corresponding three-fold increase in global population was recorded {{in the past century}} Gude, 2015) This is a clear indicator of potential and adverse water stress conditions. A statistic predicts over 33 countries are liable to face acute water stress by 2040, which calls for rapid action for efficient crisis management. On the other hand, companies related to the food, water treatment, and pharmaceutical fields are facing technological challenges to ensure the purity of their water sources. Reuse of water in production processes can reduce costs allowing manufacturers to be competitive. One of the main issues for reusing the water is the lack of fast and reliable <b>sensoring</b> devices for the characterization of the water. Another is the long response time of conventional tests. This requires <b>sensoring</b> technologies that can eliminate these obstacles and that can identify a potential risk of reusing contaminated water. This research focuses on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI); a technique to identify and quantify ions in drinking water based on optical interferometric measurements. The refractive index identifies which component is present in an analyzed sample. The visibility term involves a concentration parameter that allows quantifying the component present. This two-term were simulated in a MATLAB algorithm based on a fitting method between the generated interferometric spectral signal from the MZ and a model based on theoretical MZI equations. The use of this fitting model can give valuable insights for further applications of water <b>sensoring</b> technologies such as an optofluidic chip, a promising technology for identification and quantification of ions in drinking water.

40|$|Abstract. Ambient agents react {{on humans}} {{on the basis}} of their {{information}} obtained by <b>sensoring</b> and their knowledge about human functioning. Appropriate types of reactions depend on in how far an ambient agent understands the human. On the one hand, such an understanding requires that the agent has knowledge to a certain depth about the human’s physiological and mental processes in the form of an explicitly represented model of the causal and dynamic relations describing these processes. On the other hand, given such a model representation, the agent needs reasoning methods to derive conclusions from the model and the information available by <b>sensoring.</b> This paper presents a number of such model-based reasoning methods. They have been formally specified in an executable temporal format, which allows for simulation of reasoning traces and automated verification in a dedicated software environment. A number of such simulation experiments and their formal analysis are described. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It {{is still}} not clear, how large scale <b>sensoring</b> {{networks}} {{can be turned into}} useful ressources of incident response teams. Recent research has shown that the work of incident response teams is clearly exposed to denial of service attacks if the han-dling of low number / high priority incidents is not separated from the work related to high number / low priority incidents [WK 05]. This would imply that handling the magnitude of data coming from large scale <b>sensoring</b> networks will pose concrete op-erational problems to any incident response team dealing with it. While there are some strategies to mitigate this problem, we believe that only selecting the ’interest-ing ’ events through filtering is not good enough and give away useful insights that are inside the data but not yet obviously visible for an unaware observer. Therefore our research objective is to identify successful strategies of how to extract useful data au-tomatically out of large data sets. So far we have succeeded to improve a suggested algorithm and test it’s application in an operational setting. This paper will outline the algorithm, any improvement made as well as the key insights in it’s application. ...|$|E
