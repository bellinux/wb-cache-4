40|$|Abstract — The paper {{introduces}} soft switching of a Boost Converter {{which can}} {{be included in the}} Electrical Vehicle technology. In order to raise the motor power rating, the DC link Vehicles, there is a great need for less component stress, smaller voltage of inverter up to 400 V, and higher efficiency. The conventional Boost Converter generates <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> at turn on and off thus the whole system's efficiency is reduced. The proposed converter utilizes soft switching method using an auxiliary switch and resonant circuit. So a natural zerovoltage switching method for the whole switches is achieved without additional device to reduce <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> and device inrush voltage stresses. Therefore, the converter reduces <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> lower than the hard switching. These advantages make the new converter promising for high power density applications.

5000|$|Practical {{electronic}} converters use switching techniques. Switched-mode DC-to-DC converters convert one DC {{voltage level}} to another, {{which may be}} higher or lower, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components (capacitors). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is more power efficient (often 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat. Fast semiconductor device rise and fall times are required for efficiency; however, these fast transitions combine with layout parasitic effects to make circuit design challenging. The higher efficiency of a switched-mode converter reduces the heatsinking needed, and increases battery endurance of portable equipment. Efficiency has improved since the late 1980s due {{to the use of}} power FETs, which are able to switch more efficiently with lower <b>switching</b> <b>losses</b> at higher frequencies than power bipolar transistors, and use less complex drive circuitry.Another important improvement in DC-DC converters is replacing the flywheel diode by synchronous rectification using a power FET, whose [...] "on resistance" [...] is much lower, reducing <b>switching</b> <b>losses.</b> Before the wide availability of power semiconductors, low-power DC-to-DC synchronous converters consisted of an electro-mechanical vibrator followed by a voltage step-up transformer feeding a vacuum tube or semiconductor rectifier, or synchronous rectifier contacts on the vibrator.|$|E
