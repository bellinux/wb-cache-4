The results of <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that unknown {{components of the}} soil microflora might be required for B.edulis to successfully establish a mycorrhizal relationship with the host plant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggested</b> the haplosporids, mostly parasites {{of marine}} invertebrates, might belong here, but they lack alveoli {{and are now}} placed among the Cercozoa.|$|R
50|$|Whereas <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggested</b> that OPCs can {{generate}} cortical neurons, other studies rejected these findings. The question is unresolved, as studies continue {{to find that}} certain populations of OPCs can form neurons.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to IL- 6, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggested</b> that IL- 8, CCL 2 and TGF-β can also promote {{the characteristics of}} BCSCs and give rise to chemotherapeutic resistance [38, 42, 120 – 123].|$|R
5|$|The Horton Plains are the {{headwaters}} of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha Eliya Plains. Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of Sri Lankan sambar deer feature as typical mammals and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback {{is one of the}} major threats to the park and <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that it is caused by a natural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} {{horns and}} the muscular neck {{may have been}} used in fighting conspecifics. According to separate studies, rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock absorbers. The feeding habits of Carnotaurus remain unclear: <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as sauropods, while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. Carnotaurus was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> {{levothyroxine}} {{as a possible}} treatment for idiopathic hypersomnia, especially for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. This treatment does carry potential risks (especially for patients without hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothroidism), which include cardiac arrhythmia.|$|R
30|$|Our study {{revealed}} {{no statistically significant}} differences in prevalence of insomnia among MS patients according to their gender. However, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggested</b> a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances in female patients (Bamer et al. 2008; Lunde et al. 2012).|$|R
5000|$|Rosiglitazone (Avandia), {{which was}} put under selling {{restrictions}} in the US and {{withdrawn from the}} market in Europe due to <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular events.

5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E

30|$|The present cases {{illustrate}} {{the possibility of}} hysteroscopy for diagnosis and resection or ablation of intramural cystic adenomyosis. Although diagnostic hysteroscopy does not reveal the pathognomonic signs of adenomyosis, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggests</b> that an irregular endometrium with endometrial defects, altered vascularization, and cystic hemorrhagic lesion are possibly associated with adenomyosis [9].|$|R
25|$|It {{is unclear}} why fibroids {{are more common}} in African American women. <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that black women who are obese and who have high blood {{pressure}} {{are more likely to have}} fibroids. Other suggested causes include the tendency of African American women to consume food with less than the daily requirements for vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposite}} {{factor of}} perceived control {{is that of}} prior experience. Prior experience is typically associated with less optimistic bias, which <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> is from either {{a decrease in the}} perception of personal control, or make it easier for individuals to imagine themselves at risk. Prior experience suggests that events may be less controllable than previously believed.|$|E
25|$|The OPA {{estimates}} that these technologies will contribute about 1,000 MW to Ontario electricity capacity by 2025.

5000|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} is {{the most}} common and least expensive calcium supplement. It should be taken with food, and depends on low pH levels (acidic) for proper absorption in the intestine. <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggests</b> that the absorption of calcium from calcium carbonate is similar to the absorption of calcium from milk.|$|R
30|$|Echocardiography has {{previously}} been the mainstay imaging modality in the diagnosis of LVNC. Diagnostic criteria for LVNC on echocardiography have become confusing, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> using a two layered myocardium with a non–compacted to compacted ratio of more than 2 : 1 (end systolic value) and colour Doppler flow within the trabeculations [89]. Other <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> using more than two thickened trabeculations as a diagnostic criteria.|$|R
50|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} {{membrane}} in phycodnaviruses is not well understood or researched. <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggested</b> that the membrane originates from the endoplasmic reticulum and may also be directly acquired from the host cell membrane during viral assembly.
