40|$|The <b>Solanaceae</b> family {{comprises}} {{many species}} of prime agronomical importance among which tomato and potato {{are the most important}} food source crops. In despite of their tremendous morphological diversity, the <b>Solanaceae</b> are closely related at the genetic level and display remarkable similarity in gene content and order. The <b>Solanaceae</b> Genome Project emerged in recent years as an international initiative aiming at generating genomic resources on the <b>Solanaceae</b> species and at coordinating national research efforts across the world. European countries made a substantial contribution to the activity of the <b>Solanaceae</b> International Consortium either through their respective national programs or {{with the advent of the}} EU-SOL integrated project.

40|$|Abstract Background Since no genome {{sequences}} of solanaceous plants have yet been completed, {{expressed sequence tag}} (EST) collections represent a reliable tool for broad sampling of <b>Solanaceae</b> transcriptomes, an attractive route for understanding <b>Solanaceae</b> genome functionality and a powerful reference for the structural annotation of emerging <b>Solanaceae</b> genome sequences. Description We describe the SolEST database [URL] which integrates different EST datasets from both cultivated and wild <b>Solanaceae</b> species and from two species of the genus Coffea. Background as well as processed data contained in the database, extensively linked to external related resources, represent an invaluable source of information for these plant families. Two novel features differentiate SolEST from other resources: i) the option of accessing and then visualizing <b>Solanaceae</b> EST/TC alignments along the emerging tomato and potato genome sequences; ii) the opportunity to compare different <b>Solanaceae</b> assemblies generated by diverse research groups {{in the attempt to}} address a common complaint in the SOL community. Conclusion Different databases have been established worldwide for collecting <b>Solanaceae</b> ESTs and are related in concept, content and utility to the one presented herein. However, the SolEST database has several distinguishing features that make it appealing for the research community and facilitates a "one-stop shop" for the study of <b>Solanaceae</b> transcriptomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The <b>Solanaceae</b> is {{a family}} of closely related species with diverse phenotypes that have been {{exploited}} for agronomic purposes. Previous studies involving {{a small number of}} genes suggested sequence conservation across the <b>Solanaceae.</b> The availability of large collections of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) for the <b>Solanaceae</b> now provides the opportunity to assess sequence conservation and divergence on a genomic scale. Results All available ESTs and Expressed Transcripts (ETs), 449, 224 sequences for six <b>Solanaceae</b> species (potato, tomato, pepper, petunia, tobacco and Nicotiana benthamiana), were clustered and assembled into gene indices. Examination of gene ontologies revealed that the transcripts within the gene indices encode a similar suite of biological processes. Although the ESTs and ETs were derived from a variety of tissues, 55 – 81 % of the sequences had significant similarity at the nucleotide level with sequences among the six species. Putative orthologs could be identified for 28 – 58 % of the sequences. This high degree of sequence conservation was supported by expression profiling using heterologous hybridizations to potato cDNA arrays that showed similar expression patterns in mature leaves for all six solanaceous species. 16 – 19 % of the transcripts within the six <b>Solanaceae</b> gene indices did not have matches among <b>Solanaceae,</b> Arabidopsis, rice or 21 other plant gene indices. Conclusion Results from this genome scale analysis confirmed a high level of sequence conservation at the nucleotide level of the coding sequence among <b>Solanaceae.</b> Additionally, the results indicated that part of the <b>Solanaceae</b> transcriptome is likely to be unique for each species. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPlant {{non-specific}} lipid transfer proteins (nsLtps) {{have been}} reported to be involved in plant defense activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. In this study, we identified 135 (122 putative and 13 previously identified) <b>Solanaceae</b> nsLtps, which are clustered into 8 different groups. By comparing with Boutrot’s nsLtp classification, we classified these eight groups into five types (I, II, IV, IX and X). We compared <b>Solanaceae</b> nsLtps with Arabidopsis and Gramineae nsLtps and found that (1) Types I, II and IV are shared by <b>Solanaceae,</b> Gramineae and Arabidopsis; (2) Types III, V, VI and VIII are shared by Gramineae and Arabidopsis but not detected in <b>Solanaceae</b> so far; (3) Type VII is only found in Gramineae whereas type IX is present only in Arabidopsis and Solanaceae; (4) Type X is a new type that accounts for 52. 59 % <b>Solanaceae</b> nsLtps in our data, and has not been reported in any other plant so far. We further built and compared the three-dimensional structures of the eight groups, and found that the major functional diversification within the nsLtp family could be predated to the monocot/dicot divergence, and many gene duplications and sequence variations had happened in the nsLtp family after the monocot/dicot divergence, especially in <b>Solanaceae...</b>|$|R

50|$|Ardisia <b>solanacea</b> is a 1.5 to 6 meters high {{evergreen}} shrub {{or small}} tree. The thick branches are usually colored red. The bark {{is smooth and}} brown. The glabrous leaves are inversely lanceolate, obovate-elliptical or elongated, they are 7.5 to 17 cm long and 2.5 to 7 cm wide. Towards the front, they are pointed or blunt short, they are narrowed down to a pointed base. The veining is slightly reticulated and after drying translucently dotted.|$|E
50|$|Various solanaceas {{species are}} grown as {{ornamental}} trees or shrubs. Examples include Brugmansia x candida ("Angel’s Trumpet") grown for its large pendulous trumpet-shaped flowers, or Brunfelsia latifolia, whose flowers are very fragrant and change colour from violet to white {{over a period}} of 3 days. Other shrub species that are grown for their attractive flowers are Lycianthes rantonnetii (Blue Potato Bush or Paraguay Nightshade) with violet-blue flowers and Nicotiana glauca ("Tree Tobacco") Other <b>solanacea</b> species and genera that are grown as ornamentals are the petunia (Petunia × hybrida), Lycium, Solanum, Cestrum, Calibrachoa × hybrida and Solandra. There is even a hybrid between Petunia and Calibrachoa (which constitutes a new nothogenus called × Petchoa G. Boker & J. Shaw) that is being sold as an ornamental. Many other species, in particular those that produce alkaloids, are used in pharmacology and medicine (Nicotiana, Hyoscyamus, and Datura).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, eighty-four Hy-Line W 36 laying hens in two {{experiments}} were distributed in 7 treatments with 3 replicates of four hens each.
