50|$|Degradation {{can occur}} on the {{polymers}} during the flow. Because of the pressure and temperature on the polymers, {{it is easier to}} break them down. Because of this, the drag reducing agent is re-injected after points like pumps and turns, where the pressure and temperature can be extra high. To safeguard against degradation at high temperature, a different class of drag reducing agents are at times used, namely, surfactants. Surfactant is a very convenient contraction of the term <b>Surface-active</b> <b>agent.</b> It connotes an organic molecule or an unformulated compound having surface-active properties. All three classes of surfactants, namely, anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants, have been successfully tried as drag-reducing agents.|$|E
40|$|The {{described}} agglomeration of drug microparticles {{blended with}} excipient microparticles {{is a technique}} for the size enlargement of micronized products that could be damaged by granulation or compaction techniques. These agglomerates {{can be used as}} oral prompt or delayed-release dosage forms administered as they are or dispersed in a liquid. The composition and quantity of the excipient microparticles resulted to be the crucial factors for the agglomerate quality. Therefore, adjusting the content of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> between 8 - 20 % of the excipient microparticles, it is possible to agglomerate microparticles of drugs that could not be agglomerated per se. Increasing the surfactant concentration in the spray-dried excipient microparticles or increasing the fraction of these excipient microparticles in the blend, the agglomeration was improved. The spray drying technique concentrates the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> on the microparticle surface. By tumbling, the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> present on microparticles excipient surface was spread to fill the inter-particle interstices of drug particles giving rise to more resistant agglomerates. This phenomenon occured also by vibration; the production in thi case was quicker...|$|E
40|$|<b>Surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> are {{amphiphilic}} {{chemicals that}} are used in almost every sector of modern industry, the bulk of which are produced by organo-chemical synthesis. Those produced from biological sources (biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers), however, have gained increasing interest in recent years due to their wide structural and functional diversity, lower toxicities and high biodegradability, compared to their chemically-synthesised counterparts. This review aims to present a general overview on <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents,</b> including their classification, where new types of these biomolecules may lay awaiting discovery, and some of the main bottlenecks for their industrial-scale production. In particular, the marine environment is highlighted as a largely untapped source for discovering new types of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents.</b> Marine bacteria, especially those living associated with micro-algae (eukaryotic phytoplankton), are a highly promising source of polymeric <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> with potential biotechnological applications. The high uronic acids content of these macromolecules has been linked to conferring them with amphiphilic qualities, and their high structural diversity and polyanionic nature endows them with the potential to exhibit a wide range of functional diversity. Production yields (e. g. by fermentation) for most microbial <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> have often been too low to meet the volume demands of industry, and this principally remains as the most important bottleneck for their further commercial development. However, new developments in recombinant and synthetic biology approaches can offer significant promise to alleviate this bottleneck. This review highlights a particular biotope in the marine environment that offers promise for discovering novel surface-active biomolecules, and gives a general overview on specific areas that researchers and the industry could focus work towards increasing the production yields of microbial <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{theory of}} {{heterogeneous}} water nucleation on aerosol particles, which consist of soluble and surface-active substances has been developed. A similar {{approach has been}} used by Gorbunov and Hamilton (1996). The theory links interfacial free energiy of the surface of an embryo and chemical characteristics of aerosol particles with the ability of the aerosols to form water droplets under tropospheric conditions. The embryo formation free energy ΔG is a basis to calculate the water nucleation rate (Pruppacher and Klett, 1980) and probability of cloud droplet formation. An expression for ΔG was obtained as a function of a number of water molecules Nw in an embryo: Formula omitted (1) Here Rg is the universal gas constant. σeg is the interfacial free energy of the border between the surface of the embryo and gas phase. Sw is supersaturation of water vapour above a flat surface of pure water. Seg is the values of the surface area of the embryo that contains Nw moles of water. aw is the water activity in a solution of the same composition as the embryo (Pruppacher and Klett, 1980). Water nucleation rate and free energies in the case of aerosol particles that contain NaCl and NaOOCC 15 H 31 have been calculated. It was shown that water nucleation on such aerosols is strongly influenced by the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent,</b> see Figure 1. The presence of a small amount of the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> (the mass fraction of the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> in dry particles is about 10 − 2) considerably reduces the free energy of embryo formation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss and give an outlook on {{numerical}} models describing dispersions, stabilized by surfactants and colloidal particles. Examples of these dispersions are foams and emulsions. In particular, {{we focus on the}} potential of the diffuse interface models based on a free energy approach, which describe dispersions with the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> soluble in one of the bulk phases. The free energy approach renders thermodynamic consistent models with realistic sorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics. The free energy approach is attractive because of its ability to describe highly complex dispersions, such as emulsions stabilized by ionic surfactants, or surfactant mixtures and dispersions with surfactant micelles. We have classified existing numerical methods into classes, using either a Eulerian or a Lagrangian representation for fluid and for the surfactant/colloid. A Eulerian representation gives a more coarse-grained, mean field description of the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent,</b> while a Lagrangian representation can deal with steric effects and larger complexity concerning geometry and (amphiphilic) wetting properties of colloids and surfactants. However, the similarity between the description of wetting properties of both Eulerian and Lagrangian models allows for the development of hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian models having advantages of both representations...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{spermicidal}} activities against human spermatozoa of a {{range of}} non-ionic, anionic and cationic <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> have been determined with the method of Baker, Ransom & Tynen (1937). Although it has been concluded that surface-tension-lowering properties do not directly influence spermicidal power, the surface-tension/concentration curves of a number of the compounds were studied. Solubilities in water, hexane, and ethyl oleate were also determined in an attempt to find out whether there was any relationship between spermicidal action and solubilities in these solvents. The results obtained on the compounds studied showed broadly that appreciable oil solubility and good surface-tension-lowering properties were desirable for spermicidal activity in non-ionic and anionic <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents.</b> The cationic compounds studied were active in spite of low fat solubility. The lack of precision of the spermicidal results made definite activity/ solubility or activity/surface-tension relationships difficult to formulate...|$|R

Degradation changes in the three HDPE materials were monitored by ultimate tensile strength, ultimate strain, drop impact test and characterized by DSC,FTIR and SEM. The mechanical properties occured most rapidly starting at 120 hours duration. This unusual phenomenon was corroborated by chemical measurements (crystalinity and melting temperature).

40|$|Most {{hydrodynamic}} correlations {{and models}} used for gas-liquid-solid fluidized beds implicitly {{assume that the}} major physical properties of the liquid (density, viscosity and surface tension) are sufficient to characterize bubble dynamics. While {{this is true for}} pure liquids, multi-component liquids require additional properties due to <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> preferentially accumulating at the gas-liquid interface. Experiments were first conducted to evaluate the effects of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> (alcohols as well as commercial anionic, cationic and non-ionic surfactants) on the phase holdups and minimum liquid fluidization velocities in a fluidize bed composed of air, water and glass beads of 1. 2 and 5 mm in diameter. The gas-liquid interfacial behaviour of the liquid solutions was then characterized by measuring the foamability as well the dynamic surface tension and dilatational surface elasticity using the maximum pressure bubble method. The presence of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> decreases the minimum liquid fluidization velocity and the effect is more important for the larger particles. The effect of surfactants on the bed phase holdups, and in particular the gas holdup, is significant and more pronounced in the coalesced bubble flow regime where foaming occurred. Further, the bed gas holdups are lower than those observed in the freeboard. The widely used gas holdup correlations proposed by Han et al. (1990) and Larachi et al. (2001) failed. Furthermore, the approach of Gorowara and Fan (1990) which uses the dynamic surface tension also failed as all surfactant solutions present similar phase holdups despite very different surface tension behaviour.

Permeability changes following exposure to lytic systems may range from selective effects on ion fluxes to gross membrane damage and cell leakage. Lysis can be conceived as an interfacial phenomenon, and the action of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> on erythrocytes has provided a model in which to investigate relationships between hemolysis and chemical structure, ionic charge, surface tension lowering, and ability to penetrate monolayers of membrane lipid components. Evidence suggests that lysis follows the attainment of surface pressures exceeding a "critical collapse" level and could involve membrane cholesterol or phospholipid. Similarities of chemical composition of membranes from various cell types could account for lytic responses observed on interaction with <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents.</b> Cell membranes usually contain about 20 – 30 % lipid and 50 – 75 % protein. One or two major phospholipids are present in all cell membranes, but sterols are not detectable in bacterial membranes other than those of the Mycoplasma group. The rigid cell wall in bacteria has an important bearing on their response to treatment with lytic agents. Removal of the wall renders the protoplast membrane sensitive to rapid lysis with surfactants. Isolated membranes of erythrocytes and bacteria are rapidly dissociated by <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents.</b> Products of dissociation of bacterial membranes have uniform behavior in the ultracentrifuge (sedimentation coefficients 2 – 3 S).
