40|$|Abstract. <b>Oil</b> <b>shale,</b> a kind {{of energy}} source, is an {{important}} alternative to petroleum. Considering the Haishiwan mine of the Yaojie coalfield, China, as a typical study case, an exploitation and utilization system for <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> was investigated. The system consists of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mining and comprehensive utilization. Haishiwan <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> has developed in a paragenetic relationship with humic coal in coal measure strata. Underground mining technology {{is applied to the}} <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> seam. The exploitation and utilization system for Haishiwan <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> has a great significance for two reasons. On the one hand, combined with gas drainage technology, the mining of the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> seam can eliminate the risk of coal and gas outburst from the underlying coal seam in a particular area and ensure the safe mining of the coal seam. Thus the economic value of this thin <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> seam is improved. On the other hand, the mined <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> can be fully made use of by a comprehensive utilization technology. The latter includes <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> retorting, combustion of semicoke, fine <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> and fuel gases for power generation, and utilization of ashes for production of composite cement and other building materials. The industrial chain for <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> exploitation and utilization established in the Yaojie coalfield is highly significant for maximizing the utility of resources and reducing environmental pollution...|$|R
5|$|While Soviet {{troops were}} {{advancing}} into Estonia during 1944, about 200Estonian oil shale specialists were evacuated to Schömberg, Germany, {{to work at}} an oil shale industry there, codenamed Operation Desert (Unternehmen Wüste). <b>Shale</b> <b>oil</b> extraction plants in Estonia were destroyed and mines were ignited or inundated by the retreating Germans. Existing oil shale-fired power stations were also destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Estonian {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were in short supply. A large <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> extraction plant for processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910. The outbreak of World War I, coupled with a fuel supply crisis, accelerated the pace of the research.|$|E
5|$|By {{complexity}} of technology: In situ technologies are usually classified either as true in situ processes or modified in situ processes. True in situ processes {{do not involve}} mining or crushing the oil shale. Modified in situ processes involve drilling and fracturing the target oil shale deposit to create voids in the deposit. The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the deposit, thereby increasing the volume {{and quality of the}} <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> produced.|$|E
500|$|Heating the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> to {{pyrolysis}} {{temperature and}} completing the endothermic kerogen decomposition reactions require {{a source of}} energy. Some technologies burn other fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, or coal to generate this heat and experimental methods have used electricity, radio waves, microwaves, or reactive fluids for this purpose. [...] Two strategies are used to reduce, and even eliminate, external heat energy requirements: the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas and char by-products generated by pyrolysis may be burned {{as a source of}} energy, and the heat contained in hot spent <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> ash may be used to pre-heat the raw <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> in Jordan {{represents}} a significant resource. <b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> deposits in Jordan underlie more than 70% of Jordanian territory. The total resources amounts to 31 billion tonnes of <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is no exact {{formula of}} <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas. Compositions of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas depends of {{retorted}} <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> and exploited technology. Typical components of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas are usually methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and different hydrocarbons like ethylene. It may also consist of hydrogen sulfide and other impurities.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease in the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} {{technologies such}} as the Paraho Direct are thermally efficient, since combustion of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can provide all the heat requirements of the retort. These technologies can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield. Two well-established <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> industries use internal combustion technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, {{and a number of}} Chinese companies operate Fushun process facilities.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and it is seen as a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> {{industry}} started in ancient times. The modern industrial use of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> for <b>oil</b> extraction dates to the mid-19th century and started growing just before World War I because of the mass production of automobiles and trucks and the supposed shortage of gasoline for transportation needs. Between the World Wars <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> projects were begun in several countries.|$|R
5|$|Heating <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis {{to yield a}} vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil—an unconventional oil—is separated from combustible oil-shale gas (the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in <b>shales).</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{reserves}} of crude oil are non-commercial, Jordan has the 5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world, which could be commercially exploited in the central and northwestern regions of the country. Official figures estimate the kingdom's oil shale reserves at more than 70 billion tonnes. Attarat Power Plant, which will start construction in late 2017, is a $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant that will be completed in 2020 with a total capacity of 470 megawatts. The project {{is part of the}} kingdom's visionary plan that aims to diversify its energy resources by 2025.

5|$|The kukersite {{oil shale}} of Ordovician age in Estonia {{is part of}} the Baltic oil shale basin and was {{deposited}} in shallow marine basins. The deposit is one of the world’s highest-grade deposits with more than 40% organic content and 66% conversion ratio into <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> and gas. The oil shale is located in a single calcareous layer 2.5–3meters in thickness and is buried at depths from 7 to 100m. The total area of the basin is about 3,000km2. Oil yield from Kukersite is 30 to 47%. Most of the organic matter is derived from the fossil green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, which has affinities to the modern cyanobacterium, Entophysalis major, an extant species that forms algal mats in inter-tidal to very shallow subtidal waters. Matrix minerals include low-magnesium calcite, dolomite, and siliciclastic minerals. It is not enriched in heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonian {{oil shale}} was {{described}} by several scientists and used as a low-grade fuel. Its use in industry commenced in 1916. Production of <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> began in 1921 and oil shale was first used to generate electrical power in 1924. Shortly thereafter, systematic research into oil shale and its products began, and in 1938 a department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University. After World War II, Estonian oil shale gas was used in Saint Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and in northern cities in Estonia {{as a substitute for}} natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. Oil shale extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, reduced demand for electricity produced from oil shale, and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in oil shale mining. After decreasing for two decades, oil shale mining started to increase again {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E
