5|$|Ireland {{remained}} {{ruled by}} native kings into the 12th century, largely {{without the use}} of castles. There was a history of Irish fortifications called ráths, a type of ringfort, some of which were very heavily defended but which are not usually considered to be castles in the usual <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> The kings of Connacht constructed fortifications from 1124 which they called caistel or caislen, from the Latin and French for castle, and there has been considerable academic debate over how far these resembled European castles.|$|E
5|$|The Goth. sibja, OHG. sippia, sippa, AS. sib gen. sibbe, denote peace, friendship, kindred; {{from these}} I infer a divinity Sibja, Sippia, Sib, {{corresponding}} to ON. Sif gen. Sifjar, {{the wife of}} Thôrr, for the ON. too has a pl. sifjar meaning cognatio, sifi amicus (OHG. sippio, sippo), sift genus, cognatio. By this <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> Sif would appear to be, like Frigg and Freyja, a goddess of loveliness and love; as attributes of Oðinn and Thôrr agree, their wives Frigg and Sif have also a common signification.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{football}} managers in the modern <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> taking full charge of the team, rather than letting board members pick the side. As well as his tactical innovations, he was also a strong believer in physical fitness in football – he instituted a strict training regime and the use of physiotherapists and masseurs. He encouraged his players to openly discuss tactics and the game, instituting weekly team meetings at his clubs, and encouraged them to socialise in extra-curricular activities such as golf. He wrote regularly on football for the Sunday Express newspaper, and a collection of his writings was published after his death in a book, entitled Herbert Chapman on Football.|$|E

50|$|In construing statutes, and all written instruments, the {{grammatical}} {{and ordinary}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> {{is to be}} adhered to, unless {{that would lead to}} some absurdity or inconsistency with <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> may be modified, so as to avoid that absurdity or inconsistency, but not farther.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{etymology}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is {{not entirely}} clear. Several different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> have different histories or origins.|$|R
25|$|In the Romance languages, the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{had come}} to be {{extended}} to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century. At first called white or yellow amber (ambre jaune), this meaning was adopted in English by the early 15th century. As the use of ambergris waned, this became the main <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hysterectomy, in {{the literal}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> means merely {{removal of the}} uterus. However other organs such as ovaries, fallopian tubes and the cervix are very {{frequently}} removed {{as part of the}} surgery.|$|E

25|$|In most jurisdictions, {{physicians}} (in either <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word)</b> need government {{permission to}} practice. Such permission {{is intended to}} promote public safety, and often {{to protect the public}} purse, as medical care is commonly subsidized by national governments.|$|E
25|$|A {{signature}} for ordered fields {{needs an}} additional binary relation such as < or ≤, and therefore structures {{for such a}} signature are not algebras, {{even though they are}} of course algebraic structures in the usual, loose <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E

5000|$|However: other <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> -- <b>the</b> skin blemish, the breakwater, <b>the</b> unit <b>of</b> measure, and <b>the</b> Mexican sauce -- are homonyms, not polysems, as {{they are}} each {{etymologically}} distinct.|$|R
25|$|The Heavenly Doctrine {{also teaches}} that the Last Judgement was {{followed}} by the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, which occurred not by Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner, spiritual <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> through Swedenborg.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of domes, however, represents a wider <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> vault. The {{distinction between the}} two is that a vault is essentially an arch which is extruded into the third dimension, whereas a dome is an arch revolved around its vertical axis.|$|E

25|$|Balašević's concerts {{are known}} to last {{for more than four}} hours at a time.

25|$|Different ecclesiologies give {{shape to}} very {{different}} institutions.
