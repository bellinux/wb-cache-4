50|$|Originally {{nominated}} for the Best Actress award at the 2011 Grand Bell Awards {{for her role in}} Sunny, Shim complained publicly through her Twitter account when the awards committee removed her name from the official list of the nominees after she notified them she could not attend the event because she was currently studying in the U.S. She was one of four actors and actresses removed from the initial nomination. <b>Shim</b> <b>ended</b> up winning Best Supporting Actress for her role in Romantic Heaven; Chun Woo-hee, her castmate in Sunny, accepted the honor on Shimâ€™s behalf.|$|R
40|$|The {{procedure}} for automatically producing customized <b>end</b> <b>shims</b> for the Recycler Antiproton Storage Ring gradient magnets is described. Magnets were first {{measured with a}} harmonics probe. The observed field defects were then fed into a computer program (initially a spreadsheet) which generated the toolpath code for a numerically controlled milling machine which produced individually customized <b>end</b> <b>shims</b> that eliminated the measured defect. Field defects through decapole were corrected to an accuracy (limited by the reproducibility of the measurement apparatus) to a few x 10 - 5...|$|R

40|$|The model {{program for}} the LHC main dipoles is {{dedicated}} to the study and validation of design variants and assembly parameters to achieve reproducible performance and optimise components and assembly costs. The topics investigated in the last year include the material of the coil end spacers, the use of polyimide films from different manufacturers, the definition of optimum azimuthal and longitudinal coil pre-stress values, <b>shimming</b> of coil <b>ends,</b> collaring around the "cold bore" and different layouts of the yoke ends. This paper presents the main characteristics of such recent models, the results obtained during cold tests and the plans for the final phase of the model {{program for the}} LHC dipoles...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Tale of Shim Chong" [...] (Simcheongjeon). Made in 1985. Shin {{directed}} a musical {{version of this}} classic tale of filial piety. Shim Chong lives with her blind father. She sacrifices herself so that his blindness can be cured, so she is taken by merchant sailors. They toss her overboard and she goes down to the palace of the God of the Sea. She is put back on land inside of a giant floating orchid. She is found by the king, and they {{fall in love and}} are married. In the <b>end,</b> <b>Shim</b> Chong is reunited with her father, and he is healed of his blindness.|$|R
40|$|The Recycler Ring Gradient Magnets were {{designed}} with <b>end</b> <b>shims</b> which correct the field shape (harmonic components up to 10 -pole). A standard correction was employed {{at one end}} to correct the average properties. A variable correction was used {{at the other end}} to correct individual magnet variations during the fabrication process. Initial Recycler operation revealed that the quadrupole fields did not produce the desired tune. In part, this was due to the sextupole of the end-shim interacting with the curved orbit through the straight magnet. The standard end-shim was replaced on all regular cell gradient magnets. Details of these end corrections and the resulting successful modification of the lattice are described...|$|R
40|$|The ELENA {{bending magnet}} {{prototype}} shall {{prove that the}} proposed design meets the requirements set by the ELENA beam dynamics. The following points {{will be discussed in}} detail: (i) production process of a magnetic yoke diluted with stainless steel plates, (ii) the stability and repeatability of the field homogeneity of such a yoke over the full working range, (iii) choice of soft magnetic steel, (iv) hysteresis effects, (v) mechanical deformations, (vi) thermal insulation to intercept heat load from baking for activation of NEG coating in the vacuum chamber, (vii) <b>end</b> <b>shim</b> design. In order to verify these points the following measurements will be performed: (i) Hall probe scanning, (ii) integrated field homogeneity measurement (DC), (iii) integrated field homogeneity measurement (AC) ...|$|R
40|$|This note {{provides}} several {{analyses of}} the combined function bending magnets of the SESAME storage ring. The objective is to develop tools to couple the magnetic design to the linear optics specifications. Such tools {{can be used to}} carry out a 3 D field optimization, at the design phase and following magnetic measurements, in particular in order to fine tune the <b>end</b> <b>shims</b> on the poles. The analyses take as input field maps on the midplane, which are then processed in different ways to obtain linear transfer matrices for the optics, in the horizontal and vertical planes. Some peculiarities of this kind of magnet are also highlighted, for example, the slight variation of gradient along the arc. For convenience, the relative codes and scripts are included in the appendix...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that much of the field of the quadrupoles was outside the iron (in {{particular}} with the wide quadrupoles) and that thus the fields of quadrupoles and bending magnets interacted, the lattice properties of the AA could not be predicted with the required accuracy. After a first running period in 1980, during which detailed measurements were made with proton test beams, corrections to the quadrupoles were made in 1981, in the form of laminated <b>shims</b> at the <b>ends</b> of the poles, and with steel washers. With the latter ones, further refinements were made in an iterative procedure with measurements on the circulating beam. This eventually resulted, amongst other things, in a very low chromaticity, with the Q-values being constant to within +- 0. 001 over the total momentum range of 6 %. Here we see the shims and washers on a narrow qudrupole (QFN, QDN). See also 8103203, 8103204, 8103205, 8103206...|$|R
40|$|In era of NOvA operation, it {{is planned}} to slip-stack six on six Booster proton batches in the Recycler ring {{for a total}} {{intensity}} of 5 1013 protons/cycle. During the slip-stacking, the chromaticities are required to be jumped from (- 2,- 2) to (- 20,- 20). However, they can only be adjusted to (- 12,- 12) from (- 2,- 2) using existing 2 families of powered sextupoles. On the other hand, the presently designed Recycler lattice for Nova replaces the 30 straight section with 8 D-D half FODO cells. We use 3 quads in a half-cell to obtain the working point under the limit of the feasible quad strength, and the maximum beta-function in this section cannot be less than 80 m. In this paper, we re-designed the <b>end</b> <b>shims</b> of the permanent magnets in the ring lattice with appropriate quadrupole and sextupole components to meet both chromaticity and tune requirements. We are able to use 2 quads in a half cell in RR 30 straight section within feasible quad strength. The maximum beta-functions are also lowered to around 55 m. The dynamic aperture tracking has been done using MAD to simulate the scenario of beam injection into the Recycler ring for Nova.
