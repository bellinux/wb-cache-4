25|$|Double {{data rate}} {{synchronous}} {{dynamic random-access memory}} (DDR <b>SDRAM)</b> is a class of memory integrated circuits used in computers. DDR <b>SDRAM,</b> also called DDR1 <b>SDRAM,</b> has been superseded by DDR2 <b>SDRAM,</b> DDR3 <b>SDRAM</b> and DDR4 <b>SDRAM.</b> None of its successors are forward or backward compatible with DDR1 <b>SDRAM,</b> meaning DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 memory modules will not work in DDR1-equipped motherboards, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|DDR <b>SDRAM</b> modules for desktop computers, dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), have 184 pins (as {{opposed to}} 168 pins on <b>SDRAM,</b> or 240 pins on DDR2 <b>SDRAM),</b> {{and can be}} {{differentiated}} from <b>SDRAM</b> DIMMs {{by the number of}} notches (DDR <b>SDRAM</b> has one, <b>SDRAM</b> has two). DDR <b>SDRAM</b> for notebook computers, SO-DIMMs, have 200 pins, which is the same number of pins as DDR2 SO-DIMMs. These two specifications are notched very similarly and care must be taken during insertion if unsure of a correct match. Most DDR <b>SDRAM</b> operates at a voltage of 2.5V, compared to 3.3V for <b>SDRAM.</b> This can significantly reduce power consumption. Chips and modules with DDR-400/PC-3200 standard have a nominal voltage of 2.6V.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{virtually}} all <b>SDRAM</b> is manufactured {{in compliance with}} standards established by JEDEC, an electronics industry association that adopts open standards to facilitate interoperability of electronic components. JEDEC formally adopted its first <b>SDRAM</b> standard in 1993 and subsequently adopted other <b>SDRAM</b> standards, including those for DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 <b>SDRAM.</b>|$|E

25|$|Single {{data rate}} <b>SDRAM</b> {{has a single}} 10-bit {{programmable}} mode register. Later double-data-rate <b>SDRAM</b> standards add additional mode registers, addressed using the bank address pins. For SDR <b>SDRAM,</b> the bank address pins and address lines A10 and above are ignored, but should be zero during a mode register write.|$|E
25|$|In computing, DDR4 <b>SDRAM,</b> an {{abbreviation}} for double data rate fourth-generation synchronous dynamic random-access memory, {{is a type}} of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (<b>SDRAM)</b> with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface.|$|E
25|$|Finally, if CKE {{is lowered}} {{at the same}} time as an auto-refresh command is sent to the <b>SDRAM,</b> the <b>SDRAM</b> enters self-refresh mode. This is like power down, but the <b>SDRAM</b> uses an on-chip timer to {{generate}} internal refresh cycles as necessary. The clock may be stopped during this time. While self-refresh mode consumes slightly more power than power-down mode, it allows the memory controller to be disabled entirely, which commonly more than makes up the difference.|$|E

25|$|<b>SDRAM</b> {{is widely}} used in computers. Beyond the {{original}} <b>SDRAM,</b> further generations of double data rate RAM have entered the mass market DDR (also known as DDR1), DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4, with the latest generation (DDR4) released {{in the second half}} of 2014.|$|E
25|$|<b>SDRAM</b> latency is not {{inherently}} lower (faster) than asynchronous DRAM. Indeed, early <b>SDRAM</b> {{was somewhat}} slower than contemporaneous burst EDO DRAM {{due to the}} additional logic. The benefits of SDRAM's internal buffering come from its ability to interleave operations to multiple banks of memory, thereby increasing effective bandwidth.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 <b>SDRAM</b> over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 <b>SDRAM,</b> {{is its ability}} to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the memory clock speed (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per memory module, DDR3 <b>SDRAM</b> gives a transfer rate of (memory clock rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock frequency of 100MHz, DDR3 <b>SDRAM</b> gives a maximum transfer rate of 6400 MB/s.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of stuck bits in <b>SDRAMs</b> are studied. This effect is linear with fluence, and {{is due to}} reduction in RC time constant.

40|$|EM-Cube is a VLSI {{architecture}} for low-cost, {{high quality}} volume rendering at full video frame rates. Derived from the Cube- 4 architecture developed at SUNY at Stony Brook, EM-Cube computes sample points and gradients on-the-fly to project 3 -dimensional volume data onto 2 -dimensional images with realistic lighting and shading. A modest rendering {{system based on}} EM-Cube consists of a PCI card with four rendering chips (ASICs), four 64 Mbit <b>SDRAMs</b> to hold the volume data, and four SRAMs to capture the rendered image. The performance target for this configuration is to render images from a 256 ³ x 16 bit data set at 30 frames/sec. The EM-Cube architecture can be scaled to larger volume data-sets and/or higher frame rates by adding additional ASICs, <b>SDRAMs,</b> and SRAMs. This paper addresses three major challenges encountered developing EM-Cube into a practical product: exploiting the bandwidth inherent in the <b>SDRAMs</b> containing the volume data, keeping the pin-count between adjacent ASICs a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The ever {{increasing}} demand for bandwidth of computer-systems lead to several standards of <b>SDRAMs.</b> This article compares SDR, DDRI, DDRII, and RDRAM systems. Besides the overall basic innovations, differences will be discussed. Topics like architecture, interfaces, and modules are described. ...|$|R
25|$|With data being {{transferred}} 64 bits at a time, DDR <b>SDRAM</b> gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (memory bus clock rate) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100MHz, DDR <b>SDRAM</b> gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600MB/s.|$|E
25|$|Today, the world's largest {{manufacturers}} of <b>SDRAM</b> include: Samsung Electronics, Panasonic, Micron Technology, and Hynix.|$|E
25|$|Doing this in {{only two}} clock cycles {{requires}} careful coordination between the time the <b>SDRAM</b> takes to turn off its output on a clock edge and the time the data must be supplied as input to the <b>SDRAM</b> for the write on the following clock edge. If the clock frequency is too high to allow sufficient time, three cycles may be required.|$|E
2500|$|... "This {{comprehensive}} standard defines all required {{aspects of}} 64Mb through 1Gb DDR <b>SDRAMs</b> with X4/X8/X16 data interfaces, including features, functionality, ac and dc parametrics, packages and pin assignments. This scope will subsequently {{be expanded to}} formally apply to x32 devices, and higher density devices as well." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{command is}} similar to a {{combination}} of a conventional <b>SDRAM's</b> precharge and refresh commands. The POPx and BPx bits specify a precharge operation, while the ROPx, DELRx, and BRx bits specify a refresh operation. Each may be separately enabled. If enabled, each may have a different command delay and must be addressed to a different bank.|$|R
40|$|Many {{high-performance}} applications involve large {{data sets}} that {{are impossible to}} fit entirely within on-chip memories of even the largest FPGAs. As a result, they must be stored in off-chip <b>SDRAMs</b> and loaded onto the FPGAs as computations progress. Because of the high latency and energy consumption associated with off-chip memory accesses, {{it is important to}} develop efficient operation schedules that not only minimize latency of computations, but also the amount of data I/Os. We formulate this problem as a modified resource-constrained job scheduling problem. The problem is then solved using a list scheduling algorithm that takes advantage of the fast burst-mode access of <b>SDRAMs.</b> Results have shown that for large problem sizes, the performance of our algorithm is within 1 % of a hand-optimized matrix-matrix multiplication implementation, with no memory overhead, and is within 0. 03 % of the theoretical minimum latency of an 8 -by- 8 cofactor matrix computation. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to DDR, {{there were several}} other proposed memory technologies to succeed SDR <b>SDRAM.</b>|$|E
25|$|The package sizes {{in which}} DDR <b>SDRAM</b> is {{manufactured}} are also standardized by JEDEC.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>SDRAM</b> is idle (all banks precharged, no {{commands}} in progress) when CKE is lowered, the <b>SDRAM</b> automatically enters power-down mode, consuming minimal power until CKE {{is raised}} again. This must not {{last longer than}} the maximum refresh interval tREF, or memory contents may be lost. It is legal to stop the clock entirely during this time for additional power savings.|$|E
40|$|Intended for 533 MHz and 667 MHz {{applications}} • Inputs and outputs are SSTL 15 compatible • VDD = VDDQ = 1. 5 Volt ± 0. 075 Volt • <b>SDRAMs</b> have 8 internal {{banks for}} concurrent operation • Differential clock inputs • Data is read or written on both clock edges • 8 bit pre-fetch • Two different termination values (Rtt_Nom & Rtt_WR) • Extended operating temperature rage • Auto Self-Refresh option • Automatic and controlled precharge command...|$|R
5000|$|This {{operates}} equivalently {{to standard}} <b>SDRAM's</b> activate command, specifying a row address to be {{loaded into the}} bank's sense amplifier array. To save power, a chip may be configured to only activate {{a portion of the}} sense amplifier array. In this case, the SR1..0 bits specify the half or quarter of the row to activate, and following read/write commands' column addresses are required to be limited to that portion. (Refresh operations always use the full row.) ...|$|R
40|$|At GOMAC 2007, we {{discussed}} {{a selection of}} the challenges for radiation testing of modern semiconductor devices focusing on state-of-the-art memory technologies. This included FLASH non-volatile memories (NVMs) and synchronous dynamic random access memories (<b>SDRAMs).</b> In this presentation, we extend this discussion in device packaging and complexity as well as single event upset (SEU) mechanisms using several technology areas as examples including: system-on-a-chip (SOC) devices and photonic or fiber optic systems. The underlying goal is intended to provoke thought for understanding the limitations and interpretation of radiation testing results...|$|R
25|$|Later (double data rate) <b>SDRAM</b> {{standards}} {{use more}} mode register bits, and provide additional mode registers called Extended Mode registers. The register number is encoded {{on the bank}} address pins during the Load Mode Register command. For example, DDR2 <b>SDRAM</b> has a 13-bit Mode Register, a 13-bit Extended Mode Register #1 (EMR1), and a 5-bit Extended Mode Register #2 (EMR2).|$|E
25|$|Again, {{with every}} doubling, the {{downside}} is the increased latency. As with all DDR <b>SDRAM</b> generations, commands are still restricted to one clock edge and command latencies are given in terms of clock cycles, which are half {{the speed of the}} usually quoted transfer rate (a CAS latency of 8 with DDR3-800 is 8/(400MHz) = 20 ns, exactly the same latency of CAS2 on PC100 SDR <b>SDRAM).</b>|$|E
25|$|Originally simply {{known as}} <b>SDRAM,</b> single data rate <b>SDRAM</b> can accept one command and {{transfer}} {{one word of}} data per clock cycle. Typical clock frequencies are 100 and 133MHz. Chips are made {{with a variety of}} data bus sizes (most commonly 4, 8 or 16 bits), but chips are generally assembled into 168-pin DIMMs that read or write 64 (non-ECC) or 72 (ECC) bits at a time.|$|E
50|$|The a-Series has a 144-bit memory bus, with 128 bits {{used for}} data and 16 bits for ECC. There are three memory banks, each {{consisting}} of two DIMM slots, {{for a total of}} six DIMM slots, which supports 32 MB to 1.5 GB of memory. The a-Series uses proprietary 72-bit DIMMs with error correcting code (ECC) that are twice as tall as standard DIMMs and contain two rows of <b>SDRAMs</b> per a column instead of one. These DIMMs are installed in identical pairs in order to match the width of the memory bus.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 2004, {{based on}} the e300 core, an {{enhanced}} PowerPC 603e core, with 32/32 KiB instruction/data L1 caches. PowerQUICC II Pro is used as networking processors for routers, switches, printers, network-attached storage, wireless access points and DSLAMs. PowerQUICC II Pro processors reaches 677 MHz, and can include a multitude of embedded technologies like USB, PCI, Ethernet and security devices. They also use a newer QUICC Engine network offload engine instead of the CPM used in the original PowerQUICC I and PowerQUICC II series. The memory controller provides support for DDR and DDR2 <b>SDRAMs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Note: Memory {{bandwidth}} {{measures the}} throughput of memory, and is generally {{limited by the}} transfer rate, not latency. By interleaving access to <b>SDRAM's</b> multiple internal banks, {{it is possible to}} transfer data continuously at the peak transfer rate. It is possible for increased bandwidth to come at a cost in latency. In particular, each successive generation of DDR memory has higher transfer rates but the absolute latency does not change significantly, and especially when first appearing on the market, the new generation generally has longer latency that the previous one.|$|R
