The trailing edge was formed by two 2 in wide 1/32 in sheets forming a triangle with 1/8 to 3/8 in vertical spar sections in between the ribs. The covering was 1/2 mil Mylar.

40|$|AbstractMonitoring {{technique}} for detection of early {{damage in the}} wind turbine blade has been investigated using PVDF film sensor and strain gages. The trailing edge component with <b>shear</b> <b>web</b> was prepared by sectioning the full-scale blade with a box spa. Several PVDF film sensors with dimension of 10 x 10 x 0. 054 mm 3 and strain gages were installed on <b>shear</b> <b>web</b> and skin of the component and the behaviour of these sensors were examined under opening and closing loads. From the test, optimal location for detecting the occurrence of damage with static loading was investigated and sensitivity of the PVDF sensors location to the damage was examined. With increasing the applied load, several pop-ins happened up to final failure. The outputs of the PVDF film sensors under quasi-static loads showed the relatively insignificant magnitude and peaks corresponding to pop-ins. So, {{it is found that}} PVDF film sensors mounted on the trailing edge component give an early response remarkably to the damage occurrence irrespective to the closing and opening loads. Therefore, it can be said the PVDF film sensors may be significantly useful in detecting the instance of damage occurrence in the trailing edge component. Further, it can be recommended that the relatively good location of the PVDF sensor to detect the damage in the trailing edge component be the locations free to the geometrical constraint, like the center of spar web and the blade skin remote from the joint between the spa cap and the <b>shear</b> <b>web...</b>|$|R
50|$|The wings {{were swept}} back at 40° and were {{mounted in the}} mid-fuselage position. The wings appear to be mounted very far forward {{compared}} with most designs, a side-effect of attempting to keep the centre of pressure (CoP) of the wing as a whole {{as close to the}} middle of the fuselage as possible. Reflecting the dilemma of a shortage of strategic materials, the first option of using aluminum in the construction of the main spar consisting of two tapered I-beams attached together on the top and bottom with <b>shear</b> <b>webs</b> of thin steel sheeting, led to a reappraisal. Multhopp chose to use wood instead of metal throughout the wing structure, with wood structure ribs attached to the front and back of the I-beams to give the wing its overall shape, and then covered with plywood. The box-like structure contained six fuel cells, giving the aircraft a total fuel load of 1,565 l (413 US gal).|$|E

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} sources of power {{production}} in the world today. In order to extract the maximum potential amount of energy from the wind, a wind turbine 2 ̆ 7 s reliability must be a top priority. As utility scale wind turbines increase in size and initial capital investment cost, there also comes an increasing need to monitor the health of the turbine. Currently, most wind turbines do not incorporate blade mounted inertial sensing in addition to blade strain measurements. This approach has the potential to detect inevitable blade damage types early on so that a maintenance schedule can be optimized and the damage does not propagate to the point of blade failure or even damage to the drivetrain components. ^ In this thesis, the wind turbine blade 2 ̆ 7 s structural dynamic response is simulated and analyzed with the goal of characterizing the presence and severity of a <b>shear</b> <b>web</b> disbond. Computer models of a five megawatt (MW) offshore utility scale wind turbine were created to develop effective algorithms for detecting such damage. It was shown through data analysis that with the use of blade measurements, a <b>shear</b> <b>web</b> disbond could be quantified according to its length. An aerodynamic sensitivity study was conducted to ensure robustness of the developed detection algorithms. In all analyses, the measurements of the blade 2 ̆ 7 s flap-wise acceleration and root pitch- ing moment were the clearest indicators of the presence and severity of a <b>shear</b> <b>web</b> disbond. In fact, the RMS flap-wise blade tip acceleration decreased as much as 35...|$|R

40|$|A {{wind turbine}} blade {{generally}} has complex structures including {{several layers of}} composite materials with <b>shear</b> <b>webs,</b> making its structure design very challenging. In this paper, a structural optimisation model for wind turbine composite blades has been developed based on a parametric FEA (finite element analysis) model and a GA (genetic algorithm) model. The optimisation model minimises the mass of composite blades with multi-criteria constraints. The number of unidirectional plies, {{the locations of the}} spar cap and the thicknesses of <b>shear</b> <b>webs</b> are taken as design variables. The optimisation model takes account of five constraints, i. e. stress constraint, deformation constraint, vibration constraint, buckling constraint, and manufacturing manoeuvrability and continuity of laminate layups constraint. The model has been applied to the blade structural optimisation of ELECTRA 30 kW wind turbine, which is a novel VAWT (vertical-axis wind turbine) combining sails and V-shape arm. The mass of the optimised blade is 228 kg, which is 17. 4 % lower than the initial design, indicating the blade mass can be significantly reduced by using the present optimisation model. It is demonstrated that the structural optimisation model presented in this paper is capable of effectively and accurately determining the optimal structural layups of composite blades...|$|E
