5|$|On 25 May 1933, a {{passenger}} train was derailed at , London, {{coming to rest}} foul of an adjacent line. Locomotive No. 1618, hauling {{a passenger}} train, was in a side-long collision with it. Five {{people were killed and}} 35 were injured. The cause of the accident was the failure to implement a <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> on a section of track that was under maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The LZB system treats a red signal or the {{beginning}} of a block containing a train as a <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> of 0 speed. The driver will see the same sequence as approaching a <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> except the target speed is 0.|$|E
25|$|As {{the train}} {{approaches}} a <b>speed</b> <b>restriction,</b> {{such as one}} for a curve or turnout, LZB will sound a buzzer and display the distance to and speed of the restriction. As the train continues the target distance will decrease. As the train nears the <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> the permitted speed will start to decrease, ending up at the target speed at the restriction. At that point the display will change to the next target.|$|E

30|$|Turnouts on {{rail track}} have <b>speed</b> <b>restrictions</b> and the running trains must follow these restrictions.

25|$|On 7 March 1896, a {{passenger}} train was derailed at Little Bytham, Northamptonshire {{due to the}} premature removal of a <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> after track renewal. Two people were killed.|$|E
25|$|The fast {{lines were}} {{blocked by the}} {{derailment}} and the traction current to the slow lines was turned off to allow the rescue. Traction current was temporarily restored to the slow lines for the Tuesday morning rush hour and returned to traffic at 15:40 that afternoon. The fast lines were reopened with a <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> at 06:20 Wednesday morning.|$|E

A warning or commencement board showing a diagonal line means that a TSR shown in the operating notices is not in place and trains may proceed at normal line speed.|$|E
25|$|All six lines {{running through}} the station were closed {{including}} the undamaged slow lines to allow the injured access to ambulances that left from the goods yard. The slow lines reopened at 5:32am the following morning. The electric lines were used by cranes to remove the Liverpool locomotives and carriages and reopened 4:30am on 11 October. The fast lines were reopened, with a <b>speed</b> <b>restriction,</b> at 8:00pm on 12 October and a temporary footbridge was opened the same evening.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the rails}} used were flat-bottomed, 80lb per yard (90lb {{in areas where}} heavy wear was expected), spiked {{directly}} on to the sleepers of creosoted Baltic pine. Only the sharp curve at Shepherdswell had the rails bent to shape; elsewhere, short straight lengths were used on curves. Colonel Stephens obtained various job lots of rails from the salvage dump at Richborough Port, and these included 60lb rails which {{were used for the}} Wingham extension and the Richborough Port branch. The ballast used was colliery waste and ash. There was a universal <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> of 25mph.|$|E

25|$|In Germany {{the term}} Schnellstraße (expressway) refers to roads that allow higher speed traffic than is common on other roads. This in turn {{requires}} them to have dual carriageways in most cases. An exception is the 2+1 road system in some rural areas; these roads are {{also referred to as}} expressways (three lanes on a single carriageway where overtaking in a lane designated for oncoming traffic is prohibited, so that a <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> is not required to increase safety—they are generally built to a 100 or 120km/h traffic standard). This is based on the definition of expressways as having an increased amount of grade-separated sections. Technically a dual carriageway with central reservation is the legal foundation that no blanket speed limit exists—comparable to the German autobahn - but expressways are often given speed limit signs.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four {{coaches were}} built for {{push-pull}} operation on the suburban rail service including 5 built to Control Cars (6101–05, 6301–19). Originally {{used in conjunction}} with the 121 Class locomotives they were last used with 201 Class locomotives. There were a number of differences between the Irish push-pull Mark 3's and the standard Mark 3's. An underfloor generator, mounted in the Control Car, provided electrical power to the coaches; unlike on the standard Mark 3's, which used a special generator van. This single generator was not as powerful as the two used in the Mark 3 generator vans and was the main reason the sets were limited to 6 cars. Irish Mark 3 push-pull based rolling stock did not have air conditioning and had opening windows instead. There was also a 70mph <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> imposed on the train {{due to the fact that}} three of the Control Cars were fitted with LHB bogies from an 8100 Class DART. and were air-braked.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43 was incorrectly positioned.

These errors meant that the placing of the AWS magnet for the temporary <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> was also incorrect. Instead of being [...] from the fixed AWS magnet, the temporary AWS magnet for the <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> was only [...] from it. The installation of signal SN43 was in 1978, and the errors had remained undetected since then. An emergency <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> had been introduced in January 2015 due to {{the condition of the}} track, and had subsequently been converted to a temporary <b>speed</b> <b>restriction.</b> These errors were found not to have been contributory factors in the incident.|$|E

500|$|Due to misting and exhaust obstructing the driver's {{view through}} the window, the driver drove leaning {{out of the}} cab for much of the time. A side effect of this was that it made hearing the AWS sounder harder, as well as {{observation}} of a flashing light fitted in the cab to remind a driver of an AWS warning. Approaching signal SN43, there was a temporary <b>speed</b> <b>restriction</b> of , which was warned of by a temporary AWS magnet in advance of the restriction, and indicated by a sign {{at the start of the}} temporary <b>speed</b> <b>restriction.</b> The train approached signal SN43 at [...] and passed over the temporary AWS magnet.

500|$|On May 1, 1971, {{the newly}} formed Amtrak took over {{intercity}} passenger rail services from Penn Central and the other private railroads. The DOT contracted with GE and Westinghouse in June for a R project of further electrical modifications, with detailed plans made in July. On September 8, 1971, Amtrak completed purchase of its basic fleet, including 49 of the Metroliners. The twelve other Metroliner cars - likely including the 11 originally built for Harrisburg service - were leased from the Budd Company on that date. With most cars available for use, Amtrak increased frequencies on the profitable Metroliner service.
