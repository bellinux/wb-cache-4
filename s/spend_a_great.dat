2500|$|For {{cultures}} that produced pottery, archaeologists invariably <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{deal of time}} defining ceramic [...] "types." [...] Each type {{is a series of}} attributes which distinguishes one group of pottery (whether whole vessels or potsherds) from all other groups of pottery, such that each type was produced in a single time and place. Ideally, the attributes used to identify types are ones that are identifiable with the naked eye, and are found on small fragments of pottery, so that the sorting of potsherds into types is quick and straightforward. By sorting potsherds in terms of types, archaeologists can examine a series of potsherds (including those lying on a site surface) and quickly suggest when and where the pottery was made. By extension, they can estimate when a prehistoric site was used, whether there are any traded pieces, and so on.|$|E
