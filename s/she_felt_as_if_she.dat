[...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she began work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that she felt as if the songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song than her own.|$|E

Her first solo performance was a tribute to her late husband, skated to the 'Adagietto' section of Gustav Mahler's 'Symphony No. 5'. The number was publicly performed only twice, first at a preview performance at the Minto Skating Club in Ottawa Ontario, [...] and then on February 27, 1996, in a televised tribute to Grinkov, called [...] "Celebration of a Life", in which numerous skating luminaries took part. Gordeeva has said that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> skated with Sergei that night, that she was [...] "double strong" [...] because she felt him with her. The same year, {{with the aid of}} author E. M. Swift, she told her story in a book titled [...] In February 1998, CBS aired an eponymous docudrama based on the book. She published a second book in April 1998, titled A Letter for Daria. In 1998, she told an interviewer that [...] "My life of great skating, and skating with him, is over, ...

2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua {{played an important role in}} her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E
