40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an HMM-based {{approach}} to generating emotional intonation patterns. A set of models were built to represent syllable-length intonation units. In a classification framework, the models {{were able to}} detect a sequence of intonation units from raw fundamental frequency values. Using the models in a generative framework, {{we were able to}} synthesize smooth and natural <b>sounding</b> pitch <b>contours.</b> As a case study for emotional intonation generation, Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR) adaptation was used to transform the neutral model parameters {{with a small amount of}} happy and sad speech data. Perceptual tests showed that listeners could identify the speech with the sad intonation 80 % of the time. On the other hand, listeners formed a bimodal distribution in their ability to detect the system generated happy intontation and on average listeners were able to detect happy intonation only 46 % of the time. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} generating a range of natural <b>sounding</b> pitch <b>contours</b> for speech synthesis to convey the specific meanings of different intonation patterns. Where other models can synthesise intonation adequately for short sentences, longer sentences often sound unnatural as phrasing is only really considered at the sentence level. We build models within a framework of prosodic structure derived from the linguistic analysis of a corpus of speech. We show {{that the use of}} appropriate prosodic structure allows us to produce better contours for longer sentences and allows us to capture the original style of the corpus. The resulting model is also sufficiently flexible to be adapted to suitable styles for use in other domains. To convey specific meanings {{we need to be able}} to generate different accent types. We find that the infrequency of some accent and boundary types makes them hard to model from the corpus alone. We address this issue by developing a model which allows us to isolate the parameters which control specific accent type shapes, so that we can reestimate these parameters based on other data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence for}} a path to multi-word combinations that differs from the generally acknowledged sequence: single words, successive single words, two-word combinations, longer constructions. The assumption {{has been that the}} major skill that a child needs to develop is how to produce one word and then follow it with another, incorporating both words in a single contour (Dore et al 1976, Branigan & Stokes 1981). However, a more detailed list of skills needed to combine words syntactically includes: 1) understanding the conventional nature of words; 2) learning a minimal number of conventionalized lexemes (both comprehension and production); 3) understanding the utility of verbal communication and several of its functions; 4) sufficient articulatory skill to allow the distinction at least some of these lexical items, although there will be transient homonymy; 5) the ability to produce coherent multisyllabic strings; 6) the ability to produce different prosodic contours. These skills eventually converge in the incorporation of two or more morphemes within a single intonational contour. In longitudinal data for one child we find a more convoluted path: there is a period of 1 - 2 months in which he produces multi-syllabic utterances with adult <b>sounding</b> <b>contours</b> that incorporate marginally identifiable adult words. We call these Gestalts after Peters 1977, 1983. On a 15 -minute tape at 1; 5. 06 he produces 22 different lexical items along with 10 "gestalty" utterances, all with conversational intonation. The longest is 11 syllables; five contain possible words or phrases: dontcha know, xx shoes on, a gonna fit'chu, xx a went away. A month later, during a half-hour at 1; 6. 07 he produces 40 different lexical items and 14 possible Gestalts, of which 12 seem to contain identifiable words or phrases, none of which he is "combining" in a conventional way. This phenomenon is noteworthy because, although not all children take this particular path, it is probably not confined to one child. It is all too easy to ignore Gestalts, both because we haven't expected them, and because there are neither tools nor theoretical frameworks for dealing with them. In the process of audiolinking and adding phonetics to a transcript at 18 months - one we had thought was completely analyzed - we heard a number of Gestalts not previously noticed. One of us had an analogous experience many years ago listening to a Norwegian colleague's phonetic transcriptions: she had noticed some extraneous uninterpretable vowels that she merely noted as V. From these and similar vowels in other languages we developed the notion of Filler Syllables (Peters 2001) Once a framework had been developed for Fillers they have been observed in many languages. It is now time to create an analytical framework for Gestalts and to look for them more widely. This talk will present audio examples of Gestalts, discuss how they change as more combinatorial language emerges, and explore how they could have been influenced by the input...|$|R

40|$|A new {{nonvolatile}} nanoionic switch {{is powered}} and controlled through wireless radio-frequency (RF) transmission. A {{thin layer of}} chalcogenide glass doped with a metal ion, such as silver, comprises the operational portion of the switch. For the switch to function, an oxidizable electrode is made positive (anode) with respect to an opposing electrode (cathode) when sufficient bias, typically {{on the order of}} a few tenths of a volt or more, is applied. This action causes the metal ions to flow toward the cathode through a coordinated hopping mechanism. At the cathode, a reduction reaction occurs to form a metal deposit. This metal deposit creates a conductive path that bridges the gap between electrodes to turn the switch on. Once this conductive path is formed, no further power is required to maintain it. To reverse this process, the metal deposit is made positive with respect to the original oxidizable electrode, causing the dissolution of the metal bridge thereby turning the switch off. Once the metal deposit has been completely dissolved, the process self-terminates. This switching process features the following attributes. It requires very little to change states (i. e., on and off). Furthermore, no power is required to maintain the states; hence, the state of the switch is nonvolatile. Because of these attributes the integration of a rectenna to provide the necessary power and control is unique to this embodiment. A rectenna, or rectifying antenna, generates DC power from an incident RF signal. The low voltages and power required for the nanoionic switch control are easily generated from this system and provide the switch with a novel capability to be operated and powered from an external wireless device. In one realization, an RF signal of a specific frequency can be used to set the switch into an off state, while another frequency can be used to set the switch to an on state. The wireless, miniaturized, and nomoving- part features of this switch make it suitable for applications such as integration into garments, RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags, and conformal structures (e. g., aircraft wings, <b>sounding</b> rockets <b>contours,</b> etc). In the case of RFID tags the innovation will provide countermeasures to attempts for identity theft and other uninvited attempts for retrieval of information. It could also be applicable to the automotive industry as well as the aerospace industry for collision avoidance and phased array radar systems, respectivel...|$|R
40|$|During the {{beginning}} of 2000 a grid model representing the bathymetry of the Arctic Ocean was released for public use via a web page hosted by the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). The data set is a first beta version compiled {{under the auspices of}} the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) [Jakobsson et al., 2000]. Since the release of the bathymetry grid the IBCAO web page have had an average of 700 visitors per week and the data have been widely used within various GIS applications. To construct the IBCAO grid, several vintages of public-domain observations were extracted from world and national data centers, and complemented by newly released measurements that were collected by US and British submarines operating beneath the permanent polar pack from 1958 to 1988. These were further enhanced by original observations that were collected in recent years by US Navy submarines during unclassified SCICEX missions from 1993 to 1999, and by Swedish and German icebreakers from 1990 to 1997. The sum of these digital holdings represented a substantial quantity of information, but their geographical distribution was not uniform, therefore in several areas, additional depth values in the form of point <b>soundings</b> or bathymetric <b>contours</b> were derived from charts and maps published by Russian and US agencies. In combining these data in order to create a regularly space grid containing bathymetric values we were forced to use a complex interpolation scheme due to the sparseness and irregularity of the input data points. Consequently, we are now faced with the difficult task of assessing the confidence that we can assign to the final grid product, a task that is not usually addressed in most bathymetric compilations. This has important implications on use of the gridded bathymetry, especially when it is used for generating further scientific interpretations. We approach the problem of assessing the confidence via a direct-simulation Monte Carlo method. We have started with a small subset from the grid model. The test dataset shows examples of all of the data types included in the entire compilation. From this database, we assign a priori error variances based on available meta-data, and when this is not available, based on a worst-case scenario in an essentially heuristic manner. We then generate a number of synthetic datasets by randomly perturbing the base data using normally distributed random variates, scaled according to the predicted error model. These datasets are next re-gridded using the same methodology as the original product, generating a set of plausible grid models of the regional bathymetry that we can use for standard error estimates. Finally, we repeat the entire random estimation process and analyze each run 2 ̆ 7 s standard error grids in order to examine sampling bias and variance in the predictions. The final products of the estimation are a collection of standard error grids at different resolutions, a measurement of estimation reliability, and an overall assessment of gridding algorithm stability as a function of grid resolution. Our goal is to use this approach for an error estimation of the entire IBCAO grid and to offer the results to the scientific community for use while interpreting the bathymetry of the Arctic Ocean as portrayed by the IBCAO grid...|$|R
