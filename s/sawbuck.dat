50|$|Vendors of tornado shelters, {{answering}} service and small gift items {{are among the}} cluster of businesses found {{at the intersection of}} the two major highways in El Paso. Many commuters typically pass through the small community, prompting the construction of, among other things, <b>Sawbucks,</b> a very popular family eating establishment, and a McDonald's restaurant since the late 1990s. El Paso also is the home of Rafter R Logistics, LLC and R & R Transportation Solutions, LLC.Most notably is the new CrossRoads Cowboy Church and 2 bar 2 Arena.|$|R
60|$|She {{rose to a}} {{radiance}} of sun on snow. Snug in her furs she trotted up-town. Frosted shingles smoked {{against a}} sky colored like flax-blossoms, sleigh-bells clinked, shouts of greeting were loud in the thin bright air, and everywhere was a rhythmic sound of wood-sawing. It was Saturday, and the neighbors' sons were getting up the winter fuel. Behind walls of corded wood in back yards their <b>sawbucks</b> stood in depressions scattered with canary-yellow flakes of sawdust. The frames of their buck-saws were cherry-red, the blades blued steel, and the fresh cut ends of the sticks--poplar, maple, iron-wood, birch--were marked with engraved rings of growth. The boys wore shoe-packs, blue flannel shirts with enormous pearl buttons, and mackinaws of crimson, lemon yellow, and foxy brown.|$|R
5000|$|Henry Hill, Jr. {{was born}} on June 11, 1943, to Henry Hill, Sr., an {{immigrant}} Irish-American electrician, and Carmela Costa Hill, a Sicilian-American. The working-class family consisted of Henry and his eight siblings {{who grew up in}} Brownsville, a poorer area of the East New York section of Brooklyn. From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized across the street from his home, including Paul Vario, a capo in the Lucchese crime family. In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand across the street looking for a part-time after-school job. In his early teens, he began running errands for patrons of Vario's storefront shoeshine, pizzeria, and dispatch cabstand. He first met the notorious hijacker and Lucchese family associate James [...] "Jimmy the Gent" [...] Burke in 1956. The 13-year-old Hill served drinks and sandwiches at a card game and was dazzled by Burke's openhanded tipping. [...] "He was <b>sawbucking</b> me to death. Twenty here. Twenty there. He wasn't like anyone else I had ever met." ...|$|R
60|$|Carl {{invented a}} game in which he was to run in circles, but not step on the grass; he made the tenth {{inspection}} that day of the drying hazelnuts whose husks were turning to seal-brown on the woodshed roof; he hunted for a good new bottle to throw at Irving Lamb's barn; he mended his sling-shot; he perched on a <b>sawbuck</b> and watched the street. Nothing passed, nothing made an interesting rattling, except one democrat wagon.|$|E
6000|$|Mose laid aside hat and coat, {{and as the}} six pack horses approached, {{seized the}} one {{intended}} for him. Catching the saddle blanket up by the corners, he shook it straight, folded it once, twice--and threw it to the horse. The <b>sawbuck</b> followed it, the cinch flying high so that it should go clear. A tug, a grunt from the horse, and the saddle was on. Unwinding the sling ropes, he made his loops, and end-packed the box. Against it he put both flour and beans. Folding the tent square he laid it between. On this he set the stove, and packing the smaller bags around it, threw on the mantle. As he laid the hitch and began {{to go around the}} pack, the crowd began to cheer: ...|$|E
60|$|Cynthia {{came to the}} doors. One {{of these}} was open now--both had been closed that other evening against the storm of sleet--and she {{caught a glimpse of}} him {{standing}} on the floor of chips and bark--tan-bark no more. Cynthia caught a glimpse of him, and love suddenly welled up into her heart as waters into a spring after a drought. He had not seen her, not heard the sound of the sleigh-bells. He was standing with his foot upon the <b>sawbuck</b> and the saw across his knee, he was staring at the woodpile, and there was stamped upon his face a look which no man or woman had ever seen there, a look of utter loneliness and desolation, a look as of a soul condemned to wander forever through the infinite, cold spaces between the worlds--alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} I {{could make you}} governor, Mr. Crewe," [...] Mr. Tooting was saying. [...] "Say, {{why do you think}} the Northeastern crowd--why do you think Hilary Vane is pushing your bills down the sidings? I'll tell you, because they know you're a man of ability, and they're afraid of you, and they know you're a gentleman, and can't be trusted with their deals, so they just shunted you off at Kodunk with a jolly about sendin' you to Congress if you made a hit on a {{national}} speech. I've been in the business a good many years, and I've seen and done some things for the Northeastern that stick in my throat"--(at this point Victoria sat down again and gripped the arms of her chair), [...] "I don't like to see a decent man <b>sawbucked</b> the way they're teeterin' you, Mr. Crewe. I know what I'm talkin' about, and I tell you that Ridout and Jake Botcher and Brush Bascom haven't any more notion of lettin' your bills out of committee than they have Gaylord's. Why? Because they've got orders not to." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{may be as}} {{well here}} as {{elsewhere}} to state two things connected with all movements of the Army of the Potomac: first, in every change of position or halt for the night, whether confronting the enemy or not, the moment arms were stacked the men intrenched themselves. For this purpose they would build up piles of logs or rails {{if they could be}} found in their front, and dig a ditch, throwing the dirt forward on the timber. Thus the digging they did counted in making a depression to stand in, and increased the elevation in front of them. It was wonderful how quickly they could in this way construct defences of considerable strength. When a halt was made with the view of assaulting the enemy, or in his presence, these would be strengthened or their positions changed under the direction of engineer officers. The second was, the use made of the telegraph and signal corps. Nothing could be more complete than the organization and discipline of this body of brave and intelligent men. Insulated wires--insulated so that they would transmit messages in a storm, on the ground or under water--were wound upon reels, making about two hundred pounds weight of wire to each reel. Two men and one mule were detailed to each reel. The pack-saddle on which this was carried was provided with a rack like a <b>sawbuck</b> placed crosswise of the saddle, and raised above it so that the reel, with its wire, would revolve freely. There was a wagon, supplied with a telegraph operator, battery and telegraph instruments for each division, each corps, each army, and one for my headquarters. There were wagons also loaded with light poles, about the size and length of a wall tent pole, supplied with an iron spike in one end, used to hold the wires up when laid, so that wagons and artillery would not run over them. The mules thus loaded were assigned to brigades, and always kept with the command they were assigned to. The operators were also assigned to particular headquarters, and never changed except by special orders.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>sawbuck</b> is {{very simple}} to build. The five [...] "V" [...] <b>sawbuck</b> was {{designed}} with 10 vertical 4 ft 2×4s, and four horizontal, 5 ft 2×6s, secured with 3.5 in wood screws. It was designed this way in order to cut two or more smaller pieces (2 - 4 ft in length) of firewood in rapid succession. A <b>sawbuck</b> should be heavy enough to negate any kickback from the saw while cutting. Building a <b>sawbuck</b> that is too light could result in injury as it may tip over while cutting, especially with a chainsaw.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 <b>Sawbuck</b> raised $2 {{million in}} venture {{financing}} led by Dallas-based media company A. H. Belo Corp.. In 2012 <b>Sawbuck</b> raised an additional $2 million round of funding, led by Washington DC real estate investor Robert Stewart.|$|E
