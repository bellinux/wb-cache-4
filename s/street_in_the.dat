5|$|The Second Avenue Subway (SAS), {{a planned}} line {{going back to}} the late 1910s, was to be {{constructed}} from Water <b>Street</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battery to East 180th <b>Street</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bronx. The line was to be completed in three phases. The first phase, Route 132–A would have built the line from 34th Street to 126th Street, with connections to the 63rd Street Tunnel. The next phase, Route 132–B would continue the line farther north to East 180th <b>Street</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bronx, and this phase would connect with three existing lines. The final phase, Route 132–C would extend south from 34th Street to Bridge and Water Streets near the Battery. The SAS was prioritized due to overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, which was the only remaining rapid transit service on the east side in Midtown and Upper Manhattan. The Upper Manhattan portion of the Second Avenue line, from 63rd Street in Manhattan to 138th <b>Street</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bronx (near the current Third Avenue–138th Street station), would be built as two tracks. Stops for the SAS were proposed at Broad, Houston, 34th, 48th, 57th, 86th, 106th, and 125th Streets. Originally, Upper East Side residents complained about the lack of stations at 72nd and 96th Streets; while the 72nd Street station was later inserted into the SAS's construction plan, the 96th Street station did not get added.|$|E
