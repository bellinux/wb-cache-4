[...] The king Sancho VII of Navarre the Strong changed his coat of arms, commemorating {{the victory of the}} battle of Navas de Tolosa, waged on July 16, 1212, where he and his knights of Navarre defeated the stockade composed of the Black Guard, that chained together formed the human defense of the almohade caliph Mohammed al-Nasir, well known as Miramamolin. He changed his coats of arms from an eagle in sable (black) to a <b>shield</b> <b>ground</b> in gules (red) and put a chain of gold (yellow) of eight links and added one emerald (green) in its center. The chain represents the stockade composed of the Black Guard and the emerald symbolizes the caliph, known by his nickname the Green. His cousin Iñigo Ortiz de Stunica, II count of Marañón, lord of Stunica, Mendavía and others towns, who participated with his son Diego in the defeat of the stockade, made by the Black Guard, changed his coats of arms as well, adding a chain of gold (yellow) of eight links as border. As well other knights of Navarre, who participated in the defeat of the stockade, added the chain on their coats of arms, they were named Ramón de Peralta, Rodrigo Navarro, Ortun Diaz Urbina, Pedro Maza and Iñigo de Mendoza.Iñigo Ortiz de Stunica’s son Diego López de Stunica changed in 1270 the coats of arms of his lineage again as a sign of grief due to the death of king Saint Louis IX of France and king Theobald II of Navarre, {{who took part in the}} crusade called by pope Clement IV.The coat of arms of the Zúñiga lineage since this time is: <b>shield</b> <b>ground</b> in silver (white), a band of sable (black) and a gold (yellow) chain of eight links as a border.|$|E
50|$|A {{major part}} of the study is {{developing}} jetliner and engine designs that can meet the SAI objectives. The favoured configuration is a blended wing design, with the engines located on the upper surface of the wing, to <b>shield</b> <b>ground</b> observers from the engine noise. A very low specific thrust (i.e. very high bypass ratio) turbofan is proposed for the aircraft. Engine handling and low jet noise are facilitated by the use of a variable area final nozzle, to rematch the fan. Acoustic treatment in the intake and exhaust ducting minimizes turbomachinery noise. Because the blended wing is too shallow to accommodate twin engines, a four-engine configuration is proposed.|$|E

On high-current circuits the shields might be connected only at one end.

40|$|Abstract—A novel slow-wave {{transmission}} line with optimized slot-type floating shields in advanced CMOS technology is pre-sented. Periodical slot-type floating shields are inserted beneath the {{transmission line}} to provide substrate shielding and to shorten the electromagnetic (EM) propagation wavelength. This is the first study that demonstrates how the wavelength, attenuation loss, and characteristic impedance can be adjusted by changing the strip length (SL), strip spacing (SS), and metal layer position of the slot-type floating shields. Wavelength shortening needs to be achieved with a tradeoff between slow-wave effect and attenuation loss. The slot-type floating shields with different SLs, SSs and metal layer positions are analyzed. It is concluded that minimum SL provides the most optimal result. A design guideline can be established to enable circuit designers to reach the most appropriate slot-type floating shields for optimal circuit performance. Transmission line test structures were fabricated by using 45 -nm CMOS process technology. Both measurement and EM waves simulation were performed up to 50 GHz. Transmission lines are frequently used at a length of half- or quarter-wavelength. With a shortened wave-length, a saving in silicon area of more than 67 % {{can be achieved by}} using optimized slot-type floating shields. Experimental results demonstrated a higher effective relative permittivity value, which is improved by a factor of more than 9, and a better quality factor, which is improved by a factor of more than 6, as compared to conventional transmission lines.
