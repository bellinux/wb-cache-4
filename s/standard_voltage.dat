25|$|The Altair bus {{consists}} of the pins of the Intel 8080 run out onto the backplane. No particular level of thought went into the design, which led to such disasters as shorting from various power lines of differing voltages being located next to each other. Another oddity was that the system included two unidirectional 8-bit data buses, but only a single bidirectional 16-bit address bus.

40|$|Although primary {{metrology}} laboratories use standards {{based on}} the Josephson effect to maintain a local reference <b>standard</b> for dc <b>voltage,</b> artefact <b>standards</b> are still the standard of choice in many secondary laboratories. The National Metrology Laboratory, Dublin maintains a local reference <b>standard</b> for dc <b>voltage</b> {{by means of an}} ensemble of Zener-diode based electronic <b>voltage</b> <b>standard</b> units. Electronic <b>voltage</b> <b>standards</b> have a number of shortcomings over Josephson standards for use as a local reference standard. In particular their output voltages are influenced by several external factors. In order to make optimum use of the NML reference standard {{it is important that the}} output voltage of individual units be characterised for the effects of these influence factors so that appropriate corrections can be applied. This thesis describes techniques and procedures used to characterise the effects of time and pressure on electronic <b>voltage</b> <b>standards</b> and reports the results obtained for the devices used at NML. The methods of analysis, which can be applied to the results of interlaboratory comparisons in order to quantify the temporal characteristics of electronic <b>voltage</b> <b>standards,</b> are discussed. The temporal regression parameters and associated uncertainties, which were estimated for all the NML units, are presented and the use of within-group comparisons as a means of surveying the behaviour of individual units is illustrated. An experimental set-up suitable for the measurement of the pressure coefficients of electronic <b>voltage</b> <b>standards</b> is described. The design and development of important aspects of this set-up, including the test chamber, they systems used to control and monitor temperature and pressure, and the data acquisition and analysis program are described.

50|$|The {{transformer}} patents described {{two basic}} principles. Loads {{were to be}} connected in parallel, not in series as had been the general practice until 1885.

The parallel connection and efficient closed core made construction of electrical distribution systems technically and economically feasible.|$|R
