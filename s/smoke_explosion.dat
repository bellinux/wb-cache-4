Traditionally, black, dense smoke was considered particularly dangerous, but history shows this to be an unreliable indicator.

50|$|Ventilation {{is a part}} of {{structural}} firefighting tactics, and involves the expulsion of heat and smoke from a fire building, permitting the firefighters to more easily and safely find trapped individuals and attack the fire. If a large fire is not properly ventilated, not only will it be much harder to fight, but it could also build up enough poorly burned smoke to create a <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion,</b> or enough heat to create a flashover. Contrarily, poorly placed or timed ventilation may increase the fire's air supply, causing it to grow and spread rapidly. The flashover may cause the temperature inside the building to peak at over 1000 °C (1850 °F).|$|E
40|$|A <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion</b> is {{generally}} considered as a deflagration of the accumulated unburned fuel inside a closed compartment. However, the term <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion</b> has been widely misused for decades {{with a great deal}} of confusion, and very little research has been done towards this topic. The purpose of this research is to study the <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion</b> phenomenon in much more detail through the development of a fire scenario under various experimental conditions including ventilation size, fuel elevation and fuel mass, so that a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon can be achieved. A total of twenty experiments are carried out including both exploratory and final experiments. Thirteen experiments result in smoke explosions, among which there are five experiments result in more than one <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion.</b> A phenomenon referred as smoldering decay is observed in all experiments with smoke explosions, making it one of the precursors of the <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion</b> phenomenon. The smoldering decay is often indicated by an exponential decay of the temperature and is caused by the low oxygen concentration within the compartment. Based on the analysis, it is found that the vent size must be at least 50 mm in diameter in order for smoke explosions to occur. The fuel elevation has no influence on the occurrence of the <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion.</b> However when the fuel is placed near the ceiling, the temperature, the mass flow rate and the heat release rate are all lowered significantly. The size of the fuel also has no significant influence except for the duration of the experiment. The concentration of CO is scattered in the range of 1. 9 % and 4. 3 % when explosions occur. Hence, the accumulation of CO is considered not to be the direct cause for the <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion.</b> The triggering factor for smoke explosions is believed to be the flammable limit formed by the mixture of hydrocarbon and CO. The pressure difference caused by the explosion inside the compartment has to be at least 27 Pa for it to be considered as a <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractCompartment {{fires are}} {{commonly}} {{discussed in the}} classical sense with the compartment fire growth history starting with the incipient phase leading into the growth phase that transition through flashover into the fully developed phase and ends in the decay phase. However, when a fire starts in a closed compartment where only ventilation is the leakage available, the fire can start to smolder and produce large quantities of CO and unburned hydrocarbons. These products of incomplete combustion accumulate in the compartment and create an extremely hazardous condition. If the conditions are right and a large vent becomes available, such as a fire fighter opening a door, a rapidly developing flame front spreads through the enclosure burning the available fuel that has mixed with the incoming air, culminating in a large fireball outside the opening. This catastrophic event is known to fire fighters as a backdraft and by definition requires a sudden change it the ventilation. Anecdotal evidence supports a different phenomenon in which a closed compartment suddenly erupts in flames breaking glass and even causing structural damage without a vent ever being open. This phenomenon is referred to here as a <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion.</b> Recent work has focused on improving our understanding of these poorly understood events and the conditions that precede them. A series of small scale experiments have been conducted burning a timber crib inside an enclosure with tightly controlled ventilation. Under certain fire conditions, the compartment will suddenly erupt, ejecting smoke and flames from the small openings in the compartment. This paper describes the experimental results from the <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion</b> research and compares the <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion</b> to the more familiar phenomena known as backdraft...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} the conditions that exist in a typical residential compartment fire when subject to limited ventilation. Emphasis was on the conditions that leads to a backdraft from natural fuel and the circumstances prior to a <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion.</b> Also included within this report is a comparison of the results with those expected from CFAST, a computer zone model. The first phase of the project was to design a full scale apparatus to safely carry out the experiments. The second phase consisted of seven experiments with variations in ventilation size and location, and fuel elevation. The fuel used was timber cribs that provided a fuel load density of 340 MJ/m². Temperatures, mass loss, pressures and O₂ concentration within the compartment were monitored. The areas used to represent leakage ranged from 0. 0154 m² to 0. 0079 m². Ventilation was modelled using two horizontal circular vents located at lowest and highest practical points. In each experiment the vent at the bottom was twice the area of that at the top. Under the conditions experimented no backdraft occurred. During one experiment (number 6) a <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion</b> occurred that caused an instantaneous temperature rise of 140 °K and pressure increase of 30 Pa. Further research in this phenomena is required. Comparisons made with CFAST indicate that it is inadequate in coping with limited ventilation fires in a single compartment situation...|$|E

40|$|Fourteen {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} University of Canterbury using a 1. 0 m x 1. 0 m x 1. 5 m compartment with liquid pool fires. They were conducted to experimentally study, in reduced scale, the conditions that exist in under-ventilated compartments, {{with a focus on}} smoke explosions. Ventilation into the compartment was controlled to force the fire to burn to extinction, with the temperatures and fuel mass loss rates being recorded. In the process of determining these conditions, the behavioural properties of various building materials and their limitations showed testament to the difficulties that arise when attempting to control a natural energy. Trying to build a compartment to contain fires of temperatures up to 1100 °C, was in itself a testing process. The initial fire resistant building materials used, were found to have adverse effects when repeatedly exposed to fires. Although a <b>smoke</b> <b>explosion</b> was not produced, steady state mass loss values for various ventilation openings were found. These were then used to produce a very good ventilation dependent mass loss trend line. The point of extinction of these fires was found, which will be of use in further research. The fires conducted in the {{experiments were}} supplied with minimal oxygen, and all produced excessive quantities of unburnt fuel. This was due to the generation of pyrolyzates {{as a result of the}} radiative feedback off the compartment walls, diffusion flame and gas layer. The fire initially burns in the pan, until all oxygen within the compartment has been depleted. At this point the combustion transfers from inside the pan, to burn in the localised vicinity around the pan where oxygen is able to penetrate. The combustion then progresses through a transition stage, in which the flame front moves from the rear of the compartment, to the front. This involves a period where the flames oscillates backwards and forwards from the vent. Steady state burning occurs continuously within the vent. Once steady state burning in the vent is achieved, no degree of ventilation reduction, except full sealed closure, would result in extinction of the fire. A fire occurring at this stage is fully fuelled from the volatilisation of the liquid pool at the rear of the compartment. The mass loss of fuel due to this type of burning is found to be well in excess of that available to ventilation controlled stoichiometric burning. The neutral plane layer was found to be located at approximately the mid-height of the opening and little effect is seen on the location of the neutral plane layer at these low ventilation limits...|$|E

Given a three-dimensional scene description, we utilize sampling and spatio-temporal clustering techniques to generate a concise overview of the achievable variations and their temporal evolution. Our visualization system then allows the user to explore the simulation space in a goal-oriented manner.
