MethodsA total of 18, 049 lung resections for non–small cell lung cancer were entered into the French national database Epithor. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Two independent analyses were performed with comorbidity variables. The first analysis included variables as independent predictive binary comorbidities (model 1). The second analysis included the number of comorbidities per patient (model 2). ResultsIn model 1 predictors for mortality were age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, performance status, forced expiratory volume (as a percentage), body mass index (in kilograms per meter squared), <b>side,</b> <b>type</b> of lung resection,extended resection, stage, chronic bronchitis, cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, alcoholism, history of malignant disease, and prior thoracic surgery. In model 2 predictors were age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, performance status, forced expiratory volume, body mass index, <b>side,</b> <b>type</b> of lung resection, extended resection, stage, and number of comorbidities per patient. Models 1 and 2 were well calibrated, with a slope correction factor of 0. 96 and of 0. 972, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0. 784 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 76 – 0. 8) in model 1 and 0. 78 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 76 – 0. 797) in model 2.

In this study, patients who had undergone unilateral (15 right and 15 left) temporal lobectomy (TL) for the relief of epilepsy and 15 control subjects completed a range of public and autobiographical memory tests. Deficits in recall and recognition of details related to past famous world events were observed for both left and right TL groups. In addition, the left TL group showed impaired retrieval of famous names and TL patients as a group generated significantly fewer names of people from their own past. Current seizure- and medication-status influenced performance on a few measures, but duration of epilepsy and age of onset had no significant impact. Underlying cognitive deficits (especially naming ability) contributed to, but could not completely explain difficulties remembering the past. In particular, deficits in the ability to retrieve highly specific information learned in the past, such as names of famous people or details about famous events, remained evident in analyses that controlled for the impact of related cognitive skills. 14 page(s...|$|E

Methods: We have analyzed baseline data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. Four hundred twenty-two patients with a diagnosis of PD confirmed by DaTSCAN imaging were divided into 4 groups according to age at onset (onset younger than 50 years, 50 – 59 years, 60 – 69 years, and 70 years or older) and investigated for differences in <b>side,</b> <b>type</b> and localization of symptoms, occurrence/severity of motor and nonmotor features, nigrostriatal function, and CSF biomarkers. Results: Older age at onset {{was associated with a}} more severe motor and nonmotor phenotype, a greater dopaminergic dysfunction on DaTSCAN, and reduction of CSF α-synuclein and total tau. The most common presentation was the combination of 2 or 3 motor symptoms (bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity) with rigidity being more common in the young-onset group. In about 80 % of the patients with localized onset, the arm was the most affected part of the body, with no difference across subgroups. Conclusions: Although the presentation of PD symptoms is similar across age subgroups, the severity of motor and nonmotor features, the impairment of striatal binding, and the levels of CSF biomarkers increase with age at onset. The variability of imaging and nonimaging biomarkers in patients with PD at different ages could hamper the results of future clinical trials...|$|E

40|$|The apical {{membrane}} of frog skin {{contains two}} types of pathways which allow the passage of several monovalent cations {{in the absence of}} external Ca 2 +. Differences between the two pathways concern their open-close kinetics, selectivity, and the affinity for several blocking agents. Type S channels open and close relatively slowly, whereas type F channels display fast open-close kinetics. Both channel types allow the passage of Na+, K+, and Rb+ currents which are blocked by divalent cations and La 3 + added to the extracellular <b>side.</b> <b>Type</b> F channels are permeable for Cs+ which is, however, excluded from type S channels. Shifts in open-close kinetics induced by Mg 2 + occur at concentrations below 5 microM for type F channels, whereas more than a tenfold higher dose is required for the type S pathway. UO 2 (2 +) concentrations up to 100 microM only occlude type S channels while 100 microM tetracaine selectively blocks type F channels. Apical membranes of toad urinary bladder, cultured amphibian renal epithelia (A 6), and toad colon contain only type F channels. In toad bladder and A 6 cells volume expansion strongly activates this pathway.

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to develop an Early Warning System of Macro Vulnerability for several Latin American {{countries}} based on previous work of Kaminsky, Lizondo and Reinhart (1997) and Kaminsky (1998). We build a composite leading indicator that signals macroeconomic vulnerability, showing that, historically, crises tend to happen in these “vulnerable” situations. The main differences with Kaminsky’s approach are, 1) we use a reduced set of variables to generate the signals, 2) the variables were first aggregated and then the signal was issued depending on the behavior of the composite index, as opposed to Kaminsky’s procedure of generating signals with each individual variable and then aggregating these. The results are very satisfactory on the statistical and operational fronts: on the statistical <b>side,</b> <b>Type</b> I and Type II errors are smaller than those reported in previous papers. Operationally, this system of leading indicators is less costly to maintain given the reduced set of primary variables involved, their wide-spread availability and the timeliness with which they are reported. The models’ out-of-sample predictive ability are tested with plenty of crises cases occurring after the first stage of this project was finished: Colombia (September, 1998), Brazil (January, 1999), and Ecuador (February, 1999). All the cases were correctly anticipated by the signals of vulnerability issued by the models. Additionally, Mexico’s models, estimated with information available two years before the crisis, show that these signaling devices would have been useful anticipating the 1994 crisis. early warning system, Latin America, speculative pressure, macroeconomic vulnerability, currency crisis,...|$|E
