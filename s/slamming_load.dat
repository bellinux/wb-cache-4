40|$|Slamming often {{occurs in}} severe sea states {{particular}} for high speed vessels, {{which can cause}} damage to ship hulls or even equipment on ships. Analysis of transient dynamic response of ship hulls is useful in establishing criterion related to slamming loads and predicting seakeeping behavior of the ship.

Hence, numerical methods {{are considered to be}} very useful for dynamic analysis of the ship.

40|$|Slamming induced {{whipping}} {{can significantly}} increase the structural loading of ships. Although this is well-known, the whipping {{contribution to the}} structural loading is rarely taken into account when computing the structural loading. An exception are the "dynamic loading" factors found in Classification Societies rules. Currently there are no commercial tools available to compute the seakeeping response including slamming induced whipping. This {{is the main reason}} for not accounting for the effects of whipping. Extensive research has been done on the subject of slamming impact and whipping response but an integral and computationally efficient method is not yet available for ship structure designers. This is the starting point for this research presented in this thesis. The objective of this thesis is: "The development of a practical method to calculate the global and local response of the ship structure due to the seakeeping <b>loading</b> including the <b>slamming</b> <b>loading.</b> This method should contain the full hydro-elastic coupling. " This method is developed by combining well-known components and new tools. The concept of generalised modes is used to solve the hydro-elastic seakeeping problem. All degrees of freedom of the ship structure are described by mode shapes using this approach, even the rigid-body modes. The number of degrees of freedom may be arbitrary selected by the user. The flexible mode shapes of the structure are obtained from either a 3 D-FEM analysis or a 1 D-FEM analysis using a beam model of the ship structure. The seakeeping response of all modes, rigid and flexible, is solved simultaneously which ensures a full account for the hydro-elastic coupling. The seakeeping response is solved in the time domain using a 3 D surface integration method. The time domain allows one to include non-linear load components and to calculate the transient response with relative ease. The non-linear Froude-Krylov and non-linear hydrostatic loads are taken into account to improve the seakeeping and internal load predictions. The diffraction and radiation loads are kept linear to allow for reasonably fast computations. The linear diffraction and radiation coefficients are solved in the frequency domain using a 3 D boundary element method. This hydro-elastic approach allows one to compute the transient whipping response. The springing response can only be partially predicted because springing is often caused by additional non-linear load components which are not included in the presented theory. Since fast and robust, non-empirical 3 D methods are not yet available for the calculation of the <b>slamming</b> <b>loads,</b> the <b>slamming</b> <b>loads</b> are solved using 2 D methods. The first of the two used methods is the Generalised Wagner Model (GWM). This is the most accurate of the two methods. The second method is the Modified Logvinovich Model (MLM) which is much faster compared to the GWM. The drawback of using these 2 D methods is that the <b>slamming</b> <b>loading</b> can only be computed accurately for head seas and near head sea conditions. The computation of the <b>slamming</b> <b>loads</b> is directly integrated into the time domain seakeeping calculation. At every time step the <b>slamming</b> <b>loads</b> are computed based on the actual relative motions, and the computed <b>slamming</b> <b>loads</b> are taken into account for the solution of the resulting motions. Insight into the global response of the ship structure is obtained by using the modal approach for computing the seakeeping response. However, it is difficult to compute the local structural response of a ship structure using the modal method. Therefore, the local structural response is computed by transferring the seakeeping loads to the 3 D-FEM model of the structure and solving the response using the FEM method. The method used ensures that the hydrodynamic loads at the structural model are well balanced by the applied nodal acceleration loads, thus ensuring a consistent FEM solution. These nodal acceleration loads allow one to include the effect of whipping even when a quasi-static FEM approach is used. The developed methodology is verified and validated using different ships, results of model experiments and the results of one full-scale sea trial. All verifications show that the developed approach gives the expected results and that the presented theory is consistent. The slamming forces are verified using model experiments of a container ship and an aluminium model. This validation shows {{that it is necessary to}} take into account the static bow wave generated by the blunt bow of the container ship when computing the <b>slamming</b> <b>loads</b> to a reasonable accuracy. The validations using experiments with the aluminium model show that the contribution of the added mass on the natural frequency is well predicted, even for conditions with forward speed. The calculated <b>slamming</b> <b>loads</b> and resulting whipping response compare well with the experimental results of the aluminium model. Stresses measured during a sea trial of the M-Frigate of the Royal Netherlands Navy are also used to validate the developed methodology. The computed spectral energy of the wave frequency and the whipping response are close to the spectra measured. The Weibull fits of the extremes of the calculated and measured stresses shows very good agreement, the hog/sag ratio is also well predicted. The stresses are slightly overpredicted for the highest speed. Two ultra large container ships are used for a case study. Design values such as the expected ultimate bending moment and fatigue loading are calculated based on the computed bending moment or stress history. It is shown that the seakeeping response should be calculated for at least 750 wave encounters in order to accurately compute the design values. The developed seakeeping method is fast and robust enough to compute the design values for all cells of a scatter diagram. The expected ultimate bending moment and fatigue damage are calculated based on a life-time of thirty years with both North Atlantic and World wide scatter diagrams. It is shown that the slamming induced whipping and the computed springing response reduce the predicted fatigue lifetime by about forty percent and increase the expected ultimate bending moment by about twenty percent. This shows the importance of accounting for these effects when computing the design values for such flexible ships. It can be concluded that a practical method to calculate the global and local response of the ship structure due to the seakeeping <b>loading</b> including the <b>slamming</b> <b>loading</b> and whipping has been developed. It is shown that the developed method can be applied to calculate the design values for a complete scatter diagram. The validations shows that the predictions are reasonably accurate.

Three-dimensional Finite Element model is developed according to the ship (135 m dry cargo vessel) particulars provided by the ISSC committee II. 2 Dynamic Response. Preliminary model was developed in SESAM/GeniE and later this model is used for Hydrodynamic Analysis in SESAM/HydroD and Finite Element Analysis in ABAQUS/CAE.

Low frequency natural hull girder frequencies with associated vibration modes for Dry-mode and Wet-mode models (Lightship condition, Ballast condition, Fully Loaded condition) were determined. The validity of the frequency analysis results were verified through the further investigations involving study of Classification society and ISO rules and regulations.

40|$|Current {{methods to}} predict {{hydrodynamic}} loads rely either on oversimplified and semiempirical methods {{or the use}} of numerical simulation and analysis techniques such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Boundary Element Analysis (BEA). These methods are conservative which results in the over-design of these craft so they are heavier and slower than they could otherwise be. Better understanding of load intensities will inform the design process of marine structures and could result in lighter and more efficient designs. This research investigates the possibility of solving these problems employing artificial intelligence (AI) {{as an alternative to the}} current methods. Few studies have applied Artificial Intelligence to the design of marine structures. Detailed review of the past and present research shows that AI and in particular Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be used as an inverse problem solver when there are no closed form relationships that exist between the input and the output. An inverse approach is defined as the problem where response of the structure is known but the load that caused that response is unknown. In real problems/structures the response to a point load is experienced throughout the structure with different levels of intensities which is the link between the external load and these differential intensities. Determining this relationship will result in a unique solution without the knowledge of material constitutive laws, material properties and structure size or thickness. The aim of this investigation is to develop a real time in-service load measurement tool using an inverse approach. To achieve this, ANN, experimental techniques and FEA analysis are combined to form a hybrid inverse problem solver that can be trained to use structural response, such as strains at various locations, to predict the loads that caused them. The main objective of this research is to investigate the suitability of the proposed methodology for real time in-service load monitoring on large marine structures. The proposed system must be able to measure both steady-state as well as transient load such as equivalent <b>slamming</b> <b>load.</b> The outcome of this investigation was successful prediction of the external loads in terms of their approximate location and load intensities. The only disadvantage of this method is that the solver requires training and can only learn from cases that it has been subjected to. However, once the system is trained it can predict both static and dynamic loads quickly and accurately...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{progress}} {{of the performance of}} sailing yachts has been driven by the continuing use and development of lightweight sandwich structures made of polymeric composite materials. So far the structural design of sailing yachts has relied on static or quasi-static approaches which usually lead to conservative design. Sailing yachts undergo several diverse dynamic loads in a seaway. Rigs and rigging, deck and hull have to be designed to withstand local and distributed loads whose entity is always difficult to determine. In this respect, the phenomenon of slamming, namely the impact of the hull bottom against the water surface in a rough sea, and its effects on the structure represent a crucial issue. This implies that when structural optimisation is required it is necessary to better define the external loads and the strain-rate properties of the material utilized. With this in mind, this thesis explores the dynamic response of a FRP (fibre reinforced plastics) sandwich hull panel subject to <b>slam</b> <b>loads.</b> This is achieved initially by investigating experimentally the dynamic properties of FRP under rates of strain typically experienced by sailing yacht structures. A systematic methodology is then proposed to describe the strain-rate behaviour of the material by LS-DYNA explicit finite element code. This methodology is subsequently applied to examine the response of a hull panel to a <b>slam</b> <b>load.</b> It is shown that the ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) method, within LSDYNA code, is suitable to model the fluid-structure interaction slam problem and to assess the relative entity of the load {{to be used in the}} panel analysis. A static finite element analysis of the panel is also carried out based on standard design rules. Results are compared with the dynamic approach presented and the conservativeness of the static method is underpinned. Developing the knowledge of both the dynamic properties of the materials and the use of tools such as explicit finite element codes is shown to be a valid approach to optimise the design of sailing structures under <b>slam</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} investigates the {{slamming}} characteristics of wave piercing catamarans through {{the analysis of}} sea trials data of the 98 m Incat sea frame “Hull 061 ”, built in Tasmania, Australia and currently serving in the US Navy combat fleet. The importance of this sea trials data is that the ship was tested in severe sea conditions to assess her suitability for military operations and to define her operational envelope. New signal processing techniques such as Wavelet Transforms are used in analysing slamming data for two main purposes, slamming identification and modal analysis in time and frequency domains simultaneously. The Wavelet Transforms were found superior to conventional signal processing tools such as Fast Fourier Transform and Short Time Fourier Transform. The structural strength of wave piercing catamarans is studied by introducing a novel sea trials analysis for structural performance assessment {{in an attempt to}} simulate real loading conditions. The methodology was tested on normal linear wave <b>loading</b> (without <b>slamming)</b> and was found satisfactory. A “Reverse Engineering” approach is introduced to predict <b>slamming</b> <b>loads</b> during sea trials by using the capabilities of Finite Element Analysis using the well known software PATRAN/NASTRAN 1. To increase the efficiency of this approach, the load parameters, spatial location and distribution, were investigated through model tests of a similar but larger 112 m Incat hydro-elastic model in the Australian Maritime College towing tank facility. Based on pressure measurements, proper <b>slam</b> <b>load</b> models can be more accurately and efficiently introduced in the finite element analysis. Quasi-static analysis was first performed to examine its suitability to analyse such fast time varying loads. Difficulties in comparison procedures between numerical simulations and trials data have strongly highlighted the need for dynamic analysis. Direct transient dynamic analysis was performed using the dynamic solver of the same software package. Good agreement with trials data was found. The suggested procedure and <b>slamming</b> <b>loading</b> patterns used in the numerical simulation is then verified and can be regarded as a solid base for verification of other theoretical design models...|$|R
40|$|Current design {{methods are}} limited {{in their ability to}} predict long term loading {{statistics}} relating to wave loads and fatigue from prolonged cyclic loading. These methods either neglect <b>slam</b> <b>loads</b> entirely or they are included as post-processed or simplified two-dimensional methods. The work presented in this thesis introduces a combined theoretical-empirical approach to determining long term load trends in realistic sea conditions during the initial stages of the design spiral. This method builds on a previously developed non-linear time-domain seakeeping strip theory method, for high-speed multi-hull vessels, using scale model testing in irregular seas as a basis for an empirical slam module. Towing tank experiments, using an extensively instrumented 2. 5 m hydroelastic scale model wave-piercing catamaran representative of the 112 m class Incat design, were used to develop a database of slam events in a range of realistic (but idealised) irregular sea conditions. A total of 2, 103 slam events were identified over 22 test conditions during the scale model experiments. Large slams generally occurred in the conditions where motions were largest; however significant scatter was present with extreme events observed to be up to four times the median for most conditions. Occurrence rates were found to be a function of encountered wave frequency and significant wave height. If the encountered wave frequency coincides with the motion resonance, slam rates increased. Increasing the significant wave height also increased slam occurrences. A wave height dependent slam threshold was identified by extrapolating occurrence rate trends with decreasing significant wave heights. Pressure measurements also revealed that the cross-deck structure was exposed to large local pressures at each measurement station, suggesting that ship designers should ensure the structure can withstand large local loads along {{the entire length of the}} bow. The non-linear time-domain seakeeping program was extended to simulate motions and loads in irregular seas and a method for constructing idealised wave spectra was developed as an input to the seakeeping code. The extended code was verified by conducting a series of program tests and then validated by comparing computational ship motions with results from the scale model experiments in the absence of slamming. A new module for predicting <b>slam</b> <b>loads,</b> based on a statistical analysis of scale model tests was then developed and integrated into the extended time-domain seakeeping method, allowing for the slam events to be determined on-line in the time-domain. Slams are identified by defining a location dependant immersion threshold criterion based on the geometry of the hull form combined with a stochastically determined variation originating from experimental observations. In the event of a <b>slam,</b> the maximum <b>load</b> and <b>slam</b> duration are determined by empirical methods stemming from regression analyses on experimental data. Vessel forward speed and relative vertical velocity at the centre bow truncation are used to predict the maximum <b>slam</b> <b>load.</b> <b>Slams</b> <b>loads</b> are ramped up and down over a number of time steps. Forward speed and immersion at the centre bow truncation are key explanatory variables in the duration calculation. The <b>slam</b> <b>load</b> is then applied over a number of time steps according to its duration at the location where it was first triggered. A case study is finally undertaken demonstrating the application of this method. A highspeed ferry service route was selected and real wave data used to determine expected wave environments. The computer simulation was run for a range of sea conditions and slam events are identified. Slam event statistics are then extrapolated to produce expectations for long term (20 + years) loading expectations showing how this method could be a valuable tool when considering the long term loading implications of a vessel for a particular route...|$|R
