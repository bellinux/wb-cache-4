50|$|For routing pre-terminated cables (cables with connectors), split {{cable glands}} can be used. These cable glands consist of three parts (two gland halves and a <b>split</b> <b>sealing</b> grommet) which are screwed with a {{hexagonal}} locknut (like normal cable glands). Thus, pre-assembled cables can be routed without removing the plugs.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 67 <b>Split</b> {{mechanical}} <b>sealing</b> {{technology has}} lagged nonsplit seal applications {{because of the}} many difficulties introduced by the requirement of assembling separate parts to {{a high degree of}} precision in the field. It has at first been applied to equipment that simply cannot be practically disassembled such as stern tubes in boats. Then the migration was made to packing replacement for larger pumps handling mostly water. But recently, many complex chemical, pharmaceutical, and other applications have been successfully addressed with <b>split</b> <b>seals.</b> This paper deals with the design and field application of a completely split mechanical gas lubricated double seal in a challenging situation by overcoming various new hurdles...|$|R

40|$|High speed {{helicopter}} transmission seal concepts were designed, fabricated and tested. The concepts were a dual element <b>split</b> ring <b>seal</b> and a circumferential seal. The {{tests were}} {{performed in a}} rig using an actual input quill assembly. The test conditions were selected to simulate transmission operation and were 230 F oil temperature, and a sliding speed of 9400 ft/min. The <b>split</b> ring <b>seal</b> exhibited gross leakage and was considered unsatisfactory, while the circumferential seal leakage was less than 1 c. c. /hour; this leakage is within acceptable limits. The circumferential seal wear was only to. 0005 inches during a 100 hour run (40 starts and stops).

50|$|For routing cables {{which are}} already {{assembled}} with connectors, split cable entry {{systems have been}} developed. The divisibility of these systems provides two advantages. The warranty on pre-terminated cables remains since the connectors don’t have to be cut and soldered again after entering the cables. The other advantage is that assembly can be done subsequently because the split cable entries are usually built around the existing lines.Most split cable entries consist of a split hard frame, made of plastic or sometimes aluminium (e.g. utilised in food industry) and one or several <b>split</b> <b>sealing</b> grommets, usually made of elastomer. The grommet matching the cable diameter is placed around the cable and fixed inside the cable entry frame. Thus allowing strain relief for the cables (in some cases according to EN 50262) as well as ingress protection of up to IP 65/66/67.|$|R
5000|$|Today's plastic {{ski boots}} evolved from leather designs {{that in turn}} evolved from {{conventional}} winter hiking boots. These all followed the same basic layout; the boot was built {{on top of a}} semi-stiff sole of leather or (for a stiffer boot) wood. The upper shell consisted of single layer or multiple layers of leather and stiffeners that were formed around a foot-like wooden block, the [...] "last". Some models were designed with a single piece of leather wrapped over the toe area of the last, with {{the two sides of the}} leather meeting at the back of the heel, where they were stitched together. The designs normally left a slot-like opening and overlapping flaps running from the instep and up in front of the ankle. Laces threaded across the split section allow the boot to be tightened over the foot, and a tongue below the <b>split</b> <b>sealed</b> it to prevent water or snow entering.|$|R
40|$|Objective. Structures such as ligamentum flavum, annulus, and lamina play an {{important}} role in the segmental function. We proposed the surgical technique for achieving the sufficient preservation of segmental structures, in spite of sufficient removal of pathologic disc in the L 5 -S 1 using the ligamentum flavum <b>splitting</b> and <b>sealing</b> technique. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 80 cases that underwent percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy for L 5 -S 1 herniated nucleus pulposus, using the ligamentum flavum <b>splitting</b> and <b>sealing</b> technique between January 2011 and June 2013. Outcomes were assessed using VAS (leg, back), MacNab’s criteria, and the immediate postoperative MRI for all patients. Structural preservation was classified as complete, sufficient, and incomplete. Results. The surgical results are as follows: 65 cases were complete, 15 cases were sufficient, and 0 cases were incomplete. The VAS was decreased at the last follow-up (leg: from 7. 91 ± 0. 73 to 1. 15 ± 0. 62; back: from 5. 15 ± 0. 71 to 1. 19 ± 0. 75). A favorable outcome (excellent or good outcome by MacNab’s criteria) was achieved in 77 patients (96. 25 %). During the follow-up period, 2 cases (2. 5 %) of recurrence have occurred. Conclusion. According to the result, we could obtain the favorable clinical and radiological outcomes while simultaneously removing pathologic discs using the ligamentum flavum splitting and annular fissure sealing technique...|$|R

40|$|About {{four years}} ago, work was {{completed}} on a 36 inch diameter gas to gas carbon ring seal used to buffer low pressure turbine {{air at the}} rim of the forward outer flowpath on the GE 36 unducted fan (UDF) engine. At about the same time, we were developing a long life counter-rotating intershaft air-oil seal of approximately 7. 6 inch diameter for operation at 800 fps, 800 F, and 50 psid. Although we were successful in meeting most program goals with a <b>split</b> ring <b>seal</b> of the axial bushing type, the seal with the greatest payoff in life and air leakage rates, bearing many features in common with the GE 36 seal, could not be successfully tested because of the structural weakness of the primary seal ring carbon material. This was a <b>split</b> ring <b>seal</b> using a hybrid combination of orifice compensated hydrostatic and shrouded hydrodynamic gas bearings. We are presently working to develop this design in conjunction with high strength materials being developed by Pure Carbon Co. In the area of engine secondary gas flow path-sealing for performance improvement, we are currently working with carbon and all metal face seals. A 15 inch diameter all metal 'aspirating' face seal, using self-acting hydrostatic bearings, was successfully tested to 700 fps, 100 psid, and 1000 F, demonstrating long life at flow reduction of 86 percent compared to a 'best' labyrinth. This seal will be developed through 1400 F, 900 fps, and 350 psid. The seal 'aspirates' closed at about idle speed pressure during engine start and reopens at engine shutdown. A hydraulic thrust balance seal, currently using orifice compensated hydrostatics, is under development. Other aspects of these projects are briefly covered...|$|R

5000|$|The {{coalition}} {{was dealt}} its final blow on 19 October 1922. After criticism of Lloyd George over his {{threat of war}} with Turkey over the Chanak crisis, the Conservative leader, Austen Chamberlain, summoned a meeting of Conservative Members of Parliament at the Carlton Club to discuss their attitude to the Coalition in the forthcoming election. Chamberlain and other Conservatives such as Arthur Balfour argued for supporting Lloyd George, while former party leader Bonar Law argued the other way, claiming that breaking up the coalition [...] "wouldn't break Lloyd George's heart". The main attack came from Stanley Baldwin, then President of the Board of Trade, who spoke of Lloyd George as a [...] "dynamic force" [...] who would break the Conservative Party. Baldwin {{and many of the}} more progressive members, like Austen Chamberlain, of the Conservative Party, and those who fundamentally opposed Lloyd George <b>split.</b> They <b>sealed</b> Lloyd George's fate with a vote of 187 to 87 in favour of the motion [...] "That this meeting of Conservative members of the House of Commons declares its opinion that the Conservative Party, whilst willing to cooperate with Coalition Liberals, fights the election as an independent party, with its own leader and its own programme."

40|$|Special Paperpg. 109 The {{symmetrical}} seal {{offers a}} significant advancement in seal design to pump manufacturers and users {{it is the}} first alternative design to complex seal arrangements which are required to fit a stuffing box designed for packing. Today, with more demands being made on tighter leakage control and simplified installation, the transition is being made from a conventional stuffing box to a self-contained package seal. The concept of a package seal is not new and dates back to {{the early days of the}} pipeline industry when they were supplied to <b>seal</b> <b>split</b> case pumps. What is new is the bolt-on feature of the symmetrical seal, freeing the seal design from the space required for packing. This freedom allows the seal manufacturers to include such sealing features like upstream pumping, when required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} novel offline {{signature}} verification scheme. The {{idea behind the}} extraction of stroke speed is to extract dynamic feature from a static signature. In order to obtain {{the speed of the}} stroke, the intensity of the stroke is considered. This is because intensity is directly proportional to speed of the stroke. Faster the stroke speed, higher is its intensity value. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme in discriminating the genuine signatures from the forgeries. counterparts. So we developed a signature database which consists of signatures from all the age groups. Our database is also language independent and also it consists of signatures done with different pens with different colors along with these there are <b>split</b> signatures and <b>seal</b> signatures. The signature samples from the data base are shown in Figure 1...|$|R
50|$|Aventuras AD was a {{videogame}} Spanish producer, one of {{the most}} popular in Spain during the Golden Era of Spanish Software in the 1980s, specialized in text adventure games. It was created as a <b>seal</b> <b>split</b> from Dinamic Software in 1987 (AD comes from Aventuras Dinamic, the name they had when they were part from Dinamic from 1985 to 1987). They popularized the genre of aventura conversacional (a Spanish word for text adventures that have static graphics, which in English is part of the primitive graphic adventures), and they would release games until 1992, when they, like the rest of the Spanish companies of the time, had to close on bankruptcy, unable to switch in time to 16 bit development. They would release their titles mainly for ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, IBM PC, Amstrad PCW, and in the last years also Atari ST and Commodore Amiga.|$|R
50|$|Both SEAL Team FOUR and SEAL Team SIX, the {{predecessor}} to DEVGRU, {{participated in the}} US invasion of Grenada. The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's Governor-General and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On Oct 24, 1983, 12 operators from SEAL Team SIX and 4 Air Force Combat Control Team members(CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C130 Hercules with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salinas, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. <b>SEALs</b> <b>split</b> into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their cryptographic satellite phone. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in AC-130 gunship fire support.

40|$|Within {{one month}} of {{construction}} parts of an airport runway in Botswana surfaced with a 13 mm Cape <b>seal</b> (<b>split</b> application single bituminous seal with slurry) started to exhibit blisters and cracks. An investigation showed that this damage {{was due to}} the crystallization of common salt (NaCl) between the seal and the base course. The salt content of the calcrete gravel base course under the blisters was found to average about 2, 2 % and that under unblistered and uncracked surfacing 1, 4 %. The source of salt {{is believed to be the}} salt water used during compaction of the subbase and lower layers. The use of salt water for compaction was required due to the limited availability of potable water. Precautions adopted in the design and construction procedures to prevent salt damage were to construct rapidly to minimize upward migration of salt and to surface with a salt-resistant surfacing (the Cape seal) as soon as possible thereafter. In the event, neither of these precautions were achieved and measurements showed the surfacing to be unusually permeable for a Cape seal. Due to lack of funds for rehabilitation the runway was successfully kept in service for over seven years simply by periodically rolling the blisters flat and by patching any scabbed areas. Rehabilitation options are discussed and the additional precautions employed on a road in the area outlined...|$|R
