5|$|Eventually {{they meet}} a rabbit named Cowslip, who invites {{them to join}} his warren. At first Hazel's group are {{relieved}} to finally {{be able to sleep}} and feed well – all except for Fiver who senses only death there. When Bigwig is nearly killed in a <b>snare,</b> the group realize that the new warren is managed by a farmer who protects and feeds the rabbits, but also harvests a number of them for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply using Hazel and the others to increase their own odds of survival. Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a <b>snare,</b> then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a <b>snare.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Snaring</b> River {{rises in}} the northwestern section of Jasper National Park, near the British Columbia border. It flows east-southeast before joining the Athabasca River. The <b>Snaring</b> is fed by meltwater of {{numerous}} peaks, including Mount McCord, Mount Beaupre, Mount Knight, Mount Rutherford, and <b>Snaring</b> Mountain. The small Harvey Lake also drains into the <b>Snaring.</b> [...] A campground run by Parks Canada {{is located on the}} <b>Snaring</b> near the Yellowhead Highway.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Snaring</b> River is a {{medium-sized}} {{river in the}} Canadian Rockies. It runs through parts of Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada. The <b>Snaring</b> River is a significant tributary of the Athabasca River.

5|$|The Kijé suite is scored for: {{baritone}} voice (optional); piccolo; two flutes; two oboes; two clarinets; two bassoons; tenor saxophone; four horns; cornet; two trumpets; three trombones; tuba; bass drum; <b>snare</b> drum; triangle; cymbals; tambourine; sleigh bells; celesta; piano; harp; and strings.|$|E
5|$|Blackberry: A clever buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He {{is often}} capable of {{understanding}} concepts {{that the other}} rabbits find incomprehensible. He realises, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice to travel on water. He also works out how to dismantle the <b>snare</b> that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSNARE {{proteins}} mediate membrane fusion. Neurosecretion {{depends on}} neuronal <b>SNAREs</b> (SNAP- 25, syntaxin- 1, and synaptobrevin- 1 or 2) and is blocked by neurotoxin-mediated cleavage or genetic ablation. We report that exocytosis in mouse inner hair cells (IHCs) is insensitive to neurotoxins and genetic ablation of neuronal <b>SNAREs.</b> We found mRNA but no synaptically localized protein of neuronal <b>SNAREs</b> in IHCs. Thus, IHC exocytosis is unconventional and may operate independently of neuronal <b>SNAREs...</b>|$|R
5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise {{is an important}} component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a <b>snare</b> drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E
5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} <b>snare</b> drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a <b>snare</b> drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, {{who went on to}} book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Rick {{approaches}} Hershel {{about the}} walkers in the barn, but Hershel refuses {{to allow them}} to harm the walkers. He, Maggie, and Jimmy (James Allen McCune) bring Rick to a forest swamp where two walkers are stuck. Hershel insists that if Rick's group is to stay on his farm, they must treat the walkers as people, and shows Rick how to <b>snare</b> and lead the walkers back.|$|E
5|$|The team's cheerleaders are the Carolina Topcats, a {{group of}} 24 women who lead cheers and {{entertain}} fans at home games. The TopCats participate in both corporate and charity events. The team's drumline is PurrCussion, an ensemble of <b>snare,</b> tenor, and bass drummers as well as cymbal players. PurrCussion performs for fans outside the stadium and introduces players prior to home games; it consists of drummers from across the Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|Zampanò {{makes his}} living as an {{itinerant}} street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's naïve and antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches {{her to play}} the <b>snare</b> drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{types of}} {{breakaway}} <b>snares</b> were evaluated for breaking strength and variability using a universal testing machine. Maximum tension before breakage for individual <b>snares</b> ranged from 142 to 486 pounds. Sheet metal locks which ripped out, and S-hooks which straightened, provided the least variable results. Coyotes (Canis latrans), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), domestic calves and lambs were tested {{to determine the}} tension loads they applied to <b>snares.</b> Differences in tension loads among coyotes and nontarget species should allow {{for the development of}} <b>snares</b> that will consistently hold coyotes and release most larger nontarget animals...|$|R
50|$|The train {{crosses the}} <b>Snaring</b> River, {{which has its}} source in Jasper National Park near the British Columbia border.

50|$|The <b>Snares</b> penguin {{is named}} after the place in which it breeds - the <b>Snares</b> Islands. The <b>Snares</b> Islands are {{a small group of}} islands off the coast of {{southern}} New Zealand. Although little is known of their range and migration outside of the breeding season, it is not thought that they migrate far in the winters. Occasional sitings have occurred on the coasts of Tasmania, southern Australia, the Chatham Islands, Stewart Island, and the southern New Zealand mainland. There are approximately 25,000 living pairs of <b>Snares</b> penguins.|$|R
5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another {{battle between}} the forces of order and chaos. A <b>snare</b> drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems {{similar to that in}} Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E
5|$|As {{written in}} the {{original}} 1926 edition of the score, the Fifth Symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, <b>snare</b> drum, celesta, and strings. Some optional doublings are added in the 1950 edition of the score revised by Emil Telmányi and Erik Tuxen; these include the third flute doubling flute in G and the second bassoon doubling contrabassoon. These optional doublings are discarded in the latest 1998 Carl Nielsen Edition score, which was produced as a co-operation between the Danish Royal Library and Edition Wilhelm Hansen.|$|E
5|$|At Geneviève's apartment, Robert says he {{must end}} their {{relationship}} but invites {{her to join}} them for a weekend retreat to Robert and Christine's country estate, La Colinière, in Sologne. Later, Octave induces Robert to invite André to the estate as well. They joke that André and Geneviève will begin a relationship, thereby solving everyone's problems. At the estate, Schumacher is policing the grounds and trying to eliminate rabbits. Marceau (Julien Carette)a poachersneaks onto the estate to retrieve a rabbit caught in a <b>snare.</b> Before Marceau can escape, Schumacher catches him and begins to escort him from the property when Robert demands {{to know what is}} happening. Marceau explains that he can catch rabbits and Robert offers him a job as a servant. Once inside the house, Marceau flirts with Lisette.|$|E

30|$|N-ethyl-maleimide {{sensitive}} factor adaptor {{protein receptor}} (<b>SNAREs)</b> domain-containing proteins {{were known as}} key players in vesicle-associated membrane fusion. Genetic screening has revealed the function of <b>SNAREs</b> in different aspects of plant biology, but the role of many <b>SNAREs</b> are still unknown. In this study, we have characterized the role of Arabidopsis Qc-SNARE protein AtBS 14 b in brassinosteroids (BRs) signaling pathway.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a <b>snare</b> that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on <b>snare,</b> sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to <b>snare</b> an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
40|$|Vesicle {{traffic is}} {{essential}} for cell homeostasis, growth and development in plants, {{as it is in}} other eukaryotes, and is facilitated by a superfamily of proteins known as soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors (<b>SNAREs).</b> Although <b>SNAREs</b> are well-conserved across phylla, genomic analysis for two model angiosperm species available to date, rice and Arabidopsis, highlights common patterns of divergence from other eukaryotes. These patterns are associated with the expansion of some gene subfamilies of <b>SNAREs,</b> the absence of others and the appearance of new proteins that show no significant homologies to <b>SNAREs</b> of mammals, yeast or Drosophila. Recent findings indicate that the functions of these plant <b>SNAREs</b> also extend beyond the conventional 'housekeeping' activities associated with vesicle trafficking. A number of <b>SNAREs</b> have been implicated in environmental responses as diverse as stomata movements and gravisensing as well as sensitivity to salt and drought. These proteins are essential for signal transduction and response and, in most cases, appear also to maintain additional roles in membrane trafficking. One common theme to this added functionality lies in control of non-SNARE proteins, notably ion channels. Other examples include interactions between the <b>SNAREs</b> and scaffolding or other structural components within the plant cell...|$|R
50|$|The larva spins a nest out of silk on {{the ceiling}} of the cave and then hangs down as many as 70 threads of silk (called <b>snares)</b> from around the nest, each up to 30 or 40 cm long and holding {{droplets}} of mucus. <b>Snares</b> built by forest-living specimens are much shorter, reaching a maximum length of 5 cm due to wind entangling longer <b>snares.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>snaring</b> of non-target {{animals can}} be {{minimized}} using methods that exclude animals larger or {{smaller than the}} target animal. For example, deer stops are designed to avoid the <b>snaring</b> of deer or cattle by the leg; they are required in many States of the USA. Other precautions include setting <b>snares</b> at specific heights, diameters, and locations. In a study of foxes in the UK, researchers were unintentionally <b>snaring</b> brown hares about as frequently as the intended foxes until they improved their methods, using larger wire with rabbit stops to eliminate the unwanted catch of the brown hares.|$|R
