5|$|The {{most popular}} {{alcoholic}} drink in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for {{the variety of}} grapes grown {{because of the large}} variations in terroirs, with their specific mixes of <b>soil,</b> <b>air,</b> altitude and light. Swiss wine is produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread varieties are the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais) and Pinot noir. The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.|$|E

25|$|Rattans are {{threatened}} with overexploitation, as harvesters are cutting stems too young and reducing {{their ability to}} resprout. Unsustainable harvesting of rattan can lead to forest degradation, affecting overall forest ecosystem services. Processing can also be polluting. The use of toxic chemicals and petrol in the processing of rattan affects <b>soil,</b> <b>air</b> and water resources, and also ultimately people's health. Meanwhile, the conventional method of rattan production is threatening the plant's long-term supply, and the income of workers.|$|E

25|$|Willard Gardner and Walter Gardner {{developed}} a negative head permeameter {{as early as}} 1939. Dixon (1975) {{developed a}} closed-top ring infiltrometer to quantify macropores. Water is applied to a closed-top system, which permits the imposition of negative head or pressure on the ponded water surface. Negative tension {{can be considered as}} simulating a positive <b>soil</b> <b>air</b> pressure, created by a negative air pressure above ponded surface water. A simplification was made by Topp and Zebchuk (1985). The limitation of this device is the infiltration has to be started by ponding the closed-top infiltrometer (applying a positive head), then adjusted to a negative pressure. Little research effort was continued in this area, instead attention has been given mainly to the sorptivity apparatus of Dirksen (1975) which used a ceramic plate as a base. Based on this design, Brent Clothier and Ian White (1981) developed the sorptivity tube which can provide a constant negative potential (tension) on the soil surface. However, the sorptivity tube had many shortcomings, hence modifications to the design {{led to the development of}} the disc permeameter by Perroux and White (1988) from CSIRO. In the US it is known as the tension infiltrometer.|$|E
500|$|The {{combined}} {{domains of}} archaea and bacteria {{make up the}} most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth and inhabit practically all environments where the temperature is below +140°C. They are found in water, <b>soil,</b> <b>air,</b> as the microbiome of an organism, hot springs and even deep beneath the Earth's crust in rocks.

2500|$|The Earth's crust has {{constantly}} {{changed since}} its formation. Likewise, life has constantly changed since its first appearance. Species continue to evolve, taking on new forms, splitting into daughter species or going extinct {{in the process}} of adapting or dying [...] in response to [...] ever-changing physical environments. The process of plate tectonics continues to shape the Earth's continents and oceans and the life they harbor. Human activity is now a dominant force affecting global change, adversely affecting the biosphere, the Earth's surface, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, with the loss of wild lands, over-exploitation of the oceans, production of greenhouse gases, degradation of the ozone layer, and general degradation of <b>soil,</b> <b>air,</b> and water quality.|$|E

30|$|Since Terzaghi in 1936 {{explained}} {{the behavior of}} saturated soils and helped to underline {{the principles of the}} soil mechanics, different authors (Fredlund 1997) have tried to explain the behavior of the “problematic” unsaturated soils (Fredlund et al. 2012) that didn’t fit the behavior explained by the Terzaghi’s equation. These types of soils comprise soils above the water table (sands, silts and clays and even gravels) including man-made fills, colluvium, residual <b>soils,</b> <b>air</b> transported <b>soils</b> and gas generating soils (Fredlund et al. 2012).|$|R
