The promotion of a stable and coherent tumble structure is largely believed in literature to enhance in-cylinder turbulence accelerating combustion process. In small PFI engine layout and weight constraints limit the adoption of more advanced concepts. In previous technical papers the authors demonstrated the influence of head shape and <b>squish</b> <b>area</b> on tumble vortex formation, development, breakdown and on final value of turbulence close to spark plug for small PFI engines. The main result of the this research was that the combustion chamber having the less <b>squish</b> <b>area</b> resulted to have {{the highest level of}} turbulence close to spark plug at ignition time. The geometry under analysis in the current paper is a 3 -valves pent-roof motorcycle engine. 3 D CFD simulations were ran at 6500 rpm with AVL FIRE code. The chosen engine geometry was the geometry found to be the best set-up in terms of turbulence and combustion performances in the previous paper. In the present paper the head shape and the <b>squish</b> <b>area</b> were kept constant and the following engine parameters were varied: the intake duct angle (the angle of the intake duct entering the head was reduced of 6 %, i. e. it was more directed toward the exhaust side of the chamber), the piston shape, and finally the compression ratio (it was reduced of 9 %). The main goal of the current analysis is to understand which of these parameters is predominant in accelerating combustion for directing engine design toward the best set-up...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The effect of combustion chamber design on combustion rate has been investigated experimentally and theoretically. The experimental work concentrated on the measurement of cylinder pressure and flame speed using a piezo-electric pressure transducer and multiple ionisation probes together with a data acquisition/processing system. A total of twenty one chamber designs of varying shape, compression ratio and spark plug arrangement were tested over a range of operating conditions on a single cylinder S. I. engine. The pressure data were analysed to obtain values of pressure rise rate, cyclic dispersion and combustion (mass burn) rate whilst the ionisation data were processed to yield flame travel angles and flame dispersion. The results obtained show that for a given compression ratio, the flame speed is not significantly affected by chamber design. In contrast, the combustion rate and pressure parameters are highly dependent on the chamber design; more compact arrangements giving higher combustion rates and reduced cyclic dispersion. A computer simulation model of the compression, combustion and expansion phases of the engine cycle was developed to predict {{the effects of the}} combustion chamber design parameters. Based on the experimental results, the model assumes that the ratio of laminar to turbulent burning velocity is independent of chamber design. The influence of chamber shape on the burnt volume, flame front surface area and heat transfer surface areas is modelled using a simple but effective geometric integration technique. This technique allows an infinite variation of the design parameters to be specified for a large range of chamber shapes with a minimum of input data being required. The model predicts that chamber design does have a major effect on combustion rate and cylinder pressure but shows that the influence of individual design is highly dependent on the setting of all other parameters. The effect of <b>squish</b> <b>area</b> is shown to be due to it changing the compactness of the chamber, optimum <b>squish</b> <b>area</b> being about 50...|$|E
40|$|The most {{economical}} way {{to convert}} truck and bus DI-diesel engines to natural gas operation is {{to replace the}} injector with a spark plug and modify the combustion chamber in the piston crown for spark ignition operation. The modification of the piston crown should give a geometry well suited for spark ignition operation with the original swirling inlet port. Ten different geometries were tried on a converted VOLVO TD 102 engine and a remarkably large difference {{in the rate of}} combustion was noted between the chambers. To find an explanation for this difference a cycle resolved measurement of the in-cylinder mean velocity and turbulence was performed with Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). The results show a high correlation between in cylinder turbulence and rate of heat release in the main part of combustion. The very early part of combustion is more affected by other parameters but the intermediate part of combustion corresponding to 0. 5 - 10 % of the total heat released is influenced by both mean velocity and turbulence. There is a surprisingly good correlation between the average level of turbulence and the used <b>squish</b> <b>area...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} some results {{concerning}} the combined {{effect of the}} tumble flow and combustion chamber geometry layout variations on flame front shape and its propagation through homogenous mixture of isooctane and air are presented. Spatial distributions of NO in different combustion chamber geometries are presented as well. The basic combustion chamber geometry layout considered consists of the flat head with two vertical valves and a cylindrical bowl subjected to variations of depth and <b>squish</b> <b>area.</b> All results presented were obtained by dint of multidimensional modeling of reactive flows in arbitrary geometry with moving objects and boundaries with modified KIVA 3 and KIVA 3 V source codes. Two additional computer codes were applied to generate boundary conditions for KIVA 3 V calculations with moving valves. The AVL TYCON code {{was used for the}} calculation of valve lift profiles, and AVL BOOST code was used for the calculation of relevant data set in the valve regions. Different combustion chamber geometry layouts generate different levels of squish, and the combustion effects in essence depend on the interaction of that flow with tumble. It was found that for particular combustion chamber shapes with different diameter/depth aspect ratios entirely different flame front shapes and propagation velocities were encountered primarily due to variations of fluid flow patterns in the vicinity of top dead center...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} some results {{concerning}} {{the evolution of}} 3 D fluid flow pattern through all four strokes in combustion chambers with entirely different bowl-in-piston geometry layouts ranging from ”omega” to “simple cylinder” were presented. All combustion chambers i. e. those with „omega“ bowls, with different profiles, and those with „cylinder“ bowls, with different <b>squish</b> <b>area</b> ranging from 44 % to 62 %, were with flat head, vertical valves and identical elevation of intake and exhaust ports. A bunch of results emerged by dint of multidimensional modeling of nonreactive fluid flow in arbitrary geometry with moving objects and boundaries. The fluid flow pattern during induction and compression in all cases was extremely complicated and entirely three-dimensional. It {{should be noted that}} significant differences due to geometry of the bowl were encountered only in the vicinity of TDC. Namely, in the case of “omega” bowl all three types of organized macro flows were observed while in the case of “cylinder” bowl no circumferential velocity was registered at all. On the contrary, in the case of “cylinder” bowl some interesting results concerning reverse tumble and its center of rotation shifting from exhaust valve zone to intake valve zone during induction stroke and vice-verse from intake valve zone to exhaust valve zone during compression were observed while in the case of “omega” bowl no such a displacement was legible. During expansion the fluid flow pattern is fully controlled by piston motion and during exhaust it is mainly one-dimensional, except in the close proximity of exhaust valve. For that reason it is not affected by the geometry of the bowl...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} phases in thedevelopment of direct-injected Diesel engines is theoptimisation of the fuel spray evolution within thecombustion chamber, since it strongly influences boththe engine performance and the pollutant emissions. Aim of the present paper is to provide information aboutmixture formation within the combustion chamber of aheavy duty direct injection (HDDI) diesel engine formarine applications. Spray evolution, in terms of tippenetration, is at first investigated under quiescentconditions, both experimentally and numerically,injecting the fuel in a vessel under ambient temperatureand controlled gas back-pressure. Results of penetrationand images of the spray from the optically accessiblehigh pressure vessel are used to investigate thecapabilities of some state of the art spray models withinthe STAR-CD software in correctly capturing sprayshape and propagation. The experimental investigation is carried outusing a mechanical injection pump equipping a heavyduty eight cylinder engine. Only one of its plungers isactivated, and the fuel is discharged through a sevenhole nozzle, 0. 40 mm in diameter, mounted on amechanical injector. Tests are carried out at two differentload fuel amounts, representing 50 %, and 100 %respectively, and results are used as data base for theCFD setup. CFD analyses of the intake andcompression strokes are at first performed in order tocompare two different combustion chambers anddifferent jet orientations with respect to the combustionchamber cavities, running the engine under motoredconditions and injecting 50 % load fuel amount. Both thetwo tested pistons show two-stage deep valve pocketshollowed under the valve seats projections, but somerelevant differences exist in the piston outer region andin the <b>squish</b> <b>area.</b> Subsequently, full CFD analyses of the intake,compression and combustion processes are performedfor the two different combustion chambers and thepreviously optimised jet orientation, operating the engineat full load, maximum revving speed.

40|$|Direct {{injection}} {{diesel engines}} power {{most of the}} heavy-duty vehicles. Due to their superior fuel economy, high power density and low carbon dioxide emissions, turbocharged, small bore, high speed, direct injection diesel engines are being considered to power light duty vehicles. Such vehicles have to meet stringent emission standards. However, {{it is difficult to}} meet these standards by modifying the in-cylinder thermodynamic and combustion processes to reduce engine-out emissions. After-treatment devices will be needed to achieve even lower emission targets required in the production engines to account for the anticipated deterioration after long periods of operation in the field. To reduce the size, mass and cost of the after-treatment devices, {{there is a need to}} reduce engine-out emissions and optimize both the engine and the aftertreatment devices as one integrated system. For example, the trade-off between engine-out NOx and PM, suggests that one of these species can be minimized in the engine, with a penalty in the other, which can be addressed efficiently in the after-treatment devices. Controlling engine-out emissions can be achieved by optimizing many engine design and operating parameters. The design parameters include, but are not limited to, the type of injection system: (CRS) Common Rail System, (HEUI) Hydraulically Actuated and Electronically controlled Unit Injector, or (EUI) Electronic Unit Injector; engine compression ratio, combustion chamber design (bowl design), reentrance geometry, <b>squish</b> <b>area</b> and intake and exhaust ports design. With four-valve engines, the swirl ratio depends on the design of both the tangential and helical ports and their relative locations. For any specific engine design, the operating variables need also to be optimized. These include injection pressure, injection rate, injection duration and timing (pilot, main, and post injection), EGR ratio, and swirl ratio. The goal of the program is to gain a better understanding of the spray behavior under high injection pressures in small-bore, high compression ratio, high-speed, direct-injection diesel engines equipped with advanced fuel injection system. The final results demonstrate the capability of the engine in reducing the engine-out emissions and improve the trade-off between nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, other emissions and fuel economy. This report introduces a new phenomenological model for the fuel distribution and combustion, and emissions formation in the small bore, high speed, direct injection diesel engine. This will be followed by an analysis of the effect of each of injection pressure, EGR, injection advance and retard and swirl ratio on engine-out emissions and fuel economy. A discussion will be given on the 2 -D and 3 -D trade of maps. Finally a discussion will be made on the low temperature combustion regimes, its major problems and proposed solutions...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two centuries, the {{development}} of the internal combustion engine has followed the evolution of the customer expectations. From the race for pure performances, high power, and fun to drive, perfectly well illustrated by the fabulous Mercedes 300 SL, the focus moved towards fuel efficient engines under the pressure of the still increasing oil prices. The well-known Diesel powertrain, up to this period limited to industrial vehicles, suddenly became the object of many researches, even for automotive manufacturers, specialists for sport cars. Technologic developments, mainly concerning turbocharging and injection, allowed the opening of the passenger cars market to CI engines due to acceptable noise, power and still unreachable efficiency. On the gasoline side, direct injection moved from racing to economic cars by the introduction of the stratified combustion. More recently, the pressure rose for dramatically reducing the air pollution, both in urban areas, by limiting NOx and soot, but also, at the scale of the earth, for managing CO 2 rejections and thereby enlarging the efforts on efficiency. The two first combustion systems described in this document are concerning spray guided and air guided design alternatives to obtain a fuel stratification, and thereby operate the gasoline engine without throttling the air intake, aiming at a better fuel efficiency. The first concept, called MID 3 S, was based on a 3 valve combustion chamber with a large <b>squish</b> <b>area</b> and a high compression ratio over 12; inspired from the May Fireball system, it was developed with a house made high pressure injector operating up to 80 bars with an outwardly opening needle. An ultra-lean flame-able mixture was formed at WOT {{in the vicinity of the}} spark plug for different operating points as low as idle, while the maximum performances were quite close to the targeted 37 kW/l. The efficiency was significantly improved compared to a similar MPI engine while CO and HC were quite acceptable. On the contrary, NOx and soot would have to be improved. The robustness of the squish aerodynamic motion was unfortunately balanced by the sensitivity of spray angle and penetration versus the back pressure and thereby late injection timings, creating plug wetting and fouling. The hollow cone structure of the fuel plume was clearly responsible of this behavior, especially because of the effect of the air entrainment inside the spray. An increase of the injection pressure from 30 to 80 bar, and probably upper, would probably reduce this effect. Concerning methodologies, a dedicated cylinder head was designed with two endoscope locations in order to visualize the interaction between spray, air, walls and combustion –or more precisely soot- with a high speed camera operating within visible wavelengths. The spray structure, formed by a succession of ligaments at the surface of the plume, was clearly emphasized in atmospheric conditions. The second design, called K 5 M, was based on an adjustable high tumble motion generated in the intake port. A swirl injector provided by Siemens and located between the two intake valves of the pent roof chamber, was operated until 80 bar. Mixture preparation was relying on the interaction between the air motion and the spray, the tumble velocity deviating fuel droplets towards the spark plug situated at the center of the chamber. 3 D CFD simulation, PIV and LIF visualization techniques on an optical single cylinder engine were used in parallel in order to understand the spatial evolution of the equivalence ratio during the cycle and the ability to operate the engine at WOT, even at part load. At low BMEP and speed, the natural reduction of the tumble intensity might have been followed by a significant reduction of the injection pressure in order to secure an accurate balance between the two momentum energies; unfortunately, both high cycle to cycle aerodynamic fluctuations and a poor spray atomization at 30 bar didn’t allow to achieve an acceptable ignition stability at low loads due to a too lean mixture in the plug vicinity. Protruded electrodes could have been a solution to the problem but their reliable use in serial life was not secured. On the contrary, mid load performances were globally adequate. The third concept is concerning Diesel combustion aiming at very low NOx and soot emissions by using an innovative injection system. The basic idea relies on the use of a quite homogeneous combustion at low load –called Mild HCCI- and on a diffusion controlled one at higher loads. Based on two injections close one of the other in the vicinity of TDC, the Mild HCCI allows to moderate the combustion noise inherent to the premixed burning phase as the fuel injected during the second injection cools down the first combustion; the advantages of very low NOx and soot emissions until around 8 bar BMEP are meanwhile maintained. Above this value, the noise level becomes unacceptable for automotive applications and the come back to a conventional diffusive combustion becomes mandatory. Based on early academic investigations pointing out the positive effect of small nozzle holes associated to high injection pressures in terms of soot via a significant difference between the lift-off length and the liquid penetration length, an innovative injection system was adapted to a conventional combustion chamber. The first conclusion was concerning a significant improvement of the NOx/soot tradeoff at mid and high loads with quite usual EGR rates. This advantage was due to a much better fuel atomization linked to both small holes and high pressures. The second conclusion was related to the possibility to achieve a “ 0 soot/ 0 NOx” combustion at high loads while very much increasing EGR and air mass flows. In this case, a Lifted Flame Diffusion Controlled combustion was generated, confirming on a scale 1 engine the results obtained in academic conditions. Nevertheless, the use of 3 D simulation allowed to demonstrate that mixture preparation was only one part of the result; the location of the different stages of the combustion in a Kamimoto diagram, much away from the NOx and soot peninsula, highlighted the impact of the LTC (Low Temperature Combustion) thermodynamics. Unfortunately, despite these good results, industrially available EGR and air systems are not able to provide the necessary mass flows. Concerning tools, the development steps were followed by intensive spray visualizations for both the liquid and the vapor phases, in conditions closer and closer to the actual engine. These measurements allowed to precisely evaluate the impact of the diameter size, the rail pressure and the oxygen content on the difference between lift-off and liquid lengths. Finally, the importance of coupling investigation tools like visualization and 3 D simulation in conditions as close as possible to the actual engine in terms of temperature, pressure and timing –eg the ability to record a complete mixture and combustion cycle- has been emphasized for both future SI and Diesel engines. In particular, the forecasted increase of the rail pressures will lead to re-optimize the different available spray models and eventually to re-adapt them in terms of physical phenomena because of the great variations of the spray velocity and of the Weber number. The presence of cavitation in the nozzle holes will also have to be taken into account as it has a key role versus coking. In conclusion, it is quite clear that the development of stratified gasoline and low emissions Diesel engines will more and more rely on the mixture preparation and on its association with low gas temperatures.
