40|$|Impression {{making is}} not only {{important}} but {{is also the most}} significant step in the fabrication of any fixed or removable prosthesis. Proper impression making may be hindered by certain pathologic conditions. Reduced mouth opening is one of the common mechanical obstructions for proper orientation of the impression tray in the patient’s mouth. In patients with trismus induced by submucous fibrosis, the procedure may be even more difficult to carry out because of reduced tissue resiliency and obliteration of vestibular spaces. Use of <b>sectional</b> <b>trays</b> offers one of the alternatives to overcome the problem of restricted mouth opening.

40|$|The Prosthetic {{rehabilitation}} of microstomia patients presents difficulties {{at all the}} stages. The difficulty starts with the preliminary impression making. This {{is due to the}} tongue rigidity and the decreased oral opening. A maximum oral opening which is smaller than the size of the tray can make prosthetic treatment challenging. Due to the restricted mouth opening, insertion and removal of the impression trays is extremely cumbersome and various modifications of the trays have been used in the past. Among these are the flexible <b>trays</b> and the <b>sectional</b> <b>trays</b> used with different modes of reassembling the segments extra orally after the impression is made. This article reviews the literature published from 1971 to 2015 concerning preliminary impression techniques used in making impressions for patients with microstomia based on various tray designs. An electronic search was performed across three databases (PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scolar) for relevant citations. The keywords/combinations used for the search were microstomia, limited/constricted/restricted mouth opening/oral access, trismus, <b>sectional</b> <b>trays,</b> impressions and prosthetic/prosthodontic rehabilitation.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Microstomia signifies any {{significant}} decrease {{in the size of}} the oral aperture. The etiology might include disease, trauma, burns and surgical complications in the peri-oral areas. This article describes a practical method for the treatment of a maxillary-edentulous patient with severe microstomia. Materials and Methods: The patient was a 40 -year-old woman who was completely edentulous in the maxilla, with severe microstomia. Due to reduced mouth opening, all the clinical procedures, from selection of a prefabricated tray for initial impression to designing the final prosthesis, are difficult and it is impossible to use a conventional impression tray and denture in such patients. Implant treatment was not possible for the patient because of financial problems; therefore, complete denture was the best choice. A sectional denture that can be worn and removed easily can be a treatment of choice for such patients. The primary impression in this patient was taken by a <b>sectional</b> <b>tray</b> and putty and wash. The special 2 -sectional tray was fabricated for the patient. Then a 2 -sectional denture was fabricated by ball attachment and finally was assembled in her mouth by palatal strap frame. In the first fallow-up of the patient after 1 year, she was satisfied with the esthetic and function of the denture, in addition to proper fit and stability of denture, without any traumatic injuries. Results: Sectional dentures that are easily worn and removed can be successfully used for the treatment of patients with microstomia. Conclusion: Complete denture, Impression technique, Microstomia.

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} dies made from dual arch impressions using different <b>sectional</b> dual arch <b>trays,</b> combinations of elastomeric impression materials, and the sequence of pour of dies. Subjects and Methods: The dual arch impression materials were grouped into three groups depending on the combination of impression materials used and each group is subdivided into four subgroups. A sample size of 8 in each subgroup yielding a total 96 impressions will be made into three groups of 32 each (Group I, II, and III). Group I constitute impressions made using monophase (M) impression material, Group II constitute impressions made using combination of heavy body and light body (HL), and Group III constitute impressions made using combination of putty and light body (PL). Dies obtained were evaluated with a travelling microscope to measure the buccolingual width of the tooth at the margin by using the sharp corners of the notches as reference points. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive analysis namely mean and standard deviation, {{one-way analysis of variance}} test. Results: The results obtained in this study indicate that though not statistically significant, the metal dual arch trays performed better when compared to the plastic trays in reproducing die dimensions.
