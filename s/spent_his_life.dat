5|$|The French, led by Charles, {{similarly}} {{sought to}} expand their influence; Charles seized Sicily and Byzantine territory while marrying his daughters to the Latin claimants to Byzantium. To create his own claim to the throne of Jerusalem, Charles executed one rival and purchased {{the rights to the}} city from another. In 1270 Charles turned his brother King LouisIX's last Crusade, known as the Eighth Crusade, to his own advantage by persuading Louis to attack his rebel Arab vassals in Tunis. Louis' army was devastated by disease, and Louis himself died at Tunis on 25August. Louis' fleet returned to France, leaving only Prince Edward, the future king of England, and a small retinue to continue {{what is known as the}} Ninth Crusade. Edward survived an assassination attempt organised by Baibars, negotiated a ten-year truce, and then returned to manage his affairs in England. This ended the last significant crusading effort in the Eastern Mediterranean. The 1281 election of a French pope, MartinIV, brought the full power of the papacy into line behind Charles. He prepared to launch a crusade against Constantinople but, in what became known as the Sicilian Vespers, an uprising fomented by MichaelVIII Palaiologos deprived him of the resources of Sicily, and Peter III of Aragon was proclaimed king of Sicily. In response, Martin excommunicated Peter and called for an Aragonese Crusade, which was unsuccessful. In 1285 Charles died, having <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> trying to amass a Mediterranean empire; he and Louis had viewed themselves as God's instruments to uphold the papacy.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} his Engineering degree, Drew practiced engineering in Puerto Rico and Venezuela. However, he {{became interested in}} the teaching profession instead. His first teaching jobs were in economically deprieved rural areas of the Puerto Rican country side, including Adjuntas. He subsequently moved to Ponce to teach in schools in Ponce's urban zone. His teaching subjects included physics, English as a second language, French, and Spanish. Drew <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> teaching at the Ponce High School, starting under its first principal, Chales H. Terry.

25|$|Cameron was baptised in Little Dunkeld in Perthshire, Scotland on 6 January 1800 and was {{a direct}} lineal {{descendant}} of MacIain Chief of Glencoe. His early years were spent in and around Murthly Castle where he learned carpentry. His father Thomas <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> {{in the service of}} the laird of Murthly. The LMS mission in Madagascar, established in 1820, accepted Cameron's petition to serve five years later when he was 25 years of age. Prior to arriving in Madagascar in September 1826 during the reign of the progressive King Radama I, he spent a year in Manchester assisting with the development of machinery which would eventually be installed at Amparibe, Madagascar, to modernize the production of cotton yarn.|$|E
25|$|Bacon met George Dyer in 1963 at a pub, {{although}} a much-repeated myth claims their acquaintance started during the younger man's burglary into the artist's apartment. Dyer was about 30 years old, from London's East End. He {{came from a}} family steeped in crime, and had till then <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> drifting between theft, detention and jail. Bacon's earlier relationships had been with older and tumultuous men. His first lover, Peter Lacy, tore up the artist's paintings, beat him in drunken rages, at times leaving him on streets half-conscious. Bacon was now the dominating personality; attracted to Dyer's vulnerability and trusting nature. Dyer was impressed by Bacon's self-confidence and artistic success, and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man.|$|E

25|$|Just as Ricci <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> in China, {{others of}} his {{followers}} did the same. This level of commitment was necessitated by logistical reasons: Travel from Europe to China took many months, and sometimes years; and learning the country's language and culture was even more time-consuming. When a Jesuit from China did travel back to Europe, he typically did it as a representative ("procurator") of the China Mission, entrusted {{with the task of}} recruiting more Jesuit priests to come to China, ensuring continued support for the Mission from the Church's central authorities, and creating favorable publicity for the Mission and its policies by publishing both scholarly and popular literature about China and Jesuits. One time the Chongzhen Emperor was nearly converted to Christianity and broke his idols.|$|E
25|$|The {{school was}} {{completed}} in 1888 and named the Saint Peter Claver Colored Mission {{and was the first}} Catholic school for blacks in San Antonio. It was also the first free school for African Americans in the city. The school was named for a Jesuit saint, Saint Peter Claver, who had <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> helping slaves in Spain. In order to staff the church with priests, she sought help from the Saint Joseph Society of the Sacred Heart (Josephites), which had a mission of ministry to African Americans. Murphy's finished church had 500 seats, a rectory and a school, all of which was financed solely by Murphy. Bishop Neraz dedicated the building and its name on Sunday, September 16, 1888. The school had 120 students attending on opening day which was September 17, 1888.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} of the early texts suggests that he was born as Siddhārtha Gautama in Lumbini {{and grew up in}} Kapilavasthu, a town in the plains region of the modern Nepal-India border, and that he <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> in what is now modern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Some hagiographic legends state that his father was a king named Suddhodana, his mother was queen Maya, and he was born in Lumbini gardens. However, scholars such as Richard Gombrich consider this a dubious claim because a combination of evidence suggests he was born in the Shakyas community – one that later gave him the title Shakyamuni, and the Shakya community was governed by a small oligarchy or republic-like council where there were no ranks but where seniority mattered instead. Some of the stories about Buddha, his life, his teachings, and claims about the society he grew up in may have been invented and interpolated at a later time into the Buddhist texts.|$|E
