Julia later recalled, [...] " [...] was writing amazing songs ... had shown me how to play guitar in Bolivia, and those songs had gotten me through that year". She elaborated [...] "At that time the guitar was a new thing for me. I'd just bought it because I wanted to start learning. So we're {{in the middle of the}} jungle in Chalalan with this guitar and Angus was playing us these songs he'd been writing. I hadn't really been around him that much for the last couple of years – once I finished school I moved in with my boyfriend and Angus was off surfing and skating – and all of a sudden we're in the middle of the jungle and he's singing these songs that are so beautiful <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to teach me some songs and that was the start of learning guitar and our friendship, I suppose, and the start of us having this amazing experience".|$|E
60|$|I did not by {{any means}} relish the manner and tone, in which all this was said: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what {{particular}} service he belonged to.|$|E

5000|$|Jacques had the {{strength}} - {{for which he was}} always criticised - to say out loud what others would only whisper. <b>So,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> 'What have you taken?' he didn't drop his eyes before replying. He had {{the strength}} of conviction. Pierre Chanyon Anquetil ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{keep talking}} to <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{questions}} {{and he looks}} at his watch," [...] Millen said. [...] "I said, 'You got some place you need to be?' And he goes, 'Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Sorry, sir.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> another question, {{he looks at his}} watch and I said, 'You're done, get out of here." [...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't believe what I just witnessed, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I get on the phone and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell. Don't take Calvin Johnson, but don't take JaMarcus Russell." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It is easy {{to forget}} about his wealth of {{experience}} fighting the toughest fights {{in the name of}} fairness and civil rights. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> always <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> what he’s up to and every conversation leads to something important and enriching." [...] ~ Rodney A. Coggin, publications director of the Virginia State Bar ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wondered}} what Hunky Magee {{thought about his}} own story; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{if he had any}} theories about reincarnation and transmogrification and such mysteries as he had touched upon.|$|E
6000|$|Her eyelids fell to {{shut out}} his gaze. [...] "Well--after your visit I couldn't find courage to fulfill my promise--and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to release me--and he did--he was very kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{first step}} was to restore confidence, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> {{speaking}} pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears, [...] "Would you like some sugar to get your flies around again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Could not {{the ghost}} with the close red cap, [...] My Pollajolo, the twice a craftsman, [...] 210 [...] Save me a sample, {{give me the}} hap [...] Of a muscular Christ that shows the draftsman?

6000|$|I could never, igad, as I {{came home}} from the tavern, meet a [...] {{watchman}} or <b>so,</b> but <b>I</b> presently <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> 'Baron Tell-clock of the [...] night, pr'ythee how goes the time?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{may seem}} strange, but {{such is the}} fact, that even when thus {{surrounded}} by danger my curiosity was <b>so</b> great that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> even before {{he had time to}} explain how he hoped to effect our rescue, where he had been so long.|$|R
6000|$|I {{suspected}} him, {{and determined}} to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> point-blank, [...] "Why may I not go tonight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look. I {{begged him}} to put my name, though {{he said it was}} a pity to do it with his left hand; I didn't like to wait, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> at least to write N. W. May, and the date." ...|$|E
60|$|With all his self-confidence, this officer did {{not seem}} to me to be more than my own age, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> whether he had seen any service. His {{moustache}} bristled with indignation at my question, and he looked me up and down with a severe eye.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{just where}} the whole {{business}} slips up,' replied Jim, prodding {{the table with a}} pen in a misanthropic manner. 'Betting's the one thing he's absolutely down on. He got done rather badly once a few years ago. Believe he betted on Orme that year he got poisoned. Anyhow he's always sworn to lynch us if we made fools of ourselves that way. <b>So</b> if <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> I'd not only get beans myself, besides not getting any money out of him, but Allen would get scalped too, which he wouldn't see at all.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} Pete Seeger's [...] "Ballad of Sherman Wu" [...] are {{patterned}} after [...] "Streets of Laredo'" [...] and {{is set to}} the same tune. The song presages the American Civil Rights Movement and recounts the refusal of Northwestern University's Psi Upsilon fraternity to accept Sherman Wu because of his Chinese heritage. The song deliberately echoes [...] "Streets of Laredo", beginning:As I was out walking the streets of Northwestern,I spied a young freshman, dejected and blue.And <b>so</b> when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Why are you dejected?",He said [...] "I'm Chinese, and I can't join Psi U." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help it, father," [...] she {{answered}} coolly. [...] "He was with Mrs. Quest when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> had to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> too. Besides, <b>I</b> rather like Mr. Cossey, he is always <b>so</b> polite, and <b>I</b> don't see why you should take such a violent prejudice against him. Anyhow, he is coming, {{and there is an}} end of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had heard}} {{about some of these}} things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought he}} would be a good person to learn {{interesting}} things from, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he would mind telling me something about the whale fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Please, Berta,' he whispered, 'Mr. Ladywell has called, and I've {{showed him}} into the liberry. You know, Berta, {{this is how it}} was, you know: I thought you and Mr. Julian were in the drawing-room, and wouldn't want him to see ye together, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to step into the liberry a minute.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There again I am puzzled. His work {{is known}} even in Germany. His {{articles}} are reprinted in German and Austrian reviews. You would {{expect him to}} have a certain authority of manner. You would expect there to be discussion at the table upon questions of philosophy and aesthetics.... It is not <b>so.</b> When <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> questions it is often that they are not seriously answered. Sometimes it is as if he did not like the questions I askt of him. Yesterday I askt of him did he agree or did he not agree with Mr. Bernard Shaw. He just said--I wrote it down in my memoranda--he said: 'Oh! Mixt Pickles.' What can one understand of that?--Mixt Pickles!"...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had been}} a fan of Khru Hem’s {{drawings}} since 1944, when <b>I</b> was 14. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> wrote <b>him</b> <b>asking</b> to become his student. He was a great teacher and taught me a lot, from how to draw anatomy to getting the right perspective on paintings. I learned all this from his letters," [...] Payut told The Nation newspaper in a 2004 interview.|$|R
60|$|BENTLEY. Yes. Thats {{an idea of}} mine. I knew a chap named Joey Percival at Oxford (you know I was {{two months}} at Balliol before I was sent down for telling the old woman who was head of that silly college what I jolly well thought of him. He would have been glad to have me back, too, {{at the end of}} six months; but I wouldnt go: I just let him want; and serve him right!) Well, Joey was a most awfully clever fellow, and <b>so</b> nice! <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what made such a {{difference}} between him and all the other pups--they were pups, if you like. He told me it was very simple: they had only one father apiece; and he had three.|$|R
60|$|So {{we bought}} the {{horse in the}} Lowther Arcade, Porthos, who thought it was for him, looking proud but uneasy, and it {{was sent to the}} bandbox house anonymously. About a week {{afterward}} I had the ill-luck to meet Mary's a husband in Kensington, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what he had called his little girl.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{beautiful}} day, of the lamb-like entrance weather of March, {{and on the way}} home Miss Adeline was met taking advantage of the noontide sunshine to exchange her book at the library, 'where,' she said, 'I found Mr. White reading the papers, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to meet Jasper at luncheon, thinking that may be useful.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Very true. It {{was plain}} that the Englishman had studied the matter from all sides. Still I thought I might catch him on one point; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why the modern empire {{did not make}} the nation's cream in the Heidelberg Tun, instead of leaving it to rot away unused. But he {{answered}} as one prepared-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "P.S. I {{have had}} news of you through Mr. Worthington, of your [...] colony, {{who is just}} arrived here.

He does not call them so. Since your [...] modesty will not permit you to write me any of these things, I have [...] been imagining you driving slaves with a rawhide, and seeding [...] runaway convicts to the mines. Mr. W. is even now paying his [...] respects to Miss Manners, and I doubt not trumpeting your praises [...] there, for he seems to like you. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to join the [...] Bear mess.

6000|$|She was {{so excited}} {{that she could not}} speak connectedly at first, the practised air which she had brought home with her having disappeared. Calming herself she added, 'I am not disturbed, and nothing has happened. Only {{he said he wanted to}} ask me something, some day; and I said never mind that now. He hasn't asked yet, and is coining to speak to you about it. He would have done <b>so</b> to-night, only <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> not to be in a hurry. But he will come to-morrow, I am sure!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As far as I can tell, none. That man Pratt {{knew that}} he had not done <b>so</b> {{yesterday}} afternoon. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what were the intentions of his blackguard friend, {{and he said that he}} did not know--that Crosbie would probably have written to me. Then he brought me this letter. There it is," [...] and the squire threw the letter over the table; [...] "read it and let me have it back. He thinks probably that the trouble is now over as far as he is concerned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{did write}} it," [...] she cried, pouring out her soul in {{a torrent of}} words. [...] "I did write it. Why should I deny it? I {{have no reason to}} be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I {{believed}} that if I had an interview I could gain his help, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to meet me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{rather a}} {{favorite}} {{with the first}} officer," [...] the lad said. [...] "The men who desired to leave were to be discharged at once and a fresh gang taken on board, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> directly the news came round if I might have four days away. He agreed at once, and I came down by the night coach; and here I am for eight-and-forty hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Mender, [...] "he didn't git a mite of {{satisfaction}} out of me. I've seen enough of {{his kind of}} folks {{to know how to}} deal with 'em, and I told him <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what they meant by sending that slick Mr. Tooting 'raound to offer me five hundred dollars.

60|$|For {{another week}} or more I {{remained}} upon the Blanche waiting till my full strength returned, also because Kari said <b>I</b> must do <b>so.</b> When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why, he replied {{for the reason that}} he wished news of my coming to spread far and wide throughout the land from one tribe to another, which it would do with great swiftness, flying, as he put it, like a bird. Meanwhile, every day I sat upon the poop in the armour for an hour or more, and both these people and others from afar came to look at me, bringing me presents in such quantity that we knew not what to do with them. Indeed, they built an altar and sacrificed wild creatures to me, and birds, burning them with fire. Both those that I had seen and the other folk from a long way off made this offering.|$|R
500|$|On June 12, 2005, Milla Jovovich was {{announced}} to reprise {{her role as}} the heroine Alice.

[...] Sienna Guillory was planned to reprise her role as Jill Valentine; however, she passed on the role, citing commitments to Eragon. On May 9, 2006, Oded Fehr was confirmed to reprise his role of Carlos Olivera, as well as Iain Glen, Spencer Locke and Ashanti Douglas who were added to the cast. It was rumored that Debra Marshall was originally cast as Cindy Lennox. However, it was proven to be only a rumor.
