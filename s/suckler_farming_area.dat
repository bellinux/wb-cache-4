40|$|Agriculture is {{responsible}} for {{a large share of}} global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially for methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Applying a bio-economic whole-farm model, we assessed five GHG mitigation options on their economic suitability to reduce emissions from grassland-based <b>suckler</b> cow <b>farms.</b> Among the assessed options, only compensation by agroforestry systems and the choice of an adequate production system showed the potential to significantly reduce emissions. If an adequate production system is chosen, GHG emissions per kilogram of meat can be reduced by up to 18 % – from 21. 9 to 18 kg CO 2 -eq. /kg of meat – while total gross margin can be increased by up to 14 %. Through the application of an agroforestry system, GHG emissions in all systems can be further reduced to 7. 5 kg CO 2 -eq. /kg meat – equating to a reduction of GHG emissions of 48 % to 66 % – at costs between 0. 03 CHF/kg meat and 0. 38 CHF/kg meat depending on the production system and the state of the system before the reduction. In contrast, the addition of lipids to the diet or a cover to the slurry tank has neither the potential to reduce GHG emissions significantly nor are they cost-effective enough to be implemented. Nitrification inhibitors can reduce GHG emissions up to 10 %, but costs for this reduction are much higher than for agroforestry systems. The application of agroforestry systems to <b>suckler</b> <b>farming</b> in Switzerland therefore seems to be an adequate option to reduce GHG emission significantly for a relatively low price.

40|$|The {{conversion}} to OF for three specialized <b>suckler</b> cattle <b>farming</b> systems was simulated by coupling an economic optimization model (“Opt'INRA”) {{with a model}} assessing on‐renewable energy (NRE) consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (“PLANETE”). Based on average prices over 2004 ‐ 2008, and after adaptation of the production system, we analyzed the productive, environmental and economic impacts of the conversion process. The ban on chemical fertilisers entails a drop in <b>farm</b> <b>area</b> productivity. For these specialized farms, meat production decreased by 19 to 37 % depending on the initial level of intensification. The reduced use of inputs results in a 23 to 45 % drop in non‐renewable energy consumption per hectare and a 5 to 16 % drop per ton of live weight produced. Due to its methane production, the cow is the biggest driver of GHG emissions. The shift to OF does significantly not affect gross GHG emissions per ton of live weight produced, but, taking into account carbon sequestration in grasslands, net GHG emissions could be lower for OF systems. The lower productivity per hectare (less animals reared per ha) allows a 26 to 34 % reduction in net GHG emissions per hectare of <b>farm</b> <b>area.</b> Economically, the drop in productivity is not compensated by the gain in the meat selling price (+ 5 to + 10 %), gross farm product drops by 9 to 16 %, and the lower use of inputs entails a strong drop in operational costs: ‐ 9 to ‐ 52 %. Farm income falls more than 20 % (‐ 7 to ‐ 46 %) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is described}} {{to establish the}} relative financial benefit of farm animal disease prevention (biosecurity). This methodology is demonstrated using the example of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) incursion on beef <b>suckler</b> <b>farms</b> in Scotland. A random sample of 276 herds was taken and a proportion of young stock on each farm tested for previous exposure to BVDV. There was evidence that 0. 4 of herds had been exposed over one year prior to sampling. All herds completed a questionnaire about their biosecurity practices. The influence of these practices on relative risk of BVDV was subjected to a Chi squared test and practices ranked accordingly. Most important risk factors were animal buying in strategy, farm size and a single farm boundary. The economic benefit/disbenefit of these strategies was assessed using a bio-economic model of a 10 -year BVDV epidemic. Expected output losses due to BVDV infection and risk were affected by biosecurity strategy and by level of biosecurity threat. The implications of these findings for animal health strategy at farm and regional level are discussed. Livestock Production/Industries, Biosecurity, BVD, Economic Impact,...|$|R

40|$|The {{agricultural}} sector {{is being called}} upon to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). A scenario approachwas developed to explore the plausible futures of the French bovine sector {{and their impact on}} climate change. These scenarios encompass a Business As Usual scenario (S 1 -BAU) and alternative contrasting scenarios: (S 2) cattle production increase to meet a high global demand under a liberal policy, (S 3) refocus on internal demandwithin France, with an upmarket move to ‘green’ products, (S 4) committed public policy to reduce GHGemissions. This paper analyses how key drivers of these scenarios (e. g. subsidies on investment, reduction ofmarket risks, carbon tax, limitation of concentrate feed in animal diets) affect the evolution of production,economics, and environmental impact on climate change of typical French suckler cow and dairy farms, bymeans of simulations performed with a bio-economic model. To adapt their farming systems to the scenarios,farms can opt for variably intensive/integrated practices per animal and per unit land area. Some technologicalprogress in animal production, crop production, and farm equipment is also modeled. Results show that in S 1 -BAU, milk production, net income and impact on climate change of dairy farms rise. Beef production and impacton climate change decrease slightly in <b>suckler</b> cow <b>farms.</b> Impact on climate change per unit of product decreasesowing to higher productivity per animal and to a more integrated management of crop production. Alternativescenarios underline that reorienting public support toward farm investment would further intensify dairy farmsand increase their income, but would reduce production and income of <b>suckler</b> cow <b>farms</b> and favor crop production(S 2). Climate change impact per unit of product is more strongly reduced in S 3 (organic farming withlow feed concentrate) than in S 2, but with a reduced production, particularly for milk.
