25|$|Intersection <b>sight</b> <b>{{distance}}</b> is the <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> {{needed to}} safely proceed through an intersection. The distance needed {{depends on the}} type of traffic control at the intersection (uncontrolled, yield sign, stop sign or signal), and the maneuver (left turn, right turn, or proceeding straight). All-way stop intersections need the least, and uncontrolled intersections require the most. Intersection <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> is a key factor in whether no control or yield control can be safely used, or more restrictive control in needed.|$|E
25|$|Drivers at intersections with all-way {{stop control}} or traffic signals need the least <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> At all-way stops, drivers {{need to be}} able to see {{vehicles}} stopped at other approaches. At signals, drivers approaching the intersections need to see the signal heads. In jurisdictions that allow right turn on red, drivers in the right lane stop control need the same <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as two-way stop control. Although not needed during normal operations, additional <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> should be provided for signal malfunctions and power outages.|$|E
25|$|Warning {{signs are}} often used where <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> is insufficient. The US MUTCD {{requires}} Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead or Signal Ahead signs at intersections where the traffic control device is not visible from a distance equal to the stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> at speed of approaching traffic. Hill Blocks View signs can be used where crest vertical curves restrict <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> However, many jurisdictions still expect drivers to use ordinary care regarding conditions readily apparent to a driver, without the prompting of a sign. The care and focus ordinarily required of a driver against certain types of hazards may be somewhat amplified on roads with lower functional classification. The probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of access points, and this density should be readily apparent to a driver even when a specific access point is not. For this reason, full corner <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> is almost never required for individual driveways in urban high-density residential areas, and street parking is commonly permitted within the right-of-way.|$|E
40|$|Background/purpose: In the {{fabrication}} of casting post and core or inlay the line {{angle of the}} cavity floor can be seen even when the internal axial walls are parallel or slightly convergent. It is conceivable that more <b>sighted</b> <b>distance</b> will be required for internal axial walls evaluation compared with external axial walls evaluation. The aim {{of the study is}} to derive a practical and convenient method and data for the evaluation of the divergent angle of internal axial walls. Materials and methods: Through a scientific analysis, this study derived a practical and convenient method and data for the evaluation of the divergent angle of internal axial walls. The <b>sighted</b> <b>distance</b> between occlusal line angle and the cavity floor line angle at 30 -cm distance was calculated by an established formula and expressed in 6 °, 12 °, and 18 ° of internal axial walls divergent angle respectively. Results: Tables 1 – 3 show the value of <b>sighted</b> <b>distance</b> with cavities of 6 °, 12 °, and 18 ° tapering. Based on the data, if more divergent angle is prepared; more <b>sighted</b> <b>distance</b> will be observed. Conclusion: Compared with the teeth preparation of external axial wall in a single crown, the <b>sighted</b> <b>distance</b> at 30 -cm distance in the internal axial wall is 1. 5  × wider. More <b>sighted</b> <b>distances</b> are required to prevent undesired undercuts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{settlement}} observation usually adopts precision geometric leveling method, {{to improve}} the accuracy, generally requiring the value of central cross-hair {{to be in the}} range of 0. 5 m to 2. 8 m. However, it may easily exceed the range in the regions that have big value of slope. After analyzing, the conclusion is as follow: when the value of slope is certain, we can adjust the height of instrument, <b>sighting</b> <b>distance</b> and distance of slope, so as to make the value of central cross-hair in the range of our requirement. Thus make a compromise of the measurement efficiency and accuracy of measurement. When the values of slope are in the range of 10 degree to 20 degree, the critical values of <b>sighting</b> <b>distance</b> and distance of slope vary greatly. In the process of actual field measurement, combining with the slope acquisition method, taking the critical values of <b>sighting</b> <b>distance</b> and distance of slope as experience values, and it achieves a good effect...|$|R

25|$|The <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> {{needed for}} a given {{situation}} is the distance travelled during the two phases of a driving maneuver: perception-reaction time (PRT), and maneuver time (MT). Perception-reaction time is {{the time it takes}} for a road user to realize that a reaction is needed to a road condition, decided what maneuver is appropriate, and start the maneuver. Maneuver time is {{the time it takes to}} complete the maneuver. The distance driven during perception-reaction time and maneuver time is the <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> needed.|$|E
25|$|Stopping <b>sight</b> <b>{{distance}}</b> is {{the distance}} traveled during perception-reaction time (while the vehicle driver perceives a situation requiring a stop, realizes that stopping is necessary, and applies the brake), and maneuver time (while the driver decelerates {{and comes to}} a stop). Actual stopping distances are also affected by road conditions, {{the mass of the}} car, the incline of the road, and numerous other factors. For design, a conservative distance is needed to allow a vehicle traveling at design speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. Typically the design <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> allows a below-average driver to stop in time to avoid a collision.|$|E

50|$|The {{crossing}} of Onehunga Harbour Road was historically very difficult, as traffic was fast and heavy with over 15,000 vehicles daily (due {{to the nearby}} port and the motorway ramps) and <b>sight</b> <b>distances</b> were also limited by the strong curve of {{the road in the}} vicinity.|$|R
25|$|Corner <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> (CSD) is {{the road}} {{alignment}} specification {{which provides a}} substantially clear line of sight so that the driver of a vehicle, bicyclist or pedestrian waiting at the crossroad may safely anticipate the driver of an approaching vehicle. Corner sight provides an adequate time for the waiting user to either cross all lanes of through traffic, cross the near lanes and turn left, or turn right, without requiring through traffic to radically alter their speed.|$|E
25|$|All public {{crossings}} in the United States {{are required}} to be marked by at least a crossbuck. The 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices requires passive crossings (crossings without actuated flashing lights or gates) to have either stop signs or yield signs {{in addition to the}} crossbuck, unless a flagger will stop traffic every time a train approaches. Normally a yield sign is used, unless it is determined that all vehicles should stop at the crossing, such as a location with poor <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> All passive crossings must be upgraded to meet this standard by December 31, 2019.|$|E

500|$|Critics praised Wipeout 2048 {{graphics}} and visuals, calling them {{a showcase for}} the PlayStation Vita's power. Cam Shea of IGN enjoyed the game's detail and depth but questioned its visual design, saying that the game's darker environments and cluttered worlds made the tracks ambiguous and less readable. Adam Goodall of Gameplanet called the graphics stunning {{and said that the}} game had a pervasive artistic statement, something he considered rare in video games (particularly racing games). According to Digital Spys Mark Langshaw and GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey, the game's backdrops were superior to Wipeout HD; Langshaw said that they showcased the PlayStation Vita's graphical prowess. David Meikleham of the Official PlayStation Magazine wrote that Wipeout 2048 [...] "brilliantly shows off" [...] the new hardware with its attractive lighting effects, solid frame rate and wide range of colours, and Dan Ryckert of Game Informer said that its fast-paced races [...] "do a good job" [...] of displaying the Vita's graphical capabilities. Frédéric Goyon of Jeuxvideo.com liked the game's utilisation of the PlayStation Vita's OLED screen, although he saw little difference between the graphical enhancements of Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD. According to Goyon, the game was [...] "fluid in all circumstances" [...] and was essentially Wipeout HD on a smaller screen. Heath Hindman of Game Revolution said that although it [...] "really shows off" [...] the PlayStation Vita's graphical power (along with Uncharted: Golden Abyss, another launch title), the game's <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> was limited. Wipeout 2048 track design was largely praised. Simon Parkin of The Guardian enjoyed its [...] "wholly contemporary" [...] track details and visual consistency with previous instalments, and Peter Willington of Pocket Gamer called the game's track design the best in the series. According to Sebastian Haley of VentureBeat, Wipeout 2048 would have benefited from a [...] "slightly braver" [...] track design.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} design criterion for these curves is headlight <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> When a driver is driving on a sag curve at night, the <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> {{is limited by}} the higher grade in front of the vehicle.

50|$|Originally, signals {{displayed}} simple stop/proceed indications. As {{traffic density}} increased, this {{proved to be}} too limiting and refinements were added.

This allowed for an overall increase in speed, since train drivers {{no longer had to}} drive at a speed within <b>sighting</b> <b>distance</b> of the stop signal.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the long}} {{distance}} required to bring a moving train to a stand, distant signals must be located on the approach to the corresponding stop signal by at least the braking distance of the worst braked train to use the route.
