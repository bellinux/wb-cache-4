40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the specificity of Src homology 2 (SH 2) and phosphotyrosine-binding domain interactions are mediated by phosphorylated tyrosines and their neighboring amino acids. Two of the first phosphotyrosine-based binding sites were found on middle T antigen of polyoma virus. Tyr- 250 acts as a binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> ShcA, whereas Tyr- 315 forms a binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> the SH 2 domain of the p 85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. However, genetic analysis of a given phosphotyrosine's role in signaling can be complicated when it serves as a binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> multiple proteins. The situation is particularly difficult when the phosphotyrosine serves as a secondary binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> a protein with primary binding determinates elsewhere. Mutation of a tyrosine residue to phenylalanine blocks association of all bound proteins. Here we show that the mutation of the amino acids following the phosphorylated tyrosine to alanine can reveal phosphotyrosine function as a secondary binding site, while abrogating the phosphotyrosine motif's role as a primary binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> SH 2 domains. We tested this methodology by using middle T antigen. Our results suggest that Tyr- 250 is a secondary binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, whereas Tyr- 315 is a secondary binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> a yet-to-be-identified protein, which is critical for transformation...|$|R
