25|$|It is {{not clear}} how the cell determines the {{locations}} of de novo DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that, for many (though not all) locations, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is involved. In RdDM, specific RNA transcripts are produced from a genomic DNA template, and this RNA forms secondary structures called double-stranded RNA molecules. The double-stranded RNAs, through either the small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) pathways direct de-novo DNA methylation of the original genomic location that produced the RNA. This sort of mechanism is thought to be important in cellular defense against RNA viruses and/or transposons, both of which often form a double-stranded RNA that can be mutagenic to the host genome. By methylating their genomic locations, through an as yet poorly understood mechanism, they are shut off and are no longer active in the cell, protecting the genome from their mutagenic effect. Recently, it was described that methylation of the DNA is the main determinant of embryogenic cultures formation from explants in woody plants and is regarded the main mechanism that explains the poor response of mature explants to <b>somatic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> in the plants (Isah 2016).|$|E

40|$|Primordial {{germ cells}} (PGCs) {{are the first}} germ cells {{distinguishable}} from surrounding <b>somatic</b> cells during <b>embryogenesis.</b> In many animal species PGC specification is generally classified into two modes: preformation, in which PGCs are determined by maternally inherited components in early development, and epigenesis, in which PGCs arise from proximal somatic cells by inductive signal in late development. In this review we focused {{on the process of}} PGC formation in molluscan bivalves and gastropods and compared the PGC specification modes of these two classes. Several reports indicated that bivalves tend to adopt preformation, as maternally inherited germline-specific genes are transcribed in specific blastomeres differentiating into PGCs. In gastropods, maternal germline-specific genes are transcribed in mesodermal stem cells. PGCs seem to be epigenetically determined from mesodermal stem cells by inductive signals after the veliger larval stage, which indicates that PGC precursor cells not only generate germline tissues but also generate mesodermal somatic tissues. The common origin of germline and mesodermal somatic tissues is observed in the annelids Platyhelminthes and Cnidaria, and is considered to be an ancient mode of germ cell determination. We suggest that gastropods retain the ancient PGC specification mode, while bivalves switch their PGC specification mode to preformation...|$|R
40|$|The inaccessibility of the zygote and proembryos of {{angiosperms}} {{within the}} surrounding maternal and filial tissues has hampered studies on early plant <b>embryogenesis.</b> <b>Somatic</b> and gametophytic embryo cultures {{are often used}} as alternative systems for molecular and biochemical studies on early embryogenesis, but are not widely used in developmental studies {{due to differences in}} the early cell division patterns with seed embryos. A new Brassica napus microspore embryo culture system, wherein embryogenesis highly mimics zygotic embryo development, is reported here. In this new system, the donor microspore first divides transversely to form a filamentous structure, from which the distal cell forms the embryo proper, while the lower part resembles the suspensor. In conventional microspore embryogenesis, the microspore divides randomly to form an embryonic mass that after a while establishes a protoderm and subsequently shows delayed histodifferentiation. In contrast, the embryo proper of filament-bearing microspore-derived embryos undergoes the same ordered pattern of cell division and early histodifferentiation as in the zygotic embryo. This observation suggests an important role for the suspensor in early zygotic embryo patterning and histodifferentiation. This is the first in vitro system wherein single differentiated cells in culture can efficiently regenerate embryos that are morphologically comparable to zygotic embryos. The system provides a powerful in vitro tool for studying the diverse developmental processes that take place during the early stages of plant embryogenesis...|$|R

40|$|How {{genome-wide}} approaches {{can be used}} {{to unravel}} the remaining secrets of the imprintome Wendy N. Cooper and Miguel Consta “ ncia Genomic imprinting is the differential expression of genes according to their transmitting parent and is achieved by labelling of the two alleles with different epigenetic marks. The majority of described imprinted genes are present in clusters with coordinate regulation. Multiple mechanisms are known to regulate this differential expression, including repression of one allele by the action of cis-acting macro non-coding RNAs, insulator elements, allele specific histone modifications and DNA methylation. A hallmark of all imprinted regions described so far is the presence of one or more differentially methylated regions (DMRs). A DMR is a nucleotide sequence rich in CpG dinucleotides that is specifically methylated on one parental chromosome and unmethylated on the allele derived from the other parent. This parent-specific differential methylation may be imparted during spermatogenesis or oogenesis (as is the case for gametic DMRs) or may be acquired during <b>embryogenesis</b> (<b>somatic</b> DMRs). This review will describe {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} some of the techniques that {{can be used to}} compare epigenetic marks between parental chromosomes and to understand how these marks affect the 3 D interactions and monoallelic expression at imprinted loci. Recent advances in sequencing technologies, in particular, provide exciting new opportunities to study imprinting.

40|$|Using {{the known}} {{sequences}} for serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and ceramide kinase (CERK) from Arabidopsis, {{candidates for the}} corresponding genes in Loblolly pine were cloned and examined during embryogenesis. The cloned two cDNA sequences from Loblolly pine, which has similarity of 81 % and 88 % respectively to two subunits of SPT 1 and SPT 2 in Arabidopsis, were presumed as the Loblolly pine SPT 1 and SPT 2 (Pt-SPT 1 and Pt-SPT 2). A few different versions of Pt-SPT 1 mRNAs (2223 nts, 756 nts, 822 nts, and 754 nts respectively), most likely the alternative splicing results, were found. Three of these mRNAs are capable of encoding proteins. The long version (2223 nts) encodes a protein with 484 amino acids (Pt-SPT 1); two short versions (822 nts, 756 nts) encode a 90 a. a. protein. Another cDNA sequence of 2396 nts encodes a protein of 493 a. a. (Pt-SPT 2). Both predicted Pt-SPT 1 and Pt-SPT 2 proteins possess highly conserved serine palmitoyltransferase functional domains (E value 5. 7 e- 61). Their expression patterns are different between <b>somatic</b> and zygotic <b>embryogenesis.</b> Two different versions of mRNAs, with 2786 nts (long), and 2320 nts (short) respectively, of ceramide kinases in Loblolly pine (Pt-CERKs) have been cloned. The long version encodes a protein with 721 a. a.; the short version with 560 a. a. The expression patterns for these two CERK mRNAs are different during embryo development. The long version is constitutively expressed, while the short one is only expressed in some stages with much lower expression level. Overexpression Pt-CERKL, Pt-CERKS, and Pt-CERKF in E. coli and function analysis in vitro show that all Pt-CERKs appear {{to have the same}} catalytic functions as their homologs in human and Arabidopsis, but with different efficiency. The catalytic efficiency was dramatically lower in the short Pt-CERK protein compared with the long Pt-CERK protein and Pt-CERKF. The membrane system is not necessary for the catalytic reactions of these three Pt-CERKs in vitro and Pt-CERKs were less dependent on the Ca 2 + ions. Thus, these studies have provided the first information about SPT- and CERK- like proteins in loblolly pine, and open new avenues of investigation for the roles of sphingolipids in embryonic development.

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster the visceral {{mesoderm}} (VM) develops during embryogenesis in {{a process}} where myoblasts become specified to generate two distinct cell types, the founder cells (FCs) and the fusion competent myoblasts (FCMs) that consequently fuses. The cell specification is dependent on cell signaling mediated by the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) and its ligand Jelly belly (Jeb), how this further sets up different identity programs that drive myoblasts to differentiate into FCs and FCMs is still not well understood. We have analysed whether the Midkine (MDK) /Pleiotrophin (PTN) homologues in Drosophila, Miple 1 and Miple 2 activate the Alk RTK in vivo. Earlier results from cell culture experiments suggested that vertebrate MDK/PTN is capable of activating ALK, findings that have become controversial with other studies showing contradictory results. We wanted to use Drosophila that have conserved homologues of both MDK/PTN and ALK, {{to address the question}} in vivo. We analysed the contribution of Miple in Alk dependent developmental processes such as visceral mesoderm (VM) specification during embryogenesis and in body size regulation of adult flies. Specification of VM as well as body size are not effected by loss of Miple proteins, and over expression of Miple proteins do not effect VM specification or body size. All together we conclude that {{there is no evidence that}} Miple 1 or Miple 2 can activate Alk in vivo. We found that loss of Miple protein effect the median lifespan of the fly which is reduced, interestingly the over expression of Miple proteins can promote an increased median life span in Drosophila. We have also analysed how Alk RTK signaling regulates the Gli-like transcription factor Lame duck (Lmd) in vivo on a post-translational level. It has already been reported that Lmd plays an essential role in specification of FCMs in the <b>somatic</b> mesoderm during <b>embryogenesis.</b> We detect Lmd protein exclusively in FCMs of VM in control embryos, but in Alk mutants Lmd protein is present in all cells of VM and opposite to this when Alk is activated in all cells in VM by over expression of Jeb this results in total loss of Lmd protein. This suggests that Alk signaling is regulating Lmd, and we additionally show that Lmd persist in FCMs in mutants where VM is specified but where myoblast fusion do not occur, supporting that Alk activity in FCs is regulating the downregulation of Lmd in FCMs upon fusion. Finally we have characterised the Rap 1 GEF C 3 G in vivo in Drosophila. In cell culture systems, the GTPase Rap 1 has been identified to mediate Alk signaling and that this is regulated by the GEF C 3 G and interestingly the Drosophila C 3 G is expressed in the FCs of VM. We generated deletion mutants of C 3 G which exhibit semi-lethality and reduced life span, but no defects in visceral mesoderm development during embryogenesis. Instead we detected distinct phenotypes in somatic muscles of 3 rd instar mutant larvae, with detachment and mistargeting of muscles, which effect localisation of integrins. We suggest that Drosophila C 3 G regulates Rap 1 via inside out signaling of integrins which in turn effects cell adhesion in vivo in Drosophila larval muscles...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Summer Savory (Satureja hortensis L.) is an annual, {{herbaceous}} plant {{belonging to the}} Labiatae family. This plant is most often used as a culinary herb, {{but it also has}} marked medicinal benefits, especially upon the whole digestive system. The most important components of S. hortensis include volatile oils, phenolic compounds, flavonoids and phenolic acids, tannins, mucus, resins, carotenoids and mineral components. Plant growth regulators are used to improve {{the quality and quantity of}} medicinal plant production. Salicylic Acid is one of this PGRs that involved in seed germination, photosynthesis, Stomatal opening and closure, Membrane Permeability, Ions Absorption and transmission and other growth processes. Polyamines are ubiquitous low-molecular-weight aliphatic amines that are involved in regulating plant growth processes. The most commonly found polyamines in higher plants, putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) may be present in free, soluble conjugated and insoluble bound forms. It has been demonstrated that PAs are important for the normal course of diverse plant ontogeny processes such as cell division and elongation, organogenesis and <b>somatic</b> and zygotic <b>embryogenesis.</b> Materials and Methods This experiment was conducted in factorial based on a randomized complete block design with three replications in Karaj, Iran. Foliar spraying with SA (1, 2 and 3 mM. l) and Putrecine (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg l- 1) was performed in thrice in Savory growth period. Spraying was performed at 21, 35 (Budding Phase) and 56 (flowering initiation phase) day after seed germination. In flowering stage, some morphological traits such as plant height, weight, yield, canopy diameter, stem diameter, leaf area, essential oil content and efficiency were measured. Results and Discussion Analysis of variance showed that the effects of salicylic acid and putrescine spraying on plant height, canopy diameter, stem diameter, number of axillary stems, foliage dry weight, foliage yield, flower dry weight, number of leaves, leaf dry weight, leaf yield, leaf area index (LAI), number of inflorescence, dry weight of inflorescence, total chlorophyll content, chlorophyll a and b content, essential oil content, yield and efficiency was significant (P< 0. 01). Application of 100 mg. l putrescine resulted in maximum plant height (45. 67 cm) that showed a significant difference with control and 1 mM. l SA treatments. Highest number of inflorescence per plant obtained in pots spraying with 150 and 200 mg. l putrescine and 3 mM l- 1 SA. It seems that spraying with putrescine improved vegetative growth through production enhancement of biosynthetic enzymes. Putrescine increased the cell division in plant tissues due to the presence of nitrogen in its structure. Treatment with putrescine significantly improved plant height in Matthiola incana. In response to spraying with 3 mM. l SA amounts of stem diameter, number of leaves per plant, dry weight and yield of leaves and number of inflorescences were significantly increased in comparison with other treatments. Highest values of axillary stems, dry weight of aerial parts, weight of flowering stems, leaf area index and inflorescence yield were also observed in 3 mM l- 1 treatments but it did not show significant deference with any of the other treatments. It was well documented that salicylic acid exert their influence on physiological and biochemical processes, including, photosynthesis, ion uptake, membrane permeability, enzyme activities, flowering, heat production and growth and development of plants. SA can increase growth parameters in Summer Savory by enhancing photosynthetic rate and nitrate metabolism. SA increased the activity of nitrate reductase both in leaves and roots of maize plants. Maximum total chlorophyll content was obtained in plants, spraying with 1 and 3 mM l- 1 SA that was significant. Application of 1 and 3 mM l- 1 SA resulted in higher amounts of chlorophyll a and b, respectively. Moreover, all putrescine concentrations eventuated to significant increase in chlorophyll contents compared to control treatments. Talaat (33) reported that foliar application of putrescine increased chlorophyll and carotenoids content, soluble and non-soluble sugar, proteins and alkaloids in sweet pepper. Based on Figure 2, it was clear that the yield of aerial parts and flowering stems gradually increased with addition of SA concentration and reached its maximum at the 3 mM l- 1 treatment. However the significant difference between putrescine concentrations was not observed. Conclusions This study revealed that foliar application of SA and putrescine significantly affected the morphological, physiological and biochemical traits of Satureja hortensis. Thus, it can be used as a plant growth regulator for yield and essential oil content improvement in field production of this plant...|$|R

50|$|<b>Somatic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> is an {{artificial}} {{process in which}} a plant or embryo is derived from a single somatic cell or group of somatic cells. Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved {{in the development of}} embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo. Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form from the callus. The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant. Somatic embryos are mainly produced in vitro and for laboratory purposes, using either solid or liquid nutrient media which contain plant growth regulators (PGR’s). The main PGRs used are auxins but can contain cytokinin in a smaller amount. Shoots and roots are monopolar while somatic embryos are bipolar, allowing them to form a whole plant without culturing on multiple media types. <b>Somatic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> has served as a model to understand the physiological and biochemical events that occur during plant developmental processes as well as a component to biotechnological advancement.
