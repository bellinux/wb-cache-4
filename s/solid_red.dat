5|$|The breed {{has four}} main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> of various shades. Red {{includes}} sable (red where {{the tips of the}} hairs are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red with brown overlay).|$|E
5|$|The first, iconic uniforms the Raptors wore back in 1995 were {{extraordinarily}} busy, as they featured {{black and}} white tears as pin stripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw {{on one side of}} the shorts, a raptor biting the ‘T’ of the ‘TR’ franchise acronym on the other side, and were rounded up with a giant, aggressive-looking raptor dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled new jerseys in 1999−00, launching a unique road jersey which had a purple front and a black back. In 2003−04, the Raptors introduced a <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006−07 onward, as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From 2008−09 through 2014−15, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.|$|E
50|$|The Yankees {{would add}} three more {{runs in the}} seventh to put the game away. New York's seven-run output equaled what the Bronx Bombers were able to put up {{combined}} in their first three games as <b>solid</b> <b>Reds</b> starting pitching, combined with a wounded Mantle, kept the New York offense sputtering. That would change in Game 5.|$|R

50|$|The apple has a striking, striped or <b>solid,</b> light <b>red</b> color. Its {{taste is}} sweet {{like that of}} 'Gala', but more aromatic; its texture is more solid and crunchy than that of 'Elstar'.|$|R
5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E
25|$|The white text on red {{background}} {{appearance is}} usually the same. Exceptions include Japan, which uses an inverted <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> triangle, and Zimbabwe, which uses a disc bearing a black cross.|$|E
25|$|Red (liver) with {{or without}} tan points or white {{markings}} on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly - either white or tan points are required. <b>Solid</b> <b>red</b> dogs are equally desirable as ones with tan or white.|$|E
50|$|The R12s bore several schemes {{during their}} service lives. The cars were {{delivered}} in two-tone gray scheme with orange stripes, then a <b>solid</b> bright <b>red,</b> and finally, repainted into the MTA's silver with blue stripe scheme.|$|R

25|$|The <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> flag is {{displayed}} when conditions are {{too dangerous to}} continue the session. Depending on the series and the circumstances, the cars are typically directed to proceed immediately to pit road, or to stop at a specific spot on the track. In some severe cases the cars might be required to stop immediately where they are. During red flag conditions, repair work in the pits or garage area is typically prohibited, except in non-points paying races.|$|E
25|$|In 1902 {{the lantern}} was changed again from <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> to flashing. Apart from routine {{reinforcement}} to the riprap and {{replacement of the}} dock no changes {{were made to the}} lighthouse building itself until the 1940s, when modern sanitary facilities were added. In 1947, an electrical connection was installed, eliminating the need for the kerosene lamps that had provided routine illumination within the lighthouse. During the next decade, the original coal-fired steam heating system was replaced with modern forced air, and the sanitary facilities were further upgraded.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} clinically based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as EM, facial palsy, or arthritis), or {{a history of}} possible exposure to infected ticks, as well as serological blood tests. The EM rash {{is not always a}} bull's eye, i.e., it can be <b>solid</b> <b>red.</b> When making a diagnosis of Lyme disease, health care providers should consider other diseases that may cause similar illnesses. Not all individuals infected with Lyme disease develop the characteristic bull's-eye rash, and many may not recall a tick bite.|$|E

25|$|The current ribbon logo was {{launched}} {{to coincide with}} the new millennium celebration on 1 January 2000 and the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney. The ribbon logo was used between 2000 and 2003 in five colour variants: red, orange, yellow, green and blue, to symbolise passion, involving, fun, life and energy respectively. The logo was simplified in 2003, effectively becoming simply two angled trapezoids, losing its gradient, shadows and colour-coded usages to become <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> but first it was used in solid white as an on-screen bug from 2000. In 2012, the Seven logo was slightly modified with the shape of it remaining the same, the upper right corner was lighter red than the remaining logo. On February 1, 2016, it reverted to red trapezoids.|$|E
25|$|The current Church now {{occupies}} {{what used}} to be the choir and the sanctuary areas. This is separated from the open court by a <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> brick wall, of Middle Ages construction with doors and windows. The original sanctuary was built in a trefoil style with three apses. It is a step higher than the nave in the open court. The rectangular space defined by the apses to its north, south, and east sides; used to serve as the altar for the greater basilica. Now the altar is located within the central or eastern apse. The rest of the space is now integrated into the nave of the current Church. There is also a new iconstasis made with solid wood and adorned by small icons on its top register. The current sanctuary in the central apse is actually divided into three. The middle one is dedicated to Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite, the southern one to the Virgin Mary, and the northern one to Saint George.|$|E
25|$|Females {{can reach}} 12mm body length, males 7 to 11mm. Both sexes have blue-green {{iridescent}} chelicerae, a black cephalothorax and limbs, {{and a bright}} red abdomen with a median black stripe (similar to the female P. johnsoni). Between the black and red areas on the posterior part of the dorsal abdomen there are two minute white spots. At {{the sides of the}} abdomen there are light diagonal bands, and there is also a light transverse anterior band on the dorsum. These markings vary in conspicuousness: the bands and spots may be only a somewhat lighter shade of red than the remainder of the abdomen, while the median black stripe may be so reduced in width and length that the abdomen appears <b>solid</b> <b>red.</b> Sometimes, the basic color is orange rather than red, and very old spiders may even be yellow. In this species, the adult males and the adult females are similar in coloration, and this is also true of P. apacheanus. It is more usual for the males of Phidippus to have iridescent chelicerae and a distinctive adult coloration while the females of this genus remain similar to the immature spiders (e.g., P. clarus, P. octopunctatus, P. whitmani).|$|E

5000|$|In 1962, Neil Bartlett {{discovered}} that a mixture of platinum hexafluoride gas and oxygen formed a <b>red</b> <b>solid.</b> [...] The <b>red</b> <b>solid</b> {{turned out to be}} dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate, O2+PtF6−. Bartlett noticed that the ionization energy for O2 (1175 kJ mol−1) was very close to the ionization energy for Xe (1170 kJ mol−1). He then asked his colleagues to give him some xenon [...] "so that he could try out some reactions", whereupon he established that xenon indeed reacts with PtF6. Although, as discussed above, the product was probably a mixture of several compounds, Bartlett's work was the first proof that compounds could be prepared from a noble gas. His discovery illustrates that the finding of new chemical methods often lead initially to impure products. Since Bartlett's observation, many well-defined compounds of xenon have been reported including XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6.|$|R
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (<b>solid</b> <b>red</b> sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E

500|$|The {{color of}} Naturalean {{composites}} or crossbred cattle can be solid black or <b>solid</b> <b>red</b> with black or reddish pigmentation {{in the same}} areas as the pigmentation on fullbloods. They may be horned or polled, and homozygous (2 copy), or heterozygous (1 copy). Fullbloods and Naturalean bulls are often crossed with traditional beef breeds like Black Angus or Hereford cattle because of substantial benefits in the crossbred results, including a higher protein meat that is lower in saturated fat, improved tenderness, and an approximate 7% yield increase in salable carcass. [...] Calving problems are also reduced in the crossbreds.|$|E
