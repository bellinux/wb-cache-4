25|$|Nakula and Sahadeva {{are said}} to be skilled swordsmen in Mahabharata. Sword-{{fighting}} is one of the common Indian fighting arts. Varieties include the curved <b>single-edge</b> sword, the straight double-edge sword, the two-handed longsword, the gauntlet-sword, and the urumi or flexible sword. Techniques differ from one state to another but all make extensive use of circular movements, often circling the weapon around the user's head. The flexible nature and light weight of Indian swords allows for speed but provides little defensive ability, so that the swordsman must instead rely on body maneuvers to dodge attacks. Entire systems exist focusing on drawing the sword out of the opponent's body. Stances and forms traditionally made up the early training before students progress to free sparring with sticks to simulate swords in an exercise called gatka, although this term is more often used in English when referring to the Panjabi-Sikh fighting style. A common way to practice precision-cutting is to slice cloves or lemons, eventually doing so while blindfolded. Pairing two swords of equal length, though considered impractical {{in some parts of the}} world, is common and was considered highly advantageous in South Asia.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s, {{large numbers}} of folding switchblade or {{automatic}} opening knives with locking blades were imported from Italy to the United States. Most of these switchblades were side-opening designs, though some employed a telescoping blade. [...] These Italian switchblades were commonly and popularly referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard. [...] The majority of these Italian stiletto switchblade knives used a now-iconic bayonet-style blade with a single sabre-grind edge (often unsharpened) and a long opposing false edge. [...] As with the medieval stiletto, the stiletto switchblade was designed primarily as an offensive weapon, optimized for thrusting rather than cutting. [...] Most of these knives were designed with a locking device which locked the blade in the open position, and this lock, combined with the stiletto blade profile, enabled the knife {{to be used as}} an effective thrusting or stabbing weapon (unlike most U.S. switchblade designs of the day). [...] Though most switchblade stilettos used a <b>single-edge</b> blade equipped with a long false edge, many variations exist. [...] The stiletto switchblade is produced to this day in Italy and many other countries, and now includes many derivative folding knife designs that incorporate the same basic 'stiletto' or bayonet-style blade profile, including spring-assist, non-locking, and lock blade variants.|$|E

The CPU and cache could be tested separately, before final assembly into a package, reducing cost and making the CPU more attractive to markets other than that of high-end servers. These cards could also be easily plugged into a Slot 1, thereby eliminating the chance for pins of a typical CPU to be bent or broken when installing in a socket.|$|R
5000|$|The first safety razors used a <b>single-edge</b> blade {{that was}} {{essentially}} a 4 cm long segment of a straight razor.

5000|$|A second popular <b>single-edge</b> {{design is}} the [...] "Injector" [...] razor {{developed}} {{and placed on}} the market by Schick Razors in the 1920s. This uses narrow blades stored in an injector device {{with which they are}} inserted directly into the razor. The injector blade was the first to depart from the rectangular dimensions shared by the wedge, standard <b>single-edge,</b> and double-edge blades. The injector, itself, was also the first device intended {{to reduce the risk of}} injury from handling blades. The Gillette blade dispenser released in 1947 had the same purpose. The narrow injector blade, as well as the form of the injector razor, also strongly influenced the corresponding details of the subsequently developed cartridge razors.|$|E

50|$|Its {{used for}} both timber felling, {{agricultural}} activities and warfare is characterised by the noticeable bent at an obtuse angle from {{one-third of its}} length starting from the pommel. This parang features a <b>single-edge</b> blade that is heavier and wider towards {{the point of the}} blade. The handle of the Parang Latok is made of wood without a guard and often tied securely with rattan at its grip. It is carried in a long, two-piece wooden sheath to properly hold the blade.|$|E
50|$|Safety razors {{have been}} known to exist since at least 1876 when the <b>single-edge</b> Star safety razor was {{patented}} by brothers Frederick and Otto Kampfe. The razor was essentially a small piece of a straight razor attached to a handle using a clamp mechanism. Before each shave the blade had to be attached to a special holder, stropped with a leather belt, and placed back into the razor. After a time, the blade needed to be honed by a cutler.|$|E
50|$|Another {{utility knife}} {{often used for}} cutting open boxes {{consists}} of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which <b>single-edge</b> utility blades can be inserted. The sleeve slides {{up and down on}} the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use. The blade holder may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife. The blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of corrugated fiberboard, to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.|$|E
50|$|The klewang or kelewang {{is a type}} of <b>single-edge</b> longsword from Indonesia with a {{protruding}} notch {{near its}} tip. In size, weight and shape it is halfway between the golok and the kampilan. The style of the klewang differs between the various cultures of Indonesia. Blades range from 15 to 30 inches in length and may be straight or slightly curved. It is carried for show by followers of chiefs, or taken on expeditions to market or nightly walks in the villages. It is worn without a sheath although there are sheathed varieties.|$|E

Structures closely related to non-separating ear decompositions of maximal planar graphs, called canonical orderings, are also a standard tool in graph drawing.|$|E
5000|$|The risk {{of injury}} from {{handling}} razor blades was further reduced in 1970 when Wilkinson released its [...] "Bonded Shaving System", which embedded a single blade in a disposable polymer plastic cartridge. A flurry of competing models soon followed with everything from one to six blades, with many cartridge blade razors also having disposable handles. Cartridge blade razors are sometimes {{considered to be a}} generic category of their own and not a variety of safety razor. The similarities between <b>single-edge</b> cartridge blade razors and the classic injector razor do, however, provide equal justification for treating both categories contiguously.|$|E
50|$|During the 16th century, the Burmese ruled over {{parts of}} Siam. Naresuan {{was born to}} King Maha Dharmaraja but {{until the age of}} 16 he was a hostage of the Burmese. Upon his return to Ayutthaya, he renounced {{allegiance}} to Burma on behalf of his father the king. Having studied at Wat Buddhaisawan, Naresuan was well-versed in fighting with the <b>single-edge</b> sword (krabi). The Burmese attacked the capital numerous times in succession but were always repelled by Naresuan's forces. In a final attempt to retake their Thai states, the Burmese sent an army of 25,000 warriors led by the crown prince of Burma atop a war-elephant.|$|E

50|$|The {{arrival of}} European colonists brought the {{influence}} of western swords, which is likely {{the origin of the}} pinuti's hand-guard and sabre-like blade. When the Philippines was colonized by the Spaniards, the use of traditional swords and weapons was immediately banned. Because of this, the Filipinos were forced to use their own farm tools to fight in rebellions. And in the following insurgencies against other foreign colonists like America and Japan, they were again forced to use these improvised weapons. During the Japanese occupation, because of scarce ammunition to fight the Japanese, the Filipinos used guerilla attacks with their melee weapons and swords in raiding Japanese camps. Filipino swordplay relies heavily on speed, and even today Filipino marines train in a form of eskrima using a curved <b>single-edge</b> sword.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} Korean swords were straight double-edge blades {{derived from}} the Chinese jian. As Korean warfare favoured mounted combat, the curved <b>single-edge</b> sword {{was found to be}} more effective from horseback. Joseon's centralised government and the need to fend off frequent foreign invasions were conducive to the development of swordsmanship as a standardised military discipline. Along with other martial systems, forms of swordsmanship were formalised in the military manual Muyejebo (1610) based on Qi Jiguang's Ji Xiao Xin Shu, and in the revisions, Muyesinbo (1759) and Muyedobotongji (1790). The Muyedobotongji also describes standard lengths and weights of the swords used; while not exclusive to swordsmanship, 8 of the 23 chapters are devoted to it, reflecting the needs the era when the guns have not yet matured enough for short-range combat.|$|E
50|$|The Pandat has a short, heavy, <b>single-edge</b> blade {{with an iron}} hilt. It has no real handle, but a short {{cross-piece}} of iron or bone {{passes through}} the handle. The sword is handled {{with one or two}} hands, with a downward stroke. Its blade and hilt are forged from one piece and the blade is bent, just before the hilt, at an angle of 25 degrees. The bend in the blade is located in the transitional part between the blade and the hilt. Both the back and the edge are straight and run apart, so that the blade's broadest part is at the point. The blade length is generally between 55 and 70 cm and the handle is about 40 cm long. The sheath is usually made of wood and decorated with traditional patterns. It may be decorated with feathers or tufts of hair or simply painted red.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s the German Luftwaffe began {{training}} a Fallschirmjäger or paratroop force, {{and as part}} of this effort developed specialized equipment for the airborne soldier, including the Fallschirmjäger-Messer (paratrooper's knife), which used a gravity-operated mechanism to deploy its sliding spearpoint blade from the handle. The German paratrooper knife, which featured a marlinspike in addition to the cutting blade, was used to cut rigging and unknot lines, though it could be employed as a weapon in an emergency. The U.S. Army in 1940 tasked the Geo. Schrade Knife Co. to produce a small <b>single-edge</b> switchblade for U.S. airborne troops, to be used similarly to the Fallschirmjäger-Messer. The knife was not intended primarily as a fighting knife, but rather as a utility tool, to enable a paratrooper to rapidly cut himself out of his lines and harness in the event he could not escape them after landing.|$|E
5000|$|Chinese-speakers make a clear {{distinction}} between a [...] "sword" [...] (double-edged) and a [...] "knife" [...] (single-edged). In Chinese culture the double-edged sword or jian is considered a master's weapon or gentlemen's weapon, both from the considerable skill required to fight with this weapon and from the fact that commanders of armies favored the jian in order to move easily amongst the troops. It is described in Chinese as the [...] "delicate lady" [...] of weapons, and is traditionally considered the weapon most suitable for women. The <b>single-edge</b> broadsword is referred to as a dao, literally meaning knife, regardless of the weapon's size. The sword and broadsword are among the four main weapons taught in the Chinese martial arts, the others being the staff and spear. The order in which these weapons is taught may vary between schools and styles, but the jian is generally taught last among the four.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} both iron {{smelting}} and forging {{was introduced to}} Sub-Saharan Africa from the north, thus many African swords were of Egyptian derivation. Among some communities, swords were restricted to royalty or tribal leaders. Forms vary from one area to another, such as the billao of Somalia, boomerang-sword in Niger or the <b>single-edge</b> swords of the Gold Coast. The Abyssinian shotel {{took the form of}} a large sickle, like the Egyptian khopesh, with a small 4 inch wooden handle. The edge was {{on the inside of the}} blade, which has a mid-rib running along its entire length. Double-edge swords similar to those of Europe and ancient Arabia occurred in some areas such as the takoba and kaskara. Two types of sword existed in Zanzibar: the foot-long shortsword and the standard sword with a blade measuring 3-3.5 feet and a cylindrical pommel. The latter weapon was wielded with both hands like a quarterstaff.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} form of dueling {{among the}} Bugis-Makassar community was called sitobo lalang lipa {{in which the}} duellists fight in a sarong. The challenger stands with a loosened sarong around him and respectfully invites the other man {{to step into the}} sarong. The sarong itself is kept taut around both their waists. When both men are inside, an agreement to fight til death and thereafter shall be no hereditary grudge nor will any party be allowed to question the duel, shall be made. If both fighters agree, they then engage each other within the confined space of a single sarong. Unlike the more typical kris duel of Javanese and Malay culture, the Bugis-Makassar community instead wield badik, the local <b>single-edge</b> knife. Because avoiding injury is near-impossible even for the victor, this type of duel was considered a sign of extraordinary bravery, masculinity and the warrior mentality. Although true sitobo lalang lipa are no longer practiced, enactments of these duels are still performed at cultural shows today.|$|E
5000|$|An {{interview}} with Jung {{on the design}} and illustration of the 1974 poster The Man with the Golden Gun elaborated on his creative process: [...] "The actual painting is done on 20x30 double-weight illustration board, half of a standard 30x40 board. I used acrylics, I can use it transparently or opaquely; it dries quickly and is permanent and can be reworked. I'd use airbrushing for large areas of background, color pencils, and inks and dyes and tempera and whatever else I think that may give me the desired result. Sandpaper. Brillo. A <b>single-edge</b> razor blade. Whatever works." [...] Jung often used family members as models. For the Star Wars poster design, with Frank Frazetta in mind as his final illustrator, Jung posed his son Jeff as Luke Skywalker and his wife Kay as Princess Leia. After discussions with Don Smolen of Smolen, Smith and Connolly, {{it was decided that}} Jung would execute the illustration.|$|E

50|$|Parallel to the US {{development}} of “ice pick” vests, the British police, PSDB, {{was working on}} standards for knife-resistant body armor. Their program adopted a rigorous scientific approach and collected data on human attack capacity. Their ergonomic study suggested three levels of threat: 25, 35 and 45 joules of impact energy. In addition to impact energy attack, velocities were measured and {{were found to be}} 10-20 m/s (much faster than the California test). Two commercial knives were selected for use in this PSDB test method. In order to test at a representative velocity, an air cannon method was developed to propel the knife and sabot at the vest target using compressed air. In this first version, the PSDB ’93 test also used oil/clay materials as the tissue simulant backing. The introduction of knives which cut fiber and a hard-dense test backing required stab vest manufacturers to use metallic components in their vest designs to address this more rigorous standard. The current standard HOSDB Body Armour Standards for UK Police (2007) Part 3: Knife and Spike Resistance is harmonized with the US NIJ OO15 standard, use a drop test method and use a composite foam backing as a tissue simulant. Both the HOSDB and the NIJ test now specify engineered blades, double-edged S1 and <b>single-edge</b> P1 as well as the spike.|$|E
