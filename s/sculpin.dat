5|$|The Snake River below Shoshone Falls {{is home to}} thirty-five native fish species, {{of which}} twelve are {{also found in the}} Columbia River and four of which are endemic to the Snake: the relict sand roller (Percopsis transmontana) of the Percopsidae family, the shorthead <b>sculpin</b> (Cottus confusus), the maginated <b>sculpin</b> (Cottus marginatus), and the Oregon chub (Oregonichthys crameri). The Oregon chub is also found in the Umpqua River and nearby basins. The lower Snake River also {{supports}} seven species of Pacific salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus). There are also high, often localized levels of mollusc endemism, especially in Hells Canyon and the basins of the Clearwater River, Salmon River, and middle Snake River. The mollusc richness extends into the lower Columbia River and tributaries such as the Deschutes River.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} eight species of wild fish in West Creek. Brook trout and brown trout both inhabit West Creek, {{although}} brook trout are slightly more common than brown trout, with nine brook trout and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common fish in the creek are <b>sculpin,</b> eastern blacknose dace, and cutlips minnows. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, {{a total of}} 81 <b>sculpin,</b> 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed. Other species of fish in the watershed include johnny darter, white sucker, and creek chub.|$|E

5|$|The Upper Snake {{freshwater}} ecoregion includes most {{of southeastern}} Idaho and extends into small portions of Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada, including major freshwater habitats such as Jackson Lake. Compared {{to the lower}} Snake River {{and the rest of}} the Columbia River's watershed, the Upper Snake ecoregion has a high level of endemism, especially among freshwater molluscs such as snails and clams. There are at least 21 snail and clam species of special concern, including 15 that appear to exist only in single clusters. There are 14 fish species found in the Upper Snake region that do not occur elsewhere in the Columbia's watershed, but which do occur in Bonneville freshwater ecoregion of western Utah, part of the Great Basin and related to the prehistoric Lake Bonneville. The Wood River <b>sculpin</b> (Cottus leiopomus) is endemic to the Wood River. The Shoshone <b>sculpin</b> (Cottus greenei) is endemic to the small portion of the Snake River between Shoshone Falls and the Wood River.|$|E
5|$|Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, {{among them}} cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, {{several species of}} salmon, sucker, minnow, <b>sculpin,</b> and lamprey, as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 {{non-native}} species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American dipper, osprey, and harlequin duck. Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.|$|E

5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and <b>sculpin</b> are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, <b>sculpin,</b> bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E

This was completed in late March 1962, and <b>Sculpin</b> returned to her home port.|$|E
40|$|Sealworms, Pseudoterranova decipiens, {{are found}} in several fish species, and {{generally}} have a high prevalence in cod (Gadus morhua) and <b>sculpins</b> (Myoxocephalus scorpius). In the outer Oslofjord the final host is common seals (Phoca vitulina Linne, 1758), and here there are two colonies of these seals: a small population of 150 – 400 individuals in the outer Hvaler skerries in Norway and a large {{population of more than}} 2000 individuals in the Koster archipelago in Sweden. A feature of the sealworm life cycle in these habitats is that <b>sculpins</b> (Myoxocephalus scorpius) act as an important transmitter from invertebrates to cod. Heavily infested seals have eaten cod which have consumed heavily infected <b>sculpins.</b> The purpose of this project was to compare the <b>sculpins</b> found from Hvaler and Koster in order to investigate the effect of the number of common seals on the infection levels in <b>sculpins.</b> 107 <b>sculpins</b> caught from the Hvaler Islands were investigated in 2009 and 161 <b>sculpins</b> from the Koster archipelago in the 1990 ’s. Females constituted slightly less than 70 % of the samples and had a significant different age structure than males. While the females were between 1. 5 and 4. 5 years old, the males achieved one year less: 1. 5 – 3. 5 years. All fish were between 12 and 29 cm. Females were approx. 5 cm longer than males. In Hvaler around 25 % of the <b>sculpins</b> were infested by sealworms and the number of sealworms per fish varied between 0 and 4. On average, the number of sealworms per investigated fish (abundance) was 0. 4 in Hvaler, and the number of sealworms per infested fish (intensity) was 1. 6. In Koster around. 85 % of the <b>sculpins</b> were infested by sealworms and the number of sealworm per fish varied between 0 and 34 with the exception of 102 sealworms in one female. On average, the number of sealworms per investigated fish was 6. 4, and the number of sealworms per infested fish (intensity) was 7. 5. There was no correlation between the number of sealworm and weight of the fish. In the Hvaler Islands, with few common seals, the number of sealworms per fish followed a Poisson distribution. In the Koster Islands with many common seals, the number of sealworms per fish had a large deviation from the Poisson distribution. In addition to the abundance of seals, the diet of <b>sculpins</b> may contribute to the observed differences in the distribution of sealworms in <b>sculpins</b> in the two areas...|$|R
