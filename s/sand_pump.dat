5000|$|According to {{the records}} {{available}} {{with the state}} public department, efforts to restore the waterway first began back in 1872 under the British. The earliest recorded proposal was mooted in 1890. After Independence, the then chief minister C. N. Annadurai launched a Cooum Improvement Scheme {{at a cost of}} [...] 19 million in September 1967, six months after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party came to power {{for the first time in}} the state, when M. Karunanidhi was PWD minister. The project comprised installation of a regulator and a <b>sand</b> <b>pump</b> at the river mouth, protecting the sides of the river with cement concrete slabs from the Chetput bridge to the Napier Bridge, provision of a walkway on either side of the river, removal of encroachments on the banks of the river and, more importantly, the diversion of sewage. In addition, seven boat jetties were built. In February 1973, when Karunanidhi was chief minister, he launched a pleasure boat service at a cost of [...] 22 million, and roving boats, powered boats and paddle boats were made available at a nominal charge. However, the efforts went futile when the <b>sand</b> <b>pump</b> developed snags. Incidentally, the jetties built for the purpose still dot the riverfront.|$|E
40|$|In this study, some {{measuring}} {{techniques of}} sediment discharge are discussed. In the previous paper, the author devised a direct measuring system composed of afixed sieve, a <b>sand</b> <b>pump,</b> rotating baskets and a load cell. In this paper, it is im-proved {{to a system}} composed of a trommel and a tipping bucket suspended by aload cell. For relatively small gravel and sand, this system works well. It is difficult, however, to apply direct measuring methods for coarser gravel,and it is necesarry to devise some indirect measuring techniques. Among some indirect methods, an acoustic one is discussed in this paper. Theoscillation of air confined in a pipe is detected by a microphone mounted on aninside wall of the pipe. The amplitude {{is proportional to the}} momemtum of theparticle which impacts the pipe. If the particle velocity is known or constant, it ispossible to estimate the particle mass from the amplitude with some calibration. Two sets of calibration were carried out using a small flume. It is expected thatthis method will be also applicable to field measurement...|$|E

50|$|The Kattegat is {{a rather}} shallow sea and can be very {{difficult}} and dangerous to navigate, due to the many sandy and stony reefs and tricky currents that often shift.

50|$|Waterfront canal {{living is}} {{a feature of}} the Gold Coast. Most canal {{frontage}} homes have pontoons. The Gold Coast Seaway, between The Spit and South Stradbroke Island, allows vessels direct access to the Pacific Ocean from The Broadwater and many of the city's canal estates. Breakwaters {{on either side of the}} Seaway prevent longshore drift and the bar from silting up. A <b>sand</b> <b>pumping</b> operation on the Spit pipes sand under the Seaway to continue this natural process.|$|R
40|$|Slurry pumps, {{such as oil}} <b>sand</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} to convert electrical energy to slurry potential and kinetic energy. Because of adverse working conditions, slurry pump impellers are prone to suffer wear, which may result in slurry pump breakdowns. To prevent any unexpected breakdowns, slurry pump impeller performance degradation assessment should be immediately conducted to monitor the current health condition and {{to ensure the safety}} and reliability of slurry pumps. In this paper, to provide an alternative to the impeller health indicator, an enhanced factor analysis based impeller indicator (EFABII) is proposed. Firstly, a low-pass filter is employed to improve the signal to noise ratios of slurry pump vibration signals. Secondly, redundant statistical features are extracted from the filtered vibration signals. To reduce the redundancy of the statistic features, the enhanced factor analysis is performed to generate new statistical features. Moreover, the statistic features can be automatically grouped and developed a new indicator called EFABII. Data collected from industrial oil <b>sand</b> <b>pumps</b> are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is able to track the current health condition of slurry pump impellers...|$|R

50|$|Since the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 beaches {{along the}} shores of the East Coast have been {{regularly}} replenished with <b>sand</b> <b>pumped</b> in from off-shore. A multi-year project in for replacing sand began in 1994 by the USACE and originally completed in 2001 and been renourished 4 times since then. After Hurricane Sandy, approximately 5 million cubic yards of sand from the beaches in the area were washed away. The USACE in 2014 replaced more than 8 million cubic yards of sand thus restoring the project area to its original design profile. The practice has become controversial due to environmental and economic concerns.|$|R

50|$|Hatteras Island {{was cut in}} two on September 18, 2003 by Hurricane Isabel {{which opened}} a new inlet 3000 ft wide and 30 ft deep through the {{community}} of Hatteras Village on {{the southern end of}} Hatteras Island. This new inlet was temporarily named the Isabel Inlet after the hurricane. Road access along NC 12 was temporarily severed until the island was repaired and restored by <b>sand</b> <b>pumped</b> ashore by the Army Corps of Engineers. In 2007, Subtropical Storm Andrea caused high winds to push waves over dunes and onto the highway on Hatteras Island, leaving water a foot deep and sand 2 to 3 ft deep in some places.|$|R

50|$|The {{stamp mill}} {{contained}} 40 1250 lb stamps. Ore entering the mill from the tramway went over grizzlies. It {{then went to}} stamps which dropped 106 times per minute. Only outside amalgamation was used, and the pulp flowed over 6 ft amalgamating plates to Frenier <b>sand</b> <b>pumps,</b> which sent it to hydraulic classifiers. The slime was sent to thickeners; the sand was concentrated in three double deck and two single deck Deister tables. The concentrate was de-watered, after which it was ground in a tube mill. The middling was sent to two Union Vanners. Tailing went from the tables to 7 sand vats. From the tube mill, the ground concentrate flowed over a 6 ft amalgamating plate, fines going to cyanide and portion over 200 mesh returning to tube mill for regrinding.|$|R

40|$|Oil <b>sand</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are widely}} used in the mining {{industry}} for the delivery of mixtures of abrasive solids and liquids. Because they operate under highly adverse conditions, these pumps usually experience significant wear. Consequently, equipment owners are quite often forced to invest substantially in system maintenance to avoid unscheduled downtime. In this study, an approach combining relevance vector machines (RVMs) with a sum of two exponential functions was developed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of field pump impellers. To handle field vibration data, a novel feature extracting process was proposed {{to arrive at a}} feature varying with the development of damage in the pump impellers. A case study involving two field datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed method. Compared with standalone exponential fitting, the proposed RVM-based model was much better able to predict the remaining useful life of pump impellers...|$|R
