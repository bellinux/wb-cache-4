The control system uses range/range rate radar, a forward command link, and a compressed video return link. Figure 1 illustrates the overall compressed video coding techniques. Analog RS- 170 compatible video is available from any one of eight or, at a lower resolution, simultaneously from any two television cameras. The video data is digitized and then compressed by sampling every sixth frame of data. A rate of five frames per second is adequate for the OMV docking speeds. Further compression, {{at the expense of}} spatial resolution, is obtained by averaging adjacent pixels. The remaining compression is achieved using differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) and Huffman run length encoding. To protect this compressed video data stream from Space to TDRSS channel errors, a concatenated error correction coding system will be used. This concatenated coding is achieved by encoding with a helical interleaved (depth 8) Reed-Solomon (255, 239) block code and then encoding with a rate 112 convolution code (constraint length 7) followed by a periodic convolution interleaver (30, 116). Thus, we see that four stages of compression, two types of error correction encoding and two levels of interleaving are utilized in this fairly sophisticated data transmission system.

The goal {{of this paper is to}} propose Resource Allocation (RA) techniques, i. e. carrier, power and bandwidth allocation, for a cognitive spectrum utilization scenario where the satellite system aims at exploiting the spectrum allocated to terrestrial networks as the incumbent users without imposing harmful interference to them. In particular, we focus on the microwave frequency bands 17. 7 - 19. 7 GHz for the cognitive satellite downlink and 27. 5 - 29. 5 GHz for the cognitive satellite uplink, although the proposed techniques can be easily extended to other bands. In the first case, assuming that the satellite terminals are equipped with multiple Low Block Noise Converters (LNB), we propose a joint beamforming and carrier allocation scheme to enable cognitive <b>Space-to-Earth</b> communications in the shared spectrum where Fixed Service (FS) microwave links have priority of operation. In the second case, however, the cognitive satellite uplink should not cause harmful interference to the incumbent FS system.

There {{have been many}} proposals for the transmission of solar power collected in space {{to the surface of}} the earth so that solar energy could provide a major part of the electric power requirements on earth. There are, however, serious difficulties in implementing the single stage space-based solar power systems that have been previously studied. These difficulties arise due to: i) the cost of transporting the components needed for the extremely large microwave transmit beaming aperture into space orbit, ii) the even larger collection apertures required on earth, iii) the potential radiation hazard to personnel and equipment on earth, and iv) a lack of flexibility in location of the collection station on the earth. Two candidate system architectures are described here to overcome these difficulties. In both cases a two-stage space to tethered aerostat to earth transmission system (SSP-TA) is proposed. The use of high altitude tethered aerostats (or powered airships) avoids the effects of attenuation of EM energy propagating through the earth s lower atmosphere. This allows the use of beaming frequencies to be chosen from the range of high millimeter (THz) to near-infra-red (NIR) to the visible. This has the potential for: i) greatly reduced transportation costs to space, ii) much smaller receiver collection apertures and ground stations, iii) elimination of the potential radiation hazard to personnel and equipment on earth, and iv) ease in transportation and flexibility in location of the collection station on the earth.

40|$|As {{increasingly}} complex scientific and environmental observation spacecraft are deployed, {{the burden on}} the downlink assets, and ground-based systems complexity and cost is becoming a major problem. Already, the limitations of communications bandwidth and processing throughput limit the science data gathering, both in volume and in rate. This poses a dilemma to the scientist experimenter forcing choices between data collection and bandwidth/processing/archiving. Advances in ground based processing and <b>space-to-Earth</b> links have fallen behind the requirements for observation data, at increasing rates, over the last few decades. As NASA achieves its 40 th anniversary, the ability to observe and capture phenomena of theoretical and practical interest to life on Earth far outstrips the ability to transfer, process, or store these data. NASA recognizes the need to invest on technological advancements that will enable both the space and ground systems to address the limitations. Spacecraft onboard computing power is a clear one. The capability of creating data products onboard the spacecraft adds a new level of flexibility to address the more demanding observation needs. Current spacecraft computing power is limited and incapable of addressing the needs of the new generation of observation satellites because extensive onboard data processing is required. Traditional spacecraft architectures only collect, package, and transmit to Earth the data acquired by multiple instruments. Conversely, the experience on developing ground data systems shows the need for high performance computing systems to process and create information from the instrumentation data. The expectation is that supercomputing technology is required to enable spacecraft to create information onboard. Moving supercomputing capability onboard spacecraft requires an approach that considers an integrated data architecture. Otherwise, it may simply convert a compute-bound problem into a communications bound problem, as has been shown numerous times in the context of massively parallel architectures.

40|$|Today, {{there is}} an {{increased}} commitment to the cultural and scientific analysis of technology transfer (TT), which is also present in the management literature. Many companies have adopted technologies developed in other industrial sectors because of the rising costs {{of research and development}} and the need to create new products in a shorter time. In addition, the development and diffusion of information technology today means that new sources of knowledge can be accessed with greater ease. The need to intensify the processes of TT is particularly felt in the space sector. Firstly, space agencies have attempted to increase the returns on their investments in space missions by encouraging the commercial use of advanced technologies. Secondly, the aerospace industry is characterised by complex products of very high value produced in relatively small quantities. Lastly, these products are 'archipelago- like' systems of technology, to a large extent originating from other sectors, and can be transferred yet again. The following paper is a synthesis of the results of a research work carried out between 2009 and 2012. In particular, we have analysed: policies for TT adopted by the major space agencies [1], four TT case studies concerning the construction of scientific satellites [2], two case studies focused on <b>space-to-earth</b> TT programs undertaken by the Japanese aerospace agency [3] and two TT case studies examining Italian space companies [4]. The aim {{of this study is to}} present: 1) policies and strategies the major space agencies have adopted for technology transfer and 2) operational mechanisms and determinants involved in the transfer of space technologies to the industrial sector. The results of these studies indicate that the space agencies in more industrialised countries aim primarily at consolidating and developing industrial systems in their own countries, including using TT programs, and that the transfer of space technologies follows an ' earth-space-earth' route. With regard to the determinants of the TT process, the most important of these correlate with the type of technology transferred, whereas organisational, economic and financial determinants have less significance.

A simulation model based on the ITU-R P 618 - 10 rain model is used to predict the rain attenuation in the C-, Ku- and X-bands in 15 different locations with varying rainfall intensities of between 145 - 300 mm/hr in East and West Malaysia. The simulations assume a 1. 8 m receive antenna with 65 % aperture efficiency, QPSK modulation and use of either vertical or horizontal polarization. The downlink centre frequencies {{used in this study}} are 4200 MHz, 7750 MHz and 11200 MHz for C-, X- and Ku-bands respectively. The average free-space path loss calculated for each band is used to estimate the signal attenuation due to rain and the corresponding Eb=No (dB) is computed at varying rain intensities. The results show that when using vertical receive polarization, all 15 locations of study with a rainfall intensity of up to 200 mm/hr could receive the X-band signal. At 200 mm/hr rain intensity in the horizontal receive, most of the X-band links could achieve the threshold Eb=No of 7. 68 dB with a ULPC adjustment of approximately 1. 5 dB where required. At 300 mm/hr rain intensity, video signals in the X-band were no longer receivable in both polarizations. At 145 mm/hr rain intensity, only one location with high satellite elevation and greater height above mean sea level maintained the Ku-band link in the horizontal receive. In the vertical receive, the Ku-band link was receivable at all locations at 145 mm/hr but were no longer receivable at 200 mm/hr. The study concluded that the elevation angle towards the satellite is a major factor in determining the quality of the signal in the X-band. The other factors that affected the receive Eb=No was the polarization, depth of rain and height of the earth station above mean sea level. In comparison to the Ku-band, the X-band was able to maintain a good quality satellite link in rain intensities of up to 200 mm/hr in the vertical receive. The results indicate that there is high potential for the use of X-band to provide for video transmission over Malaysia in spite of the high rain intensities...|$|E

In this scenario, telecommunications links between Earth ground receiving stations and extra-terrestrial satellite platforms have to be designed {{in order to ensure}} the optimal transfer of the acquired scientific data back to the Earth. A significant communication capacity has to be planned when very large distances, as those characterising deep space links, are involved thus fostering more ambitious scientific mission requirements. At {{the current state of the}} art, two microwave channel frequencies are used to perform the deep space data transfer: X band (~ 8. 4 GHz) and Ka band (~ 32 GHz) channel. Ka-band transmission can offer an advantage over X-band in terms of antenna performance with the same antenna effective area and an available data transfer bandwidth (50 times higher at Ka band than X band). However, Earth troposphere-related impairments can affects the <b>space-to-Earth</b> carrier signals at frequencies higher than 10 GHz by degrading its integrity and thus reducing the deep space channel temporal availability. Such atmospheric impairments, especially in terms of path attenuation, their statistic and the possibility to forecast them in the next 24 H at the Earth's receiving station would allow a more accurate design of the deep space link, promoting the mitigation of the detrimental effects on the link availability. To pursue this aim, meteorological forecast models and in situ measurements need to be considered in order to characterise the troposphere in terms of signal path attenuation at current and future time. In this work, we want to show how the synergistic use of meteorological forecasts, radiative transfer simulations and in situ measurements such as microwave radiometry observations, rain gauges and radiosoundings, can aid the optimisation of a deep space link at Ka band and improve its performance with respect to usual practices. The outcomes of the study are in the framework of the Radio-Meteorological Operations Planner (RMOP) project promoted by ESA for supporting the BepiColombo mission to Mercury. More in detail, the methodology used in this work foresees the use of Fifth-Generation Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM 5) coupled with an Eddington-like radiative transfer model in order to convert the forecasted meteorological variables into radio-propagation parameters. Thus, in-situ observations from microwave radiometers are used to validate the weather forecasts in terms of integrated water paths in clear sky whereas radiosoundings and rain gauges will provide a reference for temperature and rain accumulations, respectively. Eventually, the final results will be shown in terms of improvements in the transferred data volume when the RMOP chain is implemented...|$|E

However, these navigation systems are being used increasingly in space. Beginning with the launch of the TOPEX/Poseidon remote-sensing mission in 1992, over 90 GPS receivers have flown onboard spacecraft for such applications as real-time spacecraft navigation, three-axis attitude control, precise time synchronization, precision orbit determination, and atmospheric profiling. In addition to use onboard many science spacecraft, GPS has been used or is planned to be used onboard the shuttles, the International Space Station, the International Space Station Emergency Crew Return Vehicle, and many commercial satellite {{systems such as}} Orbcomm, Globalstar, and Teledesic. From a frequency spectrum standpoint, however, one important difference between the space and terrestrial uses of GPS is that it is being used in space with no interference protection. This is because there is no frequency allocation for the space-to-space use of GPS (i. e., from GPS satellite to user spacecraft) in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) regulatory table of frequency allocations. If another space-based or groundbased radio system interferes with a spaceborne GPS user, the spaceborne user presently has no recourse other than to accept the interference. Consequently, for {{the past year and a}} half, the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field and other Government agencies have been working within ITU toward obtaining a GPS space-to-space allocation at the next World Radio Conference in the year 2000 (WRC 2000). Numerous interference studies have been conducted in support of a primary space-tospace allocation in the 1215 - to 1260 -MHz and 1559 - to 1610 -MHz RNSS bands. Most of these studies and analyses were performed by Glenn and submitted as U. S. input documents to the international Working Party 8 D meetings in Geneva, Switzerland. In the structure of the ITU, Working Party 8 D is responsible for frequency spectrum issues in the RNSS and the mobile satellite service (MSS). The full texts of the studies are available from the ITU web site under Working Party 8 D contributions. Note that because spaceborne RNSS receivers operate in a receive-only mode with navigation signals already being broadcast toward the Earth, the addition of a space-tospace allocation will not result in interference with other systems. A space-based RNSS receiver, however, could experience interference from systems of other services, including intraservice interference from other RNSS systems. The interference scenarios examined in the studies can be inferred from the following frequency allocation charts. In these charts, services labeled in all capital letters (e. g., "ARNS") have primary status, whereas those labeled with sentence-style capitalization (e. g., "Amateur radio") have secondary status (i. e., a service with secondary status cannot claim interference protection from or cause harmful interference to a service with primary status). Charts showing the ITU frequency allocations in the 960 to 1350 MHZ range and the 1525 - 1660 MHZ range are discussed and presented...|$|E
