First, the instruments are analysed in relation to the classical discussion of environmental policy that opposes price-based instruments versus quantity-based instruments in an uncertain environment (feed-in tariffs as price based system on one hand, quotas + green certificates, competitive bidding as quantity-based instruments on the other hand). Next, the incentives to invest and innovate in the context of each framework are analysed in relation to the sharing of the surplus associated with each of them between producers/constructors and consumers or the public budget. Finally, the paper looks at the overall cost-efficiency of the policies on the basis of each instrument, by referring to factual evidence in European experiences. It concludes that if social preference is attached to climate change prevention and reflected in a high quantitative objective for renewables, <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> feed-in <b>tariffs</b> are a good compromise in order to promote technical progress and national RES industry also. The quota/certificate system also presents a number of advantages in terms of static efficiency, but its ability to stimulate innovation still has to be confirmed by experience...|$|R

40|$|Though {{almost no}} postwar union {{contracts}} indexed wage rates to {{prices of the}} employer's products, union agreements linking wage rates to product prices, known as <b>sliding</b> <b>scales,</b> were common in some industries in the United States and Britain from the 1860 s through the 1930 s. This paper explains why <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> disappeared after the 1930 s, and examines what practical experience with <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> revealed about fundamental constraints on wage indexation. Paradoxically, the history of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> confirms that workers' information about product prices and materials costs is generally imperfect, {{in ways that would}} substantially constrain wage indexation in long-term contracts. <b>Sliding</b> <b>scales</b> were not indexed long-term contracts, but rather devices to forestall costly strikes in the absence of contracts by revealing employers' private information about product demand. In the postwar US, unions and employers failed to link wage rates to product prices because they had gained the ability to enter binding contracts, which could achieve the benefits of preventing strikes without incurring the extra negotiation costs and information problems associated with product-price indexation. I present a model to show how <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> could forestall strikes by revealing information, and how the introduction of binding union contracts reduced incentives to link wages to product prices.

The most common is the aggregate deal where total box office revenue that a given film generates is split by a pre-determined mutually-agreed percentage between distributor and movie theater. The other method is the <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> deal, where the percentage of box office revenue taken by theaters declines each week of a given film's run. The <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> actually has two pieces that starts with a minimum amount of money that theater is to keep—often called “the house nut”—after which the <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> kicks in for revenue generated above the house nut. However, this <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> method is falling out of use. Whatever the method, box office revenue is usually shared roughly 50/50 between film distributors and theaters.|$|R

40|$|Sliding scales- {{agreements}} between employers and unions that linked wage rates to product prices- were widespread in some industries, and tried in others, in Britain and the United States from the 1860 s through the 1930 s. I describe how <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> worked {{in practice and}} how they were viewed by contemporary employers, unionists and outside observers. I argue that <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> were not adopted for the reasons suggested by most theories of wage indexation, but rather {{in order to reduce the}} frequency of strikes in an institutional setting where there was no third-party enforcement of labor agreements. This can explain both the presence of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, and the disappearance of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> since the 1930 s. - 1 -Sometime before the year 1841, a British ironmaster named G. B. Thorneycroft decided that the wages of his puddlers "should fluctuate with the price of 'marked bars '- these words indicating a quality of iron that then enjoyed a high reputation [...] . The puddlers received, as a rule, 1 shilling for each pound of the selling price " (Munro, 1889, p. 141). By the 1880 's, arrangements linking wages to product prices were generally referred to as "sliding scales. " In Britain, they had become standard practice for skilled iron and steel workers (Munro, 1885) and common in coalmining, where wages of about 120, 000 men were linked to coal prices (Munro, 1885, 1889).
