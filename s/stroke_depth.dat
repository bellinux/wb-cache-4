With respect to paper dating, in the past, Max Frei theory (based only on microscope analysis) claimed that strokes are time-dependent.

In this way, we have the purpose to verify the real possibility of documents dating by means of Max Frei theory. Subsequently, we test how the 3 D profile of strokes changes in connection with the microclimatic variations. In particular, we test humidity variations. With this experiment, we show that humidity variations reduce the <b>strokes</b> <b>depth.</b> Moreover, this effect shows a non-linear trend, leaving a hysteresis on the depth.

A multi-purpose manipulator (MPM) system has been developed and attached to the W 7 -X vessel before the operational phase 1. 1. The system was designed as user facility for many diagnostics, which can be mounted on a unique interface without breaking the W 7 -X vacuum. The manipulator system, located in the equatorial plane, transports the inserted diagnostic probe {{to the edge of the}} inner vacuum vessel.

40|$|The time of {{occurrence}} and spatial {{location of the}} advance cues used to anticipate the direction and force of an opponent 2 ̆ 7 s stroke in squash were examined using a film task. This task, designed to simulate the normal perceptual display of the defensive player, consisted of two discrete parts, each containing 160 individual stroke sequences (trials). In {{the first part of}} the film task, the display was occluded at different time intervals throughout the development of the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s stroke and the 16 expert and 20 novice subjects had to predict both the direction (down-wall or cross-court) and force (drive or drop shot) of the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s stroke. In the second part of the film task, visibility to selected advance cues was occluded by placing opaque mats on the film surface. Across all of the film task conditions experts were superior to novices in predicting the event outcome from the information available, highlighting the important contribution anticipatory skills make to expert performance in this sport. Analysis of lateral (direction) error showed that the most critical time periods for extracting information about stroke direction are the periods between 160 - 80 ms prior to racket-ball contact and the period of extended ball flight arising at least 80 ms after contact. Whereas both groups were attuned to this ball flight information, only the experts were capable of picking up information from the early part of the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s actions.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sensitivity to {{information}} contained within movement patterns {{is fundamental to}} successful anticipation and deception avoidance in many sports. The {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain if expert perception of deceptive intent is dependent upon the pick-up of information of a kinematic or non-kinematic origin. METHODOLOGY: 13 expert (Olympic level), 18 intermediate and 15 novice badminton players viewed video clips of opposing players hitting strokes, either with or without deceptive intent, to either the front or back half of the court. The display, which simulated that normally available on-court, was occluded at one of four different times relative to the point of racquet-shuttle contact (viz., 160 ms before, 80 ms before, at, or 80 ms after contact). Half of the trials showed the display in normal format and half in a point-light format (white dots for joint centres against a black background). The latter condition provided only kinematic sources of information while the former also made non-kinematic cues such as colour, contour, texture and facial expressions available. Participant error in predicting <b>stroke</b> <b>depth</b> was examined as a function of skill level, deceptive intent, display mode and time of occlusion. RESULTS: For the video display mode a significant main effect was found for deceptive intent with greater prediction error invoked for all participants for the deceptive strokes. A significant group×occlusion interaction was also observed due to the earlier pick-up of information (in the period from 160 to 80 ms prior to contact) by the expert players for both deceptive and non-deceptive strokes. For the point-light display mode prediction accuracy was comparable for both the deceptive and non-deceptive strokes. An expert advantage remained on the point-light displays but the time of initial pick-up of useful information was delayed (to the period from − 80 ms until contact). CONCLUSION: Non-kinematic sources of information appear to be most critical for the effective use of movement pattern deception. Removing non-kinematic information through point-light displays eliminates prediction accuracy differences between deceptive and non-deceptive strokes and also delays the time at which expert players first pick-up useful information. Both the very early pick-up of advance information by experts and the effectiveness of deception therefore appear to be dependent upon the presence of information additional to the immutable kinematic signature of the movement.

40|$|Many {{authors have}} {{proposed}} that sprint and distance front crawl swimmers differ in their stroke characteristics, however little three-dimensional quantitative data is provided to support these assumptions. It is currently unknown whether sprint and distance swimmers exhibit distinct stroke characteristics when swimming at the same pace. There were two main purposes of this study: 1) {{to determine whether there}} are distinct kinematic and kinetic differences between sprint and distance front crawl swimmers, and 2) to investigate whether stroke characteristics of front crawl swimmers, in terms of kinematic and kinetic variables change with swimming speed. Fifteen male national/international front crawl swimmers (17. 87 +/- 2. 33 yrs; 73. 87 +/- 8. 72 kg; 183. 02 +/- 6. 84 cm) volunteered to participate in this study. This sample was composed of seven sprint (SG) and eight distance (DG) swimmers. Each testing session required swimmers to perform four 25 m sprints and one 400 m max effort (front crawl), with no pacing strategy, in a randomised order. Each trial was performed through a 6. 75 m 3 calibrated space and recorded by six gen-locked JVC KY 32 CCD cameras (4 below and 2 above water) sampling at a frequency of 50 fields per second. All trials were processed using ‘APAS’ software to obtain 3 D coordinate data. Anthropometric measures were quantified using the elliptical zone method. Both data sets were entered into a bespoke MATLAB program which output: average swim velocity (Vav), stroke length (SL), stroke frequency (SF), stroke index (SI), vertical and lateral displacement for each segment, shoulder and hip roll angle, and elbow joint angle variables (1 st back, shoulder x, end back, hand exit and recovery elbow angle). Stroke phase (entry, pull, push and recovery) durations (%) were quantified at instants corresponding to percentiles of the stroke cycle. Centre of mass position data were obtained from the digitised 3 D data using a 14 segment rigid link body model in conjunction with the body segment parameter data obtained by the elliptical zone method. Component whole body velocity (VCOMHor), acceleration (accCOM) and net force (forceCOM) were derived from the centre of mass position data. Variables were statistically analysed in SPSS v. 14. 0, using a General Linear Model, repeated measures analysis of variance. The results indicated that the groups differed (p< 0. 05) with respect to the duration of the pull phase, the occurrence of max left and right shoulder roll and the temporal sequencing of the shoulders and hips rolling at both sprint and distance pace. Other variables approached significance between the groups, particularly when distance swimming, such as the duration of the push phase (p= 0. 082), the Vav (p= 0. 071) and average VCOMHor (p= 0. 071). The stroke kinematic variables that changed between paces (p< 0. 05) were the duration of the entry, pull, push, hand exit and recovery phases; the elbow angle at the end back position and the push phase range; total shoulder and hip roll; the sum average vertical displacement of the foot; the time to max vertical and lateral displacement of the finger; the time at max right elbow extension; the average VCOMHor, Min VCOMHor and Max VCOMHor. The stroke kinetic variables that changed between paces (p< 0. 05) were the Min accCOM, Max accCOM, range of accCOM, min forceCOM and max forceCOM. Other variables approached significance between the paces such as the entry elbow angle (p= 0. 084), the max right elbow extension (p= 0. 056), the finger lateral range (p= 0. 067) and the time to max accCOM (p= 0. 079). The SG displayed shorter durations of the pull and push phases than the DG for both paces, which was linked to the faster horizontal velocity and/or vertical acceleration of the hand. The sequencing order of the shoulders and hips changed between groups and paces, which was speculated to be controlled by the magnitude of the leg-kick. The main changes between paces were the greater magnitude of elbow angle at both the end back position and the push phase range, which contributed to the adjustment of kinetic variables. SL, SF, SI, Vav and the duration of the all the stroke phases changed between sprint and distance pace {{in order to meet the}} physiological requirements of the race distance. The prolonged duration of the entry phase, when distance swimming, resulted in a delayed attainment of the catch position and maximum <b>stroke</b> <b>depth.</b> Moreover, the magnitude of shoulder and hip roll increased at distance compared to sprint pace, which in turn influenced the magnitude of average vertical and range of lateral displacement of the finger between paces. In conclusion, contrary to the literature, SG and DG differed only with respect to the duration of the pull and push stroke phases and the sequencing order of the shoulders and hips. All swimmers adjust the majority of kinematic and kinetic variables depending on the swim pace in order to optimise performance for that race distance.

Understanding of foraging behavior is essential for a comprehensive understanding of overall diving behavior. Although several techniques of measuring feeding behavior have been developed, direct measurement of feeding efficiency has not been made. Simultaneous measurement of feeding rate and effort is essential to study feeding efficiency. In order to develop simultaneous measurement of feeding events and effort (swim stroke) we tested a new mandible accelerometer method on free ranging Weddell seals in the Atka Bay, Eckstroem Ice Shelf, Antarctica in November/December 2008. Before to conduct the field test on Weddell seals, we attached the accelerometers (D 2 GT; 15 mm in diameter, 53 mm in length, 18 g in air, Little Leonardo, Tokyo) on the mandible of captive harp seals.

Clinching is also used in furniture and computer industries, in different kind household appliances as well as in ventilation and air conditioning products. Clinching is the mechanical clamping methods to join sheet metal without extra components, which use the special tools to form a mechanical interlock between the sheets metal. Normally, the tools of mechanical clinching are a punch and a die. The first procedure to carry out this research is by design the suitable punch and die shape in joining two sheet metals. All the parameters that involve in fabricating the punch and die shape such as the diameter of die, the diameter of punch, punch <b>stroke,</b> die <b>depth</b> and the thickness of the sheet, the point that must be emphasis. This all factors are related to each other. If the parameters are not suitable, it may cause the interlocking between two sheets will not happen. Thus, no joining process are occur. For the die diameter, it must consider the size of punch diameter and also the thickness of sheet metal for in being fabricate. This is because if it too large or too small, it may cause the defect to occur which are button separation mode for the large size of die diameter and neck fracture for the small size of die diameter. Meanwhile, for the punch stroke, it must consider the die depth and also the thickness of the sheet metal. If the small punch stroke are apply at thick sheet metal and small die depth, it may cause the joining between the two sheets will not occur. Hence, die depth and the thickness of the sheet metal should be emphasized before deciding the punch stroke to ensure the interlocking will occur...|$|R

40|$|In the wild, seabirds dive {{longer than}} their {{theoretical}} aerobic dive limit (oxygen store divided by oxygen consumption rate). One {{of the potential}} explanations {{for this is that}} when descending in water seabirds regulate their foot or wing strokes to compensate their upward buoyancy, which decreases with the current depth to reduce oxygen consumption rate. The change in frequency of wing or foot <b>stroke</b> with current <b>depths</b> was compared between South Georgian Shag Notocarbo georgianus (SGSG), Common Murre Uria aalge (COMU), and Macaroni Penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus (MCPN) using biologging techniques. When descending to 60 m depth, the frequency of thrust and foot stroke decreased in SGSG, which make a forward thrust at each foot stroke. While in COMU, the frequency of thrust decreased, whereas wing stroke was nearly constant. COMU made a thrust with each up- and down-stroke in shallow water but only with each down-stroke in deeper water. In MCPN, however, the frequency of thrust did not change with the current depth. The MCPN made strokes at a nearly constant rate, while making thrusts with each up- and down-stroke at any depth. Because of the shallower descent angle of MCPN, compared with those of SGSG and COMU, MCPN should require relatively little thrust in order to compensate for its buoyancy and thus might not need to change the frequency of thrust with current depth. Swimming speeds during descent were nearly constant (1. 4 – 2. 2 m/s) in SGSG, COMU and MCPN. These three species appeared to regulate their strokes to maintain a range of swimming speeds. Biologging techniques reveal the biomechanical regulation of movement of birds under morphological and physical constraints. This provides a new approach to understanding the behavioural ecology of birds flying in the air and water...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of a relationship between regional seismicity and changes in volcanic activity {{has been the subject}} of several studies in the last years. Generally, activity in basaltic volcanoes such as Villarica (Chile) and Tungurahua (Ecuador) shows very little changes after the occurrence of regional earthquakes. In a few cases volcanic activity has changed before the occurrence of regional earthquakes, such as observed at Teide, Tenerife, in 2004 and 2005 (Tárraga et al., 2006). In this paper we explore the possible link between regional seismicity and changes in volcanic activity at Mt. Etna in 2006 and 2007. On 24 November, 2006 at 4 : 37 : 40 GMT an earthquake of magnitude 4. 7 stroke the eastern coast of Sicily. The epicenter was localized 50 km SE of the south coast of the island, and at about 160 km from the summit craters of Mt. Etna. The SSEM (Spectral Seismic Energy Measurement) of the seismic signal at stations at 1 km and 6 km from the craters highlights that four hours before this earthquake the energy associated with volcanic tremor increased, reached a maximum, and finally became steady when the earthquake occurred. Conversely, neither before nor after the earthquake, the SSEM of stations located between 80 km and 120 km from the epicentre and outside the volcano edifice showed changes. On 5 September, 2007 at 21 : 24 : 13 GMT an earthquake of magnitude 3. 2 and 7. 9 km <b>depth</b> <b>stroke</b> the Lipari Island, at the north of Sicily. About 38 hours before the earthquake occurrence, there was an episode of lava fountain lasting 20 hours at Etna volcano. The SSEM of the seismic signal recorded during the lava fountain at a station located at 6 km from the craters highlights changes heralding this earthquake ten hours before its occurrence using the FFM method (e. g., Voight, 1988; Ortiz et al., 2003). A change in volcanic activity – with the onset of ash emission and Strombolian explosions – was observed a couple of hours before the occurrence of the regional earthquakes. It can be interpreted as the magmatic response to a change of the distribution of tectonic stress in the edifice before the earthquake. In the light of this hypothesis, we surmise that the magmatic system behaved similar to a dilatometer and promise news lines to forecasting the volcano activity...|$|R
