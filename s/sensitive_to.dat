5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E

5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are measured by the peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are more <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood.|$|E

5|$|A {{trial in}} Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such species as Grevillea steiglitziana) {{was part of}} a {{secondary}} regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.|$|E

This report assesses the (1) extent to which agency guidance and contracts contain safeguards for contractor access <b>to</b> <b>sensitive</b> information, and (2) adequacy of governmentwide guidance on how agencies are <b>to</b> safeguard <b>sensitive</b> information <b>to</b> which contractors may have access. To conduct this work, GAO identified key attributes involving sensitive-information safeguards, analyzed guidance and met with officials at three agencies selected for their extensive reliance on contractor employees, analyzed 42 of their contract actions for services potentially requiring contractor access <b>to</b> <b>sensitive</b> information, and analyzed the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and pending FAR changes regarding governmentwide guidance on contractor safeguards for access <b>to</b> <b>sensitive</b> information. ...|$|R
5|$|Alprazolam, {{like other}} benzodiazepines, binds to {{specific}} {{sites on the}} GABAA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) receptor. When bound to these sites, which {{are referred to as}} benzodiazepine receptors, it modulates the effect of GABAA receptors and, thus, of GABAergic neurons. Long-term use causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> stimulation and thus making the drugs less potent.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> wind direction.|$|E

5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> cold.|$|E
