The question of future <b>surgical</b> <b>expenses</b> proves {{to be a problem}} as it entertains the probability of the occurrence of an uncertain future event. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Expose {{the weak}} loops in the Chinese medical {{insurance}} coverage and uncover hospitals' role of over-pricing hospitalized insured patients {{compared with those}} non-insured. Methods: A multi-linear regression method was used to analyze hospitalization expense for insured and uninsured patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, benign uterine tumors, and normal delivery. Results: Hospitalization cost is higher among insured than uninsured patients due to longer hospitalization lengths of stay, type of disease (highest among cholecystitis patients), type of gender - females, old-aged people, and type of marital status - singles, as well as drugs expenses, <b>surgical</b> <b>expenses,</b> and other medical acts. Conclusion: Require a better government's supervision system over medical insurance expenses such as reforming methods of payments, building up new cost compensation mechanism, and unifying and stabilizing prices for each category of medicines.

40|$|Descemet {{membrane}} endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) is a corneal {{surgical technique}} which selectively replaces the damaged posterior {{part of the}} cornea with a healthy donor graft retaining {{the rest of the}} tissue intact. There is a need to validate and standardize the donor tissue before grafting due to certain issues that can lead to consequences such as graft failure due to poor endothelial cell count, higher mortality, detachment of the graft, or increased <b>surgical</b> <b>expenses,</b> time, and effort. Thus, prospective potential surgeons and eye banks should now aim at developing new improved surgical techniques in order to prepare the best suited, validated, precut, preloaded, and easy to transplant tissue to reduce pre- and postsurgical complications. This could be achieved by defining parameters like graft thickness, accepted mortality threshold of the endothelial cells, and behavior of grafts during preservation and transportation along with using more sophisticated instruments like microkeratome and femtosecond lasers for graft preparation. Thus, a rapport between the eye banks and the surgeons along with the advanced instruments can overcome this challenge to find the best possible solution for endothelial keratoplasty (EK) ...|$|E
40|$|Kidney {{transplantation}} significantly improves patient survival, and is {{the most}} cost effective renal replacement option compared with dialysis therapy. Living kidney donors provide a valuable societal gift, but face many formidable disincentive barriers that include not only short- and long-term health risks, but also concerns regarding financial expenditures and health insurance. Other than governmental coverage for their medical evaluation and <b>surgical</b> <b>expenses,</b> donors are often asked to personally bear a significant financial responsibility due to lost work wages and travel expenses. In order to alleviate this economic burden for donors, we advocate for the consideration of tax credits, lifelong health insurance coverage, and an outcomes registry as societal reciprocity to reward their altruistic act of kidney donation. Key words: kidney transplantation, live donor transplantation, policy, risk End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a terminal condition unless treated via dialysis or transplantation. Of the two options, transplantation is preferred by {{the patient and the}} physician be-cause of reduced morbidity and mortality, increased quality of life and lower health care costs compared with dialysis [1, 2]. Within transplantation, donated kidneys come from the gener...|$|E
40|$|Basil Chapman {{retired from}} ACF Industries, a railroad-car maker, after thirty-eight years of service. In December 2003, he {{received}} an unexpected phone call at his West Virginia home from a union representative, who informed him that an ACF executive wanted to speak with him. When they spoke, the executive informed Mr. Chapman that ACF was planning on changing its retirees’ health coverage plan. The ACF plan would now have a lifetime maximum benefit cap on hospital and <b>surgical</b> <b>expenses</b> for each participant and would require retirees to make monthly contributions. According to court papers filed later, Mr. Chapman responded, “We have a contract. You can’t do that. ” Then, {{he said that he}} would “file in federal court” against ACF. The next business day, ACF filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri asking the court to rule that retiree benefits were not vested and that ACF accordingly could alter benefits unilaterally. On January 26, 2004, Mr. Chapman, other named plaintiffs, and their union sued ACF in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia...|$|E
