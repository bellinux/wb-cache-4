40|$|Extraction {{constants}} (Kex & Kex±) for {{the extraction}} of <b>silver</b> <b>picrate</b> (AgPic) by benzo- 18 -crown- 6 ether (B 18 C 6) into 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE) were determined at 298 K and various ionic strength (I) -values of a water phase with or without excess HNO 3. Here the symbols, Kex and Kex±, were defined as [AgLPic]DCE/P and [AgL+]DCE[Pic−]DCE/P with P = [Ag+][L]DCE[Pic−] and L = B 18 C 6, respectively; []DCE refers to the concentration of the corresponding species in the DCE phase at equilibrium. Simultaneously, KD,Pic (= [Pic−]DCE/[Pic−]) and K 1,DCE (= Kex/Kex±) values for given I and IDCE values were determined, where the symbol IDCE shows I of the DCE phase. Also, equilibrium potential differences (Δφeq) based on the Pic− transfer at the water/DCE interface {{were obtained from the}} analysis of the KD,Pic [= KD,PicS exp{−(F/RT) Δφeq}] values; the symbol KD,PicS shows KD,Pic at Δφeq = 0 V. On the basis of these results, I dependences of logKex and logKex± and IDCE ones of logK 1,DCE and logKex± were examined. Extraction experiments of AgClO 4 and AgNO 3 by B 18 C 6 into DCE were done for comparison. The logKex±-versus-Δφeq plot for the above Ag(I) extraction systems with Pic−, ClO 4 −, and NO 3 − gave a good positive correlation...|$|E
40|$|Novel cage-functionalized azacrown ethers, i. e. 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, 61 and 62, {{which have}} various crown cavity and {{different}} number of nitrogen atoms incorporated, have been prepared. X-ray structures of 53, 55 and 57 {{have been obtained}} {{for the study of}} the crown topological structure. The complexation properties of crown 51, 52, 57, 61 and 62 have been evaluated via alkali metal picrate extraction, <b>silver</b> <b>picrate</b> extraction and ESI-MS study. The novel cage-fuctionalized azacrown ethers generally exhibit high avidity and selectivity towards Ag+ versus alkali metal ions and some transition metals i. e. Cu 2 +, Mn 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ni 2 + and Pb 2 +. Crown 61 displays significant avidity and selectivity toward K+ in alkali metal picrate extraction experiments vis-à-vis the remaining alkali metal picrates. Three types of ditopic ion-exchange receptors for sodium hydroxide extraction study have been designed. All of the crown ether molecules have proper cavity for selective sodium complexation and have weakly acidic ionizable alcohols for sodium-proton exchange under strongly basic conditions. Crown 80 and 81 were synthesized; key intermediates for the synthesis of crown 82, 83 and 84 have been prepared. The preparation of 99 afforded an unexpected crown 103. The preparation of 109 had been attempted, but could not be successfully isolated. Four novel cage-functionalized calix[4]arene crown- 5, i. e. 113 - 116, have been synthesized. The structures of 113 and 116 have been established by X-ray crystal structural analysis and NMR spectral analysis. The complexation properties of the four ionic receptors have been studied via alkali metal picrate extraction experiments. Crown 115 and 116 display more than modest avidity toward alkali metal ions and are most selective toward K+ vis-à-vis 113 and 114...|$|E
40|$|A {{partially}} substituted calix[4]resorcarene receptor, namely, 5, 17 -ethylthiomethylated calix[4]resorcarene, 1, {{has been}} synthesized and characterized by 1 H NMR in CD 3 OD, CDCl 3, and CD 3 CN and 13 C NMR in CD 3 OD, {{as well as}} by 2 D NMR. Partition data in the methanol-hexane and acetonitrile-hexane solvent systems show that the monomeric species are predominant in these solvents. The solubility of 1 in various solvents was determined at 298. 15 K. These data were used to calculate the standard solution Gibbs energy of 1 in these solvents. Taking hexane as the reference solvent, the standard transfer Gibbs energy of 1 to various solvents was calculated. Good agreement is found between the DeltatG(o) values in the hexane-methanol and hexane-acetonitrile and the DeltapG(o) values of this ligand in these solvent systems. The higher partition constant of 1 in the hexane-methanol relative to the hexane-acetonitrile solvent system contrasts with corresponding data for the fully functionalized receptor, 2. This is explained in terms of the solvation differences of these receptors in these solvents as reflected in the DeltatG(o) values. The cation complexing properties of this receptor were investigated through 1 H NMR, conductance, calorimetric, and potentiometric methods. Among the metal cations (alkali, alkaline earth, heavy, and transition), 1 interacts only with Ag+ in methanol and Hg 2 + in propylene carbonate, acetonitrile, methanol, and N,N-dimethylformamide. While 1 forms a 1 : 1 complex with Ag+ in methanol, the hosting ability of the receptor for the mercury cation is enhanced in methanol, acetonitrile, and N,N-diethylformamide. Thus, Hg 2 + complexes of 1 : 2 (ligand:metal cation) stoichiometry are found in these solvents. In moving to propylene carbonate, the composition of the mercury complex is altered from 1 : 2 to 1 : 1. The results are compared with corresponding data for 2 and these metal cations in the appropriate solvents. The lack of stability observed for 2 and Hg 2 + in acetonitrile resulting from the departure of pendant arms from the resorcarene backbone greatly contrasts with the high stability observed for 1 and this metal cation in the various solvents. Preliminary results on the extraction of <b>silver</b> <b>picrate</b> by this ligand in the water-dichloromethane solvent system are reported. Final conclusions are given...|$|E
