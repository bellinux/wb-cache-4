5|$|Certain {{scenes in}} Cannibal Holocaust {{have also been}} noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film Savana violenta, {{specifically}} the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Monroe bathes naked in {{the river and the}} scene of the forced abortion rite. The cinéma vérité style used heavily in Cannibal Holocaust was also used before in Climati's first Mondo film, Ultime grida dalla savana, in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions. Another <b>scene,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a native man is captured, tortured, and murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.|$|E
5|$|Hergé later {{concluded}} that the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Tintin hoodwinked the Inca with {{his knowledge of the}} sun was implausible, suggesting that solar worshipers with a keen knowledge of astronomy like the Inca would have been well aware of the sun and its eclipses.|$|E
5|$|Many planned {{elements}} were never filmed, due to production time constraints. Moore {{had hoped for}} an extended battle <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Data would be electrocuted, and Wesley Crusher blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19.|$|E

5|$|On the DVD Commentary, series creator Rob Thomas {{opined that}} the {{relationship}} between Veronica and Keith was the core of the series and listed the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Keith stays up all night before scaring Veronica in the morning as one of his favorite examples of their chemistry in the season. Thomas highlighted the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a girl shows Veronica around the sorority as indicative of Hansen's comedic talents; in addition, it marked the first appearance of David Tom in the season, a guest star in season two who was brought back for a recurring role in this season. The actress who played the girl showing Veronica around, Keri Lynn Pratt, previously appeared in the film Drive Me Crazy, which Thomas co-wrote.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} began in October 2012 with film's lead cast. The film was shot in Goa, Mumbai and Cape Town. During the filming in South Africa, Shraddha Kapoor needed medical attention after kneeling on broken glass fragments during the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> she had to kneel {{on the floor and}} talk to her co-star Aditya Roy Kapoor. Aditya Roy Kapoor also received burns to his hand during the filming of the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they light some Chinese lanterns in Cape Town.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} based on “a couple of incidents” that the writers had heard about in which {{troublesome}} children, through alternative sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens {{as part of their}} punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced had to wear certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had not paid taxes. The <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's police car {{was based on}} one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running police car parked at a Dunkin' Donuts while the police were in the store.|$|E

The computer graphic ("Damon loves Debbie") that Debbie programs within a few minutes was programmed by Charles Forsyth.|$|R
5|$|The song is the namesake for the 2014 film Obvious Child; {{it appears}} in a <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> two {{characters}} drunkenly dance together. Director Gillian Robespierre titled the film with hope that its meaning would be ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes that {{appeared}} in the storyboard and animatic were reordered or dropped altogether in {{the final version of the}} episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. A <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.|$|E
5|$|A {{seamless}} 40-second driving <b>scene,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Michael Sullivan {{and his son}} travel into Chicago {{from the}} countryside, was aided by visual effects. The live-action part of the scene was filmed at LaSalle Street, and {{due to the lack}} of scenery for part of the drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects.|$|E

The scene, however, didn't {{make it in the}} final film.|$|E
5|$|According to Slovak filmmaker Juraj Herz, the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a {{group of}} women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film Zastihla mě noc (Night Caught Up with Me, 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.|$|E

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as in the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the}} same time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|Assante and Banderas {{did their}} own singing, and studied {{to master the}} {{instruments}} their characters use in the film. Assante practiced on drums, preparing for a <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> his character plays a musical number with Tito Puente. Banderas worked to mimic the correct posture and finger placements for his character's trumpet performances, while the actual playing was performed by Arturo Sandoval.|$|E
5|$|Fifty animators {{worked on}} the <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the castle is built, and one frame {{required}} 30 hours to render. They later extended similar techniques to Elsa's clothing. While the traditional Norwegian rosemaling was the inspiration for her costuming early in the film, her ice gown was designed similarly to her palace, with snowflakes heavily influencing the style. Her cape itself is a large snowflake.|$|E
