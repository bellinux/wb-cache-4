40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} intake and patterns in consumption of potentially erosive beverages in school children in the Netherlands. METHODS: A cross-sectional, single centre study was performed among 502 school children in Rotterdam, in age varying between 12 and 19 years. Data on consumption of <b>soft</b> drinks, <b>energy</b> drinks, sports drinks and alcopops were obtained through a self-reported questionnaire. Gender- and age-related differences in consumption were analysed with Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Associations between variables were investigated with Chi-square tests and Spearman's rank order correlation analysis. RESULTS: Boys consumed <b>soft</b> drinks, <b>energy</b> drinks and sports drinks more frequently than girls, and on average also consumed higher amounts of these drinks. No gender-related differences were observed in alcopop consumption. Consumption of all drinks was most frequent at 14 - or 15 -year of age, {{with the exception of}} alcopops which was most frequent by 16 -year-old school children. Significant positive associations were observed between the consumption of <b>soft</b> drinks, <b>energy</b> drinks and/or sports drinks. Alcopop consumption was only associated with consumption of energy drinks. CONCLUSION: onsumption of <b>soft</b> drinks, <b>energy</b> drinks, sports drinks and alcopops by school children is related to age and gender. The significant positive associations between the consumption of these drinks suggest that a subgroup of school children exists with a high cumulative intake of these potentially erosive drinks...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the and spectra of 21 broad line AGN (QSOs) with z∼ 1 detected in the 2 - 10 keV band with the. The summed spectrum in the band is well described by a power-law with Γ= 1. 56 ± 0. 18, flatter that the average spectral index of bright QSOs and consistent with the spectrum of the X-ray background in this band. The flat spectrum in the band could be explained by only a moderate absorption (∼ 10 ^ 22 cm^- 2) assuming the typical AGN spectrum ie a power-law with Γ= 1. 9. This could in principle suggest that some of the highly obscured AGN, required by most X-ray background synthesis models, may be associated with normal blue QSOs rather than narrow-line AGN. However, the combined 0. 5 - 8 keV - spectrum is well fit by a power-law of Γ= 1. 7 ± 0. 2 with a spectral upturn at <b>soft</b> <b>energies.</b> It has been pointed out that such an upturn may be an artefact of uncertainties in the calibration of the ROSAT or ASCA detectors. Nevertheless if real, it could imply that the above absorption model suggested by the data alone is ruled out. Then a large fraction of QSOs could have "concave" spectra ie they gradually steepen towards <b>softer</b> <b>energies.</b> This result is in agreement with the hardness ratio analysis of ∼ 100 hard X-ray selected sources.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{personal and}} environmental correlates of Belgian university students’ <b>soft</b> and <b>energy</b> drink consumption and investigated whether these associations were moderated by gender or residency. Four hundred twenty-five university students completed a self-reported on-line questionnaire assessing socio-demographics, health status, <b>soft</b> and <b>energy</b> drink consumption, {{as well as}} personal and environmental factors related to <b>soft</b> and <b>energy</b> drink consumption. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Students believing soft drink intake should be minimized (individual subjective norm), finding it less difficult to avoid soft drinks (perceived behavioral control), being convinced they could avoid soft drinks in different situations (self-efficacy), having family and friends who rarely consume soft drinks (modelling), and having stricter family rules about soft drink intake {{were less likely to}} consume soft drinks. Students showing stronger behavioral control, having stricter family rules about energy drink intake, and reporting lower energy drink availability were less likely to consume energy drinks. Gender and residency moderated several associations between psychosocial constructs and consumption. Future research should investigate whether interventions focusing on the above personal and environmental correlates can indeed improve university students’ beverage choices...|$|R

The hyperon-meson couplings are chosen according to experimental values of the hyperon nuclear matter potentials, and possible uncertainties are considered. It is shown that a <b>softer</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> gives rise to stars with less hyperons, smaller radii and larger masses. Hyperon-meson couplings may also have a strong effect on the mass of the star. Comment: 7 pages, revtex, accepted in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of GRB durations is bimodal, {{but there is}} little additional evidence to support the division of GRBs into short and long classes. Based on simple hardness ratios, several studies have shown a tendency for longer GRBs to have <b>softer</b> <b>energy</b> spectra.

40|$|The impact {{parameter}} dependence of ratio is examined in heavy-ion collisions at 400 MeV/nucleon within a transport model. It is {{shown that the}} sensitivity of ratio on symmetry energy shows a transition from central to peripheral collisions, i. e., the stiffer symmetry energy leads to a larger ratio in peripheral collisions while the <b>softer</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> always leads this ratio to be larger in central collisions. After checking the kinematic energy distribution of ratio, we found this transition of sensitivity of ratio to symmetry energy is mainly from less energetic pions, i. e., the <b>softer</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> gets the less energetic pions to form a smaller ratio in peripheral collisions while these pions generate a larger ratio in central collisions. Undoubtedly, the <b>softer</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> can also lead more energetic pions to form a larger ratio in peripheral collisions. Nevertheless, considering that most of pions are insufficient energetic at this beam energy, we therefore suggest the ratio as a probe of the high-density symmetry energy effective only in central at most to midcentral collisions, thereby avoiding the possible information of low-density symmetry energy carried in ratio from peripheral collisions.
