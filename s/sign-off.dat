The judge later validated the contract once Steve Irwin's death certificate was presented to the court, resulting in Bindi receiving a $350,000 paycheck from the show.|$|E

The following day, images of the host were removed from the front windows of the News Corp. Building. O'Reilly was not given an opportunity to <b>sign-off</b> on-air, instead releasing a statement through his agency about the matter, while continuing to deny the sexual harassment allegations against him.

During that timeframe, KRON also produced a Saturday morning children's program called Buster and Me. From the 1970s into the late 1980s, the station used Gabriel Fauré's Pavane, Opus 50 as the music piece played during its nightly <b>sign-off,</b> alongside scenic rustic shots from around the Bay Area. KRON also produced Bay Area Backroads, a half-hour program (which ran from the mid-1980s to 2008) that profiled places {{and people in the}} greater San Francisco Bay Area, and occasionally beyond.
