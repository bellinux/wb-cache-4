5|$|The Rodrigues rail is {{believed}} to have become extinct in the mid-18th century because of predation by introduced cats and destruction of its habitat by tortoise hunters. Apart from information gathered from subfossil bones, the bird is poorly known and was only documented from life by two contemporaneous accounts, but no such illustrations. The bird was first mentioned by François Leguat, a French Huguenot refugee marooned on Rodrigues in 1691, and was named E. leguati in his honour in 1874. The <b>second</b> <b>account</b> was by Julien Tafforet, also marooned on the island in 1726. Subfossil remains were later discovered and connected with the old accounts.|$|E
5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the <b>second</b> <b>account,</b> Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E
5|$|Wighard was a Saxon priest {{during the}} late 7th century, and a native of Kent. He served in the {{household}} of Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury, and was also a priest at Canterbury. The 8th-century writer Bede says that Wighard was selected to be Archbishop of Canterbury, {{and that he was}} sent to Rome to visit Pope Vitalian for confirmation and to receive his pallium. How exactly he was selected, and when that occurred, is open to debate, as Bede himself had two different stories. The first one, related in his Historia Abbatum, stated that Wighard was selected by King Ecgberht of Kent. Fifteen years after Bede's completion of the Historia Abbatum, Bede wrote the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, which states that Wighard was selected by Oswiu of Northumbria and Ecgberht with the consent of all the clergy and people. Some modern historians have followed Bede's <b>second</b> <b>account,</b> but others feel that only Ecgberht selected Wighard.|$|E

25|$|In a later publication, True Travels (1630), Smith {{claimed a}} similar rescue by another {{young girl in}} 1602, {{following}} his capture by Turks in Hungary; the story resembles a popular contemporary type of moral tale, in which a Christian hero maintains his faith despite threats and intimidation. Karen Ordahl Kupperman suggests that Smith used such details to embroider his first account, thus producing a more dramatic, <b>second</b> <b>account</b> of his encounter with Pocahontas as a heroine worthy of reception by Queen Anne. Its later revision and publication was probably an attempt to raise his own stock and reputation; he had long since fallen from favor with the Company that had funded the Jamestown enterprise. Gleach, drawing on substantial ethnohistory, suggests that Smith's <b>second</b> <b>account,</b> while substantially accurate, represents his misunderstanding of a three-stage ritual intended to adopt Smith, as representative of the English colony, into the confederacy; but not all writers are convinced, some suggesting the absence of certain corrborating evidence.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{academic}} performance of students in their first full year of accounting at Monash University to determine the variability in the marks in the <b>second</b> <b>accounting</b> subject that can be explained by performance in the first. Monash University has a number of campuses in Australia and internationally, and analysis is also undertaken on the variability by campus. Design/methodology/approach – Data for this paper are obtained from the end of semester marks in the first and <b>second</b> <b>accounting</b> subject. The variability in the marks is analysed using the co-efficient of determination. Findings – The findings show there is some relationship between the marks obtained in first two accounting subjects, however the results show that the variability in the marks in the second subject that can be explained by the knowledge in the first subject accounts for between 25 and 28 per cent. The analysis by campus also shows wide discrepancy. Practical implications – The results of this paper have implications for academics teaching the first two introductory subjects and students. Originality/value – While the advantage of prior knowledge is well documented, this paper provides more insight on the conflicting research findings on the value of the prior knowledge of the first accounting subject on the second. It also provides a statistical measure of that accounts for the variability. The paper also examines the results of students in the first and <b>second</b> <b>accounting</b> subject at various campuses as very little prior research has addressed this issue.

25|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{whether or not}} Pocahontas saved John Smith exists largely because Smith wrote two very different accounts of his captivity. The first one, published in 1608, included a generally flattering description of Powhatan and his tribe. This first account contained no mention of almost being slain by Powhatan. It was not until Smith released his <b>second</b> <b>account</b> around 1622 that he described any cruel treatment by Powhatan, and his supposed rescue by Pocahontas. Because Smith's two accounts consist of very different facts, and because the second was released only after Pocahontas had gained prominence in England, many hypothesize that Smith embellished {{the story of his}} captivity with respect to Pocahontas.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>account,</b> {{from the}} Weilue, {{mentioned}} that Cao Zhen's original family name was Qin (秦), {{and that he}} was adopted into the Cao family. In this account, Cao Zhen's father was one Qin Bonan (秦伯南), who was a close friend of Cao Cao. Around 195, when Cao Cao was being attacked by soldiers under a rival warlord Yuan Shu, he took shelter in Qin Bonan's house. When the soldiers showed up and asked him where Cao Cao was, Qin Bonan claimed that he was Cao Cao and was killed by the soldiers. Out of gratitude to Qin Bonan for saving his life, Cao Cao adopted his children and allowed them to bear his family name.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>account</b> by Yahya of Antioch, {{and also}} cited by Ibn al-'Adim, holds that Nasr's coup took {{place after the}} Battle of Azaz. Accordingly, when Thimal left Aleppo to bring back his family to the city after Nasr's victory over the Byzantines, Nasr {{took control of the}} citadel in his absence. Historian Suhayl Zakkar asserts that this account was the more likely scenario, {{particularly}} since Nasr immediately appealed for Byzantine forgiveness and protection, offering an annual tribute of 500,000 dirhams, despite his decisive victory over Romanos at Azaz; Zakkar explains that Nasr's spontaneous offer to the Byzantines must have come as a result of Kilabi dissent or threats toward his rule organized by Thimal in response to the latter's ouster.|$|E

25|$|Imperial Mali is {{best known}} through three primary sources: {{the first is the}} account of Shihab al-'Umari, written in about 1340 by a geographer-administrator in Mamluk Egypt. His {{information}} about the empire came from visiting Malians taking the hajj, or pilgrim's voyage to Mecca. He had first-hand information from several sources, and from a second-hand source, he learned of the visit of Mansa Musa. The <b>second</b> <b>account</b> is that of the traveller Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali in 1352. This is the first account of a West African kingdom made directly by an eyewitness; the others are usually second-hand. The third great account is that of Ibn Khaldun, who wrote in the early 15th century. While the accounts are of limited length, they provide a fairly good picture of the empire at its height.|$|E
25|$|Progress on Le Griffon was {{fraught with}} problems. Suffering from cold and low on supplies, {{the men were}} close to mutiny. The uneasy truce with the Indians was tested by threats and {{attempts}} of sabotage and murder. Tonti learned {{of a plan to}} burn the ship before it could be launched, so he launched ahead of schedule and Le Griffon entered the waters in early May, 1679. Hennepin's first account says she was a vessel of about 45 tons; his second says 60 tons. Because his <b>second</b> <b>account</b> has numerous exaggerations and cases where he credits himself for things that La Salle had done, Hennepin's first account is considered more reliable. In any case, Le Griffon was larger than any other vessel on the lakes at the time, and as far as contemporary reports can confirm, the first named vessel. Her fitting out continued {{the next couple of months}} and when La Salle arrived in July he was encouraged by her readiness.|$|E

500|$|The case {{system of}} Middle Mongol has {{remained}} mostly intact {{down to the}} present, although important changes occurred with the comitative and the dative and most other case suffixes did undergo slight changes in form, i.e., were shortened. The Middle Mongol comitative -luγ-a {{could not be used}} attributively, but it was replaced by the suffix -taj that originally derived adjectives denoting possession from nouns, e.g. mori-tai 'having a horse' became mor'toj 'having a horse/with a horse'. As this adjective functioned parallel to ügej 'not having', {{it has been suggested that}} a [...] "privative case" [...] ('without') has been introduced into Mongolian. There have been three different case suffixes in the dative-locative-directive domain that are grouped in different ways: -a as locative and -dur, -da as dative or -da and -a as dative and -dur as locative, in both cases with some functional overlapping. As -dur seems to be grammaticalized from dotur-a 'within', thus indicating a span of time, the <b>second</b> <b>account</b> seems to be more likely. Of these, -da was lost, -dur was first reduced to -du and then to -d and -a only survived in a few frozen environments. Finally, the directive of modern Mongolian, -ruu, has been innovated from uruγu 'downwards'. Social gender agreement was abandoned.|$|E
