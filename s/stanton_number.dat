40|$|Surface heat {{transfer}} {{rates have been}} measured for several different flows on an isothermal, convexly curved surface. The freestream velocity, boundary layer thickness, acceleration parameter, and unheated starting length were varied systematically, and both turbulent and transitional boundary layers were studied. The effect of convex curvature on {{heat transfer}} rates is significant with <b>Stanton</b> <b>numbers</b> reduced 20 - 25 % below flat wall values for the same enthalpy thickness Reynolds number. Heat transfer rates recovered slowly on a flat wall downstream of the curved wall, and after 60 cm, the <b>Stanton</b> <b>numbers</b> were still 15 - 20 % below flat wall values. The behavior of the boundary layer suggests {{the existence of an}} asymptotic condition. Boundary layer thickness, freestream velocity, and boundary layer maturity affect the initial response to the introduction of curvature and {{the rate at which the}} asymptotic state is approached. Convex curvature appears to increase the boundary layer's sensitivity to acceleration; it also delays and retards transition.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{and heat}} {{transfer}} investigations were {{done on a}} constant curvature curved plate in a subsonic wind tunnel facility for various wake passing frequencies and zero pressure gradient conditions. Steady and unsteady boundary layer transition measurements were taken on the concave surface of the curved plate at different wake passing frequencies where a rotating squirrel-cage generated the unsteady wake flow. The {{data were analyzed using}} timeaveraged and ensemble-averaged techniques to provide insight into the growth of the boundary layer and transition. Ensemble-averaged turbulence intensity contours in the temporal spatial domain showed that transition was induced for increasing wake passing frequency and structure. The local heat transfer coefficient distribution for the concave and convex surface was determined at those wake passing frequencies using a liquid crystal heat transfer measurement technique. Detailed aerodynamic and heat transfer investigations showed that higher wake passing frequency caused transition to occur earlier on the concave surface. Local <b>Stanton</b> <b>numbers</b> were also calculated on the concave surface and compared with <b>Stanton</b> <b>numbers</b> predicted using a differential boundary layer and heat transfer calculation method.

The average <b>Stanton</b> <b>numbers</b> for block heights of 15 and 25 mm were higher than those of flat surface by % 38 and % 84, respectively.

5000|$|In 2008, the {{qualitative}} form of validity of Reynolds' analogy was re-visited for laminar flow of incompressible fluid with variable dynamic viscosity (μ). [...] It was {{shown that the}} inverse dependence of Reynolds number (Re) and skin friction coefficient(cf) {{is the basis for}} validity of the Reynolds’ analogy, in laminar convective flows with constant & variable μ. For μ = const. it reduces to the popular form of <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> (St) increasing with increasing Re, whereas for variable μ it reduces to St increasing with decreasing Re. Consequently, the Chilton-Colburn analogy of St•Pr2/3 increasing with increasing cf is qualitatively valid whenever theReynolds’ analogy is valid. Further, the validity of the Reynolds’ analogy is linked to the applicability of Prigogine's Theorem of Minimum Entropy Production. [...] Thus, Reynolds' analogy is valid for flows that are close to developed, for whom, changes in the gradients of field variables (velocity & temperature) along the flow are small.|$|E
40|$|In this study, a look {{on field}} synergy number (Fc) is presented. The field synergy number (Fc) was {{introduced}} in literature in 21 st century by Professor Zeng-Yuan Guo and co-workers.

As a result, Fc is defined in the same way like the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> (St) although the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> (St) was named after Thomas Edward Stanton (1865 - 1931). Based on this study, it is clear that existing dimensionless number in literature i. e. <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> (St) can be used instead of the field synergy number (Fc) because {{there is no need to}} change the name of the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> (St) to the field synergy number (Fc) as well as the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> (St) can be used in mass transfer applications...|$|E

The effect of unsteady periodic wakes on heat transfer and boundary layer transition was investigated on a constant curvature heat transfer curved plate in a subsonic wind tunnel facility. The local heat transfer coefficient distribution for the concave and convex surface was determined using a state of the art liquid crystal heat transfer measurement technique. Higher wake passing frequency was observed to cause transition to occur sooner on the concave surface. No effect was seen on the convex surface due a separation bubble that induced transition for all wake passing frequencies. Local <b>Stanton</b> <b>numbers</b> were also calculated on the concave surface and compared to <b>Stanton</b> <b>numbers</b> predicted by TEXSTAN. Good agreement was found between TEXSTAN and the experimental data. Steady and unsteady boundary layer measurements were taken on the concave surface of the heat transfer plate to help explain the boundary layer transition behavior and corroborate the results of the heat transfer measurements. Extensive boundary layer measurement were taken, and the data were analyzed using time-averaged and ensemble averaged techniques. The results corroborate the heat transfer data in that they show that boundary layer transition occurs earlier for higher wake passing frequencies. In addition, the start and end of transition determined by the hot-wire data is in good agreement with the heat transfer data...|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} here {{was motivated by}} concern {{over the use of}} smooth heat flux gages for heat transfer measurements on the otherwise rough turbine blades. <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> distributions and boundary layer profiles of mean temperature, mean velocity, and turbulence intensity are reported for a surface with a step change from a rough to a smooth surface. In most cases, the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> immediately downstream of the change in roughness drops below the all-smooth-wall data at the same x-Reynolds number. The alignment of the smooth surface between the bases and crests of the roughness elements is shown to have only a weak effect on the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> distribution.

Their measurement of the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> distribution not only reflects the heat loads to the turbine passage, but also, according to Reynolds analogy, the skin friction coefficient distribution over the blade. Since the cascade design without the boundary layer control can be understood as the design with a suitable skin friction coefficient distribution, the released data of the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> distribution indicate a slight possibility of the more efficient cascade design. For the given turbine flow conditions, the mentioned design would apply small deceleration before the maximum curvature region in order to achieve near-to-separation state of boundary layer (skin friction coefficient and <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> closer to zero). It would also result in lower heat load in this region. Author's Closur...|$|E

The purpose of the analysis was to get an insight of local heat transfer and fluid flow conditions in a heat exchanger and to establish widely applicable drag coefficient and <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> correlations for the heat exchanger integral model, based on average flow variables. The simulation results revealed much more complex flow behavior than reported in current literature. For each of the almost 100 analyzed cases the time distributions of the Reynolds number, the drag coefficient and the <b>Stanton</b> <b>number</b> were recorded and their average values calculated.
