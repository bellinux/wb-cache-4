5|$|A 2013 book {{researched}} by James Taylor counters {{the popular}} {{belief that the}} Leete design was an influential recruitment tool during the war. He claims the original artwork was acquired by the Imperial War Museum in 1917 and catalogued as a poster in error. Though the image of Kitchener (Britain's most popular soldier) inspired several other poster designs, Taylor <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> find no evidence in photographs {{of the time that}} the Leete poster was used, although a photograph from 15 December 1914 taken at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway station in Liverpool clearly depicts Leete's depiction among other recruiting posters.|$|E

25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price.

She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe.

Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says you have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything.

[...] At the episode's end, Olivia returns, having found no leads on Peter's location.

500|$|The {{episode is}} notable {{in that it}} was the first episode of the series to confirm Agent Scully's cancer. Reportedly, when Chris Carter {{informed}} Gillian Anderson that her character would be diagnosed with cancer, she was [...] "delighted" [...] that {{she would be able to}} play her character in a different way. John Shiban considers the episode to be [...] "a great X-Files story" [...] and very important because it established the story-arc featuring Scully's cancer. However, the audience receives an early indication of Scully's cancer in the episode [...] "Unruhe" [...] (which aired earlier in the same season, also written by Vince Gilligan), when Gerry Schnauz kidnaps her in the episode and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> see Scully's [...] "unrest", and points to the bridge of her nose–exactly where her cancer would be.|$|E
500|$|Many ancient authors mention stichometry. Galen {{complains}} about the verbosity {{of a rival}} and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> offer a description in fewer lines. In the 1st century BCE, a philosopher criticized Zeno of Citium and cited particular passages by giving their line number to the nearest hundredth line. Diogenes Laertius probably draws on the Pinakes, the published catalogue of the Library of Alexandria, when he reports {{the total number of}} lines in the oeuvres of various authors. He says, for example, that Speusippus wrote 43,475, Aristotle wrote 445,270, and Theophrastus wrote 232,808 lines. The Cheltenham Canon lists line totals for books in the Christian Bible and concludes with an anonymous note apparently written by a book dealer in the 4th century CE when the practice of stichometry was perhaps becoming less familiar: ...|$|E

Charlie <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> deliver the baby, but after he accidentally confesses that he is a recovering drug addict, she yells at him to get Jack, which leaves her alone in the jungle. Charlie finds Ethan and tells him that Claire is in labor and to get Jack. Charlie goes back to comfort Claire, who tells him the story about the psychic. Charlie suggests that the psychic knew the flight was going to crash, and this was his way of forcing Claire to raise the baby by herself. Claire stops having contractions.|$|E
500|$|The {{people in}} the {{wardrobe}} are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark {{that he no longer}} has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the [...] "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", said Andrew did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> smell carbolic soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom.

Outside, [...] "Ian" [...] locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song.

500|$|The {{television}} {{show that the}} Simpson family watches {{at the beginning of}} the episode, in which the two reviewers discuss the latest McBain film, is a parody of the American television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies. In the flashback sequence, Homer is seen singing along to the 1973 song [...] "The Joker" [...] by the Steve Miller Band while driving to school. Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin posters hang on the wall of Homer's 1974 bedroom. The 1970 song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] by The Carpenters is heard when Homer sees Marge for the first time. Homer eats a bucket of Shakespeare Fried Chicken when he reveals his feelings towards Marge to Grampa. At the debate, Homer disagrees about the idea of lowering the United States national speed limit to 55mph (90km/h), arguing that [...] "Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late!" [...] This is a reference to the National Maximum Speed Law provision of the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that prohibited speed limits higher than 55mph. Barney asks a girl named Estelle if she wants to go to the prom with him, but she tells him that she would not go to the prom with him even if he were American actor Elliott Gould. Artie <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> think of a dozen highly cogent arguments to why Marge should accept his prom offer, one of which is from a Time magazine titled [...] "America's Love Affair with the Prom: Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year," [...] a reference to the American magazine Time.

This statement is later repeated in [...] "Mawdryn Undead", the 1996 TV film and [...] "The Time of the Doctor". This aspect became embedded in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. [...] The BBC's Series 4 FAQ suggested that since the Time Lords {{were believed to be}} dead and their rules destroyed, the Doctor may be able to regenerate indefinitely: [...] "Now that his people are gone, who knows?
