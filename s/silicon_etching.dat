The fabrication process mainly consists of one <b>silicon</b> dry <b>etching</b> and one <b>silicon</b> wet <b>etching.</b> The use of <b>silicon</b> wet <b>etching</b> makes the process simple and inexpensive.

50|$|Advanced <b>silicon</b> <b>etching</b> (ASE) {{is a deep}} {{reactive}} {{ion etching}} (DRIE) technique to rapidly etch deep and high aspect ratio structures in silicon.ASE was pioneered by Surface Technology Systems Plc. (STS) in 1994 in the UK. STS has continued to develop this process with even greater etch rates while maintaining side wall roughness and selectivity.STS developed the switched process originally invented by Dr. Larmer at Bosch, Stuttgart.ASE consists in combining the fast etch rates achieved in an isotropic Si etch (usually making use of an SF6 plasma) with a deposition or passivation process (usually utilising a C4F8 plasma condensation process) by alternating the two process steps. This approach achieves the fastest etch rates while maintaining the ability to etch anisotropically, typically vertically in Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) applications.The ASE HRM is an evolution of the previous generations of ICP design, now incorporating a decoupled plasma source (patent pending). This decoupled source generates very high density plasma which is allowed to diffuse into a separate process chamber. Through careful chamber design, the excess ions that are detrimental to process control are reduced, leaving a uniform distribution of fluorine free-radicals at a higher density than that available from the conventional ICP sources. The higher fluorine free-radical density facilitates increased etch rates, typically over three times the etch rates achieved with the original Bosch process. Also, {{as a result of}} the reduction in the effect of localised depletion of these species, improved uniformity for many applications can be achieved.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on the {{hierarchical}} structure formations by fabricating hierarchical MNHS that meet the boiling heat transfer requirements mentioned above. In particular, we propose a simple fabrication process using two-step silicon etching: silicon deep trench reactive ion etching (DRIE) for microstructure fabrication and electroless <b>silicon</b> <b>etching</b> for nanowire formation. These processes are feasible and robust. In particular, the electroless <b>silicon</b> <b>etching</b> process enables uniform nanowires to be readily fabricated over a large area at room temperature, without any catalysts or templates [18 – 20]. By this simple technique, we fabricated wafer-scale hierarchical MNHS made up of micropillars/cavities covered with uniformly grown nanowires. By controlling the removal of natively coated polymeric passivation layers during DRIE (or Bosch process) [21], we obtained various combined structures by two-step <b>silicon</b> <b>etching</b> process. Especially, by removing the polymeric passivation layers which induce the conglomeration of nanowires at the boundary of micropatterns and thus make hydrophobic surface by prohibiting the cooling agent from spreading or wicking, hierarchical MNHS can readily serve to pump the water cooling agent to the surface due to the superhydrophilic characteristics. We validated that the surface wettability of those surfaces with hierarchical MNHS by measuring the surface contact angle for deionized water. Based on our results, we believe that the surfaces with hierarchical MNHS may be candidates for boiling heat transfer applications.|$|E
