Focusing {{on the development}} of an enterprise diagram document online management system, this paper defined the task node of diagram documentation <b>approval</b> <b>process,</b> and analyzed the corresponding diagram document <b>approval</b> <b>process.</b> According to the change demand, the diagram document change <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> was subdivided into three sub process: problem report approval, change request approval and change approval, and each main node task of the three sub process has been designed. On this basis, the UML activity diagram model of the document change and <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> was established, which is useful to develop the diagram document online approval management system...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{academics}} are at {{the centre}} of the curriculum design process, faculty academic quality (AQ) teams {{are at the}} centre of - and are critically important to - the <b>approval</b> <b>process.</b> AQ teams are singularly responsible for administrating and managing the curriculum <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> and therefore have responsibility for tracking, providing on-going feedback, controlling the status of proposals, assigning proposals for academic review, etc. Administering this functionality exposes AQ teams to an extra layer of C-CAP functionality. The back-end administration of the curriculum <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> via C-CAP is therefore mediated at a faculty level by AQ staff and is best understood, not through process diagrams, but by a star-shaped interpretation of faculty level <b>approval</b> <b>processes.</b> AQ teams govern or mediate key decision points during the <b>approval</b> <b>process.</b> Their centrality to the <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> and their influence on curriculum design (via academics) is such that they are the stakeholders above all others who interact with C-CAP the most and are the most exposed to its functionality and benefits. AQ teams are therefore at {{the centre of the}} star in Figure 1, {{which is part of the}} wider process surrounding curriculum design and approval. AQ teams were always central to faculty level <b>approval</b> <b>processes</b> but this centrality was never formalised in the previous state (i. e. before C-CAP) and, as a consequence, the <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> remained mysterious to many stakeholders. The development of C-CAP has changed this by making explicit a curriculum <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> that was hitherto mythic and plagued by tacit practice. This document provides guidance on using the C-CAP administration dashboard, the underlying approval workflows and also makes recommendations on how best to use C-CAP during the <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> and during Academic Committee. It should also be remembered that C-CAP covers only the curriculum design and approval process; there are a great many “off-line” processes and activities that AQ and faculty officers must undertake to ensure the successful delivery of a new class or course...|$|R

The question that arises is whether the length of the drug <b>approval</b> <b>process,</b> as well as associated costs, leads to better safety. The first part briefly summarizes the history of the drug regulation and the drug legislative in the Czech Republic. Also focuses on the theory of economic regulation and the theory of bureaucracy. The second part deals with the drug <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> for new drugs, describes preclinical and clinical testing in relation to the analysis of Sam Peltzman.
