40|$|Innovation is a buzz {{word that}} {{continues}} {{to be used in}} various ways in commercial and political contexts as a passe-partout for economic development and regional prosperity. As a result, innovation <b>spaces,</b> <b>hubs</b> and precincts are often heralded as a panacea by government and industry to bring about a start-up and entrepreneurial culture. However, many innovation spaces exclude people and community groups who could potentially make a useful contribution to innovation. In this positioning paper, we are interested in unpacking the innovation narrative and looking more closely at the types of spaces designed to enable citizens to participate in and contribute to innovation – using both physical and digital means...|$|R
40|$|Data {{reduction}} {{is a common}} pre-processing step for k-nearest neighbor classification (kNN). The existing prototype selection methods implement different criteria for selecting relevant points to use in classification, which constitutes a selection bias. This study examines {{the nature of the}} instance selection bias in intrinsically high-dimensional data. In high-dimensional feature <b>spaces,</b> <b>hubs</b> are known to emerge as centers of influence in kNN classification. These points dominate most kNN sets and are often detrimental to classification performance. Our experiments reveal that different instance selection strategies bias the predictions of the behavior of hub-points in high-dimensional data in different ways. We propose to introduce an intermediate un-biasing step when training the neighbor occurrence models and we demonstrate promising improvements in various hubness-aware classification methods, on a wide selection of high-dimensional synthetic and real-world datasets...|$|R

50|$|Regions require various land uses; {{protection}} of farmland, cities, industrial <b>space,</b> transportation <b>hubs</b> and infrastructure, military bases, and wilderness. Regional planning is {{the science of}} efficient placement of infrastructure and zoning for the sustainable growth of a region. Advocates for regional planning such as new urbanist Peter Calthorpe, promote the approach because it can address region-wide environmental, social, and economic issues which may necessarily require a regional focus.|$|R
40|$|A “hub ” is {{an object}} closely {{surrounded}} by, or very similar to, many other {{objects in the}} dataset. Recent studies by Radovanović et al. indicate that in high dimensional <b>spaces,</b> <b>hubs</b> almost always emerge, and objects close to the data centroid tend to become hubs. In this paper, we show that the family of kernels based on the graph Laplacian makes all objects in the dataset equally similar to the centroid, and thus {{they are expected to}} make less hubs when used as a similarity measure. We investigate this hypothesis using both synthetic and real-world data. It turns out that these kernels suppress hubs in some cases but not always, and the results seem to be affected {{by the size of the}} data. However, for the datasets in which hubs are indeed reduced by the Laplacian-based kernels, these kernels work well in ranking and classification tasks. This result suggests that the amount of hubs, which can be readily computed in an unsupervised fashion, can be a yardstick of whether Laplacian-based kernels work effectively for a given data...|$|R

40|$|According to the Global Exploration Roadmap, which {{reflects}} the international effort to define feasible and sustainable exploration pathways to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids and Mars, {{the next step}} for manned space exploration is the Moon as second home in the Solar System. In that perspective, the Earth-Moon Libration points (EML points) have been a topic of great interest in recent years since EML 1 and EML 2 were suggested as advantageous locations of <b>space</b> <b>hubs</b> in the Moon neighborhood. To materialize this vision, detailed {{studies are needed to}} investigate transfers between Earth and the vicinity of EML 2 and the strategies to reduce associated maneuver costs. This work is framed within the perspective of a future deep space habitat in halo orbit around EML 2, and this paper intends to provide quantitative results so as to select the best deployment scenario of the station. The main purpose is to determine the best transfer trajectory between a low-Earth orbit and a halo orbit around EML 2 in terms of cost and duration. Two different kinds of attractive transfer strategies have been identied. Station deployment and cargo missions would use Weak Stability Boundary (WSB) trajectories whereas manned flights would exploit a fly-by strategy as it shows an advantageous compromise between short trip duration and efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Impact Hub is {{a global}} network of local spaces and {{communities}} designed to facilitate sustainable impact through collaboration. Local Impact Hubs are autonomous companies that offer co-working spaces, programming, events platforms, and communities of individuals and organizations with ideas {{to build a better}} world. Hub was established in 2005 in London with the aim of creating a space dedicated to inspire, connect and enable people to achieve a sustainable entrepreneurial idea. The idea was simple: There {{are a lot of people}} with good ideas for a "better world". What seem to be missing are places to help these people to move from intent to action and to find like-minded for a greater impact. In Romania about four years ago, first opened in Bucharest office <b>space</b> <b>hubs</b> in Romania (for entrepreneurs in technology) and business where teams from different companies could collaborate. The idea to open a hub in Bucharest focused on social innovation and entrepreneurship appeared some time ago in the context in which part of the team now has worked since 2010 at the initiation and growth of a community to support social entrepreneurship. In all this diversity, there is a common mission: “we can create if we put all our innovation capacity in the common goal to create a positive impact through our work?...|$|R
