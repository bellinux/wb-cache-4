He arrived to the season finale <b>still</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> points, with other seven drivers also able to become champion: Swiss Kevin Jörg, British Jack Aitken, French Anthoine Hubert, British Jake Hughes, Japanese Ukyo Sasahara, Norwegian Dennis Olsen, and British Ben Barnicoat. Aitken (previously winner in the Hungaroring, Silverstone and the Nürburgring) won the two first races at the final race meeting in Jerez, securing the championship, while Delétraz ended as championship runner-up. German team Josef Kaufmann Racing was the teams' champion.|$|E

He had encamped the night before on this stream; they found the embers of the fire by which he had slept, and the remains of a miserable wolf on which he had supped.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the advent of {{wireless}} networking technology and the achievements in the miniaturization of electronic devices have set new trends in distributed computing. This ultimately enables a new paradigm for embedding mobile users in intelligent environments that support them in their interactions with their local physical surrounding. This vision is called Ambient Intelligence (AmI). There are <b>still</b> many challenges <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the way towards the realization of AmI. One question that {{is central to the}} entire concept is: How can we render AmI systems self-organizing such that they can indeed disappear in our environment without creating a massive administrative problem? In this thesis, we propose a model for a dedicated AmI infrastructure that supports the user in his interaction with his physical environment and with external entities. This infrastructure is called Ad hoc Service Grid (ASG) and provides wireless services in a decentralized and self-organizing fashion. We identify three distinct problems associated with self-organized service provisionin...|$|R
60|$|There is a {{plenty of}} other testimonies in the magazine, but these quoted samples will answer. They show the kind of trade the Science is driving. Now we {{come back to the}} question; Does it kill a patient here and there and now and then? We must concede it. Does it {{compensate}} for this? I am persuaded that it can make a plausible showing in that direction. For instance: when it lays its hands upon a soldier who has suffered thirty years of helpless torture and makes him whole in body and mind, what is the actual sum of that achievement? This, I think: that it has restored to life a subject who had essentially died ten deaths a year for thirty years, and each of them a long and painful one. But for its interference that man would have essentially died thirty times more, in the three years which have since elapsed. There are thousand of young people in the land who are now ready to enter upon a life-long death similar to that man's. Every time the Science captures one of these and secures to him life-long immunity from imagination-manufactured disease, it may plausibly claim that in his person it has saved 300 lives. Meantime it will kill a man every now and then; but no matter, it will <b>still</b> be <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the credit side.|$|R

The loops of the river doubled more closely; in spite of his exertion he was getting very little farther down the valley; but an attempt to push through the forest led him into such tangles of fallen trunks and branches that he was forced back to the ice.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{this changed}} the company's plans, work <b>still</b> went <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the razing of the Arlington Beach {{amusement}} park, construction of three paved new runways {{on the theme}} park grounds, a new paved runway {{on the site of}} the existing airport, razing of the old hangar and office building, construction of a new hangar [...] by [...] in size and a new and larger office building.

(Paving of the runways was also canceled in favor of oiled earth.) Construction on the new buildings began in January 1930. The hangars were designed by the firm of Lockwood, Green & Co., while the terminal was designed by the architectural firm of Holden, Stott, & Hutchinson. Total cost of the two structures, whose designs were approved by the United States Commission of Fine Arts, was $85,000. Forty-five days later, however, some shareholders in the company sued the Funkhouser, Fahy, and others, arguing that they had reneged on a deal to buy them out and further alleging that they were driving the airport into bankruptcy with their profligate spending. As the suit lingered in the courts, Arlington County commissioners stopped the burning of trash at the landfill next to Hoover Field in mid-1932 (but not the one next to Washington Airport).|$|R
