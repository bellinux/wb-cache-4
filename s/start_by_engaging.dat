[...] New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez issued a statement saying the news of a possible stadium in his district was [...] "deeply troubling" [...] and that he was [...] "irked" [...] by what he read in the report. Councilman Rodriguez also said “Any group with a real intention to develop any possible project should <b>start</b> <b>by</b> <b>engaging</b> the surrounding community that will be directly impacted by the proposal and its elected leaders. For years community residents in this area have worked hard to ensure that {{the quality of life in}} this area is maintained, and I believe that in order to preserve and build upon their gains, community engagement in this process is of utmost importance.” ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Abstract: Recent {{international}} relations (IR) scholarship {{has developed a}} growing awareness of this discipline&# 8217;s colonial roots, prompting a search for decolonising approaches. This article is about indigenous sovereignties and how they have been occluded in the currently globalised European system of states. The method employed is {{a case study of}} two of the most impoverished and brutalised Indigenous Peoples in Brazil: the Guarani and the Kaiowa. In an attempt to transit between the world of Westphalia and non-European worlds, it <b>starts</b> <b>by</b> <b>engaging</b> in a conversation with Guarani and Kaiowa knowledge. Then, through a long-term historical analysis, it examines the main colonial processes that caused the occlusion of Guarani and Kaiowa sovereignty. Finally, it provides a broader perspective on how the diffusion of the European model of sovereignty, confronted with Indigenous resistance, has led to the social exclusion of Indigenous Peoples worldwide...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the dynamism of the motivations of academic entrepreneurs, who are operating in resource constrained environments. In-depth interviews are carried out to gather longitudinal data to investigate dynamisms, which are compared and contrasted with static motives identified from cross-sectional data gathered via an on-line survey. Findings reveal that academic entrepreneurial engagement is a process, which <b>starts</b> <b>by</b> <b>engaging</b> in teaching related academic entrepreneurial activities, and then diversifies into research related academic entrepreneurial activities and company creation. Since environment is resource constrained, the engagement in each type of activity is motivated initially by push factors, subsequently by pull factors, and during the shift by a combination of pull and push factors. These findings resolve the presence of two contradictory viewpoints in relation to static motives; namely, entrepreneurs being motivated by one type of motive (i. e. push or pull motive), and a mix of both types (i. e. pull and push motives), which is found to be determined by the stage at which cross-sectional data is collected. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of studying dynamisms to obtain an in-depth understanding about entrepreneurial motivations. Policy implications and future research avenues are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This article <b>starts</b> <b>by</b> <b>engaging</b> in a {{dialogue}} with the most relevant postcolonial emendations to trauma theory, addressed to both its aporetic and its therapeutic trends, and it goes on to reflect {{on the state of the}} decolonizing trauma theory project, critically examining the motivations behind it as well as some of the problems it still encounters, like the risk of objectification and revictimization of postcolonial peoples, the blurring of their trauma particularities, and the appropriation of their experience. Then, it proposes an alternative understanding of postcolonial trauma theory as a contact zone where trauma criticism and the postcolony are interrelated and mutually transformed, and where unequal power relations are also attended to. Acknowledging the postcolony as a site of theory production rather than the object of external definition, it proceeds to analyze Edwidge Danticat’s short story cycle Claire of the Sea Light: its strategic representation of grief—which she achieves through the short story cycle structure and overall in-betweenness and ambivalence in symbols and characterization—puts Haitians on the critical map of trauma, fighting invisibility and oblivion, but it simultaneously resists an appropriation of Haitian experience by rejecting any monolithic view on Haiti and refusing to fit into a predetermined template...|$|R

I <b>start</b> <b>by</b> critically <b>engaging</b> with sexualities-based terminology. This is important because defining and naming are political processes that serve to produce social and cultural divisions. Then, I move to consider some examples of increasing access and participation, and I end with evidence of ever-present social divisions in society and sports that {{have a negative impact}} on sexually diverse individuals and communities...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the ancient}} world, {{psychological}} pessimism {{was associated with}} melancholy, and {{was believed to be}} caused by an excess of black bile in the body. The study of pessimism has parallels with the study of depression. Psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional pain or even biology. Aaron Beck argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world. Beck <b>starts</b> treatment <b>by</b> <b>engaging</b> in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts. Pessimists, however, are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified; as in Depressive realism or (pessimistic realism). Deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed. They let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding. [...] The pessimism item on the Beck Depression Inventory has been judged useful in predicting suicides. The Beck Hopelessness Scale has also been described as a measurement of pessimism.|$|R

The second section explores factors that affect disabled people, such as homelessness, violence and unemployment. The third section turns to social care, and how disabled people are prevented from living with independence and dignity. Finally, the last section examines how different imagery and technology impacts our understandings of disability and deafness. Showcasing empirical work {{from a range of}} countries, including Japan, Norway, Italy, Australia, India, the UK, Turkey, Finland and Iceland, this collection shows how disability studies can be simultaneously sophisticated, accessible and policy-relevant. Disability Research Today is suitable for students and researchers in disability studies, sociology, social policy, social work, nursing and health studies...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} self-translation in multilingual contexts in Europe, aiming at mapping out innovative perspectives {{to the study of}} power and, by so doing, empowering self-translation. We <b>start</b> <b>by</b> critically <b>engaging</b> with the “cultural” and “power turns” in translation studies, as a way of delineating what the particularities of self-translation are when practised by author-translators in multilingual spaces. Focusing on the European milieu, defined broadly in terms of its geographies, we then discuss multilingualism, cultural awareness and ethnic diversity as staple terms in both academic and political ideologies across Europe, emphasising that one of the aspects of multilingualism is precisely the power differentials between languages and cultures. We explore these unequal power relations and centre-periphery dichotomies of Europe’s “minorised” languages, literatures and cultures, suggesting the usage of “minorised” in preference to the others discussed, inasmuch as it highlights both hegemonic power hierarchies and also the continual resistance to them. This is followed by a brief overview of the emerging debates in the subdiscipline of self-translation in recent times. It is within them that we situate our contribution, arguing that the self-translators’ double affiliation as authors and translators turns them into powerful cultural and ideological mediators and places them in a privileged position to challenge (or submit to) power. Here another term, “self-censorship,” is suggested as invaluable to self-translation studies where self-editing often occurs before translation is begun...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 22 - 23). Expecting {{parents often}} hear how babies {{should be read}} to from birth and even while in the womb. However, these reading experiences are {{about more than just}} reading a book cover-to-cover hoping to create an early love of reading. Reading with babies can increase language development and establish new brain connections during a time of rapid brain growth. Parents can {{play a key role in}} the brain development of their baby right from the <b>start</b> <b>by</b> providing <b>engaging</b> reading experiences. What behaviors show engagement in babies 6 - 12 months old? What strategies can parents use to increase this reading engagement? This action research studied the reading experiences of four boys, ages 6 - 12 months, with their parents in their own homes. Parents were asked to fill out a survey before and after the six-week study about books and reading. The boys were videotaped during a typical reading experience with a parent in their own home at the beginning, midpoint, and end of the study. After the first two videotaped sessions, the boys were placed on the Developmental Continuum for Reading: Pre-Verbal Phase (Engagement) to see what behaviors were already being demonstrated and to see what behaviors should be focused on for continued development. Following placement on the Developmental Continuum, parents were given two reading strategies to try with their child. Parents then journaled about the strategies tried and noted the engagement level of their child over three weeks. All four babies showed increased engagement over the six-week study. All parents involved in the study noted a change in the way reading times at home looked and sounded as a result of being more aware of strategies to engage their child in reading experiences...|$|R
