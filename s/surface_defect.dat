5000|$|Pilling is a <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> of {{textiles}} caused by wear, {{and is considered}} unsightly.

The textile industry divides pilling into four stages: fuzz formation, entanglement, growth, and wear-off. [...] Pilling normally happens on the parts of clothing that receive the most abrasion in day-to-day wear, such as the collar, cuffs, and around the thighs and rear on trousers.|$|E

The harder part is the restrictions that are placed on the patient during the post-operative recovery period. This can be a major challenge for many patients. For optimal re-growth of joint surface, the patients need to be very patient and also extremely cooperative. They usually need to be on crutches for four to six weeks (sometimes longer). Sometimes a brace is needed. This all depends on the size and/or location of the joint <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> that is being repaired or regenerated. The patients are encouraged to spend approximately 6-8 hours a day on a CPM (Continuous Passive Motion) machine that helps with optimal re-growth of joint surface. The procedure is so painless that some patients avoid these critically important steps and expose the knee to physical activity before the joint fully heals.|$|E

For certain pairs of adsorbates and adsorbents, the mathematical parameters of the Polyani theory {{can be related to}} the physicochemical properties of both adsorbents and adsorbates. The theory has been used to model the adsorption of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanoparticles. In the study done by Yang and Xing, the theory have been shown to better fit the adsorption isotherm than Langmuir, Freundlich, and partition. The experiment studied the adsorption of organic molecules on carbon nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. According to the Polyani theory the <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> curvatures of carbon nanoparticles could affect their adsorption. Flat surfaces on the particles will allow more surface atoms to approach adsorbing organic molecules which will increase the potential, leading to stronger interactions. The theory has been beneficial in trying to understand the adsorption mechanisms of organic compounds on carbon nanoparticles and estimating the adsorption capacity and affinity. Using this theory, researchers are hoping to be able to design carbon nanoparticles for specific needs such as using them as sorbents in environmental studies.|$|E

[...] "Hachures", are the lines on fracture surfaces which show crack direction. The broken crankshaft shown at right failed from a <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> near the bulb at lower centre, the single brittle crack growing up into the bulk material by small steps, a problem known as fatigue. The crankshaft also shows hachures which point back to {{the origin of the}} fracture. Some modes of crack growth can leave characteristic marks on the surface that identify the mode of crack growth and origin on a macro scale e.g. beachmarks or striations on fatigue cracks. The areas of the product can also be very revealing, especially if there are traces of sub-critical cracks, or cracks which have not grown to completion. They can indicate that the material was faulty when loaded, or alternatively, that the sample was overloaded at the time of failure.A cusp is formed where brittle cracks meet, as shown on the picture of a failed catheter (Cp). The cusp was formed by brittle failure of the catheter on a breast implant in silicone rubber. The origin of the cracks is at the shoulder at the left-hand side. Identifying such features will allow a fracture surface map to be made of the surface being studied. The implant failed because of overload, all the imposed loads being concentrated at the connection between the catheter and the bag holding salt solution. As a result, the patient reported loss of fluid from the implant, and it was extracted surgically and replaced.|$|E

We also observe that surface defects have obvious influence on the nanowire’s plastic deformation mechanisms.

40|$|AbstractAs {{a method}} of {{processing}} cemented carbide, sinking electrical discharge machining (EDM) is generally used. However, typical <b>surface</b> <b>defects,</b> such as cracks, microcraters and recast layer, lead to a decreased surface integrity, probably resulting in a short tool life. Under the present situation, the recast layer is removed by polishing. However, this process extends the machining time and increases the cost of production of metal molds. Therefore, it is desirable to eliminate these <b>surface</b> <b>defects</b> by some methods. Thus, an on-the-machine surface modification technology in EDM, for the complete elimination of <b>surface</b> <b>defects,</b> was developed in this study. The <b>surface</b> <b>defects</b> are eliminated using a sinking electrical discharge machine by introducing surface integrity machining for EDM (SIME) after applying finishing EDM. SIME is conducted by applying voltage to the constant gap between electrode and workpiece in deionized water. It can be considered that a recast layer including cracks is selectively eliminated by the dissolution of cobalt based on the electrolytic action during SIME. As a result, the <b>surface</b> <b>defects</b> generated by EDM could be completely eliminated by incorporating SIME into EDM...|$|R
40|$|It is {{necessary}} in factories to assess {{the severity of the}} surface defects of castings, as a slight <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> will be taken as qualified when it brings no bad effect or it can be removed by the subsequent processing. In practical production, professional technicians visually inspect the <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> severity according to their individual experience. Therefore, it is difficult for them to maintain the same standard and accuracy in the subjective, tedious and labor-intensive work. Recently, image processing techniques based on optical images have been applied to achieve better accuracy and high efficiency. Unfortunately, optical images cannot directly quantify surface depth, which works as a crucial factor in the practical assessment of <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> severity. The surface roughness evaluation algorithm, which takes into account of both area and depth information of the assessed surface, was applied to directly characterize <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> severity based on surface asperity rather than optical image. The results using standard casting pieces show that <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> severity has no apparent dependence on surface roughness. However, the subsequent results show that the root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) of surface gradient of flow line defects positively correlates with the increase of defect severity. The other types of defect do not present such tendency. Thus, practical workpieces with flow line defects on the surface were used to verify the universality of this tendency. The results show that surface roughness of an unqualified workpiece is larger than that of a qualified workpiece after surface slope adjustment, but presents no obvious coincidence before the adjustment. In contrast, the RMSD of an unqualified workpiece, no matter before or after the adjustment, is larger than that of a qualified one...|$|E
