5|$|I {{would hold}} that {{officers}} {{must have some}} level of particularized <b>suspicion</b> in order to conduct a seizure and search {{like the one at}} issue here, because (1) seizing one’s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized <b>suspicion)</b> permits the Government to engage in the type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E

40|$|Broadcasting {{messages}} in fault-tolerant distributed systems: 	 {{the benefit of}} handling input-triggered and 	 output-triggered <b>suspicions</b> differently 	 B. Charron-Bost, X.

Schiper ABSTRACT The paper investigates the two main and seemingly antagonistic approaches to broadcasting messages reliably in fault-tolerant distributed systems: {{the approach based on}} Reliable Broadcast, and the one based on View Synchronous Communication (or VSC for short). While VSC does more than Reliable Broadcast, this has a cost. We show that this cost can be reduced by exploiting the difference between __input-triggered__ and __output-triggered__ <b>suspicions,</b> and by replacing the standard VSC broadcast primitive by two broadcast primitives; one sensitive to input-triggered <b>suspicions,</b> and the other sensitive to output-triggered <b>suspicions...</b>|$|R
