The scenes also offered viewers the chance to gain a better perspective on who Kylie is and learn about her past. The night before their wedding, Gail unsuccessfully tries to pay Kylie one thousand pounds to leave for good. Lane said that Kylie had the audacity to come back after [...] "£25K for Max" [...] so [...] "£1000 to give up a salon and someone she loves is nothing", though she still keeps the money. Up until this point Kylie had been [...] "playing the game with Gail", but she was not on [...] "Kylie's radar". Kylie then realises how determined Gail is to ruin her wedding. Lane said [...] "Gail has taken a pretty intense disliking to Kylie, <b>so</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> Kylie is going to fight her corner—that's the kind of girl she is." ...|$|E
500|$|Barney was {{inspired}} by Barney Rubble, Fred Flintstone's best friend and next-door neighbor from the animated series The Flintstones. The writers originally wanted the character to be Homer Simpson's sidekick and next-door neighbor, but instead, while still portraying him as Homer's best friend, they decided to make him an alcoholic. Ned Flanders would become the next-door neighbor instead. [...] "Barney was taking the standard sitcom sidekick and just making him as pathetic as possible," [...] said Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons. The writers drew further inspiration from Crazy Guggenheim, a character played by comedian Frank Fontaine on The Jackie Gleason Show. Part of the reason the writers went in that direction, according to Groening, was because of [...] "a sort of unspoken rule about not having drinking on television {{as a source of}} comedy. <b>So,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> we went right for it." [...] The writers also patterned the character after Norm Peterson (George Wendt), a character from the sitcom Cheers.|$|E

On screen, his character was seen exposing corruption within the local police force and then receiving threats from some of his colleagues. McGregor later explained to a Press Association reporter that Mark's exit storyline {{would not be a}} happy one, as he is forced out of Ramsay Street. Mark is asked to enter a witness protection program and the night before he leaves, he realises he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, Kate (Brewer). McGregor told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap [...] "He hasn't been able to tell Kate that he's leaving before now – but he just can't say goodbye, and asks her to come along with him. It's such a very big ask, <b>so</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> she has to give it a lot of thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{used some}} {{character}} designs from his comic book. He designed [...] "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" [...] as an octopus because the species' large head; octopi, he said, [...] "have {{such a large}} bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual <b>so</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> he's gonna have a large bulbous head." [...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants". However, it occurs in [...] and the sixth season episode, [...] "Giant Squidward".|$|E
500|$|During the 12 {{days that}} {{he watched the}} court-martial proceedings, Thurgood Marshall began to {{formulate}} an appeal campaign. Marshall had noticed {{that none of the}} men's grievances had been aired in court. Directly after the court closed the case, Marshall sent a letter to Secretary Forrestal asking why only blacks were assigned the task of loading munitions; why had they not been trained for that task; why were they forced to compete for speed; why were they not given survivor's leaves; and why had they not been allowed to rise in rank. Forrestal replied weakly, saying that a predominance of black men were stationed at Port Chicago <b>so</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> they would be working there to load munitions. Forrestal pointed out that there was no discrimination because other naval weapons stations were manned by white crews loading munitions. The Navy Secretary said that the men had not been promoted because their time at Port Chicago had been a [...] "trial period", and that they were not given 30-day leaves because he thought it best for men to get quickly back to duty to prevent them from building up mental and emotional barriers.|$|E

It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., <b>so</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong."

500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, <b>so</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people coming in and out of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, and he loves it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... to do it to an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E
500|$|With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county {{travelled}} to India {{to partake}} in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who {{was described as}} having [...] "been in sparkling form all season" [...] and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. In the last couple of times I have tried to go on tour it's failed, <b>so</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> ... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen." [...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, [...] "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" [...] according to ESPNcricinfo.|$|E

500|$|The Pumpkins drew {{inspiration}} {{from a variety of}} other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist. When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that [...] "Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal" [...] and that they [...] "were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt". Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's Master of Reality and Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East. The song [...] "Zero", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed [...] "cybermetal." [...] Post-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, The Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees [...] saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them. Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, [...] "In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music <b>so,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> that's exactly what we had to do." [...] Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as [...] "the Pumpkin chord" [...] (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played over it), used as the basis for [...] "Cherub Rock", [...] "Drown", and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix. Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream, The Stooges, and Blue Cheer.|$|E

He adds, [...] "She was intelligent, beautiful and young— and <b>so,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> Lisa {{had to lie}} [...] down and let men walk all over her [...] a snivelling, suicidal wreck."

2500|$|In The Lord of the Rings, Merry {{is often}} considered, and was {{described}} by Tolkien as, the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits. Even before Bilbo Baggins left the Shire, he knew of the One Ring and its power of invisibility. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party, protecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He is knowledgeable and has an innocent, teasing sense of humour. In one incident, Lobelia Sackville-Baggins accused Frodo of being a Brandybuck and no true Baggins. Merry assured Frodo, [...] "It was a compliment; and <b>so,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> not true".|$|E
2500|$|Romney's {{relationship}} with the state legislature was somewhat fraught. He insisted that discussions with executive branch appointees always go through the governor's office, which left legislators annoyed. [...] Furthermore, he withheld giving the legislators permanent authority to create new committees or to grant committee chairs pay increases. [...] Romney was disinclined towards making political deals with the legislature, saying: [...] "I ran on the platform of cleaning up the mess on Beacon Hill, [...] reform means changing the way things are.

[...] Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: [...] "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and {{do that kind of}} thing. You'd get killed. <b>So</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> I didn't do it.

2500|$|Although the {{new laws}} were typical of {{censorship}} laws in many {{other countries in the}} 1920s and 1930s, they were implemented with an eagerness which gradually alienated and embittered many Irish writers. It caused some writers to leave the country. The author Mervyn Wall explains that during the 1930s there was 'a general intolerant attitude to writing, painting and sculpture. These were thought dangerous, likely to corrupt faith and morals...One encountered frequently among ordinary people bitter hostility to writers...Obscurantism had settled on the country like a fog, <b>so</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> anyone who had eyes to see and the heart to feel, was rebellious.' The Academy of Letters established by William Butler Yeats attempted to fight censorship with solidarity among writers, but it achieved little in this field. The fight against literary censorship was fought mainly by isolated figures. Seán Ó Faoláin, perhaps the most vociferous critic of the censorship laws, wrote: 'Our Censorship...tries to keep the mind in a state of perpetual adolescence {{in the midst of all}} the influences that must, in spite of it, pour in from the adult world.' ...|$|E
