50|$|Since silk, the {{original}} product, was gradually {{being replaced by}} more modern raw materials, Amann & Söhne started to manufacture <b>schappe</b> <b>silk</b> in 1919, and mercerised cotton in 1923. Alfred Amann died in 1942. Alfred Pielenz, his son-in-law, was nominated to become his successor. He guided the company through {{the last years of}} war, during which the production stagnated, as well as through the postwar years, during which the production was slowly being reconstructed.|$|E
50|$|The {{early years}} of the 20th century saw the {{manufacture}} of surgical threads which were woven rather than twisted. In 1907 a new artificial silk was produced specifically for the manufacture of Plauen lace. With the main factory unable to cope with demand, another was set up at Mundelsheim in 1910. A new product was added to the Amann range in 1919 with the manufacture of <b>schappe</b> <b>silk</b> (silk waste) and in 1921 an extension was built to house the colour dyeing plant. The latter was overseen by Johannes Mecheels, whose son, Otto Mecheels, went on to establish the Hohenstein Institute, a textile research centre situated at the edge of Bönnigheim. In 1923, mercerised cotton thread was produced, followed two years later by crocheting thread made from artificial silk.|$|E
