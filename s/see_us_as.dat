500|$|Because Carter {{originates}} {{from the}} films, Marvel Studios co-presidents Feige and D'Esposito [...] "are very invested {{in this and}} they've been really collaborative and very generous with their world". Markus, talking about the series' place in the greater architecture of the MCU, later said [...] "you really only need to drop the tiniest bit of hint and its connected. You don't have to go, [...] "Howard Stark's wearing the same pants that Tony wears!"...Everything is enhanced just {{by the knowledge that}} its all connected." [...] Butters said, [...] "We always want to feel like you <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> a piece of [...] But because of our time period, we kind of are on our own a little bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A {{number of}} us were given the word that the {{selectors}} didn't <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> having any future as Test players," [...] said Yallop. [...] "We were told – quietly, of course – that our futures weren't exactly rosy. So when the approach came, we were interested." ...|$|E
2500|$|Revolutionary {{themes are}} also an {{important}} part of the album and its promotion. Coldplay used customized French revolutionary costumes through the Viva La Vida Tour and on the videos produced for the album's singles. Chris Martin said on an interview for The Sun [...] "some say this album is brave - I just <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> being very lucky". Martin stated that a big inspiration for the album was the book Les Miserables by Victor Hugo.|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{want to work}} {{alongside}} {{churches that}} share our convictions. We {{want to be in}} a denomination that <b>sees</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank".|$|R
50|$|The 1980 Moscow Olympics did not {{actually}} <b>see</b> <b>U.S.</b> participation, <b>as</b> it followed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.|$|R
5000|$|She wrote, [...] "For I saw no wrath {{except on}} man's side, and He forgives that in us, for wrath {{is nothing else}} but a perversity and an {{opposition}} to peace and to love." [...] She wrote that God <b>sees</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> perfect and waits {{for the day when}} human souls mature so that evil and sin will no longer hinder us.|$|R
2500|$|Obama was {{scheduled}} to give his keynote address {{on the night of}} Tuesday, July 27. [...] Some Obama advisors were concerned prior to his delivery, because it amounted to the first time he used a teleprompter. [...] He would have three one-hour practice sessions in what were normally the FleetCenter locker rooms of the Boston Bruins and the Boston Celtics, reportedly having difficulty with the teleprompter while also learning various techniques in speaking to a live and TV audience. [...] Once while Obama was backstage rehearsing his speech, he met Kerry staffer and speechwriter Jon Favreau (later to become Obama's speechwriter), who instructed him that to avoid overlap with Kerry, a sentence had to be changed. The sentence involved, later recalled as [...] "We're not red states and blue states; we're all Americans, standing up together for the red, white, and blue" [...] was to conclude his paragraph on red states and blue states, but was instead used by Kerry as [...] "Maybe some just see us divided into those red states and blue states, but I <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> one America: red, white, and blue"; it is unclear whether or not this already existed in Kerry's speech, but regardless, its removal left Obama incensed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} just make them out now, Messer Francisco, {{and as we}} shall have the {{buildings}} behind us, {{they will not be}} able to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> well as we can see them. I think we can go now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not there! not there!' {{she gasped}} faintly as Numerian endeavoured to lead {{her up the}} ascent. 'She will <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we enter the doors!--through the streets! Oh, father, if you would save me! we may lose her in the streets!--the guards, the people are there! Back! back!' ...|$|E
5000|$|I'm {{a perfectionist}} {{much more than}} I'm a super competitor, and there's a big {{difference}} there.... I've been painted {{as a person who}} only competes.... But most of all, I get off on hitting a shot correctly. ... Any woman who wants to achieve anything has to be aggressive and tough, but the press never <b>sees</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> multidimensional. They don't see the emotions, the downs....|$|R
5000|$|... 12 {{included}} of American Indians. All of them showed Indians {{as spiritual}} or in-tune with nature. 10 {{of them as}} impoverished and/or beaten down by society. 10 as continually in conflict with whites. However, {{the image of the}} professional photographer, the musician, the teacher, the doctor, they were largely absent… If society only <b>sees</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> these images, it means that our modern issues don’t exist… How can we be seen as modern, successful people, if we are continually represented as the leathered and feathered, vanishing race? ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{due to the}} {{negative}} associations linked to the name ASBRO, the group became known as The Mend. Of the change, Dean Kelly stated in an interview, 'We loved the name Asbro, but {{we felt it was}} holding us back because there was negative feedback about it. We thought ‘we need to mend this’, hence how we came up with The Mend.' Jayme Kontzle added of the name change, [...] "No record label has <b>seen</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> The Mend so it’s like a new start for us. It also stands for The Manchester End." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be sure, {{how close}} {{together}} they do stand! You couldn' slip a penny-piece between 'em--that you couldn'! Beautiful to see it, isn't it--beautiful!... But {{this is a}} private path, and we won't let 'em <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> <b>as</b> all the ringers be goen there to a supper and dance to-morrow night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} {{were ready to}} run away, Mr. Ormesby, and you really don't seem as much pleased to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> you ought to be," [...] she said. [...] "You know you often asked us to visit you, so you have brought this {{surprise}} party on your own head." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl glanced {{aside and}} dropped her needle, while {{when she spoke}} her voice was a trifle strained. [...] "Do {{you know that you}} bushmen have made me ashamed once or twice?" [...] she said. [...] "I am afraid there is a great {{disappointment}} waiting for you when you <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arnold {{looks at}} me as though I were a thief," [...] she declared, lightly, [...] "and I have only come to claim my own. If you behave very nicely, Arnold, you can come and <b>see</b> <b>us</b> just <b>as</b> often as you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, my Tina,' {{answered}} Maynard slowly, {{waiting a}} little between each sentence; 'we {{mean to do}} wicked things that we never could do, just as we mean to do good or clever things that we never could do. Our thoughts are often worse than we are, {{just as they are}} often better than we are. And God <b>sees</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we are altogether, not in separate feelings or actions, <b>as</b> our fellow-men <b>see</b> <b>us.</b> We are always doing each other injustice, and thinking better or worse of each other than we deserve, because we only hear and see separate words and actions. We don't see each other's whole nature. But God sees that you could not have committed that crime.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The sheik {{shook his}} head. [...] "The son of Sheitan has escaped. We {{caught sight of}} him just {{at the edge of}} the desert, having ridden with scarce an hour's rest from the time we started. As soon as we did so Aboo and myself {{dismounted}} and started in pursuit; but he must have <b>seen</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> soon as we caught sight of him, for when we came up to his camel it was alone. We followed him to the edge of the cultivated lands, but the grass was long and the crops stood in some places as high as our heads, and it would have been useless searching for him, so we brought the camels on, gave them water and a night's halt to fill themselves in the fields, and then started back. Has all been well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go below, mesdemoiselles," [...] {{the captain}} of the lugger said as soon as they had put foot on the deck. [...] "If anyone on the shore were to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we ran down, and notice women on deck, he would think it strange. At anyrate it's best {{to be on the safe}} side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we come back, Bessie. Till then, you are our banker, and the pocketbook is yours," [...] cried Mrs. Knifton, gayly, at the door. Her husband {{lifted her}} into the saddle, mounted himself, and away they both galloped over the moor as wild and happy as a couple of children.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{too near}} to be pleasant," [...] Geoffrey said, [...] "for they can <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> plainly {{as we can}} see the land. It is to be hoped that a breeze may spring up from the south before long and enable us to creep off the land. Unless I am greatly mistaken I can see the masts of some craft or other in a line with those white houses over there." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{must face}} it, my dear friends. We cannot deceive God: and God will {{certainly}} not deceive himself. He <b>sees</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we are, and takes us {{for what we}} are. What is right in us, he accepts for the salvation of Jesus Christ, in whom we are created unto good works. What is wrong in us, he will assuredly punish, and give us the exact reward of the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or evil. Every work of ours shall come into judgment, unless it be repented of, and put away by the only true repentance--not doing the thing any more.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned into}} our street, arter passing it three times, {{and the first}} thing I saw was my missus {{standing}} on the doorstep 'aving a few words with the lady next door. Then she 'appened to look up and <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> just <b>as</b> that silly woman was trying to walk arm-in-arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Newton, what I am I ain't ashamed on, nor {{yet what}} I does. Let me have the honour of {{drinking}} {{a glass of}} wine with you, Mr. Newton. You <b>see</b> <b>us</b> just <b>as</b> we are. I wish it was better, but it couldn't be welcomer. Your health, Mr. Newton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not a wooden-head, miss. As a gambler, {{it was me}} {{business}} to read men's faces. I see more than my little girl gives me credit for. I think I know why Mrs. Crego can't <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we pass by, and I was wise to them friends of yours {{the other day when}} they curled their tails and showed their teeth at sight of us. It's because Bertie is the wife of a gambler. Isn't that so, now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} lift up a head, today," [...] John said. [...] "The guards below, {{and on the}} hills, will have their {{eyes fixed on the}} rock, on the lookout for fugitives and, until nighttime, we must not venture to sit up. Fortunately, that outer edge of the shelf is a good deal higher than it is, back here; and I don't think that even those on the mountain, opposite, could <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we lie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sent off}} a {{messenger}} to our army, {{on the day}} you left us; but have had no reply, and know not whether he reached it in safety. At any rate, you cannot be very long before your force joins the Admiral; and as we felt quite sure that you would come to <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> <b>as</b> you passed, we have our letters ready to my husband and the Count de Valecourt. You will, I am sure, deliver them {{as soon as you}} join the Admiral." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Dudley {{had brought}} letters {{that filled the}} Bishop's heart to overflowing, and still it was to his father that he wrote: 'It seems {{as if you had}} lived to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> all, <b>as</b> it were, fixed in our several positions, and could now [...] "depart in peace, {{according}} to His word."' ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce." [...] Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. [...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station <b>sees</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him. I never thought I would hear myself say this, but it would feel very strange to be on the air without him." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the last}} stop of their European tour in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Kelly Rowland {{suddenly}} announced: [...] "This {{is the last time}} you would <b>see</b> <b>us</b> on stage <b>as</b> Destiny's Child".|$|R
60|$|We in {{the boat}} were all pretty well fagged out with hunger, toil, and exposure. I was the worst off, having so little {{clothing}} in cool weather, and I think another day would have destroyed us all, unless we had taken refuge in the well-known dreadful alternative of seamen. The captain was delighted to <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> <b>as</b> indeed were all hands. They had determined to turn to windward, on short tacks, until they made the land, {{the best thing that}} could have been done, and the course that actually saved us.|$|E
60|$|Issuing forth armed {{only with}} our double-barrelled guns and heavy hunting-knives, we hastened towards the native village. When within {{a hundred yards}} of {{the edge of the}} wood that skirted it we stopped to pull off our shoes, for it was {{necessary}} that we should have nothing about our persons to tell who we were should any one chance to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we ran. We also left our rifles beside the shoes at a spot where we could find them in an instant in passing, and then slowly approached the outskirts of the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I, Beric; I {{never want}} to enter their town again save with a sword {{in one hand and}} a torch in the other. It enrages me to see the airs of superiority they give themselves. They scarce seem even to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we walk in their streets; and as to the {{soldiers}} as they stride along with helmet and shield, my fingers itch to meet them in the forest. No; I promised to walk so far with you, but I go no farther. How long will you be there?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{turned to}} give her a reassuring smile as the lion {{indicated}} that he had not <b>seen</b> <b>us,</b> and <b>as</b> I did so she, too, turned her face toward mine, for the same purpose, doubtless. Anyway, as our heads turned simultaneously, our lips brushed together. A startled expression came into Victory's eyes as she drew back in evident confusion.|$|R
60|$|Now {{we were in}} the reeds, for {{thanks to}} the flag which guided us, we had struck the big {{hippopotamus}} lane exactly, and the Pongos, paddling like demons, were about thirty yards behind. Thankful was I that those interesting people had never learned the use of bows and arrows, and that their spears were too heavy to throw. By now, or rather some time before, old Babemba and the Mazitu had <b>seen</b> <b>us,</b> <b>as</b> had our Zulu hunters. Crowds of them were wading through the shallows towards <b>us,</b> yelling encouragements <b>as</b> they came. The Zulus, too, opened a rather wild fire, with the result that one of the bullets struck our canoe and another touched the brim of my hat. A third, however, killed a Pongo, which caused some confusion in the ranks of Tusculum.|$|R
50|$|Part II has an {{interview}} with John Perkins, author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman, {{who says he was}} involved in the subjugation of Latin American economies by multinational corporations and the United States government, including involvement in the overthrow of Latin American heads-of-state. Perkins <b>sees</b> the <b>US</b> <b>as</b> a corporatocracy, in which maximization of profits is the first priority.|$|R
