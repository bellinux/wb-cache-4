5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> ethnic group.|$|E

40|$|Chloroplasts are endosymbiotic organelles of cyanobacterial origin. It seems {{reasonable}} to assume that cell division and organelle division still share general principles, as shown for the FtsZ proteins. However, further components involved in this process are largely unknown. Here we describe ARTEMIS, a nuclear-encoded protein of chloroplast inner envelope membranes that is required for organelle division. ARTEMIS consists of three distinct modules: an N-terminal receptor-like region, a centrally positioned glycine-rich stretch containing a nucleoside triphosphate-binding site, and a C-terminal YidC/Oxa 1 p/Alb 3 protein translocase-like domain. Analysis of Arabidopsis En- 1 transposon mutants as well as ARTEMIS antisense plants revealed chloroplasts arrested in the late stages of division. Chloroplasts showed clearly <b>separated</b> <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> multiple thylakoid systems, whereas the final organelle fission remained unaccomplished. Inactivation of a cyanobacterial gene with sequence similarity to the YidC/Oxa 1 p/Alb 3 -like domain of ARTEMIS resulted in aberrant cell division, which could be rescued by the Arabidopsis protein. ARTEMIS represents a so-far-unrecognized link between prokaryotic cell fission and chloroplast division...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Yersinia pestis {{appears to}} be {{maintained}} in multiple, geographically <b>separate,</b> <b>and</b> phylogenetically <b>distinct</b> subpopulations within the highlands of Madagascar. However, the dynamics of these locally differentiated subpopulations through time are mostly unknown. To address that gap and further inform our understanding of plague epidemiology, we investigated the phylogeography of Y. pestis in Madagascar over an 18 year period. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We generated whole genome sequences for 31 strains and discovered new SNPs that we {{used in conjunction with}} previously identified SNPs and variable-number tandem repeats (VNTRs) to genotype 773 Malagasy Y. pestis samples from 1995 to 2012. We mapped the locations where samples were obtained on a fine geographic scale to examine phylogeographic patterns through time. We identified 18 geographically <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> phylogenetically <b>distinct</b> subpopulations that display spatial and temporal stability, persisting in the same locations over a period of almost two decades. We found that geographic areas with higher levels of topographical relief are associated with greater levels of phylogenetic diversity and that sampling frequency can vary considerably among subpopulations and from year to year. We also found evidence of various Y. pestis dispersal events, including over long distances, but no evidence that any dispersal events resulted in successful establishment of a transferred genotype in a new location during the examined time period...|$|R
5000|$|The May {{declaration}} was criticised by Human Rights Watch who said: [...] "Several {{attacks on}} apparently civilian objects that Human Rights Watch investigated in Saada, including an attack that struck a residential house, two attacks that struck markets, and {{an attack on}} a school, took place after the May 8 announcement. Issuing warning of impending attacks to the civilian population is in line with the obligation under the laws of war to take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm, and in particular to provide “effective advance warning” of attacks that may affect the civilian population, so long as circumstances permit. However, the general and vague nature of these warnings would be of little help to civilians in need of greater security. Even more problematic, and a clear violation of the laws of war, is the coalition assertion that the entire cities of Saada and Marran are military targets. The laws of war prohibit attacks that treat as a single military objective a number of clearly <b>separated</b> <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects.|$|R
