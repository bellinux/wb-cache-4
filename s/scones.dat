5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match {{he was the}} subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and <b>scones</b> on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have the audacity to then pull a comb from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand to wipe his sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Scone</b> Abbey (originally <b>Scone</b> Priory) was a {{house of}} Augustinian canons located in <b>Scone,</b> Perthshire (Gowrie), Scotland. Dates given for the {{establishment}} of <b>Scone</b> Priory have ranged from 1114 A.D. to 1122 A.D. However, historians have long believed that <b>Scone</b> was before that time the center of the early medieval Christian cult of the Culdees (Céli Dé in medieval Irish meaning [...] "Companions of God"). Very {{little is known about the}} Culdees but it is thought that a cult may have been worshiping at <b>Scone</b> from as early as 700 A.D. Archaeological surveys taken in 2007 suggest that <b>Scone</b> was a site of real significance even prior to 841 A.D., when Kenneth MacAlpin brought the Stone of Destiny, Scotland's most prized relic and coronation stone, to <b>Scone.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the United Kingdom, tea is {{consumed}} daily and often {{by a majority}} of people, and indeed is perceived as one of Britain's cultural beverages. It is customary for a host to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival. Tea {{is consumed}} both at home and outside the home, often in cafés or tea rooms. Afternoon tea with cakes on fine porcelain is a cultural stereotype. In southwest England, many cafés serve a cream tea, consisting of <b>scones,</b> clotted cream, and jam alongside a pot of tea. In some parts of Britain, 'tea' may also refer to the evening meal.|$|E

25|$|Saladin had his guards {{supplied}} with link lights and had chalk and cinders strewed around his tent outside Masyaf—which he was besieging—to detect any footsteps by the Assassins. According to this version, one night Saladin's guards noticed a spark glowing {{down the hill}} of Masyaf and then vanishing among the Ayyubid tents. Presently, Saladin awoke to find a figure leaving the tent. He saw that the lamps were displaced and beside his bed laid hot <b>scones</b> of the shape peculiar to the Assassins with a note at the top pinned by a poisoned dagger. The note threatened {{that he would be}} killed if he didn't withdraw from his assault. Saladin gave a loud cry, exclaiming that Sinan himself was the figure that had left the tent.|$|E

However, some viewers were outraged during the first series when a decision was made to make the contestants use one of Hollywood's recipes for <b>scones</b> instead of one of Berry's. Her work on the show with Hollywood has led to The Guardian suggesting that it is the best reality TV judging partnership ever. In September 2016, Love Productions announced that a three-year deal to broadcast the show on Channel 4 instead of the BBC from 2017 had been agreed. Co-hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins announced that they would not be continuing with Bake Off on its new network. Berry announced she was also leaving Bake Off on the same day that fellow judge Paul Hollywood announced he would be staying with the show.|$|E

500|$|The {{sociologist}} Bob Ashley {{observed that}} while people in Britain might {{agree that the}} core national diet consisted of items such as the full English breakfast, roast beef with all the trimmings, tea with <b>scones,</b> and fish and chips, few had ever eaten the canonical English breakfast, lunch and dinner in any single day, and many probably never ate any item from the list at all regularly. In any case, Ashley noted, the national diet changes with time, and cookery books routinely include dishes of foreign origin. He remarked that a National Trust café, whose manager claimed [...] "We're not allowed to do foreign food... I can't do lasagne or anything like that", in fact served curry, because [...] "seemingly curry is English". Anglo-Indian cuisine has indeed {{been part of the}} national diet since the eighteenth century.|$|E

Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms became social centres for all, for business men and apprentices, for ladies and ladies' maids. The Ladies Rooms were a particular success, newly allowing respectable women {{to get out and}} meet together without male company. Unlike cafes or tearooms in other cities, there was no intrusive supervision and those having tea had an assortment of <b>Scones</b> and cakes to hand, with a discreet notice reminding newcomers to remember the amount consumed.
