5|$|For voice casting, the {{localization}} {{team was}} sent {{a list of}} people who might fit the roles, along with short reels for each actor. Once the actors had been chosen, Bateman wrote the voice direction, which consisted of short blurbs the voice actors saw next to the line they were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> so they would know how to perform it. While the North American version of the game allows the user to select either Japanese or English audio tracks, the European version, which was released by Rising Star Games, only features the Japanese audio track.|$|E
25|$|The {{leadership}} {{battle of}} the party didn't end with the election, and pressure was still mounting on Jagland to give the party leader role to Stoltenberg. It was expected that Stoltenberg would contest the leader during the national congress of Labour in November 2002, and in January 2002 the two were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if they wanted role. On the 15th of January, Jagland collapsed in the parliament and {{was sent to the}} hospital. Later that evening, during live coverage by TV 2 Nyhetene, comedian Bård Tufte Johansen interrupted the live broadcast jumping around in a chicken costume, cackling about media's treatment of Thorbjørn Jagland and mocking the media's double standards. On the 3rd of February 2002 Jagland announced that he wouldn't seek a new term as party leader in November.|$|E
500|$|There {{is also a}} scene {{after the}} {{watermelon}} exploding trick where Meg was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Fuck you, asshole! I'll kick your ass to hell!", but Fox also censored the line {{and was replaced by}} [...] "I hate you! I hate you!" [...] instead.|$|E
6000|$|Just then Mr Croft {{believed}} himself {{struck by}} a happy thought. [...] "You are not prepared, I <b>suppose,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> in consequence of it; and that recalls {{the fact that so}} much in this world happens in spite of things, instead of in consequence of them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] she said. [...] "Don't stir." [...] She {{addressed}} John Jago very reluctantly: [...] "If {{you are so}} much {{in earnest}} about it, Mr. John, I suppose it must be. I can't guess what you can possibly have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me which cannot be said before a third person. However, it wouldn't be civil, I <b>suppose,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'No' in my place. You know it's my business to wind up the hall-clock at ten every night. If you choose to come and help me, the chances are that we shall have the hall to ourselves. Will that do?" ...|$|R
500|$|According to Rockwell, who did {{not really}} care much for the work, the theme [...] "was based on a rather smug idea. Painted during the bombing of London, it was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Thank God we can put our {{children}} to bed {{with a feeling of}} security, knowing they will not be killed in the night.'" ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the praise}} was {{balanced}} by certain critics. Blender considered By the Way {{to be an}} indistinguishable sequel to Californication, calling it [...] "Californication 2". It further condemned the Chili Peppers for not varying their style and remaining extremely similar in sound. Jaime Lowe of The Village Voice panned Kiedis's lyrics as [...] "absolutely baffling" [...] and commented that [...] "it's as if {{he picked up a}} rhyming dictionary and arbitrarily strung some phrases together." [...] The newspaper's Robert Christgau was also critical of his songwriting, writing that [...] "it's not enough for Anthony Kiedis to get all mature—he's <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something interesting about maturity." [...] Entertainment Weekly praised By the Way for being well refined and a superb collaboration, but criticized the Chili Peppers for playing it safe and keeping the album's energy mild; for being [...] "more fascinating for what it symbolizes than what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith had {{attempted}} to go to rehab several times, but {{found that he was}} unable to relate to the popular treatments for addicts that used a twelve-step program basis for treatment. [...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't say what you were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the film}} Boy Meets Girl (1938), James Cagney (in dictating {{a letter to}} Pat O'Brien {{regarding}} what a third person is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> his missing wife) says, [...] "I did not go down on the Morro Castle!" ...|$|R

60|$|Into {{this society}} should be {{admitted}} none but persons eminent for learning, and yet none, or but very few, whose business or trade was learning. For I may be allowed, I <b>suppose,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{we have seen}} many great scholars mere learned men, and graduates in the last degree of study, whose English has been far from polite, full of stiffness and affectation, hard words, and long unusual coupling of syllables and sentences, which sound harsh and untuneable to the ear, and shock the reader both in expression and understanding.|$|R
500|$|To further {{promote the}} album, Rihanna {{embarked}} on her third worldwide and fourth overall tour entitled Loud Tour (2011). The tour was officially announced on February 9, 2011, when North American dates were revealed. Critics gave the tour a positive response, with Jon Brean of the Star Tribune noting, [...] "The Barbadian singer is more visually and vocally dynamic than {{she has ever}} been before." [...] During an interview with Ryan Seacrest after Rihanna performed [...] "California King Bed" [...] on American Idol, April 14, 2011, the singer spoke about the tour's development. Rihanna addressed rumors about a special performance to be included on the setlist in order to fully incorporate her fans into the experience. When asked by Seacrest about the fan experience, she explained, [...] "Right now, we just designed the stage. I'm really not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this, but I {{want to get you}} excited... We're building two sections on the stage [...] closer than they've ever been. It's real VIP." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Family Guy episode [...] "Holy Crap", two {{cardinals}} {{discuss a}} fictional {{error in the}} bible. One cardinal remarks to another, [...] "Hey, did you ever notice this?

2500|$|On the {{broadcast}} of January 8, 1950, journalist Drew Pearson {{was the subject}} of a joke gone wrong. Announcer Don Wilson was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he heard that Jack bought a new suit on Drew Pearson, but said the name wrong; Don said [...] "Drear Pewson". Later in the show, comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman. Changing his original response at the suggestion of the writers, Nelson said, [...] "Well, who do you think I am, Drear Pewson?" [...] The audience laughed for almost 30 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{episode title}} is {{a play on}} the Detroit, Michigan based hip hop group, the Insane Clown Posse, and Krusty's line [...] "do {{you want to get}} down with the clown?" [...] is a {{reference}} to an Insane Clown Posse lyric. [...] Krusty's performance at the USO show is a parody of Bob Hope who is famously known for his USO Shows. Originally Moe was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Anny Deskanko" [...] in a reference to Ani Difranco. As in some previous episodes, there is a song featuring NRBQ. Fat Tony's real name is Marion, as was the late actor John Wayne.|$|E
2500|$|After Shakir Stewart, then-Executive Vice President of Def Jam Recordings, {{organized}} {{an audition}} {{for the group}} with label chairman L. A. Reid, they were signed to the label on February 23, 2008. Stewart then organized a meeting for the group with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, who cosigned Electrik Red to their Def Jam-based label, Radio Killa. From then, the pair began producing their music and executive produced their debut album. The group explained they named the album as a [...] "play on the stereotype of what a lady is supposed to be, how she is supposed to act and what she is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> We're bringing a new age woman to the world". The group wanted {{to show that it}} was [...] "okay to be different".|$|E
2500|$|The sacres {{originated}} in the early 19th century when the social control exerted by the Catholic clergy was increasingly a source of frustration. One of the oldest sacres is sacrament, which {{can be thought of}} in Quebec French as equivalent to [...] "goddamn it" [...] in English. It is known to have been in use {{as far back as the}} 1830s. The word [...] "sacrer" [...] in its current meaning is believed to come from the expression Ne dites pas ça, c'est sacré ("Don't say that, it is sacred/holy"). Eventually, sacrer started to refer to the words francophone Québécois were not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> This is likely related to the commandment [...] "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain" [...] (Exodus 20:7). The influence and social importance of the Catholic religion at that time allowed sacres to become powerful forms of profanity.|$|E

5000|$|Ferraday reveals to Jones that {{he knows}} more about the mission than he is <b>supposed</b> <b>to,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "We don't believe in going on a mission totally blindfolded". Jones reveals to Ferraday that an {{advanced}} experimental British camera was stolen by the Soviets, along with an enhanced film emulsion developed by the Americans. The Soviets sent it into orbit to photograph the locations of all the American missile silos. However, the camera malfunctioned and continued to record Soviet missile sites as well. A second malfunction forced re-entry in the Arctic, close to Ice Station Zebra. Soon after, undercover Soviet and British agents arrived to recover the film capsule, and the civilian scientists at Zebra {{were caught in the}} crossfire between them.|$|R

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not like I just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role {{two or three times}} and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E
6000|$|... "Treat {{people like}} fools," [...] she is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "and they will [...] worship you; stoop {{to make up}} to them, and they will {{directly}} tread [...] you underfoot." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Jim!--but no, I <b>suppose</b> I ought <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Mr. James Sankey, to {{an officer}} of your importance. How comes it, sir, that you are so soon attired in His Majesty's uniform?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was an artificial--a {{conventional}} speech. Is n't a lady always <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something of}} that sort to a visitor by way of pretending to have noticed that she has not seen him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not let me}} be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that there}} are not cases {{requiring}} attention: it must be so in a large population; but there can be no means taken by a landlord, or by those under him, that are not bestowed upon that tenantry.|$|E

5000|$|Another anecdote Tacitus {{records of}} Scipio {{and his second}} wife also took place after her death.

[...] Their son was Publius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, suffect consul in 68; his cognomen {{reflects}} Scipio's tenure as governor of Asia.|$|R
5000|$|Barack Obama {{directly}} referenced {{the routine}} while campaigning {{to be elected}} President during a Father's Day speech on June 15, 2008, saying: [...] "Chris Rock had a routine.

Well, you're not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be in jail!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] said Blanche, promptly, [...] "you {{had better}} {{give me an}} address at which Sir Patrick can write to you. You wouldn't, I <b>suppose,</b> wish me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I had seen you here, and that you refused to {{communicate}} with him?" ...|$|R
