40|$|The {{paper is}} focused to the {{experimental}} investigations of weakly elastic viscous flows in complex geometries, with application in biofluid mechanics. The test samples, polyacrylamide solutions in water characterized by very low relaxation times (λ < 0. 01 s), have similar shear rheology with blood at medium and high shear rates. The flow configuration is a special designed “T ” branch Hele – Shaw geometry, characterized by relevant <b>separation</b> <b>areas.</b> The influence of polymer concentration and Reynolds number (Re) on the vortical structures are investigated. Experiments and numerical simulations of the Newtonian and shear thinning viscous fluid are performed at Re < 1000. The analyses of vortices evidence the increasing of their magnitude with polymer concentration and qualitative changes in the vorticity distribution within the <b>separation</b> <b>areas</b> of weakly elastic flows, in comparison to pure Newtonian ones. The present numerical results are qualitatively similar to experiments, up to a Reynolds critical number Recr ≅ 650.

40|$|Currently, the {{standard}} method to compute lift and drag polars of 2 D profiles, 3 D wings, and complete aircraft configurations is {{to perform a}} several number of steady simulations at angles of incidence along the polar range [...] In general, RANS methods with a one equation or two equation turbulence model were applied. For regular flow topologies with no or only small <b>separation</b> <b>areas</b> this choice is the most efficient and leads to good accordance with experimental data. However, in complex high lift configurations big <b>separation</b> <b>areas</b> can occur even at low angles of attack in the linear polar regions, forcing unsteady effects and limiting the applicability of steady methods.

In the present work a time-accurate polar calculation approach was investigated, in which the URANS method with a Reynolds-Stress-Model is coupled with a motion module to continuously increase or decrease the angle of incidence every physical time step. ...|$|R

This project is work toward an electrophoretic separation system on a custom CMOS chip. Modeling, fabrication, and testing of an AMI ABN 1. 5 um CMOS chip for this application is discussed.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a coastal Kelvin wave with the mean {{state in the}} Gulf Stream <b>separation</b> <b>area</b> is studied using a hierarchy of numerical models including both low- and high-resolution 2. 5 -layer models and a coarse-resolution ocean general circulation model (OGCM) in a simple configuration. When the Kelvin front reaches the <b>separation</b> <b>area</b> in the low-resolution 2. 5 -layer model, an anomaly of opposite sign emerges and remains in the upper layer of the <b>separation</b> <b>area.</b> The mechanism leading to its buildup is the following: the variations of thickness in the active midlayer due to the propagation of the Kelvin wave induce current variations that act {{as a source of}} thickness anomalies for the upper layer (negative feedback). This source term is proportional to the mean vorticity gradient. The latter therefore must be large enough to obtain a significant response, which explains why this phenomenon occurs only in the <b>separation</b> <b>area.</b> The anomaly remains in the <b>separation</b> <b>area</b> because the advection by the mean zonal current is balanced by the current anomalies due to the variations of thickness in the surface layer. A very similar response is obtained in the high-resolution case and with the OGCM; thus, the mechanism leading to this evolution seems also largely independent of the model. However, in the OGCM, the surface current is sufficiently strong to advect the anomaly in the surface layers (above 200 -m depth). Note finally that these anomalies do not prevent the Kelvin waves from pursuing their travel southward and then eastward toward the eastern boundary where Rossby waves are radiated. Numerous recent results based on this adjustment mechanism therefore would be robust...|$|E

The thalweg line is a stream line where the maximum velocity occurs, whereas the <b>separation</b> <b>area</b> is the boundary between the main flow and the recirculation zone.

The LSPIV (Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry) technique was used to measure and analyze flow variation around the ￢-type groynes. The velocity in the main channel measured to be increased by 1. 5 times. The velocity variation on groyne arm length is little.

The adsorption of Tröger's base onto the stationary phase ChiralPak AD was successfully described by multilayer adsorption isotherm models. Due to the complexity of these models, the region of suitable operating parameters cannot be determined algebraically by the equilibrium theory. As an alternative, the equilibrium-dispersive model, and a reliable numerical algorithm were used to scan a wide operating region, and to define this <b>separation</b> <b>area.</b> To verify the results of these calculations, the <b>separation</b> <b>area</b> was also experimentally detected by performing measurements of product purity and production rate for selected operating points.

In addition, the influence of the heterogeneity of the column set on the performance of the SMB process, is studied. Even under strongly nonlinear conditions, excellent agreements between calculated and experimental profiles were obtained.

The low-boom inlet design {{is based on}} previous scale model 1 - by 1 -ft wind tunnel tests and features a zero-angle cowl and relaxed isentropic compression centerbody spike, resulting in defocused oblique shocks and a weak terminating normal shock.
