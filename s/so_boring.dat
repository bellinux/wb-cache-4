5|$|During lunch, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Leslie that he {{is going}} to propose to Ann (Rashida Jones). Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars to stay awake for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him go because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is <b>so</b> <b>boring</b> that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E
25|$|The fly motif is so {{important}} that it remained in his work until after {{he moved to the}} West. The 1992, installation in Cologne, Life of Flies, consists of several halls in which the economy, politics, culture, and an entire civilization, specifically the Soviet Union, are associated with flies. The civilization has an atmosphere <b>so</b> <b>boring</b> that flies die from it. Throughout Kabakov’s oeuvre the flies represent two seemingly different themes: human lives and garbage.|$|E
25|$|George and Madeline took a kind {{but firm}} {{approach}} in rearing their children, encouraging {{hard work and}} regular schedules. In his autobiography, White relates that his parents ran a strict schedule on Sundays; they locked him in his room for silent prayer, a time <b>so</b> <b>boring</b> that he almost begged to do homework. His father forbade Walter from reading any books less than 25 years old so he chose to read Dickens, Thackeray, and Trollope {{by the time he}} was 12. When he was 8, he threw a rock at a white child who called him a derogatory name for drinking from the fountain reserved for blacks. Events such as this shaped White's self-identity. He began to develop skills to pass for white, which he used later to preserve his safety as a civil rights investigator for the NAACP in the South.|$|E

At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer.

Regarding the multiplayer, IGN's Greg Miller said, [...] "This mode was <b>so</b> <b>boring</b> I made up my own story.

2500|$|Delysia {{began the}} 1930s by {{appearing}} in variety. She topped the bill at the London Palladium in 1930, but the songs {{she chose to}} perform were regarded as either dated or dull. During the same year, she appeared in two successive failures in the West End. An adaptation of Marcel Pagnol's Topaze, which was a huge success in Paris, failed to sparkle in its English version, despite a starry cast in which Delysia was joined by Raymond Massey, Martita Hunt, Donald Wolfit and Frank Cellier. The second failure was A Pair of Trousers, a farcical comedy, which The Times declared <b>so</b> <b>boring</b> that [...] "all the Delysian sparkle" [...] could not save it.|$|E

Please don't cry because my reality show would be <b>so</b> <b>boring.</b> I would have to make out with Marion Cotillard or I'd have to spank Daniel Craig's bottom just to stay on the air.

2500|$|Ortmann is most {{remembered for}} his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State, in which he punted 24 times in a {{blizzard}} for 723 yards – still a Michigan record. The weather conditions were so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The strategy worked, as the game's only touchdown was scored after Ortman punted the ball out of bounds at the Ohio State six-yard line, Ohio State was forced to punt from deep in its own territory, and Tony Momsen recovered a blocked punt in the endzone. Ortmann recalled: “You and I would not have gone outside to get the newspaper on a day like that. [...] But here we were, trying to play football.” Michigan did not get a first down and had only 27 yards of total offense, while Ortman was 0 for 8 passing and gained only 9 yards in 10 rushing attempts. The fierce weather conditions stifled both offenses, and the Wolverines managed to win 9-3 on a safety and Momsen's touchdown after the blocked punt. Interviewed about the Snow Bowl in 2006, Ortmann, then retired and living in Savannah, Georgia, recalled: [...] "Twice during the game, playing as the safety, I couldn't see [...] Vic Janowicz and his backfield, the snow was falling so heavily. Tony Momsen was our regular punter and as we were ready to go out, he said, ‘Charlie, I don't feel like punting today, you punt.' I hadn't punted in three months. But the hero of that game was not Chuck Ortmann, it was Carl Kreager, our center. I just put my hands down and the ball was always there. I still remind him every time we talk, 'Carl, you never got enough credit for that game.' It was <b>so</b> <b>boring.</b> I have a film of the game, and I haven't watched it since, if that tells you something." ...|$|E

One can’t understand the message all at once, of course, but one felt {{from the very first}} that it was there. I’ve been to see it eighteen times and I’m going again to-morrow and on Thursday. One can’t see it often enough.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The film {{screened}} out {{of competition}} at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, where it was panned, misunderstood or ignored {{by the majority of}} North American critics. One critic boasted, [...] "Absolutely ravishing. I've never been <b>so</b> <b>bored</b> in my life".|$|R

How much better they fit the old legend-tales than living people would do. Nay, {{if we are going}} to have human beings on the stage, they should be masked and disguised. For in fact drama is enacted by symbolic creatures formed out of human consciousness: puppets if you like: but not human individuals.

His very ignoring of the women is part of the game. He is never UNCONSCIOUS of them. He should have been a cockerel, so he could strut before fifty females, all his subjects. But really, his Don Juan does NOT interest me. I could play Dona Juanita a million times better than he plays Juan. He bores me, you know. His maleness bores me. Nothing is <b>so</b> <b>boring,</b> so inherently stupid and stupidly conceited. Really, the fathomless conceit of these men, it is ridiculous--the little strutters.|$|E
