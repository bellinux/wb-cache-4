5000|$|The GATE {{opened the}} first group in the UK in Feb 2014. The GATE is a Registered Charity and an {{emerging}} network of engineers and non-engineers that share the idea that engineers are responsible for changing engineered systems in order to adapt to reducing fossil fuel and other un-sustainable resources. Transition Engineering is a change management discipline. Like Safety Engineering, Transition Engineering uses and audit and stock-take of current system design and operation to quantify the risks to essential activities and resources over a time-frame of study. The time-frame of study should be commensurate with the lifetime of the assets involved in the activity. An activity is anything that the engineered system supports, for example manufacturing, sewage treatment, mobility, or food preservation. Transition Engineering recognizes that the analytical methods of strategic analysis over a life-cycle time-frame {{are at odds with}} most economic analyses that discount values with time. The strategic analysis carried out by Transition Engineers seeks to avoid <b>stranded</b> <b>investment</b> by recognizing resource risks. A classic example of stranded investments is the North Atlantic Cod Fishery - where the largest number of bottom trawling ships (e.g. those ships responsible for destroying the Cod spawning beds) were manufactured in the year that the fish stocks collapsed.The Global Association for Transition Engineering is registered charity number 1166048, registered with the UK Charity Commission on 14 March 2016.

40|$|The {{goals of}} {{transmission}} pricing are briefly reviewed and discussed. We {{focus on the}} goals of short-term operational efficiency and of long-term incentives for investment in transmission capital equipment, and on the potential conflict between these goals. We ignore the issues of allocation of fixed costs and <b>stranded</b> <b>investment.</b> Some of the counter-intuitive aspects of optimal short-term pricing (spot pricing) are reviewed, especially {{in the context of}} conversion of expected short-term prices to long-term rights through the operation of financial futures markets. A simple interactive graphical tool written in the MatLab computer language is shown to provide important insights into these issues. Examples are given showing some characteristics of transmission congestion pricing, as well as the potential of transmission owners to exercise monopoly power owing to the private information they hold concerning line characteristics.

40|$|We analyze various {{regulatory}} regimes {{for electricity}} transmission {{investment in the}} context of a transformation of the power system towards renewable energy. We study distinctive developments of the generation mix with different implications on network congestion, assuming that a shift from conventional power plants towards renewables may go along with exogenous shocks on transmission requirements, which may be either of temporary or permanent nature. We specifically analyze the relative performance of a combined merchant-regulatory price-cap mechanism, a cost-based rule, and a non-regulated approach in dynamic generation settings. Through application in a stylized two-node network, we find that incentive regulation may perform satisfactorily only when appropriate weights are used. While quasi-ideal weights generally restore the beneficial properties that incentive regulatory mechanisms are well-known for in static settings, pure Laspeyres weights may either lead to overinvestment (<b>stranded</b> <b>investments)</b> or delayed investments as compared to the welfare optimum benchmark. <b>Stranded</b> <b>investments</b> could then be avoided through proper handling of weights. Model results indicate that using average Laspeyres-Paasche weights appears to be an appropriate strategy {{in the context of}} permanently or temporarily increasing network congestion. Our analysis motivates further research aimed to characterize optimal regulation for transmission expansion in the context of renewable integration...|$|R
30|$|To {{increase}} flexibility, a {{more systematic}} embedding of Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA)—combining approaches of Foresight, Technology Assessment (TA) and forecasting—into science, technology and innovation governance is repeatedly called for [1, 8 – 11]. In Europe, Foresight and TA have increasingly contributed to political priority setting and strategic decision making {{over the last}} 30  years [12, 13], and recently a shift from narrow technology focussed approaches to broader perspectives of the entire socio-technical systems is recognized [14]. Innovation understood as complex process, often entails profound uncertainties and high risks, demanding large investments with late return, or <b>stranded</b> <b>investments</b> [15, 16]. Within this setting, expectations are a main driver in shaping new technologies, often producing various forms of hype cycles {{along the way to}} market readiness or failure [17 – 19]. Here, Futures Studies support harnessing and orienting these expectations.|$|R
40|$|Discussions and {{decisions}} in states {{as diverse as}} California, Wisconsin, and Rhode Island are focusing on moving the United States electric industry from one dominated by vertically-integrated and highly regulated utility-based electricity monopolies to one characterized by largely divested and independent generation, transmission, and distribution sectors and by vigorous wholesale and retail competition. Numerous issues must be solved for this transition to be successful. Three {{of the most important}} are how to deal with <b>stranded</b> <b>investments,</b> how to provide open access to transmission systems, and how to deal with potentially stranded benefits, which is the current term being used to describe environmental and social programs such as demand-side management, low income programs, and renewable energy. This report explores how to meet public policy responsibilities, which are growing more acute, in a proactive fashion in a restructured United States electric industry. The specific goals of this report are to (1) assess trade-offs in the short-term in meeting public policy responsibilities associated with stranded benefits and (2) introduce a series of new ideas that, if enacted, could substantially satisfy important public policy considerations...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{portfolio}} {{theory is}} used to evaluate efficiency gains from wholesale trading in power markets. Wholesale power trading allows for diversification of demand risk, so that the minimally-required retail price decreases for all producers. A portion of the efficiency gains can be captured through bilateral forward contracts, while the remainder requires real-time trading. The largest efficiency gains from wholesale trading occur in regions with low power betas. Prices in competitive power markets depend on system production capacity. We consider the special case where capital investment was selected to minimize expected costs {{in the absence of}} wholesale markets, and show that retail competition decreases prices but imposes economic losses on producers. That is, the so-called <b>stranded</b> <b>investment</b> problem can arise because competitive markets do not support a normal return on capital invested to meet diversifiable demand risk. I.

40|$|In the mid- 1980 s, {{customers}} {{threatened to}} bypass local gas distribution companies {{in favor of}} other suppliers and cheaper fuels. In response, states began to reform their natural gas regulatory policies to lower delivered prices to potential bypassers. In this Article, Professor Kelly argues that the most promising means of reform is to unbundle traditional local gas utility services, that is, to make gas transportation services available to customers separately from gas retail sales services. This Article provides a thorough analysis of the unbundling policies adopted by state regulators across the nation. Through this systematic review of intrastate regulatory policies, Professor Kelly outlines the best method of maintaining open access to markets, of retaining sufficient regulatory control over local utility companies, and of maximizing competition and minimizing the adverse effects of cost-shifting and <b>stranded</b> <b>investment.</b> Professor Kelly asserts that regulatory bodies must recognize the competitive character of unbundled gas retailing service and the monopolistic nature of both unbundled gas transportation services and the services that remain bundled, {{in order to promote}} most effectively the primary goal of unbundling: prevention of uneconomic bypass by providing market-priced natural gas to end users...|$|E
40|$|The Biomass Industry {{has many}} {{characteristics}} {{of an infant}} industry but unlike an infant industry its products are primarily energy commodities that {{can be obtained from}} many sources. These characteristics create a multitude of risks. Risks are in three main areas. The first set of risks are market risks. The second set of risks are technology risks. The third set of risks are public policy risks. Market risks include prices received, prices paid and price volatility. Technology risks include current densification technology costly. Most biomass technology was developed if the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Technology is changing with resent renewed interest in biomass. Therefore, there is the risk of <b>stranded</b> <b>investment</b> as new technologies displace current technologies. Public policy risks are in three areas. First is withdrawal of public funding for biomass. Second is policy changes effecting harvesting biomass on public lands. Third is changes in environmental policies including CO² regulation. Risk management is key to success in the biomass industry. Market risks can be reduced through forward contracting. Technology risks can be reduced by investing in technologies that have multiple uses and spreading costs over many shareholders on single use technologies. Public policy risks are difficult to manage but must be evaluated in every business plan. Sensitivity analysis is essential in determining the magnitude of risk associated with changes in any element of the biomass enterprise...|$|E
40|$|The {{risks and}} {{uncertainty}} emanating from long-lived {{projects such as}} new large-scale power generation assets are a major challenge that investors face today in the energy business. Especially the market and policy risks arising from the priority dispatch of renewables {{and the price of}} carbon dioxide render such investments very risky and potentially unprofitable (<b>stranded</b> <b>investments).</b> Thus, cautious evaluation of the economic benefits is necessary before deciding about such far-reaching investments. In six distinct but related essays, different net present value and real options models have been developed that are especially suited for analyzing such long-lived investments. All models are based on multidimensional stochastic price path modeling, representing the basic underlying assets, such as the prices of electricity, carbon dioxide, and input fuels. Owing to the different risks associated with each of these assets, special attention is put on the risk-adjusted evaluation of the future cash flows. This also includes, besides time-, technology-, and state-dependency, correlations between cash flows of subsequent periods as well as reasonable extensions of an existing portfolio of power generation units...|$|R
30|$|Public engagement’s {{faces are}} manifold, and it differs {{according}} to many variables including {{but not limited to}} the context it is applied in, scope, topic, sector, who is engaged when, what is their role and what is the aimed for outcome. Thus PE is not restricted to certain areas, but it is necessary in all areas where potentially societal effects may be expected. Nevertheless, pre-aligning all areas of R&D with public benefit may be superfluous or even counterproductive. Innovation, for example, is frequently a by-product of basic research and thus there is a distinct need for basic research to remain independent and free as it is very often not possible to discern a public value ex-ante. Some scientific knowledge may also not seem relevant for societal problem solving at the time it is produced, but may become relevant later if circumstances change or it is interlinked with other findings. Such research would encounter difficulties to prove public value in early stages of research and would therefore hardly be funded under a strict PE regime. Additionally, there is the argument that the questions of how, who and when to engage is only a timely one, as when a new product is introduced, the market decides. Yet, adhering to needs based innovation may help to avoid <b>stranded</b> <b>investments.</b>|$|R
40|$|Hydropower (HP) is an {{important}} renewable energy source contributing 65. 7 % to Austria’s national electricity generation. However, HP is also associated with ecosystem degradations jeopardizing {{the aims of the}} EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Habitats Directive. Based on the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED), the Austrian Energy Strategy has defined goals to further increase HP production by 3. 5 TWh until 2015. Because national strategies for HP development are widely missing, hydropower plants (HPPs) are planned and approved on a local and regional level, often neglecting the overall optimum for energy supply and ecology. Therefore, a decision support tool (Hy:Con) was developed to integrate the energy-economic characteristics of planned HPPs and conservation needs of ecologically sensible river stretches. Based on 102 planned HPPs in Austria, Hy:Con identified HPPs with high economic attractiveness and low conservation concerns. The results show that owing to the already high HP exploitation in Austria, only a minor number of projects are without conservation conflicts. Upgrading of existing HPPs was associated with least ecological impacts, while HPPs with reservoirs are favoured over run-of-river plants. Cumulated ecological effects of numerous small HPPs are significant, whereas their contribution to overall energy production is comparatively small. Hy:Con represents a strategic instrument that can help decision makers to govern the implementation of the RED and WFD in a transparent way to pinpoint the limitations of future HP development and to avoid conflicts and <b>stranded</b> <b>investments.</b> © 2015 The Authors.

40|$|While the {{international}} community has agreed on the long-term target of limiting global warming to no more than 20 C above pre-industrial levels, only a few concrete climate policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been implemented. We use a set of three global integrated assessment models to analyze the implications of current climate policies on long-term mitigation targets. We define a weak-policy baseline scenario, which extrapolates the current policy environment by assuming that the global climate regime remains fragmented and that emission reduction efforts remain unambitious in most of the world 9 ̆ 2 s regions. These scenarios clearly fall short of limiting warming to 20 C. We investigate the cost and achievability of the stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations at 450 ppm CO 2 e by 2100, when countries follow the weak policy pathway until 2020 or 2030 before pursuing the long-term mitigation target with global cooperative action. We find that after a deferral of ambitious action the 450 ppm CO 2 e is only achievable with a radical up-scaling of efforts after target adoption. This has severe effects on trans-formation pathways and exacerbates the challenges of climate stabilization, in particular for a delay of cooperative action until 2030. Specifically, reaching the target with weak near-term action implies (a) faster and more aggressive transformations of energy systems in the medium term, (b) more <b>stranded</b> <b>investments</b> in fossil-based capacities, (c) higher long-term mitigation costs and carbon prices and (d) stronger transitional economic impacts, rendering the political feasibility of such pathways questionable...|$|R
40|$|Climate policy {{uncertainty}} has {{decisive influence}} on energy sector strategies. Potential <b>stranded</b> climate-energy <b>investments</b> may be enormous. Remote sensing can improve {{our understanding of}} the climate system and thus better inform climate policy and reduce associated uncertainties. We develop an integrated energy-portfolio model to value these uncertainties. The operations of individual power plants are optimized using real options given scenarios of stochastically evolving CO 2 prices mimicking observation-induced climate policy uncertainty. The resulting profit distributions are used in a portfolio optimization. The optimization under imperfect information about future CO 2 prices leads to substantially lower profits for a given risk level when portfolios are to be robust across all plausible scenarios. A potential uncertainty reduction associated with an improved climate modeling supported by remote sensing will thus not only lead to substantial financial efficiency gains, but will also be conducive to steering investments into the direction of higher shares of renewable energy...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{prospects}} for the Austrian economy are expected to improve significantly in 2000. The European economy has gained momentum, the American economy still follows a stable growth path, and Asia and Latin-America {{are on the road}} to recovery. WIFO predicts that the Austrian GDP will achieve a real growth rate of 2. 8 percent. In the recent business surveys among manufacturing firms most responses were optimistic. All seasonally adjusted indictors have followed an upward trend over the past months. The indicators of production and business climate expectations for the next months point at a continuation of this trend {{for the rest of the}} year. According to the most recent WIFO forecast of December 1999, manufacturing output is likely to grow at a rate of 4. 3 percent in 2000. Overall conditions for investment are still excellent in Austria. Austrian manufacturing are expanding. Additionally, they have been able to improve their competitiveness in recent years thanks to above-average productivity growth and moderate wage increases. According to the latest WIFO forecast, labour unit costs are expected to decrease further by 1. 2 percent vis-à-vis the major trading partners. Relatively low interest rates and high cash flows likewise contribute to the favourable investment climate in Austria. WIFO expects an overall increase of investment of 3. 9 percent in real terms for 2000. According to the recent investment survey, manufacturing firms plan to invest ATS 87. 6 billion, i. e., 4 percent above the 1999 level. Several firms plan major investment projects (petroleum, metals, electronics, chemical products and transport). The increase in investment is expected to be highest in sectors producing investment goods (+ 20 percent), non-durable consumer goods (12. 6 percent), food and beverages (10. 9 percent) and transport equipment (10. 8 percent). Producers of intermediate products plan approximately the same volume of investment as in 1999 (– 0. 7 percent) whereas producers of durable consumer goods intend to reduce their investments by 21. 7 percent. The construction industry is expected to expand by 1. 5 percent in nominal terms in 2000 and plans investments in plants and machinery of ATS 4. 05 billion, which amounts to just two thirds of the 1999 volume. One reason for the pessimistic investment plans may be the envisaged reduction of the public deficit which has made civil engineering firms – expecting to be affected most – to curtail their investment plans. Public electricity utilities cut investments by 14. 5 percent. The "Verbund Konzern", the largest electricity supplier in Austria, again plans massive reductions. This has to be seen as a response to liberalisation of the energy markets in Europe. Firms expect that <b>stranded</b> <b>investments</b> will be only partly accepted by the EU Commission, and they are building up balance sheet reserves against this contingency. Transport firms as well as other utilities (gas, water, etc.) will increase their investments by 3. 1 percent. Sachgüterindustrie auf Wachstumskurs, dennoch vorsichtige Investitionspläne für 2000.

40|$|New technologies, low {{natural gas}} prices, and {{federal and state}} utility {{regulations}} are restructuring the electricity industry. Yesterday's vertically integrated utility with a retail monopoly franchise may be a very different organization in a few years. Conferences, regulatory-commission hearings, and other industry fora are dominated by debates over the extent and form of utility deintegration, wholesale competition, and retail wheeling. A key obstacle to restructuring the electricity industry is <b>stranded</b> commitments. Past <b>investments,</b> power-purchase contracts, and public-policy-driven programs that made sense {{in an era of}} cost-of-service regulation may not be cost-effective in a competitive power market. Regulators, utilities, and other parties face tough decisions concerning the mitigation and allocation of these stranded commitments. We developed and applied a simple method to calculate the amount of stranded commitments facing U. S. investor-owned electric utilities. The results obtained with this method depend strongly on a few key assumptions: (1) the fraction of utility sales that is at risk with respect to competition, (2) the market price of electric generation, and (3) the number of years during which the utility would lose money because of differences between its embedded cost of production and the market price...|$|R
