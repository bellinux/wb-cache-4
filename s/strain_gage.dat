5000|$|The {{development}} of the commercial piezoelectric accelerometer came about {{through a number of}} attempts to find the most effective method to measure the vibration on large structures such as bridges and on vehicles in motion such as aircraft. One attempt involved using the resistance <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> as a device to build an accelerometer. Incidentally, it was Hans J. Meier who, through his work at MIT, is given credit as the first to construct a commercial <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> accelerometer (circa 1938). [...] However, the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> accelerometers were fragile and could only produce low resonant frequencies and they also exhibited a low frequency response. These limitations in dynamic range made it unsuitable for testing naval aircraft structures. On the other hand, the piezoelectric sensor was proven to be a much better choice over the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> in designing an accelerometer. The high modulus of elasticity of piezoelectric materials makes the piezoelectric sensor a more viable solution to the problems identified with the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> accelerometer.|$|E

50|$|Simply stated, the {{inherent}} {{properties of the}} piezoelectric accelerometers made it a much better alternative to the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> types because of its high frequency response, {{and its ability to}} generate high resonant frequencies. The piezoelectric accelerometer allowed for a reduction in its physical size at the manufacturing level and it also provided for a higher g (standard gravity) capability relative to the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> type. By comparison, the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> type exhibited a flat frequency response above 200 Hz while the piezoelectric type provided a flat response up to 10,000 Hz. These improvements made it possible for measuring the high frequency vibrations associated with the quick movements and short duration shocks of aircraft which before was not possible with the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> types. Before long, the technological benefits of the piezoelectric accelerometer became apparent and in the late 1940s, large scale production of piezoelectric accelerometers began. Today, piezoelectric accelerometers are used for instrumentation in the fields of engineering, health and medicine, aeronautics and many other different industries.|$|E

5000|$|The company {{devised a}} method for {{applying}} <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> testing to determining the stresses placed on circuit boards by the {{hundreds or thousands of}} test probes used to make electrical contact therewith. [...] This is useful because each test probe (a.k.a. [...] "pogo pin") exerts several ounces of force on the DUT (Device Under Test). When the test fixture has thousands of test probes, the sum of the individual probe forces can reach hundreds of pounds. Such force is sufficient to deform the DUT (a printed circuit board, for example) {{to the point where the}} attached inflexible electronic component packages (such as Ball Grid Arrays) may fracture, or their solder joints may fail. <b>Strain</b> <b>gage</b> testing can reveal areas on the DUT where these net forces are excessive when the DUT is clamped into the test fixture, thus showing where supports must be added to the opposite side of the test fixture to counteract the test probe forces. Where a support counteracts the test probe forces, the test probe force is converted from a deformative force distorting the DUT to a compressive force, squeezing the DUT circuit board without deforming its generally planar shape.|$|E
