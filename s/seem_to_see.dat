25|$|A frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, {{or region}} of {{greatest}} acuity in vision, upon which he must center {{a part of}} the image... The frog does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.|$|E
25|$|On {{the flat}} ceiling he painted an allegory of the Apotheosis of S. Ignatius, in breathtaking perspective. The painting, 17 m in diameter, is devised {{to make an}} observer, looking from a spot marked by a brass disc set into {{the floor of the}} nave, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a lofty vaulted roof {{decorated}} by statues, while in fact the ceiling is flat. The painting celebrates the apostolic goals of Jesuit missionaries, eager to expand the reach of Roman Catholicism in other continents. The Counter-Reformation also encouraged a combative Catholicism. For example, rather than placing the usual evangelists or scholarly pillars of doctrine in the pendentives, Pozzo depicted the victorious warriors of the old testament: Judith and Holofernes; David and Goliath; Jael and Sisera; and Samson and the Philistines. It is said that when completed, some said (sic)Sant'Ignazio was a good place to buy meat, since four new butchers are now there.|$|E

When the [...] "perpetrator of violence [...] is given control of the cinematic apparatus", this is [...] "referencing films such as Peeping Tom (Michael Powell, 1959) and Halloween (Carpenter, 1978)". Like [...] "Peeping Tom's psychopathic killer, Max does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> himself {{as some kind of}} artist, recording the rape and sending it to Lenny".|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Gilbert – {{to whom we}} owe a deep debt of {{gratitude}} for the pure and healthy fun he has given us in such comedies as [...] "Patience" [...] – {{seems to have a}} craze for making bishops and clergymen contemptible. [...] Yet are they behind other professions in such things as earnestness, and hard work, and devotion of life to the call of duty? [...] That clever song [...] "The pale young curate", with its charming music, is to me simply painful. [...] I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him as he goes home at night, pale and worn with the day's work, perhaps sick with the pestilent atmosphere of a noisome garret where, at the risk of his life, he has been comforting a dying man – and is your sense of humour, my reader, so keen that you can laugh at that man? ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Mardell, the BBC News North America editor, {{criticized the}} [...] "whole process, {{which has been}} used not to examine a candidate's fitness for high office, but to {{underline}} the rather obvious fact that the Obama administration does not share the world view of Republican senators, and they don't like their former colleague joining it." [...] Mardell noted the senators repeatedly [...] "insisted he gave a simple 'yes' or 'no' to complex questions. These are old men who hold themselves in high regard, but <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> serious examination of difficult problems as a personal affront. They desperately want to play 'gotcha', but haven't the self-restraint to design effective questions." [...] Mardell called Senator Hagel [...] "equally unimpressive, almost unprepared, for a level of hostility that had been signalled long in advance. Neither smart, nor humble, his tactic {{seemed to be a}} kind of bumbling blandness." [...] According to Mardell, only Senator Cruz was effective and well-prepared, as [...] "he ripped into the nominee with all the skill honed as a Texas solicitor general." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the humor}} in Beetle Bailey {{revolves}} around the inept characters stationed at Camp Swampy (inspired by Camp Crowder, where Walker had once been stationed while in the Army), which is located {{near the town of}} Hurleyburg at [...] "Parris Island, S.C.". Private Bailey is a lazy sort who usually naps and avoids work, and thus is often the subject of verbal and physical chastising from his supervisor, Sergeant Snorkel. The characters never <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> combat themselves, with the exception of mock battles and combat drills. In fact, they seem to be in their own version of stereotypical comic strip purgatory (initially basic training, they now appear to be stuck in time in a regular infantry division). The uniforms of Beetle Bailey are still the uniforms of the late 1940s to early 1970s Army, with green fatigues and baseball caps as the basic uniform, and the open jeep as the basic military vehicle. Sergeant First Class Snorkel wears a green Class A Army dress uniform with heavily wrinkled garrison cap; the officers wear M1 helmet liners painted with their insignia. Despite this 'anachronism,' modern weapons and equipment do make rare appearances. While Beetle Bailey's unit is Company A, one running gag is that the characters are variously seen in different branches of the Army, such as artillery, armor, infantry and paratroops.|$|E

2500|$|The Duke is {{concerned}} that Gilda has disappeared: [...] "Ella mi fu rapita!" [...] ("She was stolen from me!") and [...] "Parmi veder le lagrime" [...] ("I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> tears"). The courtiers then enter and inform him that they have captured Rigoletto's mistress: Chorus: [...] "Scorrendo uniti" [...] ("We went together at nightfall"). By their description, he recognizes it to be Gilda and rushes off to the room where she is held: [...] "Possente amor mi chiama" [...] ("Mighty love beckons me"). Pleased by the Duke's strange excitement, the courtiers now make sport with Rigoletto, who enters singing. He tries to find Gilda by pretending to be uncaring, as he fears she may {{fall into the hands}} of the Duke. Finally, he admits that he is in fact seeking his daughter and asks the courtiers to return her to him: [...] "Cortigiani, vil razza dannata" [...] ("Accursed race of courtiers"). Rigoletto attempts to run into the room in which Gilda is being held, but the courtiers block the way. [...] Gilda enters. The courtiers leave the room, believing Rigoletto has gone mad. Gilda describes to her father what has happened to her in the palace: [...] "Tutte le feste al tempio" [...] ("On all the blessed days"). In a duet Rigoletto swears vengeance against the Duke, while Gilda pleads for her lover: [...] "Sì! Vendetta, tremenda vendetta!" [...] ("Yes! Revenge, terrible revenge!").|$|E
2500|$|Archibald now {{believes}} in a [...] "purposeful cause of universal action" [...] seemingly over and above, yet directing, {{the concerns of}} humans and their endeavors. Despite all of the political scheming and brave actions of individual adventurers, the force of fate lies underneath every event. Interestingly, Archibald Hunter is much more optimistic in his tone {{about the presence of}} fate than some characters in other novels of this genre and era who have had to confront the shortcomings of science or order in the natural world in the face of fate. H.G. Wells' Edward Prendick in The Island of Dr. Moreau, for example, sees a life without meaning once he observes the disorder caused by Moreau's science. Stoker's own Van Helsing from Dracula questions his medical knowledge once he realizes that he is dealing with an evil that cannot be cured by any medical remedy. Archibald does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the supernatural or fate as working against him—most of his immediate problems spring from political tensions and other human beings. Although Stoker takes advantage of the ominous effect that can be derived from invoking fate and supernatural forces, fate is ultimately portrayed as a force over and above the flaws of individuals and as something that can make amends for foolish human errors. The kidnappers are drowned, Don Bernardino regains his honor in death, and the mysterious Seer, Gormala, meets her end near the same bay where she first met Archibald Hunter, lending a sense of justice and closure to {{what could have been a}} dark story.|$|E
