5|$|As of October 2010, {{there are}} three rest areas along the A4 motorway. Legislation {{identifies}} four types of rest areas designated as types A through D: A-type rest areas comprise {{a full range of}} amenities, including a filling station, a restaurant and a hotel or motel; B-type rest areas have no lodging; C-type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a café, but no restaurants or accommodations; D-type rest areas only offer parking spaces, possibly picnicking tables and benches, and restrooms. Even though rest areas found along the A4 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are considerable variations, as some of them offer extra services. The filling stations regularly have small convenience stores, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>may</b> offer LPG fuel.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{extremely}} hard, but also brittle {{and can be}} split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine {{the weight of the}} final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%. Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>may</b> be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.|$|E

25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, {{the very}} concept of human {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>may</b> be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E
25|$|Postosuchus {{lived in}} a {{tropical}} environment. The moist and warm region consisted of ferns, such as Cynepteris, Phelopteris and Clathropteris, gymnosperms, represented by Pelourdea, Araucarioxylon, Woodworthia, Otozamites and Dinophyton, and cycads like Sanmiguelia. Plants of the Dockum Group are not well known since the oxidizing of the environment has destroyed most of the plant fossils. However, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>may</b> provide information about the climate in Dockum Group during the late Triassic period. For example, the discovery of large specimens belonging to Araucarioxylon determine that the region was well watered. The fauna found in Dockum Group confirm that there were lakes and/or rivers containing fish such as the cartilaginous Xenacanthus, the lobe-finned Chinlea and the dipnoan Ceratodus. On the shores of these rivers lived labyrinthodonts (Latiscopus) and reptiles such as Malerisaurus and Trilophosaurus. Also living {{on the margins of}} the lakes were the archosaurs Leptosuchus, Nicrosaurus and Rutiodon. Postosuchus lived in the uplands along with Coelophysis and other archosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Typothorax. Postosuchus was one of the largest animals in that ecosystem and preyed on herbivores such as Trilophosaurus and Typothorax.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} why Somerled launched his attack upon the Scots. The early 1160s saw {{a period of}} Scottish consolidation in the maritime region between the Lennox and Cowal, and along the eastern coast of the Firth of Clyde towards Galloway. David may well have begun the infeftment and settlement of this coastal district decades earlier, to counter the seaborne threat that the rulers of Argyll posed during the dynastic challenges of the 1130s. By the 1160s, {{some of the greatest}} Scottish magnates had taken root in the region, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>may</b> have begun to extend their influence into southern Argyll and the Islands of the Clyde. The catalyst for Somerled's invasion, therefore, may have been the encroachment of Scottish influence into his own sphere of hegemony. The target of his invasion appears to have been Renfrew, the centre of the family of Walter FitzAlan, Steward of Scotland, and Somerled's forces may well have engaged those of Walterpossibly even led by the steward himself. The precise chronology of Walter's westward expansion is not known for certain, but he and Somerled likely had conflicting ambitions in the region. Although Somerled may have sought to eliminate or reduce this perceived threat, the massive scale of his seaborne assault suggests that he may have nursed even greater ambitions. With an increasingly ill and possibly incapacitated king upon the Scottish throne, the real motivation behind Somerled's last operation may well have been sheer opportunism.|$|E

25|$|These Amnesia Fortnight periods proved fortuitous, as Schafer {{considers}} {{these to}} {{have kept the}} company viable. Upon completion of Brütal Legend, Double Fine started work on its sequel, but was told to stop development shortly after as Electronic Arts decided against publishing it. With no other publishing deals lined up at the time, Schafer {{turned back to the}} eight game ideas developed from Amnesia Fortnight, believing they could be developed further into short, complete games. Schafer also looked at the success of smaller focused games like Geometry Wars on the various download services, realizing the potential market for similar titles. Schafer and his team selected the best four, and began shopping the games to various publishers, and successfully worked publishing details with these. Two of these games, Costume Quest and Stacking, were picked up by THQ and released digitally on the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network storefronts; both games were considered successful and THQ expressed interest in helping Double Fine produce similar titles in the future. Iron Brigade (originally titled Trenched but changed due to trademark issues) was developed as an Xbox Live Arcade game in association with Microsoft Game Studios, and similarly received positive praise from journalists. A fourth game, , was published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in association with the Sesame Workshop for the Xbox 360 using the Kinect controller; though initially not a licensed title, Schafer and his team found it to be an ideal fit for their first licensed-property game. The four unused ideas may be used for a game in the future, according to Schafer, but believes <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>may</b> be unsellable to a publisher.|$|E
