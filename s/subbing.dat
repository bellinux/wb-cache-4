For La <b>sub</b> 1 <b>sub</b> - <b>sub</b> x Ba <b>sub</b> x CoO <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> - subdelta, the results were in agreement with those in the literature. Materials exhibited a rhombohedral distortion for 0 <= x <= 0 centre dot 3, whilst 0 centre dot 4 <= x <= 0 centre dot 75 were cubic. For Nd <b>sub</b> 1 <b>sub</b> - <b>sub</b> x Ba <b>sub</b> x CoO <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> - subdelta, only NdCoO <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> - subdelta and Nd <b>sub</b> 0 subcentre dot <b>sub</b> 5 Ba <b>sub</b> O <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> - subdelta were prepared phase-pure. Due to A-site ordering in Nd <b>sub</b> 0 subcentre dot <b>sub</b> 5 Ba <b>sub</b> O <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> - subdelta, there was doubling of the c-axis, and the formula NdBaCo <b>sub</b> 2 O <b>sub</b> 6 <b>sub</b> - subdelta is reported in the literature, and was utilised in this study.

It appeared the materials were able to tolerate considerable oxygen loss and remain stable. For NdBaCo <b>sub</b> 2 O <b>sub</b> 6 <b>sub</b> - subdelta, structural transitions occurred as oxygen content decreased; a tetragonal-orthorhombic (approx 300 deg C) and orthorhombic-tetragonal transition (approx 900 deg C) were observed. In REBaCo <b>sub</b> 2 O <b>sub</b> 6 <b>sub</b> - subdelta (RE Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho) as RE size decreased, the oxygen content of samples prepared under the same conditions decreased, and a tetragonal-orthorhombic-tetragonal transition occurred. The intermediate sized RE (Sm, Eu, Gd) materials exhibited the orthorhombic distortion. Post-reaction heat <b>sub</b> 1 <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> + subdelta was carried out to ascertain the effect of using different radiation sources (Cu K alpha <b>sub</b> 1 and Co K alpha <b>sub</b> 1), and the effect of refinement procedure on results. The choice of radiation was not an important factor, whereas refinement procedure was found to be an important variable. Results suggested that to obtain accurate Rietveld refinement results for La <b>sub</b> 4 BaCu <b>sub</b> 5 O <b>sub</b> 1 <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> + subdelta, the O U <b>sub</b> i <b>sub</b> s <b>sub</b> o 's {{should not be allowed to}} refine. treatments were carried out to vary oxygen contents. As oxygen content was decreased, the orthorhombic distortion was observed for larger RE ions (Pr, Nd). On increasing oxygen content, under HOP conditions, the orthorhombic distortion was observed for smaller RE ions (Ho, Dy, Tb). Rietveld refinement of NdBaCo <b>sub</b> 2 O <b>sub</b> 6 <b>sub</b> - subdelta, with different oxygen contents, was carried out to try and ascertain the mechanism for the tetragonal-orthorhombic-tetragonal transitions. It appeared that as O(1) vacancies increased, CoO <b>sub</b> 6 octahedra converted to CoO <b>sub</b> 5 square pyramids. As a consequence, the coordination of Nd decreased, and the attraction for O(3) sites increased. At a critical O(1) vacancy concentration, the Nd caused the 4 -fold O(3) site to split into two 2 -fold sites [O(3) and O(4) ], with the O(3) site moving closer to the Nd ion. The splitting of the site led to the orthorhombic distortion, which occurred at O <b>sub</b> 5 subcentre dot <b>sub</b> 6, with a maximum at O <b>sub</b> 5 subcentre dot <b>sub</b> 4 and disappeared around O <b>sub</b> 5 subcentre dot <b>sub</b> 2 <b>sub</b> 5. At a second O(1) vacancy concentration, the Nd coordination decreased sufficiently for the O(4) sites to be attracted; O(3) and O(4) once again become equivalent and the orthorhombic distortion was lost. Therefore, it seemed possible that the tetragonal-orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transitions were controlled by O(1) vacancy concentration and, the subsequent, Nd coordination.

Materials were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron diffraction (ND), Rietveld refinement, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). La <b>sub</b> 4 BaCu <b>sub</b> 5 O <b>sub</b> 1 <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> + subdelta was found to be a stoichiometric phase, with no evidence of variable cation content. An oxygen content range of - 0 centre dot 3 (1) <= delta <= 0 centre dot 2 (1) was calculated from H <b>sub</b> 2 -reduction TG data. Results were in good agreement with those reported in the literature. However, from Rietveld refinement, the possible presence of CuO <b>sub</b> 4 square planes, in addition to CuO <b>sub</b> 6 and CuO <b>sub</b> 5 polyhedra, in the structure was suggested. La <b>sub</b> 4 Ba <b>sub</b> 1 <b>sub</b> - <b>sub</b> x Sr <b>sub</b> x Cu <b>sub</b> 5 O <b>sub</b> 1 <b>sub</b> 3 <b>sub</b> + subdelta was prepared; the solid solution ranges, 0 <= x <= 0 centre dot 11 (2) and 0 centre dot 56 (4) <= x <= 1 centre dot 0 were determined by quantitative EPMA.

The effects of dead space, enhanced speed to ionisation of early ionising carriers and carrier diffusion on multiplication-limited bandwidth are studied in this work via modelling.

It was found that dead space increases the order of carrier groups involved in multiplication, and hence the length of the multiplication chains, as impact ionisation events initiated by feedback carriers become more important. This degrades the improvement in bandwidth expected from reducing the multiplication layer thickness. To study the effects of enhanced speed to ionisation of early ionising carriers and of carrier diffusion on the avalanche time response, a technique has been developed for calculating the probability of fusion (pdf) of avalanche duration using general models for pdfs of ionisation in space and time and also for carrier transport. While diffusion plays only a minor role, the speed enhancement of carriers to ionisation events early in their trajectories is found to speed up the avalanche process significantly in short devices...|$|R

In February 2013, this lineup returned to Casino Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada. Tour dates played in summer 2013 included Riverfest in Watertown, Wisconsin, the St. Clair, MI Riverfest, several additional dates in Canada, and a reprise of their appearances at both Moondance Jam in Walker, MN and Rockin' the Rivers in Three Forks, Montana. The band made some rare appearances on the U.S. east coast in July 2013, including a performance with David Johansen of the New York Dolls at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in Englewood, New Jersey. Singer Joe Retta was unavailable for these dates due to a scheduling conflict, so Tribe of Gypsies frontman Chas West, who has played with Jason Bonham's band and has experience <b>subbing</b> in such well-known bands as Foreigner, Lynch Mob and Diamond Head, stepped in to man the microphone {{for a series of}} shows in New York, New Jersey and Maryland.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Zbyszko was {{promoted}} to the WCW Monday Nitro broadcast team, where he announced during the first hour with Tony Schiavone. In 1997, he was antagonized by New World Order (nWo) member Scott Hall, but Hall opted not to face Zbyszko. Zbyszko remained in the broadcast booth for most of 1997, occasionally refereeing matches involving Hall and the nWo. On October 13, 1997, Zybyszko got involved in a WCW Tag Team Championship match between the Steiner Brothers and Scott Hall and Syxx (<b>subbing</b> for an injured Kevin Nash) and counted the ensuing fall for the Steiner Brothers who became the champions. This reign was official despite Zybyszko not being an official referee, a role he previously played in Scott Hall's match against Lex Luger at Fall Brawl. On December 28, 1997 at StarrCade 1997, Zbyszko returned to the ring for a match against Bischoff for control of WCW Monday Nitro with Bret Hart acting as special referee. Hart ensured that the nWo did not interfere, and Zbyszko won the match, regaining control of Nitro for WCW. He continued to feud with Hall and his lackey, Louie Spicolli, culminating in a match between Zbyszko and Hall at Souled Out 1998 on January 24, 1998. Zbyszko won the match by disqualification after Dusty Rhodes betrayed him, joining the nWo.|$|E

The energy (150 - 600 eV) and ion-to-atom arrival ratio (0. 27 - 2. 0) of assisting argon and oxygen ions were varied. Influence of deposition conditions (deposition system geometry, nature and amount of gas in the chamber, substrate cleaning and ion-assistance parameters) on films properties (stress, composition, refractive index n <b>sub</b> 5 <b>sub</b> 0 <b>sub</b> 0 <b>sub</b> n <b>sub</b> m and extinction coefficient k <b>sub</b> 5 <b>sub</b> 0 <b>sub</b> 0 <b>sub</b> n <b>sub</b> m) was investigated. A scanning method, based on substrate curvature measurements by laser reflection and stress calculation using the Stoney equation, was employed. RBS showed that stoichiometric Ta <b>sub</b> 2 O <b>sub</b> 5 films contain impurities of Ar, Fe and Mo. Stoichiometric SiO <b>sub</b> 2 films also contain Ta impurity. Argon content increases with ion bombardment and, at maximum incorporation, argon bubbles are registered by TEM. XPS studies are complicated by surface contaminations and preferential sputtering. Evaporated SiO <b>sub</b> 2 films show + 100 MPa stress (+ is tensile, - compressive). With 300 eV Ar sup + bombardment, stress changes to - 200 MPa, n <b>sub</b> 5 <b>sub</b> 0 <b>sub</b> 0 <b>sub</b> n <b>sub</b> m decreases (1. 56 - 1. 49) and k <b>sub</b> 5 <b>sub</b> 0 <b>sub</b> 0 <b>sub</b> n <b>sub</b> m increases (1. 4 x 10 sup - sup 4 - 1. 8 x 10 sup - sup 3). Of all studied IBS conditions, stress in SiO <b>sub</b> 2 (- 560 MPa) and Ta <b>sub</b> 2 O <b>sub</b> 5 (- 350 MPa) films depends only on sputtering gas species and oxygen entry point into the chamber. With argon and oxygen bombardment stress in IBS SiO <b>sub</b> 2 films decreases to - 380 MPa and below the stress measurement system resolution, respectively. While Ar sup + bombardment of Ta <b>sub</b> 2 O <b>sub</b> 5 films leads to increase in stress to - 490 MPa, the effect of oxygen assistance depends on ion energy.

500|$|The {{third quarter}} saw Vanderbilt's one {{exciting}} offensive drive. [...] "With Godchaux, Kuhn, and Raeburn <b>subbing</b> in the backfield, the Commodores opened {{a series of}} forward passes and runs that netted about 50 yards before Flowers intercepted a long pass on his own 10-yard line and raced 50 yards before being pushed out of bounds by a Vandy tackler". Fumbles cost Vanderbilt; one by Grailey Berryhill lead to Tech's third touchdown. In the fourth quarter, a fight broke out involving Gink Hendrick, some Tech players, and spectators. Tech lost some 133 yards from penalties during the contest.|$|E

500|$|As a {{freshman}} for the 1991 Wolverines, Wheatley set the Michigan freshman yards per attempt record with 555yards on 86carries for a 6.4yards per attempt.

[...] He rushed for 1,357yards and 13Rushing touchdowns in addition to 3Receiving touchdowns and recording a kickoff return touchdown while <b>subbing</b> for the injured Ricky Powers. [...] Wheatley had amassed the most touchdowns by a running back in Michigan history {{by the end of}} his junior year and was a professional prospect. [...] In 1993 at the end of his junior season 1993 Wolverines, he earned the MVP award of the 1994 Hall of Fame Bowl. Wheatley had finished 8th in the 1993Heisman Trophy race. [...] Before LeShon Johnson's 306yard effort in November of that season against Iowa team that Wheatley had rushed for 113yards against, Wheatley had been mentioned as the best running back in the nation, but Johnson's effort and Bam Morris' final three games of 223, 222 and 223yards led to Bam Morris winning the Doak Walker Award. Most who finished ahead of him in the Heisman voting either were seniors (Ward, Glenn Foley, Johnson) or gave up their amateur eligibility and declared early for the draft (Heath Shuler, David Palmer, Marshall Faulk), which made Wheatley one of the favorites for the award if he stayed in college for one more year. [...] He stayed at Michigan for another year with the stated intent of obtaining his degree, but stayed without receiving the degree. [...] However, the preseason 1994 Heisman Trophy favorite (along with 7th-place finisher J. J. Stokes), missed the beginning of the season with an injury to the same shoulder that had caused him to miss two games in 1993. [...] His return to the lineup on September 24, 1994 was overshadowed by The Miracle at Michigan. [...] His senior season return to the 1994 Wolverines had been a surprise, but injuries allowed Tshimanga Biakabutuka and Ed Davis to get some playing time. He only finished 12th in the Heisman balloting as a senior. [...] Nonetheless, he thought that his senior-year experience broadened his horizons.|$|E
