The excavation was completed between November 17 and 19, 1986, as part of a road improvement project along SH 158 in northwestern Coke County. A few cutting implements and a blade core were found by Wayne C. Young of the SDHPT in a general surface collection which he made in September of 1986. Subsequently, four 1 by 1 meter test units and a single 2 by 2 meter test unit were excavated by hand to depths of between 10 and 30 cm below the present surface. The large unit revealed a hearth feature, part of which was visible on the surface. The other test units resulted in the recovery of only a few flakes of chert and no other features were found. No artifacts were recovered with which to assign a firm date to the <b>site.</b> <b>Road</b> maintenance such as scraping along the right-of-way may have removed the upper portion of the site. However, the overall lack of material and features suggests that the site was an ephemeral campsite of limited function.

40|$|Four JAEA {{researchers}} visited PNNL for {{two weeks}} in February, 2013 to learn the PNNL-developed, unsteady, one-dimensional, river model, TODAM and the PNNL-developed, time-dependent, three dimensional, coastal water model, FLESCOT. These codes predict sediment and contaminant concentrations by accounting sediment-radionuclide interactions, e. g., adsorption/desorption and transport-deposition-resuspension of sediment-sorbed radionuclides. The objective {{of the river and}} coastal water modeling is to simulate • 134 Cs and 137 Cs migration in Fukushima rivers and the coastal water, and • their accumulation in the river and ocean bed along the Fukushima coast. Forecasting the future cesium behavior in the river and coastal water under various scenarios would enable JAEA to assess the effectiveness of various on-land remediation activities and if required, possible river and coastal water clean-up operations to reduce the contamination of the river and coastal water, agricultural products, fish and other aquatic biota. PNNL presented the following during the JAEA visit to PNNL: • TODAM and FLESCOT’s theories and mathematical formulations • TODAM and FLESCOT model structures • Past TODAM and FLESCOT applications • Demonstrating these two codes' capabilities by applying them to simple hypothetical river and coastal water cases. • Initial application of TODAM to the Ukedo River in Fukushima and JAEA researchers' participation in its modeling. PNNL also presented the relevant topics relevant to Fukushima environmental assessment and remediation, including • PNNL molecular modeling and EMSL computer facilities • Cesium adsorption/desorption characteristics • Experiences of connecting molecular science research results to macro model applications to the environment • EMSL tour • Hanford <b>Site</b> <b>road</b> tour. PNNL and JAEA also developed future course of actions for joint research projects on the Fukushima environmental and remediation assessments...|$|E
40|$|O estudo teve como objetivo identificar os impactos ambientais provocados na fase de implanta??o e opera??o de loteamentos na APA, visando propor adequa??o nos procedimentos de licenciamento {{ambiental}} da atividade, junto aos ?rg?os ambientais. A identifica??o e a caracteriza??o qualitativa dos impactos ambientais foram realizados a partir da utiliza??o do m?todo Listagem de Controle (Check-List), que consiste, no vislumbramento e na listagem de conseq??ncias (impactos ambientais), quando se considera o potencial transformador do ambiente f?sico, bi?tico e antr?pico, de causas (atividades impactantes). Para facilitar sua avalia??o foi utilizado o m?todo de Matriz de Leopold, que facilitou a visualiza??o e a valora??o dos impactos sobre os diferentes componentes do ambiente. Para identifica??o dos cursos d ?gua, foi utilizado base cartogr?fica na escala 1 : 50. 000 do IBGE, utilizando o Softwere ARCGIS 9. 3, bem como base Cadastral da Cidade de Manaus, escala 1 : 2. 000 da SEMEF. Ap?s sistematiza??o dos dados acima citados, foi utilizado imagem SRTM para efetivar o adensamento dos cursos d ?gua da ?rea Urbana da APA. Para a din?mica espa?o-temporal, foram utilizadas imagens multiespectrais Sensores TM/LANDSAT 5, QUICKBIRD, no per?odo compreendendo os anos de 2001, 2005 e 2008, bem como dados aero-fotogram?tricos (fotografias a?reas), para an?lise da evolu??o temporal da degrada??o ambiental da APA. Os estudos possibilitaramde demonstrar que do ponto de vista ambiental, os impactos s?o comuns aos diferentes Portes, diferenciado-se apenas na intensidade e na magnitude dos mesmos. Essa informa??o foi evidenciada durante a fase de levantamento dos impactos, que foi concentrado em loteamentos de portes diferenciados: dois de porte m?dios e 2 de porte grande e na matriz qualitativa e quantitativa. Ficou evidenciado que loteamentos de Porte Grande com pouca densidade populacional tendem a causar impactos relativamente menos significativos do que outros que ocupam ?reas menores, considerados de Pequeno e/ou M?dio Porte, por?m, ocupados de forma mais intensa. Foi constatado ainda, que os loteadores s?o respons?veis apenas pela supress?o vegetal da parte de infra-estrutura do loteamento (implanta??o de canteiro de obras, sistema vi?rio e ?rea de lazer), deixando sob a responsabilidade dos propriet?rios, o desmate dos lotes. Esse procedimento evidenciou que uma grande parcela do desmatamento ? resultante da ocupa??o dos lotes, feito sem autoriza??o do ?rg?o Ambiental, desrespeitando os crit?rios da legisla??o e sem acompanhamento da construtora, desrespeitando a ?rea de reserva legal e interven??es na grande maioria das ?reas de Preserva??o Permanente APP. Quanto a an?lise temporal, a classifica??o supervisionada foi realizada na ?rea Total da APA, possibilitando calcular a din?mica e o processo espa?o-temporal de desflorestamento, dando subs?dio para an?lise da ?rea objeto de estudo que ? a sua ?rea Urbana. No per?odo de 2006 a 2008, a taxa de desflorestamento em rela??o a ?rea total da APA foi de 63, 26 %. Por?m, em rela??o ao per?odo analisado, houve uma redu??o, com incremento de apenas 6, 36 % e ?ndice de evolu??o de 59, 78 %. Na an?lise da evolu??o do desflorestamento na ?rea Urbana da APA, constatou-se que os principais vetores de desflorestamento foram: explora??o de produtos minerais para emprego imediato na constru??o civil, culturas agr?colas, atividades supress?o vegetal para instala??es industriais, bem como invas?es de ?reas, al?m dos loteamentos foco desta pesquisaThe study {{aimed to}} identify the environmental impacts caused during the implementation and operation of land divisions in the APA, to propose adequate procedures for environmental licensing of the activity, along with environmental agencies. The identification and qualitative characterization of the environmental impacts have been realized {{from the use of}} the method List of Control ("Check-List"), which consists in the glimpse and the list of consequences (impacts), when is considerate the transformative potential of the environment physical, biotic and anthropic causes (impacting activities). To facilitate their evaluation, the method of Leopold Matrix, which facilitated the visualization and assessment of impacts on different components of the environment. To identify waterways, was used 1 : 50, 000 basemap IBGE, using ArcGIS 9. 3 softwere and Cadastral base of the City of Manaus, SEMEF scale of 1 : 2, 000. After systematic data above was used to effect the SRTM image density of the watercourses in the area of Urban APA. For the spatio-temporal, multispectral images were used TM / Landsat 5, QuickBird, in the period that comprises the years 2001, 2005 and 2008 as well as aero-photogrammetric data (aerial photographs) for analysis of the temporal evolution of environmental degradation APA. Possibilitaramde Studies show that from the viewpoint of environmental impacts are common to the "Sizes", which differs only in intensity and magnitude of them. This information was evident when were making inquires about the impacts, which was concentrated in lots of different sizes: two medium-sized and two large-sized array and qualitative and quantitative. It was demonstrated that the allotments of Large Size with low population density tend to cause relatively less significant impacts than others who occupy smaller areas, considered in Small and / or Medium-sized, however, occupied more intensively. It was verified that the housing lot makers are responsible only for the suppression of plant part of the blending infrastructure (installation of building <b>site,</b> <b>road</b> system and recreation area), leaving the responsibility of the owners, the deforestation of the lots. This procedure revealed that a large portion of deforestation is the result of occupation of the plot, made without authorization from the Environmental Agency, disregarding the criteria of the legislation and no monitoring of construction, disrespecting the legal reserve area and interventions {{in the vast majority of}} Permanent Preservation Areas -APP. On the temporal analysis, the supervised classification was performed on Total Area of the APA, allowing the calculation of the dynamics and spatial-temporal process of deforestation, with allowance for the analysis of the study area which is its urban area. In the period 2006 - 2008, the rate of deforestation over the area of the BB was 63. 26 %. However, over the period analyzed, there was a reduction, an increase of only 6. 36 % and rate of progression was 59. 78 %. Analyzing the evolution of deforestation in the Urban Area of the APA, it was found that the main vectors of deforestation were: exploration of mineral products for immediate use in construction, crops, vegetation removal activities for industrial facilities, as well as invasions of areas, than the allotments...|$|E
