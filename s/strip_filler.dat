50|$|In the post-World War II {{years he}} did his Sunday strip Specs for the New York Tribune Syndicate. Published for one full year (May 12, 1946 to May 25, 1947), it was a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> which did not always appear every week.|$|R
50|$|Henry Boltinoff (February 19, 1914 - April 26, 2001) was an American {{cartoonist}} {{who worked}} for both comic strips and comic books. He drew many of the humor and <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> that appeared in National Periodical comics from the 1940s through the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Johnny the Homicidal Maniac spawned two spin-offs: a four-issue series titled Squee!, and a double-shot titled I Feel Sick. The trade {{paperback}} {{release of}} Squee!, titled Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors, includes the <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> {{left out of}} Director's Cut. Johnny makes cameo appearances {{at the end of}} Squee! and in the second issue of I Feel Sick.|$|R
5000|$|Johnny the Homicidal Maniac {{features}} several <b>filler</b> <b>strips,</b> which, for {{the most}} part, {{have nothing to do}} with the main storyline. Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut collects [...] "Happy Noodle Boy", [...] "Public Service Announcement", and [...] "Anne Gwish" [...] while Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors includes [...] "Wobbly-Headed Bob", [...] "Meanwhile...", and [...] "True Tales of Human Drama".|$|R
50|$|La Prensa, a Mexican publisher, {{released}} the Spanish language {{editions of the}} Sad Sack comics under the title Tristán Tristón. In addition to Sad Sack strips, other strips within each Tristán Tristón issue included Tristána Tristóna (Sad Sack's cousin, Sadie Sack) and Capulín which was about a boy who had overly large feet. The latter two strips were often only one page and used as <b>filler.</b> Other <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> included Firulais and Chiquilladas.|$|R
5000|$|Piper {{also created}} Steel Barr for OPCs Hurricane in 1946 and Lemmy Loo as a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> for K.G Murrays Captain Triumph Comics (October 1949 - February 1950). Steel Barr was resurrected by Youngs Merchandising in 1950, {{under the title}} Steel Barr and The Phantom Man. Australian comic book researcher, Kevin Patrick, {{describes}} Steel Barr as being [...] "a granite-jawed District Commissioner who patrolled the African jungles, battling myriad threats while searching for his elusive opponent, The Phantom Man." ...|$|R
50|$|The Bannisters - All the bannisters in {{the house}} must be replaced, but working with the contestants will be someone {{other than their own}} nominators. Tex, with Jennie, is done after 17 minutes, and Dez, with Marnie, {{following}} soon after. Both pass, and the other three (Casey paired with Tara, Joe with Tiina, and Charmaine with Rita) fail due to not having removed a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> prior to mounting the bannister to a wall that both Tex and Dez had done.|$|R
5000|$|A {{photograph}} {{of one of}} Vasquez's friends, Leah England, serves as {{the middle of a}} portrait collection {{on the cover of the}} second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. England also gave Vasquez the inspiration for a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> about a child who was dangerously afraid of losing sight of his mother, as well as the [...] "Meanwhile..." [...] strip in the second issue. The two were discussing an event that had happened to a cheerleader, and thinking up the worst excuse possible.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Wheelahan {{was born}} in Bombala, New South Wales in 1930, {{the son of a}} mounted policeman. He grew up in Dalton, New South Wales, during the great depression, and was educated in Goulburn and Muswellbrook. In 1947 Wheelahan moved to Sydney to find work and contact his idol, Stan Pitt, whose work, Silver Starr he had long admired. ...when the Sunday Sun and Guardian's Sunbeams comic {{supplement}} published episode one of Stanley Pitt's Silver Starr, I freaked. In the hour I first held that comic in my hands, I knew I would be a comic artist and assured everyone of this fact on that same day - including my parents, who were massively unimpressed. Paul Wheelahan [...] Wheelahan became friends with Pitt and from 1949 to 1950 Pitt employed him inking sections of Yarmak - Jungle King and Captain Power. Wheelahan also did artwork for H. John Edwards, including covers for the Fiction House line of reprints and fillers. H. John Edwards started giving me <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> of two to four-page comics in reprints ofAmerican books, such as Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. Paul Wheelahan [...] One of these <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> was 'Space Hawk', a science-fiction superhero, which appeared as a back-up feature in Edwards' reprints of Wings and Rangers comics.|$|R
5000|$|Another type uses a glass {{reinforced}} plastic rod with a notch in one side, which carries one or two ribbons of glass fibers. The notch is filled with water-resistant gel and covered with an extruded plastic <b>filler</b> <b>strip.</b> The whole assembly is enclosed in a sunlight and tracking resistant sheath. This design is not as flexible as the symmetrical cylindrical design above, but provides good access to the fibers at joints and is resistant to crushing. At full working load the optical fibers may experience up to 0.25% strain, which is undesirable for long fiber life.|$|R
5000|$|Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut, a trade {{paperback}} {{released by}} Slave Labor Graphics in July 1997, collected the series. Slave Labor also released a hardcover {{version of the}} collection. Rob Schrab provides a foreword. The trade paperback includes a [...] "Gallery of Ancient Horrors" [...] that features a few strips previously published in the Mount Pleasant High School newspaper and Carpe Noctem, {{as well as some}} strips previously unpublished, all with commentary by Vasquez. The paperback also introduces some new supplementary materials such as sketches, an issue-by-issue synopsis, character profiles, and a fictional interview with Vasquez, but leaves out many of the <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> from the original series.|$|R
5000|$|Lee in 2009 {{described}} these [...] "short, five-page <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> that Steve and I did together", originally [...] "placed {{in any of}} our comics {{that had}} a few extra pages to fill", as [...] "odd fantasy tales that I'd dream up with O. Henry-type twist endings." [...] Giving an early example of what would later {{be known as the}} [...] "Marvel Method" [...] of writer-artist collaboration, Lee said, [...] "All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he'd be off and running. He'd take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect." ...|$|R
50|$|Due to the character's {{popularity}} in Marvel UK's first title, The Mighty World of Marvel, Spider-Man was made {{the star of}} his own weekly comic in early 1973. A full story from the monthly The Amazing Spider-Man was published each week. The backup strip featured Thor reprints, from Journey into Mystery, {{including some of the}} Tales of Asgard. From #50, Spider-Man stories would be split, usually running over two consecutive weekly issues. Stories from The Spectacular Spider-Man (#72-74) and the Amazing Spider-Man annuals were also included (#9-10, 23, 75-76). Iron Man stories from Tales of Suspense were added from issue #50, with occasional <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> from Amazing Adult Fantasy, World of Suspense, Mystic and Not Brand Echh. The first issue also promoted the UK branch of Marvel's new in-house fan club, FOOM.|$|R
5000|$|The Marvel {{method was}} in place {{with at least one}} artist by early 1961, as Lee {{described}} in 2009 when speaking of his and Ditko's [...] "short, five-page <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> ... placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill", most prominently in Amazing Fantasy but even previously in Amazing Adventures and other [...] "pre-superhero Marvel" [...] science-fiction/fantasy anthology titles. [...] "I'd dream up odd fantasy tales with an O. Henry type twist ending. All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he'd be off and running.

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} the cooling of the outer wall of a combustion chamber or other highly heated container. It is the general object of my invention to provide an improved cooling jacket construction by which such chambers or containers may be very effectively cooled by a jacket structure of minimum weight. To the attainment of this object, I provide a system of conduits or tubes and associated parts, by which a cooling fluid may be circulated about a combustion chamber and by which the transfer of heat thereto may be facilitated. More specifically, I provide conduits or tubes of such cross section as to present maximum resistance to distortion together with associated heat transfer elements or <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> which overcome the disadvantage of line contact only between such a conduit and a combustion chamber wall.

5000|$|A Kirby science fiction/monster story, usually inked by Christopher Rule initially, then by Dick Ayers {{following}} Rule's retirement, would generally open each book. This {{was followed}} by one or two twist-ending thrillers or sci-fi tales drawn by Don Heck, Paul Reinman, or Joe Sinnott, all capped by an often-surreal, sometimes self-reflexive Lee-Ditko short. Lee in 2009 described these [...] "short, five-page <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> that Steve and I did together", originally [...] "placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill", as [...] "odd fantasy tales that I'd dream up with O. Henry-type endings." [...] Giving an early example of what would later {{be known as the}} [...] "Marvel Method" [...] of writer-artist collaboration, Lee said, [...] "All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he'd be off and running. He'd take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect." ...|$|R
5000|$|These Lee-Ditko {{short stories}} proved {{so popular that}} Amazing Adventures was reformatted to feature such stories {{exclusively}} beginning with issue #7 (Dec. 1961), when the comic was rechristened Amazing Adult Fantasy — a name intended to reflect its more [...] "sophisticated" [...] nature, as likewise the new tagline [...] "The magazine that respects your intelligence". Lee in 2009 described these [...] "short, five-page <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> that Steve and I did together", originally [...] "placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill", as [...] "odd fantasy tales that I'd dream up with O.

50|$|Dots {{are usually}} inlaid {{into the upper}} edge of the {{fretboard}} in the same positions, small enough to be visible only to the player. These usually appear on the odd numbered frets, {{but also on the}} 12th fret (the one octave mark) instead of the 11th and 13th frets. Some older or high-end instruments have inlays made of mother of pearl, abalone, ivory, colored wood or other exotic materials and designs. Simpler inlays are often made of plastic or painted. High-end classical guitars seldom have fretboard inlays as a well-trained player is expected to know his or her way around the instrument. In addition to fretboard inlay, the headstock and soundhole surround are also frequently inlaid. The manufacturer's logo or a small design is often inlaid into the headstock. Rosette designs vary from simple concentric circles to delicate fretwork mimicking the historic rosette of lutes. Bindings that edge the finger and sound boards are sometimes inlaid. Some instruments have a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> running down the length and behind the neck, used for strength or to fill the cavity through which the truss rod was installed in the neck.|$|R
5000|$|Vasquez's first comic, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, ran {{for seven}} issues and was {{collected}} as a hardcover and a trade paperback book, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut. The cover features the logo [...] "Z?", meaning [...] "question sleep", which appears frequently throughout Vasquez's work and relates to his characters' insomnia {{and his own}} hypnophobia. The series follows Johnny as he searches for meaning in his life, a quest that frequently leads to the violent deaths of those around him as well as, briefly, his own. A photograph of one of Vasquez's friends, Leah England, serves as {{the middle of a}} portrait collection on the cover for the second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. England also gave Vasquez the inspiration for a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> about a child who was dangerously afraid of losing sight of his mother, as well as the notorious [...] "Meanwhile" [...] filler piece in the second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. Vasquez's next project was The Bad Art Collection, a 16-page one-shot comic. He stated that he did the book's art while {{he was in high school}} to discourage classmates from asking him to draw for them.|$|R
30|$|We created 100 {{sequences}} 5 – 7 {{panels in}} length using wordless images from The Complete Peanuts by Charles Schulz (1952 – 1974), as in prior research (e.g., Cohn et al., 2014; Cohn & Maher, 2015; Cohn, Paczynski, et al., 2012 a). Sequences began {{with at least}} one panel introducing both characters within the same spatial environment, as in Fig.  3. Congruous Non-Conjunction (CNC) sequences then showed both characters again in an initiating state (Initial), followed by a critical panel “zooming in” on only the second character (Fig.  3 a). Congruous Conjunction (CC) sequences divided this Initial panel, by showing the first character in one panel and the second character in the subsequent critical panel (Fig.  3 b). Incongruous sequences started by substituting a different character for the one ultimately appearing in the critical panel. Incongruous Non-Conjunction (INC) sequences began with different characters, which then changed in the critical panel (Fig.  3 c), while Incongruous Conjunction (IC) sequences began with two characters, showed the first character, and then switched in the critical panel (Fig.  3 d). Thus, the same critical panels appeared across all sequence types, either at the third or fourth position in the sequence. Sequences were counterbalanced in a Latin Square Design into four lists such that no list repeated <b>strips.</b> One hundred <b>filler</b> sequences featured varying degrees of coherence to further increase the heterogeneity of the stimuli and reduce the possibility of participants detecting our experimental manipulations.|$|R
