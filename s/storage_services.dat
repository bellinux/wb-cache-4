5|$|The {{economy of}} the Croatian Littoral is largely {{centered}} on the city of Rijeka, whose economic impact is felt directly {{not only in the}} geographic region, but also in other parts of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County—Gorski Kotar and Liburnia (modern region)—and a substantial part of Lika-Senj County. The most significant economic activities in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County are transport, largely based on activities of the Port of Rijeka, shipbuilding and tourism in the coastal areas representing a part of the Northern Croatian Littoral, and forestry and wood processing in the Gorski Kotar region in the hinterland. In the city of Rijeka itself, the most significant economic activities are civil engineering, wholesale and retail trade, transport and <b>storage</b> <b>services,</b> and the processing industry. Tourism, wood processing, and agriculture are the predominant economic activities in Lika-Senj County, where nearly all businesses are small and medium enterprisess.|$|E

25|$|The slowing {{sales growth}} was {{attributed}} to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as <b>storage,</b> <b>services</b> and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs, but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.|$|E
25|$|This {{valuation}} mode {{is typically}} used to value regulated storage, for instance storage operated by interstate pipeline companies. These companies are regulated by FERC. This pricing method allows the developers to recover their cost and an agreed upon return on investment. The regulatory body {{requires that the}} rates and tariffs are maintained and publicly published. The services provided by these companies include firm and interruptible storage as well as no-notice <b>storage</b> <b>services.</b> Usually, cost of service pricing is used for depleted reservoir facilities. If {{it is used to}} price, say salt cavern formations, the cost would be very high, due to the high cost of development of such facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the city of Zagreb {{represents}} the bulk of the economy of Croatia proper. Its most significant components are wholesale and retail trade, accounting for 38.1% of the city's economic income, followed by the processing industry, encompassing 20.3% of the economy of Zagreb. Further industries, by income share, are the energy industry—the supply of electric power, natural gas, steam, and air conditioning (7.8%); information and communications (7.2%); civil engineering (5.4%), professional technical and scientific services (4.6%); financial services (4.5%); and transport and <b>storage</b> <b>services</b> (3.9%). These account for 91.8% of the total income of the city's economy. Small businesses generate 22% of the total income; 14.4% is attributed to medium enterprises and the rest to large companies. The {{economy of the}} Zagreb County, largely contiguous with Zagreb's metropolitan area, is dominated by wholesale and retail trade (53.5% of total income) and the processing industry (25.7%), followed by transport (6.1%) and civil engineering (5.3%).

2500|$|Following {{the launch}} of the service, Google Drive privacy policy was heavily criticized by some members of the media. Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy {{agreements}} that cover all of its services, meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce, use, and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive. While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights, privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the rights to use the information and data to customize advertising and other services Google provides. In contrast, other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud <b>storage</b> <b>services,</b> but that the competition uses [...] "more artful language" [...] in the agreements, and also stated that Google needs the rights in order to [...] "move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails".|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{announcement}} in April 2012, Google faced criticism over Google Drive privacy. In particular, privacy advocates {{have noted that}} Google has one unified set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements for all its products and services. In a CNET report, Zack Whittaker noted that [...] "the terms and service have come under heavy fire by the wider community for how it handles users' copyright and intellectual property rights". In a comparison of Terms of Service agreements between Google Drive and competing cloud <b>storage</b> <b>services</b> Dropbox and OneDrive, he cited a paragraph stating that Google has broad rights to reproduce, use, and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive, via a license from its users. Although the user retains intellectual property rights, the user licenses Google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize advertising and other services that Google provides to the user, and to promote the service. Summarized, he wrote that [...] "According to its terms, Google does not own user-uploaded files to Google Drive, but the company can do whatever it likes with them". In a highly critical editorial of the service, Ed Bott of ZDNet wrote that language in the agreements contained [...] "exact same words" [...] as Dropbox used in a July 2011 Privacy Policy update that sparked criticism and forced Dropbox to update its policy once again with clarifying language, adding that [...] "It's {{a perfect example of}} Google's inability to pay even the slightest bit of attention to anything that happens outside the Googleplex". Matt Peckham of Time criticized the lack of unique service agreements for Drive, writing that [...] "If any Google service warrants privacy firewalling, it’s Google Drive. This isn’t YouTube or Calendar or even Gmail——the potential for someone’s most sensitive data to be snooped, whether to glean info for marketing or otherwise, is too high. [...] Google ought to create a privacy exception that “narrows the scope” of its service terms for Google Drive, one that minimally states the company will never circulate the information generated from searching [...] your G-Drive data in any way." ...|$|E
