Some {{people in the}} great city, aware of this {{cavalier}} <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceeding</b> {{on the part of}} Time and Tide, took advantage of both, and scaled the pinnacled heights of society.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} the disruptive effect <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime action on criminal activity, and to identify factors associated with successful <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime action. Executive summary Illicit drug trafficking {{is a source of}} funds for further trafficking and for supporting the lifestyles of criminals. Drug trafficking has been closely linked with organised crime and with social harms. This project had two main aims: • To identify the disruptive effect <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime action on criminal activity. The project attempted to measure the disruptive effect by developing an economic model that estimated the multiplier impact of the reinvestment of the profits of drug trafficking. • The project also attempted to identify factors associated with successful <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime action. There are two main audiences for the findings of this study. Senior police, police intelligence, policymakers and researchers will be interested primarily in measuring the disruptive effect <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime action. Police responsible for managing <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime investigations and senior investigators will be interested in the practical applications of findings relating to success factors in financial investigations. The results of the project should improve agencies’ ability to target trafficking and increase the seizure <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime. The proposed index of the disruptive effect <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime action—the <b>Proceeds</b> <b>of</b> Crime Drug Disruption Index (POCDDI) —will also allow agencies to provide both the Government and the community with a more accurate assessment of the value <b>of</b> their <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> crime initiatives...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis essay aims at {{proposing a}} "philosophically important" form of {{scientific}} pluralism that captures essential features of contemporary scientific pratice largely {{ignored by the}} various forms of scientific pluralism currently discussed by philosophers. My starting point is Hacking's concept <b>of</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> scientific reasoning, with a focus on its ontological import. I extend Hacking's thesis by proposing the process of "ontological enrichment" to grasp how the objects created by a style articulate with the common objects of scientific inquiry "out there in the world". The result is "foliated pluralism", which puts to the fore the transdisciplinary and cumulative ways <b>of</b> <b>proceeding</b> in science, as well as the historical dimension of the genesis of scientific objects...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the intended use <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> on bank underwriters’ certification roles in Japan following deregulation in　 1999. We find that bank underwriters {{have a positive effect on}}　announcement returns. However, when the issuer discloses that the intended use <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> is repayment, the bank underwriter has no effect on the announcement returns. Although banks’ holding loans have a positive effect on announcement returns, banks’ equity holdings are negatively associated with the announcement return. Furthermore, issuers underwritten by banks whose use <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> is loan repayment are more likely to be weak in their ex-post performance than those without repayment. We conclude that banks have different effects on issuers according to the intended use <b>of</b> <b>proceeds</b> and the banks’ characteristics...|$|R
