50|$|A {{compression}} <b>seal</b> <b>fitting,</b> unlike an {{epoxy seal}} or gasket, uses mechanical components and an axial force to compress a soft sealant inside a body which then creates a seal. An epoxy seal differs {{in that it}} is composed of some type of compound which is poured into a mold in an attempt to create a seal.|$|E
50|$|A single {{compression}} <b>seal</b> <b>fitting</b> may seal {{on a single}} or multiple elements. Sealing glands designed to seal on single elements consist of a body, cap, sealant and follower. When sealing on multiple elements, gland designs also include a seat and an anti-rotation pin to prevent wires or conductors from twisting and shearing. One or more insulators may also be included when electrical isolation is required.|$|E
50|$|For ICCP on ships, the anodes {{are usually}} {{constructed}} {{of a relatively}} inert material such as platinised titanium. A DC power supply is provided within the ship and the anodes mounted {{on the outside of}} the hull. The anode cables are introduced into the ship via a compression <b>seal</b> <b>fitting</b> and routed to the DC power source. The negative cable from the power supply is simply attached to the hull to complete the circuit. Ship ICCP anodes are flush-mounted, minimizing the effects of drag on the ship, and located a minimum 5 ft below the light load line in an area to avoid mechanical damage. The current density required for protection is a function of velocity and considered when selecting the current capacity and location of anode placement on the hull.|$|E

5000|$|Simplicity is {{maintained}} through usage of a single, two-directional path for the solution. Water flows {{in and out}} using the same tube. When the pump has raised water into the tray, briefly submerging the roots, the pump is rendered inactive using a switch, typically a timer, and the water flows back down the same tube. This {{eliminates the need for}} more than one <b>sealed</b> <b>fitting</b> and reduces overall complexity of the system.|$|R
50|$|Compression {{fittings}} are {{the industry}} standard for chemical, oil and gas, R&D, Bio-tech, and the semiconductor industry. They are used because {{of their ability to}} provide leak-tight <b>seals.</b> These <b>fittings</b> can be remade.|$|R

50|$|Some {{complications}} from wood deterioration {{can be solved}} through tight <b>fitting</b> <b>seals</b> around windows and doors, gutter systems, caulking of seams and joints, and sloping away of decking from the structure. Regular cleaning of the surface may also help reduce accumulated residues on the wood thereby prolonging its usable life. The most common treatment for replacing degraded wood {{is to use a}} splicing technique where new pieces of wood are joined with original wood features. For severe cases, large in-kind replacements may be necessary.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method used}} is {{referred}} to as electrofusion. Electrofusion is a method of joining HDPE and other plastic pipes with special fittings that have built-in resistive wire which is used to weld the joint together. The pipes to be joined are trimmed, cleaned, inserted into the electrofusion fitting (with a temporary clamp if required) and a voltage (typically 40V) is applied using a device called an electrofusion processor. The processor controls how much voltage is applied, and for how long, depending on the fitting in use. As current is applied to the resistive wire, the coils heat up and melt the inside of the fitting and the outside of the pipe wall which weld together producing a very strong homogeneous joint. The assembly is then left to cool for a specified time. The joints produced tend to be more reliable than threaded <b>fittings</b> <b>sealed</b> with O-rings.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the aquatic eddy {{correlation}} (EC) technique {{has proven to}} be a powerful approach for non-invasive measurements of oxygen fluxes across the sediment water interface. Fundamental to the EC approach is the correlation of turbulent velocity and oxygen concentration fluctuations measured with high frequencies in the same sampling volume. Oxygen concentrations are commonly measured with fast responding electrochemical microsensors. However, due to their own oxygen consumption, electrochemical microsensors are sensitive to changes of the diffusive boundary layer surrounding the probe and thus to changes in the ambient flow velocity. The so-called stirring sensitivity of microsensors constitutes an inherent correlation of flow velocity and oxygen sensing and thus an artificial flux which can confound the benthic flux determination. To assess the artificial flux we measured the correlation between the turbulent flow velocity and the signal of oxygen microsensors in a sealed annular flume without any oxygen sinks and sources. Experiments revealed significant correlations, even for sensors designed to have low stirring sensitivities of ~ 0. 7 %. The artificial fluxes depended on ambient flow conditions and, counter intuitively, increased at higher velocities because of the nonlinear contribution of turbulent velocity fluctuations. The measured artificial fluxes ranged from 2 - 70 mmol m**- 2 d**- 1 for weak and very strong turbulent flow, respectively. Further, the stirring sensitivity depended on the sensor orientation towards the flow. Optical microsensors (optodes) that should not exhibit a stirring sensitivity were tested in parallel and did not show any significant correlation between O 2 signals and turbulent flow. In conclusion, EC data obtained with electrochemical sensors can be affected by artificial flux and we recommend using optical microsensors in future EC-studies. Flume experiments were conducted in February 2013 at the Institute for Environmental Sciences, University of Koblenz-Landau Landau. Experiments were performed in a closed oval-shaped acrylic glass flume with cross-sectional width of 4 cm and height of 10 cm and total length of 54 cm. The fluid flow was induced by a propeller driven by a motor and mean flow velocities of up to 20 cm s- 1 were generated by applying voltages between 0 V and 4 V DC. The flume was completely sealed with an acrylic glass cover. Oxygen sensors were inserted through rubber <b>seal</b> <b>fittings</b> and allowed positioning the sensors with inclinations to the main flow direction of ~ 60 °, ~ 95 ° and ~ 135 °. A Clark type electrochemical O 2 microsensor with a low stirring sensitivity (0. 7 %) was tested and a fast-responding needle-type O 2 optode (PyroScience GmbH, Germany) was used as reference as optodes should not be stirring sensitive. Instantaneous three-dimensional flow velocities were measured at 7. 4 Hz using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV). The velocity at the sensor tip was extracted. The correlation of the fluctuating O 2 sensor signals and the fluctuating velocities was quantified with a cross-correlation analysis. A significant cross-correlation is equivalent to a significant artificial flux. For a total of 18 experiments the flow velocity was adjusted between 1. 7 and 19. 2 cm s**- 1, and 3 different orientations of the electrochemical sensor were tested with inclination angles of ~ 60 °, ~ 95 ° and ~ 135 ° with respect to the main flow direction. In experiments 16 - 18, wavelike flow was induced, whereas in all other experiments the motor was driven by constant voltages. In 7 experiments, O 2 was additionally measured by optodes. Although performed simultaneously with the electrochemical sensor, optode measurements are listed as separate experiments (denoted by the attached 'op' in the filename), because the velocity time series was extracted at the optode tip, located at a different position in the flume...|$|R

The problem faced is the damage that often occurs suddenly on the blowmould machine so that corrective maintenance must be done. The purpose of this research is to know the cause of the damage and to propose the action plan to minimize downtime. The method used is Reliability Centered Maintenance to determine the selection of action and time interval of replacement for critical components on the blowmould machine. From the FMEA analysis, it is known that the critical components of each blowmould machine subsystem are bearing roller feed, mandrel, <b>seal</b> gasket, and <b>fitting.</b> The results of LTA analysis are the category of failure (outage problem and economic problem) and the selection of action for the critical component (time directed).

5000|$|For the {{technology}} it developed itself between 2009 and 2011, {{the company has}} lodged several registered designs and patents in diverse regions and countries. These all share the aim: Reduction of noise in addition to optimizing the operation in cooling and power supply components. One example is the “technology of aerodynamically optimized surface texture” as used in other industrial applications to reduce operational noise and improve airflow. This technology is applied to all be quiet! fans. The case fan series Silent Wings 2 and Shadow Wings have a further example of patented technology known as “anti-vibration mounts” that not only simplify the fitting and dampen the overall vibration, but also offer a flexible choice of mounting according to application. Another such technology {{is known as the}} “fan damping assembly” that reduces vibration with a rubber <b>seal,</b> simplifies the <b>fitting</b> procedures, and so significantly reduces the assembly time needed.In addition, the company has registered another invention for a “device to anchor the fan” on the CPU cooler as a utility model. This facilitates the fitting, because the device clamps easily to the exterior of the heat sink. The bracing against the heat sink serves to absorb the fan vibrations well and so inhibits the generation of noise. The company also has a registered utility model for the [...] "connector angular setting" [...] for the cables of its power supply products. This special technology enables the setting and adjustment of the outlet cable angle, to suit the installation sites in differing PC configurations. This makes for tidy routing of the cables and improves the air circulation in the casing.|$|R
60|$|Thus questioned, {{the widow}} cheerfully opened her stores of knowledge. As she {{proceeded}} in her {{account of the}} secret conferences between Deacon Pratt and her late inmate, her zeal became quickened, and she omitted nothing that she had ever heard, besides including a great deal {{that she had not}} heard. But her companion was accustomed to such narratives, and knew reasonably well how to make allowances. He listened with a determination not to believe more than half of what she said, and by dint of long experience, he succeeded in separating the credible portions of the woman's almost breathless accounts, from those that ought to have been regarded as incredible, with a surprising degree of success. The greatest difficulty in the way of comprehending the Widow White's report, arose from {{the fact that she had}} altogether missed the preliminary and most explicit conference. This left so much to be understood and inferred, that, in her own efforts to supply the deficiencies, she made a great deal of confusion in the statements. Captain Daggett was fully assured that the deacon knew of the existence of the sealing-island, at least; though he was in doubt whether the rumour that had been brought to him, touching the buried treasure, had also been imparted to this person.
