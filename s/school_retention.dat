25|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{levelled}} against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting {{a wide range of}} social reforms during its time in office. Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, Neville Wran, John Dawkins, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of Medibank, under the new name Medicare, these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in <b>school</b> <b>retention</b> rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, {{the development of a new}} youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions. As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government. In 1989, the Hawke Labor Government gradually re-introducing fees for university study. It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS), which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University, Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins (see Dawkins Revolution). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means. The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today, though with a number of changes.|$|E

Further results provided evidence for the factorial and the convergent validity of the single-factor structure of the DVBS, which has also shown good internal consistency. Criterion validity was evaluated through the association with related variables, such as age and school failure, as well as the scale’s ability to capture group differences, namely between genders and <b>school</b> <b>retentions,</b> and finally by comparing a sub-group of convicted adolescents with a group of non-convicted ones regarding their engagement in delinquent activities.

30|$|In general early {{cognitive}} development {{is one of}} the major factors that determine school performance and progress at a later stage in life. There is a strong association between early childhood factors and primary school performance and progress: it has been demonstrated that children who have participated in early childhood education and related programmes generally remain in school, are unlikely to repeat classes and their class performance is much better compared to those who have never attended pre-primary programmes. In sub-Sahara Africa not many pupils complete their primary school and <b>school</b> <b>retention</b> is generally a major challenge. In Lesotho only 60 % of the children who start school survive till Grade 7 (Department of Education, OSISA and UNESCO 2007).

40|$|Retaining {{students}} in elective class music programmes {{is an issue}} in many secondary <b>schools.</b> <b>Retention</b> is particularly problematic among lower secondary students. Eccles (2005) states that the subjective task values students attach to learning activities in any elective subject are key indicators of future enrolment decisions. Accordingly, this article reports on a study which utilized subjective task values as a theoretical foundation for investigating why many students drop out of elective class music programmes at this early stage. Specifically, the article reports on a study into students’ valuing of class music learning activities in Western Australia. Participating students were {{in their first year}} at secondary school (age 12 – 13 years), and their values for class music learning activities were measured at the start and end of the academic year. Findings revealed a decline in all values components, particularly situational intrinsic value, mirroring declines reported across other subjects among students of this age. Given criticism of the theoretical frameworks and methodologies associated with much past research into retention in music education, this study promotes subjective task values as a valid and reliable framework for progressing research in the field of class music. The article briefly synthesizes recommendations for enhancing student task values drawn from the general motivational literature with the finding of this study, and concludes by considering issues and possible directions for future research...|$|R
