5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the normal state for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. Most adults who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E

5|$|But strategically, Smith {{was most}} {{associated}} with his implementation of John McLendon's four corners offense, {{a strategy for}} stalling with a lead {{near the end of}} the game. Smith's teams executed the four corners set <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball-control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented the four corners offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball: Multiple Offense and Defense, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota drove 71 {{yards on}} its first possession, scored the game's first points on a 27-yard field goal by Adam Bailey and led 3–0 after one quarter. After the opening drive, Michigan's defense shut down the Golden Gophers, {{allowing}} only 33 yards of total offense {{in the remainder of}} the game. Minnesota was held to 10 yards of total offense in the entire second half, as Michigan extended its fourth-quarter shutout to 8 games. Michigan also held its opponent without a touchdown for the fifth time in 8 games and shut down Minnesota <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> that Michigan started four drives in Minnesota territory in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties <b>so</b> <b>effectively,</b> and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E
5|$|Manuel campaigned aggressively {{against his}} {{neighbours}} {{both in the}} west and in the east; facing Muslims in Palestine, he allied himself with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and sent a large fleet to participate in a combined invasion of Fatimid Egypt. In an effort to restore Byzantine control over the ports of southern Italy, he sent an expedition to invade Italy in 1155. Operating as part of a coalition of Byzantine, rebel, and Papal forces, Manuel's armies achieved initial success. However, disputes within the coalition led to the expedition's eventual failure. Despite this military setback Manuel was undeterred, and his armies successfully invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1167, defeating the Hungarians at the Battle of Sirmium. He was highly successful in the Balkans and Hungary; historian Paul Magdalino argues that no emperor had dominated the region <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> since Late Antiquity.|$|E

5|$|Monotype {{licensed}} {{and released}} the font Centaur {{around the same}} time as Bembo. It was drawn by the American book designer Bruce Rogers. Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo, the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 (the so-called Venetian style). Like Bembo, its italic (by Frederic Warde) comes from the 1520s, being again loosely {{based on the work of}} Arrighi from around 1520. Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure, something particularly true in its digital facsimile. Penguin often used it for headings and titles of 'classic' editions, particularly its capitals and italic; its lower-case does not <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> harmonise with Bembo due to the different letter shapes such as the tilted 'e'.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, the KPA's 5th Division entered Yongdok, {{taking the}} city without much {{resistance}} before fierce UN air attacks caused the division heavy losses. Still, {{it was able}} to surround the ROK 3rd Division in the city. By now, the 5th Division and the 766th Regiment had been reduced to a combined strength of 7,500 men to the ROK 3rd Divisions' 6,469. The 766th massed its force again to assist the 5th Division in surrounding and besieging the ROK 3rd Division, which was trapped in the city. The 3rd Division, in the meantime, was ordered to remain in the city to delay the North Koreans as long as possible. It was eventually evacuated by sea after delaying North Korean forces for a considerable time. The rugged terrain of the mountains prevented the North Korean forces from conducting the enveloping maneuvers they had used <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> against other troops, and their advantages in numbers and equipment had been negated in the fight.|$|E
5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Conquistadors, Chamberlain {{successfully}} went into business and entertainment, made money {{in stocks and}} real estate, bought a popular Harlem nightclub, which he renamed Big Wilt's Smalls Paradise, and invested in broodmares. Chamberlain also sponsored his personal professional volleyball and track and field teams, and also provided high-level teams for girls and women in basketball, track, volleyball and softball, and made money by appearing in ads for TWA, American Express, Volkswagen, Drexel Burnham, Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker. After his basketball career, volleyball became Chamberlain's new passion: being a talented hobby volleyballer during his Lakers days, he became {{board member of the}} newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became its president one year later. As a testament to his importance, the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it: he rose to the challenge and was named the game's MVP. He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979. Chamberlain promoted the sport <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame: {{he became one of the}} few athletes who were enshrined in different sports.|$|E

25|$|In anoxic sediments {{uncontaminated}} {{by heavy}} metals, the associated metal (M in equation 2) is usually iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn). Iron (II) is abundant in anoxic sediment, and the Ksp for iron (II) sulfide is 10−22.39 (with a comparable value for manganese (II) sulfide), <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> all the sulfide in an uncontaminated sediment will be bound to Fe or Mn.|$|E

This tragedy of the commons provokes a capitalization process that leads them to increase their costs until they are equal to their revenue, dissipating their rent completely.|$|E
25|$|The Normans {{also were}} {{fortunate}} to have leaders of the calibre of the Butler, Marshall, de Lyvet (Levett), de Burgh, de Lacy and de Braose families, as well as having the dynamic heads of the first families. Another factor was that after the loss of Normandy in 1204, John {{had a lot more}} time to devote to Irish affairs, and did <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> even from afar.|$|E
25|$|As an {{acoustic}} guitar player, Ashley’s technique is unusual. He plays a right-handed guitar, left-handed, without changing the strings, {{in the manner}} of Elizabeth Cotten. <b>So,</b> <b>effectively,</b> the instrument is played upside-down. As well as using standard tuning he utilises a number of guitar tunings. He also plays a custom-built electric four-string bouzouki. This unique instrument was designed to include a left-hand cutaway, and giving left-hand access to controls, but is once again strung as a right-handed instrument.|$|E

25|$|His thirty chansons show a {{diversity}} of style, some being akin to the late Burgundian style (for example, as seen in Hayne van Ghizeghem or Gilles Binchois), and others using a more current imitative polyphonic style. Since La Rue never spent time in Italy, he never picked up the Italian frottola style which featured light, homophonic textures (which Josquin used <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> in his popular El Grillo and Scaramella), and which so charmed {{the other members of}} his generation.|$|E
25|$|These {{first two}} records were {{produced}} by John Simon, who was practically a group member: he aided in arrangements and played occasional instruments (piano or tuba). Simon {{reported that he}} was often asked about the distinctive horn sections featured <b>so</b> <b>effectively</b> {{on the first two}} albums: people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively utilizing their limited technique.|$|E
25|$|The Western {{forces were}} officially {{supposed}} {{to occupy the}} old Empire, but rarely had enough troops to do <b>so</b> <b>effectively.</b> They {{had to deal with}} local authorities who had their own agenda to fulfill.
