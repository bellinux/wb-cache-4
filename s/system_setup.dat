Although Rippy used Wwise's tools only for dynamic music, they made audio <b>system</b> <b>setup</b> much easier than in previous Ensemble games. For each battle sequence, the musical cue was divided into sections and mixed differently for each section. [...] "When a cue is triggered, an intro plays and then the game randomly picks between all of those elements {{for as long as}} the battle continues," [...] Rippy explained. [...] "Once it's over, an outro plays and then it's back to the regular [...] "world" [...] music. It was an interesting way to work, and I'd like to push it further if there's an opportunity in the future." ...|$|E

And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but {{a laundry list of}} bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential." [...] He praised the single-player campaign and the storyline. However, he cited numerous bugs, including no support for Windows 95, despite the box claiming otherwise, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. He was also critical of the absence of Vengeance, despite the box stating it was included, and the fact that multiplayer mode had only five maps and no TCP/IP support. He concluded [...] "If you need your new Myth fix and can't wait for a patch, then the best option is to buy the game from a store that accepts returns in case the game doesn't like your particular <b>system</b> <b>setup.</b> If you can play it, focus your efforts on the campaign - it's fun, {{and for the most part}} works as advertised. Hopefully, by the time you are finished with Connacht's tale, a patch to fix the many multiplayer issues will be ready." ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the M/G/k queueing <b>system</b> with <b>setup</b> times.

While recent literature has analyzed the M/M/k <b>system</b> with exponential <b>setup</b> times, no closedform solutions were obtained. We provide the first analytical closed form expressions for the mean response time, limiting distribution of the system states, as well as the z-transform for the number of jobs in system for the M/M/k <b>system</b> with exponential <b>setup</b> times. In particular, we prove the following decomposition property: the mean response time of the M/M/k <b>system</b> with exponential <b>setup</b> times differs from the mean response time of an M/M/k <b>system</b> without <b>setup</b> times, by a constant factor, which is the mean of the exponential setup time.
