According to A C Lovesey, {{who was in charge}} of the Merlin's development, [...] "The impression still prevails that the static capacity known as the <b>swept</b> <b>volume</b> is the basis of comparison of the possible power output for different types of engine, but this is not the case because the output of the engine depends solely on the mass of air it can be made to consume efficiently, and in this respect the supercharger plays the most important role." ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{graphical}} objects {{can be represented}} by <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> (including its subset â€“ generalised cylinders) by sweeping 2 D or 3 D templates along 3 D trajectories. In this paper, we present a new approach for constructing <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> using image templates. We utilise scalar fields as our underlying data type, and employ volume ray casting techniques for rendering <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> in their original sweeping specifications {{as well as in}} their voxelised approximations. In addition to some simple image-swept volumes, we also treat multi-channel image templates, video templates, generalised sweeps, and self-intersecting trajectories. This approach enables us to model <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> with heterogeneous interiors and amorphous effects. It also facilitates the use of constructive volume geometry for creating complex scenes in both modelling and rendering space...|$|R
40|$|Fluid flows {{occurring}} in moving and/or deforming environments {{are influenced by}} the transient nature of their containment. In Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), simulating such flow fields requires effort to maintain the geometric integrity of the transient flow domain. Convective fluxes in such domains are evaluated with respect to the motion of the boundaries of the control volume. These simulations demand conservation of space in addition to the conservation of mass, momentum and energy as the solution continues in time. The Space Conservation Law in its continuous form can be inferred by using the rules of fundamental calculus. However, implementing it in a discrete form poses substantial challenges. During mesh motion, the surfaces enclosing the control volumes sweep through three-dimensional space. As per the Space Conservation Law, the change in the control volume has to match the sum of the <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> of all its faces exactly. The Space Conservation Law must be satisfied accurately and consistently {{in order to avoid the}} occurrence of non-physical masses and to prevent the violation of the continuity equation. In this work we have attempted to address the consistency issues surrounding the implementation of the Space Conservation Law in OpenFOAM. The existing method for calculation of <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> falls short in terms of consistency. Moreover, its capabilities are limited when it comes to complex three-dimensional mesh motions. The existing method of calculation treats <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> as net fluxes emanating from cell faces. We have implemented an alternate algorithm in which the <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> are treated as intermittent virtual cells whose volumes can be calculated in a unique and consistent manner. We will conclude by validating our approach for mesh motions of varying degrees of complexity...|$|R

It adopted some of the L2 features, having twin exhaust and inlet valves in each cylinderdriven by an overhead camshaft, twin spark plugs and twin magnetos. [...] The splash component of the L2's lubrication was abandoned in favour of a completely forced recirculating system.

2500|$|Increases in bore {{and stroke}} gave the D.4 {{more than twice the}} <b>swept</b> <b>volume</b> of the C.4 and roughly doubled its power. The cast-steel cylinders, {{individually}} machined inside and out, were mounted separately onto a flat-sided aluminium crankcase. They were fastened down by long bolts between them, which reached into the crankcase to support the four inner crankshaft bearings. The main bearings were in the crankcase ends, and the ball race was designed to allow either pusher or tractor operation. A flywheel was fitted to the output shaft. Thin cylindrical copper water jackets surrounded the cylinders almost to their base, where a rubber ring, located by a circumferential groove in the cylinder, provided a sliding water seal that allowed for the differential thermal contraction of copper and steel. [...] Cooling water was fed to these jackets by an engine-driven pump via a horizontal tube on the low right side of the engine, assuming a tractor orientation, and fed to the radiator by another tube on the top left.|$|E
2500|$|Fiat's {{interest}} in Diesel engines dated from 1907, initially focused on slow turning factory engines then moving to higher speed marine and railway motors. [...] The AN.1 {{was their first}} foray into Diesel aero-engines. To shorten its development time and {{to concentrate on the}} higher combustion chamber pressures, different burning temperatures and fuel supply systems of the Diesel cycle, they based its design on the Fiat A.12. [...] This was a petrol engine first run in 1916 and produced in large numbers during World War I, a water-cooled, upright, overhead camshaft straight six. The AN.1 kept the external dimensions and the lower section, crankshaft, crankcase, sump, plus the lubrication and water-cooling supplies of the older engine but required new cylinders, pistons, valve gear and fuel delivery systems to replace carburettors and magnetos. The cylinder barrels had to be stronger to withstand the greater combustion pressures (2-300 atmospheres) required by the compression ignition Diesel. The <b>swept</b> <b>volume</b> of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140mm (5.51in), compared with the A.12's 160mm (6.30in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall vertical rod used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom.|$|E

Asakawa (2005) has extended a general derivation of the moments to include three-dimensional, heterogeneous reservoirs including naturally fractured reservoirs. In simplest form, the <b>swept</b> pore <b>volume</b> is determined from the mean residence volume of a conservative tracer. For a tracer injected as a slug, the mean residence volume is also determined from tracer concentration histories at the production well.|$|R

40|$|Two wheels {{vehicles}} for city use {{are common in}} Europe and particularly in Italy. In {{the last ten years}} a new concept of motorcycle has been introduced on the market: maxi-scooters. Maxi-scooters represent an evolution of the small size engine scooters (from 50 to 125 cc) that were created in the 50 s for city use. In the last decade the market turned to bigger <b>swept</b> <b>volumes,</b> such as 250 and 500 cc. This category of motorcycles is aimed to a richer and more adult market, which needs a pleasant design, riding comfort and stability at higher speed. On the other hand, such {{vehicles for}} city use are passing a critical moment in terms of development of the engines, because of the stricter limits imposed by the environmental regulations and for the consequent and significant effects on performance. Road tests are no longer sufficient to reach optimal performance and the aerodynamic data of actual scooters with <b>swept</b> <b>volumes</b> over 250 cc need to be isolated, reproduced and measured in a wind tunnel. A wind tunnel and balance facility for motorcycle aerodynamic investigation, developed at the University of Perugia, is described in this paper. The development of the wind tunnel experimental set-up results from a research project between the University of Perugia and Piaggio S. p. A., one of the European leaders in scooters industry.

40|$|Gouge {{checking}} and gouge measuring are essential parts of 5 -axis tool-positioning strategies. To evaluate {{the quality of}} a tool path (i. e. the remaining material, commonly referred to as cusps), machining tests must usually be performed. If the tests prove to be unsatisfactory, new tool paths must be generated and run. In this paper, a new approach for modeling cusps is presented which makes use of recent advances in vector algebraic computation of <b>swept</b> <b>volumes.</b> The method uses the computerâ€™s graphics card to compute the cusp geometry from the <b>swept</b> <b>volumes.</b> The algorithm was verified with a machining test by measuring the cusp height between two adjacent passes with a Coordinate Measuring Machine and comparing it to the modeled cusp height. machining, modeling the surface that will be generated by a tool path is more difficult than for 3 -axis. The simplicity of 3 -axis machining allows for the development of simplified algorithms to compute and visualize the surface resulting from a tool path. Unfortunately, these simplifications cannot easily be generalized to 5 -axis tool motion. Gouge {{checking and}} measuring for 5 -axis tool paths has been a widely researched area [13]. However, gouge checking only measures the error of a tool path and does not measure its quality. To determine the quality, researchers usually perform a machining test to measure cusp heights (the material remaining on the workpiece between adjacent passes of the tool). If the test proves to be unsatisfactory, the researcher must compute new tool paths adding more tool passes and perform a new machining test. byCategories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
