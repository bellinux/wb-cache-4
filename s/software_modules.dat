25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for <b>software)</b> <b>modules,</b> and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E

40|$|The {{fuzzy logic}} model for {{information}} processing is improved in the thesis. Fuzzy knowledge base {{representation in the}} form of a metagraph, the algorithms for metagraph construction, numbering metagraph vertices, finding necessary metagraph?s part and fuzzy inference based on metagraph are proposed. The requirements for structure of metagraph corresponding to non-redundant, linguistic non-contradicted and linguistic complete fuzzy knowledge base are defined. Fuzzy knowledge base properties static verification based on metagraph structure analysis is proposed. The thesis describes the method for metagraph and hierarchical metagraph visualization based on the principles of force-directed algorithms. The information technology for based on metagraph fuzzy knowledge base development and usage is described. This technology includes improved model, developed methods and algorithms. The proposed technology includes tools for fuzzy knowledge base development and usage for complex object evaluation. It includes <b>software</b> <b>module</b> to create and edit based on metagraph fuzzy knowledge base, <b>software</b> <b>module</b> to visualize metagraph, <b>software</b> <b>module</b> for fuzzy knowledge base static verification, <b>software</b> <b>module</b> for based on metagraph fuzzy inference, <b>software</b> <b>module</b> to work with databases. ??????????????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ? ???????? ????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????? ?????????? ?? ????? ???????? ??????

500|$|Begun {{with a crew}} of five, {{the project}} grew to a staff of 17. The game's code was built from scratch. Most of the <b>software</b> <b>modules</b> were {{interlinked}} with each other, increasing the job's complexity and difficulty. The code incorporated small portions of Descents code for specific functions. Kulas, who had worked on several versions of Flight Simulator and Descent, brought his experience into the game's artificial intelligence (AI). The game's difficulty levels are based on advancing the enemy AI, rather than simply increasing damage and [...] "hit points" [...] of enemies. Some realism was incorporated into the game's physics, such that an impact on {{one part of a}} starfighter's body will send it spinning appropriately, unlike sphere-based collision detection, in which an impact would simply 'push' the starfighter in a particular direction. Due to time and budget constraints, many of the initially planned cutscenes and stories were cut from the final product. Examples of such cuts include a campaign path where the Terran-Vasudan alliance goes on a retreat, and scenes of racial tension within the alliance. Despite the promise of a deathmatch mode for multiplayer, it was cut from the final product. The expansion Silent Threat also suffered the same fate of cuts due to budgetary and time concerns.|$|E
