25|$|Like {{all other}} {{students}}, {{students with disabilities}} experience sexual harassment in school as both victims and perpetrators. Some disabilities could cause a lack of control over impulses, a lack of awareness {{of the effects of}} their words and actions, and a lack of social skills needed to avoid sexually harassing behavior. In some circumstances, a student with disabilities could exhibit a behavior that would constitute sexual harassment without intentionally trying to be malicious or inappropriate. In these cases, where a disability could lead to sexually harassing behaviors, positive behavior intervention plans are often put into place by a team often including parents, school administrators, general education teachers, <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> school psychologists, and counselors. These types of plans could also be made during Individualized Education Programmeetings regarding the student.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of an Ontario-developed online <b>Special</b> <b>Education</b> <b>teacher</b> training course {{as a model for}} in-service teacher professional development in China. The study employed a mixed method approach encompassing both a quantitative survey and a qualitative research component to gather perceptions of Chinese and Canadian teachers, educational administrators, and teacher-educators who have intensive experience with online <b>education,</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Education,</b> and <b>teacher</b> preparation programs both in China and Canada. The study revealed insufficient understanding of <b>Special</b> <b>Education</b> among the general Chinese population, underdevelopment of <b>Special</b> <b>Education</b> <b>teacher</b> preparation in China, and potential benefits of using a Canadian online teacher training course as a model for <b>Special</b> <b>Education</b> in China. Based on the literature review and the results of this study, it is concluded that online Canadian <b>Special</b> <b>Education</b> <b>teacher</b> in-service courses can set an example for Chinese <b>Special</b> <b>Education</b> <b>teacher</b> training.

The median teacher salary was $54,714. The work day is 7 hours 45 minutes with a 30-minute duty-free lunch break and a duty-free prep period.

25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education. In 1993, Mexico passed an education law that called for the inclusion of those with disabilities. This law was very important for Mexico education, however, {{there have been}} issues in implementing it {{due to a lack of}} resources.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal classroom setting for those in need of special education. In the United States, it can cost between $6595 to $10,421 extra to educate a child with autism. In the 2011-2012 school year, {{the average cost of}} education for a public school student was $12,401. In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program that is well suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number of children with disabilities there are in the school. This combined with a shortage of licensed <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> has created a deficiency in the special education system. The shortage has caused some states to give temporary special education licenses to teachers with the caveat that they receive a license within a few years.|$|E

[...] For the most part, an ISD classroom operates independently {{from the rest of}} the school in which they are located. [...] The number of ISD classrooms a school has depends on the number of special education students within that school. [...] Most special education students do not leave their ISD classroom during the school day, except for lunch and to attend [...] "out" [...] classes, such as physical education, art, music, etc. [...] They may also go to a resource room for certain subjects in which the student is semi-proficient.

Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society.

The ECA study involved representative samples of American adults from five U.S. geographical areas, providing relatively unbiased estimates {{of the risk of}} mental disorder by occupation; however, because the data were cross-sectional, no conclusions bearing on cause-and-effect relations are warranted. [...] Evidence from a Canadian prospective study indicated that individuals in the highest quartile of occupational stress (high-strain jobs as per the demand-control model) are at increased risk of experiencing an episode of major depression. A meta-analysis that pooled the results of 11 well-designed longitudinal studies indicated that a number of facets of the psychosocial work environment (e.g., low decision latitude, high psychological workload, lack of social support at work, effort-reward imbalance, and job insecurity) increase the risk of common mental disorders such as depression.|$|E

40|$|In the {{bachelor}} thesis "A special educational teacher and his/her {{position in the}} educational system of the Czech republic" were elected headmasters of elementary schools in the region around Prachatice as a target group for the research. The theoretical part deals with legislative issues and qualifying conditions required for executing this occupation. This chapter also describes personal qualities and necessary skills of a <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher,</b> then his/her further specialization. A {{very important part of}} this chapter is dedicated to a person of a <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> at a primary school and his/her career system. The second chapter of the theoretical part individually describes the educational system in the Czech Republic with a focus on basic education. Then this part discusses alternative education forms at primary schools, education of pupils with SEN and inclusive, interactive education. The empirical part of the thesis is based on a research which was designed as the qualitative research. This research survey was conducted as a semi-structured interview with directors at primary schools around Prachatice. The interview was conducted with 9 of a total of 15 directors asked to participate in the research. Before the interview was conducted, the basic questions were set. Then the question were subsequently asked to all surveyed respondents and then they were asked some additional questions. The aim of the thesis was to find out how headmasters of elementary schools around Prachatice perceive the possible application of a <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> in their schools. Then, two research questions were formed: In what conditions would the headmasters of chosen schools think about hiring a <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> in their schools? What activities should the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> perform by an opinion of the headmasters? After analyzing respondent´s answers, the financial reasons appeared {{to be the most important}} when deciding about hiring, or not, a special educational teacher. All surveyed agreed that in their financial budgets there are currently no resources for implementing a position of the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher.</b> An increasing numbers of pupils with SEN would also have a significant influence on establishing this position. Then the respondents in their answers mentioned that the school <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> might be an appropriate solution for dealing with administrative issues connected with the new system of inclusive education what they understand to be a good reason for establishing the position of a <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> at their schools. The aim of the second research question was to find what particular activities the teachers should perform. Based on the analysis of the answers received it appeared that the surveyed headmasters had a less insight into this issue. The survey among respondents brings the conclusion that the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> should communicate with parents of pupils with SEN, create an IEP, SEP, then communicate with the school advisory department and he/she should do the administrative connected to the inclusive education. This bachelor thesis shall bring the comprehensive view of the person of a <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> on chosen schools around Prachatice. The work could also bring a closer overview of a character of the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> on chosen elementary schools around Prachatice. It should also bring closer the problematics of the system of <b>special</b> <b>education</b> in the Czech Republic, not even to students of the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> but also to parents of pupils with SEN. Then the thesis shall provide information about the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher</b> for headmasters of elementary school...|$|R
