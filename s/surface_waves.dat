5|$|Ocean <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by}} the drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} the water. This friction transfers energy and forms <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E
5|$|Waves are {{disturbances}} {{that carry}} energy as they move. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium – air or water, making it oscillate {{as they pass}} by. Wind waves are sea <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models. As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create dunes, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the Taklamakan desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.|$|E
25|$|In seismology, {{several types}} of <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> are encountered. <b>Surface</b> <b>waves,</b> in this {{mechanical}} sense, {{are commonly known as}} either Love waves (L waves) or Rayleigh waves. A seismic wave is a wave that travels through the Earth, often as the result of an earthquake or explosion. Love waves have transverse motion (movement is perpendicular to the direction of travel, like light waves), whereas Rayleigh waves have both longitudinal (movement parallel to the direction of travel, like sound waves) and transverse motion. Seismic waves are studied by seismologists and measured by a seismograph or seismometer. <b>Surface</b> <b>waves</b> span a wide frequency range, and the period of waves that are most damaging is usually 10 seconds or longer. <b>Surface</b> <b>waves</b> can travel around the globe many times from the largest earthquakes. <b>Surface</b> <b>waves</b> are caused when P waves and S waves come to the surface.|$|E

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>wave</b> {{scattering}} {{theory is}} presented as a new method for analyzing teleseismic <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> data. Using <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> scattering integrals the effect of lateral heterogeneity both on the <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> coda generation and on the direct <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> is described. Since the employed scattering theory for the forward problem is linear, the inverse problem can conveniently be solved in the least squares ense using an iterative matrix solver. For waveform inversions of the direct <b>surface</b> <b>wave,</b> only near forward scattering contributes. For this case the isotropic approximation is introduced, which makes it possible to retrieve phase velocity information from scattering theory. It is shown that for practical waveform inversions the resulting system of linear equations is extremely large and how row action methods can be used conveniently for carrying out the inversion on moderate size computers. The performance of the inversions is illustrated with two numerical examples. In the first example the <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> coda generated by one point scatterer is inverted. It is shown that the reconstruction i this case is similar to Kirchhoff migration methods as used in exploration seismics. In the second example, ray geometrical effects (focusing and phase shifting) are obtained from the linear inversion with scattering theory. It follows from this example that linear waveform inversion can simultaneously fit the amplitude and the phase of <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> data. 1...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} utilised methods of diagnosing <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> plasmas in recent years has involved the measurement of the electric fields surrounding the plasma column. However, such work has almost exclusively been confined to plasmas with generating frequencies typically greater than 200 MHz. The research reported in this thesis represents the first systematic diagnostic investigation of low frequency <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> plasmas. Three distinct diagnostic methods are employed which have been developed specifically to facilitate the diagnosis of low frequency <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> plasmas. Each diagnostic technique is comprised of a two-stage process. The first stage involves the measurement of the electric fields surrounding the plasma, from which point determinations of the <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> wave number are obtained. In the second stage, an axial plasma density gradient is inferred from the wave number values using a theoretical <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> model. The thesis begins with a general introduction to the characteristics of <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> plasmas and details the principle research objectives in the present investigation. Previous work in related areas is reviewed and its relevance to the present study highlighted. The equipment employed for the experimental part of the research programme is discussed in detail. The theoretical <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> model is then developed which serves to interpret the experimental measurements. The design of the Axial and FRD diagnostic techniques is described together with their application for diagnosing the low frequency <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> plasmas. A new diagnostic tool; the parasitic test-wave technique; has been developed and the results from which serve to validate the data from the Axial and FRD techniques.
