50|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} is {{the process}} of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually by melting powder material layer upon layer. Melting in a vacuum by using a computer-controlled <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> is highly precise. Electron-beam direct manufacturing (DM) is the first commercially available, large-scale, fully programmable means of achieving near net shape parts.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the idea}} of using color stripe filters over the target was not new, the Trinicon was the only tube to use the primary RGB colors. This necessitated an {{additional}} electrode buried in the target to detect where the <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> was relative to the stripe filter. Previous color stripe systems had used colors where the color circuitry was able to separate the colors purely from the relative amplitudes of the signals. As a result, the Trinicon featured a larger dynamic range of operation.|$|E

50|$|The term Charactron is {{sometimes}} mistakenly applied to {{another type of}} CRT properly called a monoscope which generates an electrical signal by <b>scanning</b> an <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> of uniform cross section across a printed pattern on an internal target electrode.|$|R
50|$|The Super Scope {{makes use}} of the {{scanning}} process used in cathode ray tube monitors, as CRTs were the only affordable TV monitors until the late 1990s. In short, the screen is drawn by a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> that travels horizontally across each line of the screen from top to bottom. A fast photodiode will see any particular area of the screen illuminated only briefly as that point is scanned, while the human eye will see a consistent image due to persistence of vision.|$|E
50|$|The {{trick to}} this method {{lies in the}} nature of the cathode ray tube inside the video monitor (CRTs were the only {{affordable}} TV monitors in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when this method was popularized). The screen is drawn by a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> that travels across the screen starting at the top until it hits the end, and then moves down to update the next line. This is done repeatedly until the entire screen is drawn, and appears instantaneous to the human eye as it is done very quickly.|$|E

The shadow register is the recommended source for reading this information, since it will be updated during the vertical blank guaranteeing consistent and reliable results. Programs should avoid reading the hardware register directly unless the program is certain the register is read at a time insuring the value is valid. Light guns for the Atari function {{the same way as}} light pens with the addition of an optical magnifier allowing the screen to be read from a greater distance. Note that the light pen/light gun input device requires a conventional CRT using a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam.</b> The light pen/light gun cannot work with modern LCD TVs and monitors.|$|E

This paper covers the extension of this technique to highly controlled arsenic diffusion with application to bipolar emitter structures. It has proved possible to model the diffusion using a similar approach to that used for conventional furnace annealing. However, in practice significant dopant evaporation is found unless a deposited capping layer is used. It is shown that the technique is able to provide highly controlled diffusion (± 5 %) for junction depths of 0. 2 µm at processing temperatures of ~ 1100 °C. Carrier concentration profiles from spreading resistance data and atomic concentration profiles measured by SIMS for bipolar emitter-base structures are included...|$|R

5000|$|The mysterious dark [...] "orthicon halo" [...] around bright {{objects in}} an IO-captured image {{is based on}} the fact that the IO relies on the {{emission}} of photoelectrons, but very bright illumination can produce more of them locally than the device can successfully deal with. At a very bright point on a captured image, a great preponderance of electrons is ejected from the photosensitive plate. So many may be ejected that the corresponding point on the collection mesh can no longer soak them up, and thus they fall back to nearby spots on the target instead, much as water splashes in a ring when a rock is thrown into it. Since the resultant splashed electrons do not contain sufficient energy to eject further electrons where they land, they will instead neutralize any positive charge that has been built-up in that region. Since darker images produce less positive charge on the target, the excess electrons deposited by the splash will be read as a dark region by the <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{computed}} tomography (CT) cross-sectional {{images of the}} attenuation distribution within a slice are created by scanning radiographic projections of an object with a rotating X-ray source detector compound and subsequent reconstruction of the images from these projection data on a computer. CT can be made very fast by employing a <b>scanned</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> instead of a mechanically moving X-ray source. Now this principle was extended towards high-energy <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> tomography with an electrostatic accelerator. Therefore a dedicated experimental campaign was planned and carried out at the Budker Insitute of Nuclear Physics (BINP), Novosibirsk.

50|$|Eidophors used {{an optical}} system {{somewhat}} {{similar to a}} conventional movie projector but substituted a slowly rotating mirrored disk or dish for the film. The disk {{was covered with a}} thin film of transparent high-viscosity oil, and {{through the use of a}} <b>scanned</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam,</b> electrostatic charges could be deposited onto the oil, causing its surface to deform. Light was shone on the disc via a striped mirror consisting of strips of reflective material alternating with transparent non-reflective areas. Areas of the oil unaffected by the <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> would allow the light to be reflected directly back to the mirror and towards the light source, whereas light passing through deformed areas would be displaced and would pass through the adjacent transparent areas and onwars through the projection system. As the disk rotated, a doctor blade discharged and smoothed the ripples in the oil, readying it for re-use on another television frame.|$|R

A very small focused electron spot (probe) is scanned in a raster form over a small specimen area.

The output of these detectors modulates, via appropriate electronics, the screen of a monitor to form an image that corresponds to the small raster and information, pixel by pixel, emanating from the specimen surface. Beyond these common principles, the ESEM deviates substantially from an SEM in several respects, {{all of which are}} important in the correct design and operation of the instrument.

50|$|E-beam {{lithography}} is {{not suitable}} for high-volume manufacturing because of its limited throughput. The smaller field of <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> writing makes for very slow pattern generation compared with photolithography (the current standard) because more exposure fields must be scanned to form the final pattern area (≤mm2 for <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> vs. ≥40 mm2 for an optical mask projection scanner). The stage moves in between field <b>scans.</b> The <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> field is small enough that a rastering or serpentine stage motion is needed to pattern a 26 mm X 33 mm area for example, whereas in a photolithography scanner only a one-dimensional motion of a 26 mm X 2 mm slit field would be required.|$|R

It gives, in principle, quantitatively accurate images of the flow at high spatial resolution and it is non-intrusive since moderately radiation absorbing vessel walls can be penetrated by X-rays. However, {{on the road to}} a technical realisation of such a technique within a computed tomography system many problems have to be solved. As a first prototype for scientific flow measurement studies we devised and built a fast <b>scanned</b> <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> X-ray tomography scanner.
