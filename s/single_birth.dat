25|$|The western {{lowland gorilla}} {{population}} in the wild is faced {{by a number of}} factors that threaten its extinction. Such factors include deforestation, farming, grazing and the expanding human settlements that cause forest loss. There is a correlation between human intervention in the wild with the destruction of habitats and increase in bushmeat hunting. Another of these factors is infertility. Generally, female gorillas mature at 10–12 years of age (or earlier at 7–8 years) and their male counterparts mature more slowly, rarely strong and dominant enough to reproduce before 15–20 years of age. The fecundity of females, or capacity of producing young in great numbers, appears to decline by the age of 18. Of one half of captive females of viable reproductive age, approximately only 30% of those had only a <b>single</b> <b>birth.</b> However, these non-reproductive gorillas may prove to be a valuable resource since the use of assisted reproductive techniques aid in the maintaining of genetic diversity in the limited populations in zoos.|$|E
50|$|The {{subspecies}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at 2 years of age. Mating lasts from August to November and can involve mortal battles. The dominant male finally secures {{most of the}} mature females, typically a dozen per male. After gestation, in May-July, females hide alone in the maquis (the dense vegetation) to deliver, typically a <b>single</b> <b>birth</b> per female. Males leave the matriarchal group following the reproductive period.|$|E

50|$|News of {{the unusual}} birth spread quickly, sparked by Oliva's brother's inquiry {{to the local}} {{newspaper}} editor {{about how much he}} would charge for an announcement of five babies at a <b>single</b> <b>birth.</b> Before long, people from all over North America were offering assistance. Individuals sent supplies and well-meant advice (a famous letter from Appalachia recommends tiny doses of burnt rye whiskey to prevent diarrhoea); one hospital sent two incubators.|$|E
50|$|The impulse for mating {{starts with}} the female. She takes up eye contact with the male and runs away a short bit, then flashes her genitals. If the male shows {{interest}} (which does not always occur), he joins the female and they mate. The 200-day gestation period ends with a <b>single</b> <b>birth</b> in late spring or early summer. Young animals become fully mature in about six to seven years. Zoologists know little about their lifespan.|$|E

50|$|Rarely twins, {{a typical}} <b>single</b> <b>birth</b> comes after a seven-month {{gestation}} period. Newborns {{usually have a}} golden-yellow fur. The mother shares responsibilities of rearing the young with the other females ("aunties") of the harem. They hand the young around, play with it, carry it, and cuddle it, while the mother searches for food. If the mother dies, another female adopts the young animal. Lutungs are weaned {{in the latter half}} of their first year, and reach full maturity at 4 to 5 years. The life expectancy is estimated at 20 years.|$|E
50|$|A <b>single</b> <b>birth</b> on {{a planet}} where twin births are the norm, Lightning Lord {{developed}} an anti-social personality {{in response to his}} circumstance of not having a twin sibling. When the spacecraft which he was travelling in along with his younger brother and sister (Legion of Super-Heroes members Lightning Lad and Lightning Lass) ran into electrical difficulties, the Ranzz siblings were forced to land their craft on the planetoid Korbal. In an attempt to lure the local lightning beasts to recharge their battery, they were charged with electrical energy themselves, giving them the power to generate lighting. Given his newfound ability, Lightning Lord decided to turn to a life of crime.|$|E

25|$|A {{multiple}} birth is {{the culmination of}} one multiple pregnancy, wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, {{multiple birth}}s occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter, and multiple births may be more common than <b>single</b> <b>births.</b> Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.|$|R
50|$|All anthropoids have a single-chambered uterus; tarsiers have a bicornate uterus {{like the}} strepsirrhines.

Despite similar gestation periods, haplorhine newborns are relatively {{much larger than}} strepsirrhine newborns, but have a longer dependence period on their mother. This difference in size and dependence is credited to the increased complexity of their behavior and natural history.|$|R

50|$|Statistical {{studies of}} extreme {{longevity}} are {{difficult for a}} number of factors. Firstly, because few people live to very old ages, a very large population is required for such studies, ideally all born and living in similar conditions (same country, same birth year). In small countries, a <b>single</b> <b>birth</b> year cohort is insufficiently numerous for statistics, and thus multiple years are often used. Secondly, due to the great ages, accurate records of persons living over 100 years require records dating from the late 19th or early 20th century, when such record-keeping was often not high-quality; further, {{there is a tendency to}} exaggerate one's age, which distorts data. Thirdly, granularity is an issue - ideally exact day of birth and death would be used; using only year of birth and death introduces granularity, which adds bias (as discussed below).|$|E

5000|$|This {{species is}} very social, {{and lives in}} groups that are either made up of their own species {{exclusively}} or within groups of mixed species. Visual and oral communication is very important, whether communicating to other Dryas monkeys, or communicating to other individuals. When living exclusively amongst each other, troops {{are made up of}} up to 30 individuals. Troops include many young offspring and females, but only contain one male. When females reproduce, they have a <b>single</b> <b>birth</b> of one individual, and the gestation period lasts five months. Offspring will be fully matured and ready to reproduce themselves after three years of life. The expected lifespan in the wild is between 10-15 years, and because there are currently no Dryas monkeys in captivity, that lifespan is unknown. [...] Using quadrupedal locomotion, their movement occurs with a gait pattern involving all four limbs. As mentioned, communication is very important to this species, and they have a unique way of communicating with one another. Some examples of this unique communication include staring - which is a display used as a threat. The eyes stay fixed as the eyebrows rise and the scalp is retracted. The facial skin becomes stretched and the ears move back. These movements expose the eyelids, which are a different color and heavily contrasts with their facial color. Staring with open mouth is another threat expression that often goes along with head-bobbing. Head-bobbing, another threat display, is thought to be more aggressive. Presenting - this behavior is used by females during the mating season, showing males they are ready to mate.|$|E
40|$|Most anthropoid {{primates}} {{are slow}} to develop, their offspring are mostly <b>single</b> <b>births,</b> and the interbirth intervals are long. To maintain a stable population, parents must {{live long enough to}} sustain the serial production of a sufficient number of young to replace themselves while allowing for the death of offspring before they can reproduce. However, in many species there is a large differential between the sexes in the care provided to offspring. Therefore, we hypothesize that in slowly developing species with <b>single</b> <b>births,</b> the sex that bears the greater burden in the care of offspring will tend to survive longer. Males are incapable of gestating infants and lactating, but in several species fathers carry their offspring for long periods. We predict that females tend to live longer than males in the species where the mother does most or all of the care of offspring, that there is no difference in survival between the sexes in species in which both parents participate about equally in infant care, and that in the species where the father does a greater amount of care than the mother, males tend to live longer. The hypothesis is supported by survival data for males and females in anthropoid primate species...|$|R
5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually {{give birth to}} more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have <b>single</b> <b>births.</b> Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|R
40|$|Background: Childbirth {{assistance}} in highly technological settings and existing {{variability in the}} interventions performed are cause for concern. In recent years, numerous recommendations have been made concerning {{the importance of the}} physiological process during birth. In Spain and Catalonia, work has been carried out to implement evidence-based practices for childbirth and to reduce unnecessary interventions. To identify obstetric intervention rates among all births, determine whether there are differences in interventions among full-term <b>single</b> <b>births</b> taking place in different hospitals according to type of funding and volume of births attended to, and to ascertain whether there is an association between caesarean section or instrumental birth rates and type of funding, the volume of births attended to and women’s age. Methods: Cross-sectional study, taking the hospital as the unit of analysis, obstetric interventions as dependent variables, and type of funding, volume of births attended to and maternal age as explanatory variables. The analysis was performed in three phases considering all births reported in the MBDS Catalonia 2011 (7, 8570 <b>births),</b> full-term <b>single</b> <b>births</b> and births coded as normal. Results: The overall caesarean section rate in Catalonia is 27. 55 % (CI 27. 23 to 27. 86). There is a significant difference in caesarean section rates between public and private hospitals in all strata. Both public and private hospitals with a lower volume of births have higher obstetric intervention rates than other hospitals (49. 43 %, CI 48. 04 to 50. 81). Conclusions: In hospitals in Catalonia, both the type of funding and volume of births attended to {{have a significant effect on}} the incidence of caesarean section, and type of funding is associated with the use of instruments during delivery...|$|R
