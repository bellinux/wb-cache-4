In general, every effort has been made to cope with the challenges in providing a sustainable energy solution for achieving the goals. Even though the concept of “Smart Grid” has recently been highlighted in the electricity sector to improve efficiency of energy use and to reduce greenhouse gases to achieve business goals, the driving initiatives for generating a Smart Grid are straightforward and its scope and functions differ from a <b>Smart</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Network</b> (SEN) which has a broader boundary and more components. A comprehensive concept of SEN beyond Smart Grid is presented to effectively integrate energy systems which can not only cover available energy resources but also address sustainability issues. The availability of new technologies for utilizing the renewable energy such as solar, wind and biomass, and reducing the carbon footprint of fossil fuels by including natural gas within an integrated energy network provides a base for better conservation of energy usage and providing a cleaner environment. Moreover, the new energy carriers such as hydrogen and sustainable natural gas integrated into cogeneration systems should be taken into account when such a network is developed. A cogeneration system is a promising solution for effectively supplying energy to district consumers for high density urban environment. In this thesis, a new community-scale cogeneration system is modeled using TRNSYS (Transient System Simulation) software, which enables analysis of transient characteristics of cogeneration and to investigate critical factors which should be considered for successful integration into a SEN.

This paper investigates the energy and environmental potential of a renewable trigeneration system in a residential application under Incheon (Korea) and Ottawa (Canada) weather conditions. The trigeneration system consists of a ground-to-air heat exchanger (GAHX), photovoltaic thermal (PVT) panels and an air-to-water heat pump (AWHP). The study is performed by simulations in TRNSYS (Version 17. 02) environment.

40|$|Urbanisation is a {{major change}} taking place globally. It is {{estimated}} that 500 million people will be urbanised by 2030 which is around 60 % of the world’s population will be living in cities. Cities fuel economic development through mobilizing capital, work force, knowledge/information and technology and offer better chances of wealth generation, better health facilities, education and a good quality of life with better services and facilities. This {{has led to the}} increase in “megacities” (urban areas with a population of 10 million or more) and primate cities (leading cities in the region disproportionately larger than others in the urban hierarchy) across the globe. Urbanization propelled by economic reforms are putting cities under perpetual pressure of population concentration and energy intensive growth model. The cities are often confronted with a multitude of key problems like high urban densities, traffic congestion, energy inadequacy, unplanned development and lack of basic services. Due to high land values, migrants often {{have no choice but to}} settle in shantytowns and slums, where they lack access to decent housing and sanitation, health care and education thus adding to urban poverty. Urbanisation is also contributing significantly to climate change as 20 largest cities consume 80 % of the world’s energy and urban areas generate 80 % of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. The challenges of rapid urbanisation are to deal with the social, economic and environment development through more effective and comprehensive land administration functions, supported by efficient per capita infrastructure supply, resolving issues such as climate change, disaster management, insecurity, energy scarcity, environmental pollution, and extreme poverty. Urbanization must be able to support urban planning to achieve sustainable development in order to meet the growing energy and housing demands, reliable public transportation systems and be able to meet essential urban services without putting pressure on resources. Therefore it needs to support innovative urban planning policies and strategies beyond traditional urban planning paradigms. Urbanisation on the positive side provides an unparalleled urban planning opportunity to pre-address social and environmental problems, including reduction of greenhouse gas emissions combined with the retrofitting and upgrading of facilities and networks in existing urban centres, as well as smart urban planning of cities can provide better education, healthcare and high-quality energy services more efficiently and with less emissions because of their advantages of scale, proximity and lower geographic footprints. Thus “Smart Urbanisation” is the key to safer cities of tomorrow. Building cities sustainably using smart growth principles, compact development planning form, using eco-city concepts, concept of low carbon electricity ecosystem etc, provides an opportunity to avoid future sources of greenhouse emissions, while developing more liveable and efficient urban centres. It could also alleviate population pressure on natural habitats and biodiversity thus reducing the risks to natural disasters. High-level integration of existing technologies to deliver a <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>network,</b> enhanced electricity transmission, energy efficient transportation, and low carbon building footprints, will make it easier to manage the unfolding urbanisation, and could have much positive impact on energy use and consumption.

The variety of micro-generation technology choices and applications {{is strongly dependent on}} a building’s electric and thermal load profiles. Building integration of micro-generation systems is challenging because the loads are small and stochastic in nature, and the diversity is high. Given the rapidly increasing numbers of micro-cogeneration installations around the world, there is a pressing need for knowledge to enable informed choices to be made on where and when the installation of micro-cogeneration systems is appropriate. To properly integrate these systems in buildings, a significant number of operational and design issues must be investigated and resolved. This report contains the research findings of Annex 54 of the International Energy Agency’s Energy in Building and Communities Programme (IEA EBC), which was established in 2009 to further develop simulation models and performance assessment techniques affecting the integration and future penetration of micro-generation systems in buildings. The Annex 54 research encompasses the broad range of end-uses of micro-generation and the systems within it that might be deployed. The work reflects the state-of-the-art and future performance in micro-generation, including integration with energy storage and demand-side management technologies (e. g. responsive loads or dynamic demand control), virtual utility, and <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>networks.</b> Finally, given the ubiquitous nature of this technology and its broad societal impact, the research results are accessible to a broad audience including engineers, policy makers, and businesses. Annex 54 successfully developed models of micro-generation units and system components, and implemented them into performance simulation platforms for state of the art buildings. A huge amount of country-specific data has been collected from laboratory and field testing, and has been used to determine demand-side profiles and to gain knowledge on micro-generation system integration and performance under variety of real life operating conditions. The country-specific synthesis analysis performed by Annex 54 revealed generic performance trends and “rules of thumb” for the appropriate deployment of micro-generation technologies. The developed assessment methodology established common reference points for performance comparison, assessment methodology, and metrics, as Executive Summary 10 well as for the identification of generic not country-specific factors affecting the viability of micro-generation systems and their appropriate deployment in buildings and communities.

A wireless clustered network has been proposed for the localization and monitoring of <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> meters. Due to the inability of utility service providers to visit the facilities of consumers regularly results in the difficulty of detecting fraud in good time, when energy meters are tampered with. These tampering, illegal connection and illegal bypass of <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> meters results in commercial and operational losses. This paper proposes measures to address security issues that may arise in the proposed clustered network for locating and monitoring <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> meters. The security goals of confidentiality/secrecy, authorization, integrity, authentication and availability and availability that are related to the metering infrastructure are addressed in this paper...|$|R
