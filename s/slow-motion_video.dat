25|$|Just {{two races}} after celebrating his second win of 1991, Waltrip would again be {{involved}} in another serious crash, again at the Daytona International Speedway, in Daytona Beach, Florida. It came after completing the 119th of 160 laps on the 2.5 mile superspeedway. Waltrip and driver Alan Kulwicki were racing side by side, leading a large grouping of cars, battling for 5th position. The car drafting Alan Kulwicki bumped the Kulwicki car, causing his car to hit Waltrip's Western Auto Chevrolet at speeds approaching 200mph on the long backstretch. Waltrip's car slowed and was collected by driver Joe Ruttman's car, both cars sliding sideways several hundred feet on the grassy infield. The tires of Waltrip's car clipped {{the edge of an}} access road causing it to become airborne and tumbling end over end several times before coming to a stop, up-side down, in a grassy area near turn 3. Waltrip was extricated and only suffered minor injuries but many feared that he could have re-injured his shattered leg from the crash at the same track the previous year. (<b>Slow-motion</b> <b>video</b> and still photography showed that Waltrip's left arm was outside the car as the car tumbled, and came to rest.) Waltrip still had a plate in his left leg from the compound fractures he suffered in the earlier crash at the Pepsi 400, at the Daytona International Speedway, (Waltrip commented on a January 10, 2013, SPEED Television broadcast of the Daytona NASCAR winter testing, that he had spent more time in the hospital from injuries suffered at the Daytona Speedway, than at any other track he had raced). Waltrip would compete in the following race, the summer race at the Pocono Raceway, in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, but was crashed again when driver Ernie Irvan spun driver Hut Stricklin, in front of almost the entire field. Waltrip won the year's spring race at the track just 5 weeks before.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} the actual {{revolutions per minute}} (rpm) values and compare the cyclic fatigue life of Reciproc (RPC, VDW GmbH), WaveOne (WO, Dentsply Maillefer), and TF Adaptive (TFA, Axis/SybronEndo) nickel-titanium (NiTi) file systems using high-speed camera. Materials and Methods Twenty RPC R 25 (25 / 0. 08), 20 WO Primary (25 / 0. 08), and 20 TFA ML 1 (25 / 0. 08) files were employed in the present study. The cyclic fatigue tests were performed using a dynamic cyclic fatigue testing device, which has an artificial stainless steel canal with a 60 ° angle of curvature and a 5 -mm radius of curvature. The files were divided into 3 groups (group 1, RPC R 25 [RPC]; group 2, WO Primary [WO]; group 3, TF Adaptive ML 1 [TFA]). All the instruments were rotated until fracture during the cyclic fatigue test and <b>slow-motion</b> <b>videos</b> were captured using high-speed camera. The number of cycles to failure (NCF) was calculated. The data were analyzed statistically using {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA, p < 0. 05). Results The <b>slow-motion</b> <b>videos</b> were indicated that rpm values of the RPC, WO, and TFA groups were 180, 210, and 425, respectively. RPC (3, 464. 45 ± 487. 58) and WO (3, 257. 63 ± 556. 39) groups had significantly longer cyclic fatigue life compared with TFA (1, 634. 46 ± 300. 03) group (p < 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean length of the fractured fragments. Conclusions Within the limitation of the present study, RPC and WO NiTi files showed significantly longer cyclic fatigue life than TFA NiTi file...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a process}} not well understood, a {{bidirectional}} channel of ionized air, called a [...] "leader", is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of {{that of the}} leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern. In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called [...] "stepping". The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in <b>slow-motion</b> <b>videos</b> of lightning flashes.|$|R

50|$|Sony {{debuted in}} the Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium the worlds first 3-layer stacked image sensor with DRAM for smartphones.

40|$|There {{has always}} been {{interest}} in icy bodies in the solar system.

This thesis is a starting point for research into hypervelocity impacts impacting a spherical ice shell with a liquid core. It also compares the results to other hypervelocity impacts onto ice, for example Leliwa-Kopystynski (2005) et al. and Burchell et al. (1997). The research in this thesis finds the catastrophic energy density of ice-water core spheres. The conclusion of the data shows the catastrophic energy density is between 14. 8 ± 1. 6 and 17. 6 ± 2. 3 J kg− 1, whereas solid ice spheres have a catastrophic energy density of 18. 0 ± 0. 7 J kg− 1. The thesis also presents data relating to the impact events, this includes: crater depth, spall diameter, pit diameter, volume of the crater and variation in fragmentation. All these parameters of the impacts were analysed and compared with other data from similar studies that carried out experiment on solid spheres.
