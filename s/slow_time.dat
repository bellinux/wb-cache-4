5|$|The {{player can}} <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> by landing {{successive}} hits and kills on enemies to fill an on-screen meter. The player {{can return to}} levels to attempt a higher score. The game's action sequences, {{more than half of}} the game, require the player to defeat groups of enemies before proceeding to the next room, and ultimately leading to a boss battle. Kameo has a two-player, split-screen cooperative gameplay mode in which players can fight alongside each other during the action scenes. Rare added support for online cooperative play (via Xbox Live or System Link) as a downloadable patch following the game's release.|$|E
5|$|In {{completing}} missions, {{the player}} can have Talion engage in melee, ranged combat, and stealth approaches, with some missions rewarding the player more for completing the mission {{in a specific}} manner. Talion's ranger abilities are enhanced through Celebrimbor, allowing the player to mix combat with special focus-based attacks; these latter attacks {{can be used to}} <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> down while aiming with the bow, drain focus out of an enemy foe, or, later in the game, brand the foe to become an ally of Talion. The combat system uses an attack-chain system that enables the player to perform special moves after building the chain to a large enough value, such as instantly draining a foe of focus or performing an area focus attack. With the combat system, they can also counter and dodge attacks. Stealth is a critical element in some missions; several areas are considered Strongholds and should Talion's presence be discovered, an alarm will sound and more Uruks will arrive to try to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|E

5|$|The Sands the Prince {{collects}} from {{enemies and}} the environment are tied to his magical abilities, themselves connected with the Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince to rewind time by up to ten seconds if he makes a mistake in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while {{they are unable to}} move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more Sand is collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out {{with a small amount of}} Sand available to him, its capacity can be increased by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.|$|E
25|$|After the Colours {{have been}} trooped in <b>slow</b> <b>time,</b> the Joint Escort halts in place, turns about, and then {{presents}} arms as ordered. After this, the parade is told to shoulder arms by the FO, signalling {{the end of}} the Trooping proper itself.|$|E
25|$|To {{the strains}} of the Grenadiers Slow March, the Escort to the Colour then troops the colour down {{the long line of}} Nos 6-2 Guards. The colour itself is borne by the Ensign in front of the line of guards, but the ranks of the Escort {{interweave}} with their ranks. For Nos 6-2 Guards, who maintain the 'present arms' position, the long trooping, especially on a hot day, requires stamina. As this is done the Massed Bands move back in <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> to their original places.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year Patton came second to Michael Rodgers {{in a close}} 100m race at the 2009 US championships in June, running a windy 9.92 seconds. This won him {{a place on the}} American team for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. Prior to the event, he was runner-up in Monaco and in Stockholm – running a wind-assisted 9.95 seconds behind Tyson Gay at the latter. He managed to reach the final of the men's 100 meters after scoring a season's best of 9.98 in the semi-finals. He performed poorly in the final however, finishing last with a <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> of 10.34seconds due to an injury. The hopes of the American men's relay team were again dashed by an illegal baton exchange, this time between Patton and Shawn Crawford. Patton ended his season on a high: he ran a series of sub-10 runs including 9.95 for third at the Weltklasse, 9.94 to win the Hanžeković Memorial, and a personal record-equalling run of 9.89seconds for third at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, behind Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell. He also placed third in the 100m at the Memorial Van Damme and the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} progresses, the player unlocks new weapons and weapon {{abilities}} as rewards from several activities: points accrued from successfully killing targets, leaderboard rankings, and [...] "blueprint" [...] collectibles dropped by targets. Added abilities include {{the option to}} <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> or reveal enemies on-screen. The player can also purchase the in-game currency directly through microtransactions to skip game progress and automatically unlock more powerful weapons. The player can sync progress between devices through Facebook integration.|$|E
500|$|The {{score for}} Insurrection was {{composed}} by Jerry Goldsmith; his fourth {{score for the}} franchise. Goldsmith continued using the march and Klingon themes written for Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979, adding new themes and variations. Insurrection opens with Alexander Courage's [...] fanfare, introducing a six-note motif used {{in many of the}} film's action sequences. The Ba'ku are scored with a pastoral theme with repeating harps, string sections and a woodwind solo. The Ba'ku's ability to <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> was accompanied with a variation of this music.|$|E

The fastest winning time is 1:34 (set by Dan, Episode 8) and the <b>slowest</b> winning <b>time</b> is 4:29 (set by Mica, Episode 5). As for losing times, a new record for the <b>slowest</b> <b>time</b> was set in Episode 5, by Ross who came in with 9:13. The reason for many <b>slow</b> <b>times</b> was down to the [...] "Impossible Snowflakes", as out of the 27 people who {{made it to the}} Wipeout Zone, only 6 people crossed them.|$|R

500|$|The Motion Picture {{opened in}} North America on December 7, 1979, in 859 theaters {{and set a}} box office record for highest weekend gross, making $11,815,203 in its first weekend (generally {{considered}} to be a <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> for the movie business). The film beat the record set by Superman (1978), which had opened in a similar number of theaters but had been released in late December—a busier time. [...] The Motion Picture earned $17million within a week. At its widest domestic distribution, the film was shown in 1,002 theaters; it grossed $82,258,456 in the United States, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1979 in that country. Overall, the film grossed $139million worldwide. The Motion Picture was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Art Direction (Harold Michelson, Joseph R. Jennings, Leon Harris, John Vallone and Linda DeScenna), Best Visual Effects, and Best Original Score.|$|E
500|$|Following {{instructions}} from Ottawa, French finally agreed with Morris that the expedition would initially follow the trail, but then would steer {{away from the}} border and Sioux territory, and the mounted police finally left Dufferin on July 8, 1874. The 275-strong expedition was divided into six divisions, supported by 310 horses, 143 draught oxen and 187 Red River carts and wagons, in all stretching out [...] along the track. The force took two 9-pounder (4kg) guns and two mortars for additional protection, cattle for food, and mowing machines to make hay. French had negotiated that the expedition be accompanied by Henri Julien, a journalist whom the commissioner hoped would write a positive account of the new force. The expedition made <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> along the boundary trail, progressing only [...] a day at most. The police were already travelling under unpleasant and arduous conditions, made more difficult by the teamsters having little experience and their horses being unsuitable for draught work.|$|E
500|$|With the 2000 Sydney Olympics approaching, Chambers {{studied the}} {{technique}} of other sprinters. In an interview with BBC journalist Tom Fordyce, Chambers commented on the stamina Greene and Surin had gained from running in the 200metres event and Jason Gardener's improved acceleration through running the 60metres event. He experimented with distances {{at the beginning of}} 2000, sprinting over 50, 60 and 200m in various competitions. He set a personal best of 6.55s in the 60m event in Ghent in February. A hamstring injury caused him to miss six weeks of training and when he returned his 100m performances were lacklustre. He finished ninth at the Golden Gala in Rome with a <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> of 10.41s [...] and was seventh in a tame 10.30s at the London Grand Prix, results that led him to consider quitting the season altogether. A late rejuvenation at the British Olympic trials guaranteed his selection as he snatched first place with 10.11s (just one hundredth of a second ahead of Darren Campbell). Victory against in-form world record holder Maurice Greene in Gateshead raised Chambers' confidence and he stated his aim to take home a medal from the Games.|$|E

500|$|Massa {{responded to}} Alonso's quick pace with his fastest lap time to {{increase}} the gap by four-tenths of a second. Button ran wide at the first corner and fell further [...] behind sixth-place driver Webber. Hamilton set a <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> which allowed Webber to close the gap to the former. Vettel became the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop for the hard-compound tyres on the 12th lap, and rejoined in sixth in front of Kubica. It was part of a strategy by Red Bull to place him into clear air in the hopes that he could make up some time on the leading Ferrari cars. Alguersuari drove alongside Yamamoto over the start/finish line and the Alguersuari passed Yamamoto for 19th entering the first corner on the same lap. Ferrari responded to Red Bull's decision by bringing Alonso and Massa in for their stops in quick succession, handing the lead to Button. Alonso rejoined ahead of Vettel, and was followed by Webber, but he exited the pit lane among a pack of slower cars and was immediately challenged by Kobayashi. Massa began to struggle with tyre temperatures and locked-up at turn two, and lost the balance of his car at the turn six hairpin.|$|E
500|$|Among {{his more}} curious and {{enduring}} innovations was the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. [...] The winter months, between the college bowl {{season and the}} start of Major League Baseball's spring training, was a <b>slow</b> <b>time</b> for sports journalism. [...] At the time, winter team sports like basketball and ice hockey were regional niche sports, and there was little to write about. [...] Laguerre had instituted an annual February issue titled [...] "Fun in the Sun", where he sent his staff to an exotic locale to write about and photograph it for his readers. [...] In 1964, he asked Jule Campbell, then a fashion reporter for Sports Illustrated, to [...] "go to some beautiful place and put a pretty girl on the cover" [...] of that year's [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issue. That year's issue featured only five pages of girls in swimsuits, and still predominantly featured travel writing, including articles about snorkeling and fish-watching. [...] With the help of that year's [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issue, 1964 became the first year that Sports Illustrated would turn a profit. [...] Though originally only planned as a one-off event, Laguerre was convinced by Sports Illustrated art director Dick Gangel to bring back the swimsuits in 1965, only [...] "a lot sexier". [...] Laguerre once again assigned Jule Campbell to scout models and locations. [...] The 1965 issue contained an article entitled [...] "The Nudity Cult" [...] and de-emphasized the travelogue-like writing of previous [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issues from which it evolved. [...] Since then, the Swimsuit Issue has become the biggest selling issue of the magazine, and a major cross-over publication for the fashion and modeling worlds as well.|$|E

2500|$|Next was {{the grade}} I FrontRunner Stakes on September 26 at Santa Anita. At [...] mile, this was Nyquist's first race around two turns. He faced eight rivals and was made the 1–2 favorite. Nyquist {{fought for the}} early lead and entered the first turn three wide. Gutierrez then settled him just off the pace through a {{moderate}} half mile in 47.01 seconds. Nyquist went to the lead {{at the top of}} the stretch and then held off a stretch drive by Swipe to win. There was a stewards' inquiry regarding possible interference down the stretch, but the results stood. The margin of victory was only three-quarters of a length, which, combined with a relatively <b>slow</b> <b>time,</b> led to questions about his stamina.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the final}} {{arrangements}} a funeral service was arranged, with the casket leaving the Military Academy grounds in Fort Tiuna on 17 March 2013 under full military honours including references to Ltn.

Government party militias in their light motorcycles followed the motorcade (itself surrounded by Army mounted guards) {{with a large}} following of (mostly poor) citizens, with final arrival honors paid upon arrival at the Mountain Barracks. Bolivian president Evo Morales, President Maduro (then interim) and Chavez's brother Adan and daughter Maria Gabiela each gave speeches before the flag folding and dedication ceremony.
