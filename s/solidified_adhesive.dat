40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{experimental and}} simulative {{aspects of a}} novel method {{for the production of}} piezo-metal-compounds are presented in order to enhance the series capability of their former manufacturing process. These compounds are sandwich constructions with a piezomodule between two aluminum sheets. Until recently a still liquid adhesive surrounded the piezomodule to protect it from damage during forming of the compound and an already <b>solidified</b> <b>adhesive</b> in the outer regions assured the patch fixation. Now the studied novel method employs only one adhesive which takes over both functions at the same time. In order to assure this double function a local pre-curing is pursued. The paper focuses on the local activation of the curing reaction of adhesives using higher temperatures. Hence, a device with a heating and a cooling zone was employed to adjust different temperature fields within one bonded sandwich sheet. Finally, sandwich compounds with partially cured and partially liquid areas of adhesive are manufactured. Moreover, a thermo-chemically coupled continuum mechanical model for adhesives is implemented into ANSYS® and allows for finite element analysis of this spatially graded curing with its heat flow caused by both, local activation and exothermal reaction heat. Hence, alternative production strategies can be evaluated at an early stage of the process development...|$|E
40|$|A glue stick is {{comprised}} of <b>solidified</b> <b>adhesive</b> mounted in a lipstick-like push-up tube. Whey is a byproduct of cheese making. Direct disposal of whey can cause environmental pollution. The objective {{of this study was}} to use whey protein isolate (WPI) as a natural polymer along with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to develop safe glue sticks. Pre-dissolved WPI solution, PVP, sucrose, 1, 2 -propanediol (PG), sodium stearate, defoamer, and preservative were mixed and dissolved in water at 90 oC and then molded in push-up tubes. Chemical composition, functional properties (bonding strength, glue setting time, gel hardness, extension/retraction, and spreading properties), microstructure, and storage stability of the prototypes were evaluated in comparison with a commercial control. Results showed that all WPI/PVP prototypes had desirable bonding strength and exhibited faster setting than PVP prototypes and control. WPI could reduce gel hardness and form less compact and rougher structures than that of PVP, but there was no difference in bonding strength. PVP and sucrose could increase the hygroscopicity of glue sticks, thus increasing storage stability. Finally, the optimized prototype GS 3 (major components: WPI 8. 0 %, PVP 12. 0 %, 1, 2 -propanediol 10. 0 %, sucrose 10. 0 %, and stearic sodium 7. 0 %) had a comparable functionality to the commercial control. Results indicated that whey protein could be used as an adhesive polymer for glue stick formulations, which could be used to bond fiber or cellulose derived substrates such as paper...|$|E
3000|$|Rayleigh waves, {{propagating}} on {{the free}} surface of an elastic half space, are well known. If the medium is homogeneous and isotropic, the velocity of the Rayeleigh wave depends on the elastic constants of the medium {{and not on the}} wavelength, i.e., the Rayleigh wave is non-dispersive, and the power density of the wave decays exponentially from the surface with a characteristic penetration depth of the order of a wavelength. However, in the presence of stratified half-space, the velocity will exhibit dispersion. Stratified half-space is a kind of common material structure [1 – 3]. Elastic wave fields in multilayered media are of considerable interest in a variety of applications, and have, therefore, been studied extensively over the years. After Rayleigh, Love, and Stoneley, Thomson and Haskell introduced the propagator matrix method that is later focused on by many authors. These works were carried out in the stratified elastic solid media model, and the propagator matrix technique is heuristic in many applications. The propagation of Rayleigh-like waves in a stratified half-space has been widely studied for use of nondestructive. Many years ago, Mason and Thurston [4] described surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in half substrate-coatings. Zininet et al. [5] pointed out that a pseudo-Rayleigh wave leaks energy into substrate. Lawr ultrasonics have been widely used to study the SAWs of multilayered adhesive structures [6 – 9], and its advantages include providing a non-contact, wide band, perfect source. Cheng et al. [10] have simulated laser-generated ultrasonic waves in a layered plate. All of the studies cited above assumed the adhesive layers are elastic solids because <b>solidified</b> <b>adhesive</b> layers closely resemble elastic solids. It should be remembered, however, that adhesive layers or coating have more attenuation than solids due to the presence of more “relaxation” or “creep.” [...]...|$|E
40|$|A {{hot melt}} {{adhesive}} attachment pad for releasably securing distinct elements together is described which is particularly useful {{in the construction industry}} or a spatial vacuum environment. The attachment pad consists primarily of a cloth selectively impregnated with a charge of {{hot melt adhesive}}, a thermo-foil heater, and a thermo-cooler. These components are securely mounted in a mounting assembly. In operation, the operator activates the heating cycle transforming the hot melt adhesive to a substantially liquid state, positions the pad against the attachment surface, and activates the cooling cycle <b>solidifying</b> the <b>adhesive</b> and forming a strong, releasable bond...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} {{mechanical}} stacking technology with transparent conductive adhesive as intermediate conductive layer for multi-junction-solar cells. Transparent adhesive jell dispersed with Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) particles ranging from 5 to 10 wt% {{was developed for}} stacking solar cell substrates. A connecting resistivity below 2. 0 Ωcm 2 was achieved in a condition of <b>solidifying</b> the <b>adhesive</b> gel under a gas pressure from 4. 0 x 105 to 7. 0 x 105 Pa. The connecting resistivity was kept lower than 3. 0 Ωcm 2 when samples was exposed at a high temperature at 80 oC and a high humidity of 85 % humidity atmosphere {{in the case of}} solidification pressure at 7. 0 x 105 Pa. The low connecting resistivity give a possibility of application our conductive adhesive to solar cell with an effective efficiency higher than 30 %. Stacked solar cells was successfully achieved by pasting a InGaP/GaAs thin film epitaxial layer to a Ge solar cell using our intermediate adhesive layer...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Black is {{inexpensive}} {{widely used}} industrial filler, but its dispersability in solvents/polymeric media {{has always been}} a critical point. As a result either surfactants or higher mechanical forces have been utilized to disperse it well in the media. First part of research was aimed at surface modification of CB to increase its dispersability in different solvents and epoxy that directly effects filler-medium interactions. Type and magnitude of this interaction differs with structure and surface chemistry of filler, and this determines the ultimate properties of the composites. For CB surface modification Thermal and photochemical procedures have been implemented. Excellent results regarding surface modification and dispersability have been achieved. Utilization of light, as a substitute of heat, for nanocomposite synthesis, has a foundation on photochemical reaction. Liquid monomers/oligomers are jumbled with a minute percent of photoinitiator, and then exposed to UV light. In a few seconds, the products inks, coatings or <b>adhesives</b> <b>solidify.</b> UV curing of colored composites has always been challenging because of light attenuation problems through colored composite samples; this results in incomplete polymerization. Second part of research was connected with UV-curing of colored epoxy composites. Certain techniques have been utilized, to photo-cure colored epoxy composites either in micron sized thin layers or outsized thick samples. Implementation of a unique method "Smart Approach" to photo-cure thick colored epoxy composites has fabricated promising results regarding polymerization kinetics and thermal / mechanical propertie...|$|R
