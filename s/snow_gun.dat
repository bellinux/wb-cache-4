5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
50|$|A {{specially}} designed <b>Snow</b> <b>Gun</b> {{is used in}} the production of snow on site.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, {{water is}} {{atomized}} using high-pressure compressed air. The water then {{arrives at the}} <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> and is pushed out of the special nozzles {{at the end of}} the barrel. Liquid nitrogen which freezes at a low temperature of -196°C is also passed through the <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> at the same time. The extreme cold of the liquid nitrogen instantly freezes the atomized water into powder-like snowflakes.|$|E
50|$|All {{the main}} {{downhill}} runs and many secondary runs {{are equipped with}} artificial snow-making equipment. They make use of eight water storage basins, 353 snow cannon and 108 <b>snow</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At the Pistol complex {{side of the}} mountain, two trails gained snow-making capabilities. The Blundersmoke Terrain Park {{received}} new permanent <b>snow</b> <b>guns,</b> and the Side Arm {{trail was}} widened by over 50 ft.

50|$|On September 19, 2007, Boyne Resorts, a Michigan-based resort company, {{announced}} it had acquired the lease to operate Loon from Booth Creek Ski Holdings. In 2011 the resort was expanded by four trails. It also {{increased the number}} of <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> by 170 to a total of 600, at a total cost of $1.4 million.|$|R
50|$|Snowmaking has {{achieved}} greater efficiency with increasing complexity. Traditionally, snowmaking quality depended upon {{the skill of}} the equipment operator. Computer control supplements that skill with greater precision, such that a <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> operates only when snowmaking is optimal. All-weather snowmakers have been developed by IDE.|$|E
50|$|For the 2014-2015 season McIntyre {{upgraded}} their snowmaking system, by {{upgrading the}} water lines and purchased an additional <b>snow</b> <b>gun.</b> They also added a secondary motor in each ski lift, making them capable of running {{at a lower}} speed when necessary. Energy efficient lighting was also installed in some areas.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Georg Eisath and Walter Rieder, {{operations}} managers at the Obereggen ski resort, imported a <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> from America. Using {{this as a}} model, they constructed their first prototype. Together they founded the WI.TE company and started to produce machines in larger numbers. The first systems were built in Cortina (ITA), Falcade (ITA) and Valzoldana (ITA). In 1988, the first foreign offices was established with the Schneider company in Seefeld (AUT). In 1990, the Latemar M90 <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> was launched on the market. After sales figures rose, Eisath and Rieder brought in salesman Erich Gummerer. Together they founded TechnoAlpin GmbH in 1990. In 1996, TechnoAlpin founded its first subsidiaries in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In 2005, the company {{was transformed into a}} joint stock company. Today the company has a global network of 7 subsidiaries and 18 trading partners. TechnoAlpin has 250 employees worldwide. In 2008/2009, company revenue broke the 100 million euro barrier for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 305 centimetres of annual natural snowfall, the mountain uses 37 <b>snow</b> <b>guns,</b> covering 75% of the ski and snowboard terrain, for artificial snowmaking. With the capacity to extend the snow season into the spring and account for fluctuations in weather, the mountain invested in a self-reported $7 million in snowmaking equipment over a decade spanning the mid-1990s and 2000s.|$|R

Following the acquisition, Justice began several {{construction}} projects valued at a total of $12 million, including restaurant upgrades, a multimillion-dollar water tank and new <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> to facilitate the resort's 100% snow making coverage, as well as improvements to existing recreational facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{main focus}} of Snow City is its Snow Chamber, a 1200 sq-metre room covered with snow. The Snow Chamber is well {{maintained}} at -5°C and snow level is kept constantly at 40CM in depth. Between 10 and 15 tons of snow is created each week {{in order to maintain}} this level. The snow is produced using a special <b>Snow</b> <b>Gun,</b> which cools water using liquid nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|Mohawk Mountain is a {{ski area}} located in Cornwall, Litchfield County, Connecticut. The ski area {{was built on}} the {{northwest}} slope of Mohawk Mountain by Walt Schoenknecht in 1947. It is a popular destination for both day and night skiers and snowboarders in the Connecticut area. It is also a popular day skiing destination for the New York City Metropolitan Area demographic as it is approximately a 95-mile ride to Mohawk Mountain from Manhattan. This resort is also famous for its pioneering efforts in creating and popularizing the <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> and artificial snow.|$|E
50|$|The Mount Buller snowmaking systems use a {{combination}} system of fan and air/water guns. The system is based around a central high level water storage reservoir, pump station and central air compressor station. Large distribution pipelines deliver the water and compressed air to the various ski runs. Water and compressed air delivery hydrants are located down {{the edge of the}} runs where the snow guns are coupled using flexible snowmaking hoses. The system currently has 223 <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> connection hydrants around the mountain, of these, 81 are connected to snowmaking guns - 57 fan guns and 58 air/water guns.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, Hunter {{became the}} first area in the U.S. to install an {{automated}} snow-making system. The system installed on Racer’s Edge by York International {{was and still is}} operated remotely from the Upper Shop. This year also saw the completion of the first LiftSide condominiums. Construction and development continued into the 90’s, with lifts, trails and shops added to the complex. During the summer 2010, the resort acknowledged the need to replace the aging AA- Snowlite Express and decided that a high speed six person chairlift from Leitner-Poma would be the replacement. It was completed by opening day for the 2010-2011 season. Also new to the season were the Mid Mountain Tour and the Adventure Tower, operated by Zipline New York. 150 new <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> were also added for the 2010-2011 season. The summer of 2011 also saw some major changes, including another 150 new <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> and miscellaneous improvements to the terrain park. The biggest improvement was the installation of a new high speed quad on the west side to replace the Z and Y lifts. The new lift, named the Zephyr Express, was the former AA- Snowlite Express, which had undergone extensive renovations and new station designs.|$|R
50|$|Buildings on the {{property}} include a 6,000 square foot lodge with multiple dining options, a welcome center and a ski patrol. There are 32 <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> that cover 100% of the 28 ridable acres and can produce enough snow for a season to last 75 days. The park experiences a natural annual snowfall of 38 inches. Of the 14 trails, half are for intermediate level skiers, while the remainder are divided between beginners and advanced. It has six ski lifts of different varieties. Features include quarter pipe, hip jumps, spines, and more. Snowstar also has a tubing hill.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{considerable}} {{red tape}} {{involved in the}} construction of the resort, David urges one of his business partners to fly in to settle matters despite the snow. He hosts a large party in the resort the night of the opening, where everyone dances and drinks the night away. Caroline, after confronting David over his controlling nature, runs into Nick and they go off together to Nick's cabin. As the night goes on the snowfall increases, adding more weight to the mountain. The next morning sees the start of the ski and figure skating events, and Nick leaves Caroline in the cabin to go shoot some of the fresh snow off of the mountain with a <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> to avoid an avalanche.|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} detailed 2 H isotope diffusion measurements in {{the upper}} 3 m of firn at Summit, Greenland. Using a small <b>snow</b> <b>gun,</b> a thin snow layer was formed from 2 H-enriched water over a 6 × 6 m 2 area. We followed the diffusion process, quantified as the increase of the δ 2 H diffusion length, over a 4 -year period, by retrieving the layer once per year by drilling a firn core and slicing it into 1 cm layers and measuring the δ 2 H signal of these layers. We compared our experimental findings to calculations based on the model by Johnsen et al. (2000) and found substantial differences. The diffusion length in our experiments increased much less over the years than in the model. We discuss the possible causes for this discrepancy and conclude that several aspects of the diffusion process in firn are still poorly constrained, in particular the tortuosity...|$|E

40|$|Artificial snow resists wind, {{water and}} {{temperature}} changes better than natural snow and is increasingly {{used as a}} complement when natural snow is not enough. In snowmaking, water and energy resources are needed which are limited by the costs as well as regulations depending on where production takes place. Large quantities of water are often retrieved from lakes and then distributed over a concentrated area which disturb nearby ecosystems. Östersund ski stadium has since 2008 been storing artificial snow during summer {{in order to put}} it out early in the season, and offer both amateurs and professionals a training and competition venue from 1 November each year. With scarce resources of snow, the professional races have been possible to carry through, while exercising amateurs have been down prioritized with a delayed opening. The study's main purpose has been to investigate whether a change to another snowmaking model could improve the efficiency of snow production, especially considering that the average temperature in Jämtland is expected to increase, and therefore also increasing the use of resources. The snowmaking machine models studied has been Areco Super Snow and SMI Super Puma, both of which are fan driven snow guns powered with a total output of about 24 kW. The result shows that the <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> SMI Super Puma can increase the efficiency of snow production, thereby reducing water and energy consumption at the ski stadium. This opens possibilities for more snow to be stored and therefore enable the objective of offering cross country trails early in the season. However, the water and energy consumption in the current state is not assessed to be particularly large in comparison to Östersund municipality's total production of drinking water and energy consumption during the winter months of December to March and the stored snow piles are not considered an environmental problem...|$|E
40|$|In January 2012, a 41 year-old male snowmaker (victim) at a {{ski resort}} {{suffered}} fatal injuries after slipping off a ski trail and striking a tree. On {{the day of}} the incident, the victim was assigned to work on an expert-rated ski run with a partner to connect the snow guns with water and compressed air. Both workers wore hard hats without chin straps, ear muffs and boots with microspikes. Neither of them carried a radio. At approximately 9 AM, the victim hooked up the last <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> on the run and started walking down a lower trail (also expert rated) to get to a lift station. The lower trail was icy and not groomed. The partner took the lead traversing to the skiers left side that was less steep and then started descending. He was approximately 30 feet down the trail when he heard the victim calling for help. He turned around and saw the victim sliding {{down the middle of the}} trail in a seated position. The victim was trying to stop with his hands and feet but could not. As he was gaining speed, he slid past the partner towards the steeper side (at skiers-right) of the trail and into a wooded area (see Photo 1 for the section of the trail where the victim slid off). The partner quickly descended to reach the victim who was unconscious next to the base of a clump of trees. The partner then immediately walked down the trail to the lift station to use a phone to call the ski patrol. The ski patrol rescue team descended from the summit lodge and arrived on scene about 5 minutes after receiving the call. The rescuers extricated the victim and performed CPR while transporting him in a toboggan to the base area first aid station where the victim was pronounced dead by a coroner.

40|$|Today, {{there is}} a seldom seen {{interest}} for cross-country skiing. However, the winters are getting warmer, which causes lack of snow and hence a shortened skiing season. In order {{to solve this problem}} the company Lindbäcks Bygg plans to construct a ski tunnel at Lindbäcksstadion close to Piteå. At the request of this company, this master thesis aims to investigate different methods for an energy efficient supply of the tunnel’s snow demand. The main part of this project has considered design of systems for snow production and snow storage. Four different alternatives for the supply of snow to the tunnel have been investigated: outdoor storage and production of artificial snow, storage of natural snow and production of snow directly inside the ski tunnel or an external facility. These methods have been compared regarding energy consumption, costs and operation-related environmental impact in the terms of greenhouse gas emissions. It was found that the energy consumption was significantly higher for indoor than outdoor snow production, mainly because of the energy required for removal of the heat emitted when the water supplied to the <b>snow</b> <b>gun</b> changes phase into ice. The energy demand for storage and production of artificial snow was determined to 8. 5 MWh, which is equivalent to the demand for storage and transport of natural snow. The corresponding values for snow production inside the ski tunnel and the external production facility were calculated to 1. 5 and 1. 1 GWh respectively. From an economic perspective, outdoor snow production is also preferable. The highest investment cost is to be found for the external production facility. The operating costs are however higher for snow production inside the ski tunnel and notably lower for the two snow storage alternatives. The environmental impact related to operation is very low for all the alternatives, provided that the electricity demand is supplied by renewable sources. The highest greenhouse gas emissions are related to the transport and storage of natural snow. This alternative is also associated with high climate dependency and uncertainties regarding the snow quality, and is thus not appropriate to realize. Outdoor production and storage of snow is most favourable in regard to energy consumption, costs and environmental impact and is therefore the alternative that is primarily recommended for implementation at Lindbäcksstadion. If there are very high requirements on the snow quality, the snow should instead be produced in a controlled environment, preferably inside an external production facility.

40|$|Skier numbers, and {{revenues}} for the multi-billion-dollar ski industry, are highly sensitive to snow cover. Previous research projected that under climate change, natural snow cover will become inadequate at 65 % of {{sites in the}} Australian ski resorts by 2020. Resorts plan to compensate for reduced snowfall through additional snowmaking. For the six main resorts, however, this would require over 700 additional <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> by 2020, requiring ~US $ 100 million in capital investment, and 2, 500 - 3, 300 ML of water per month, as well as increased energy consumption. This is not practically feasible, especially as less water will be available. Therefore, low altitude ski resorts such as these {{may not be able}} to rely on snowmaking even for short-term adaptation to climate change. Instead, they are likely to seek conversion to summer activities and increased property development. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentFull Tex...|$|R
50|$|Intrawest renamed its {{holdings}} Mountain Creek {{and began}} pouring money into its new investment to refurbish the resort. Intrawest removed 11 of the 13 lifts, {{replacing them with}} a high-speed eight-passenger open-air gondola, known as The Cabriolet, along with two high-speed quad chairlifts and multiple-fix grip chairs, all built by Doppelmayr. The Great Gorge Lodge, which hadn't been refurbished in nearly 30 years, underwent an update of its interior and was renamed Mountain Creek South Lodge. Intrawest also made investments in the mountain's snowmaking, installing more than 1,600 new <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> throughout the mountain. The new resort opened in December 1998. Intrawest also began construction on Action Park, removing all the amusement rides except for the Alpine Slide and Bungee Tower, {{as well as the}} Motorworld section of the park, and began work on the Waterworld section of the park. The water park reopened as Mountain Creek Waterpark in the summer of 1998.|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} in the snowmaking process is to add air using an air plant. This plant is often a {{building}} which contains electric or diesel industrial air compressors the size of a van or truck. However, in some instances air compression is provided using diesel-powered, portable trailer-mounted compressors which can be added to the system. Many fan-type <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> have on-board electric air compressors, which allows for cheaper, and more compact operation. A ski area may have the required high-output water pumps, but not an air pump. Onboard compressors are cheaper and easier than having a dedicated pumping house. The air is generally cooled and excess moisture is removed before it is sent out of the plant. Some systems even cool the water before it enters the system. This improves the snowmaking process as the less heat in the air and water, the less heat must be dissipated to the atmosphere to freeze the water. From this plant the air travels up a separate pipeline following the same path as the water pipeline.|$|R
50|$|Camelback Mountain (Big Pocono) itself reaches an {{elevation}} of 2,133 feet (650 m).

50|$|Each {{year the}} ICEHOTEL {{receives}} applications from artists {{around the world}} to design the imaginative suites. In 2013 over 200 requests were submitted by different artists with different qualifications - including theatre, structural design, camerawork and interior design. The artists will start the work in Jukkasjarvi starting each year in November to build the suites. When the temperature drops and the <b>snow</b> <b>guns</b> start humming on the Torne River shore, usually in mid-November, the building process begins. The snow is sprayed on huge inverted catenary shaped steel forms and allowed to freeze. After a couple of days, the forms are removed, leaving a maze of free-standing corridors of snow. In the corridors, dividing walls are built in order to create rooms and suites. Ice blocks are then transported into the hotel, where selected artists start creating the art and design of the perishable material. The Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi opens in phases. The first phase opens in the beginning of December. For each week, another section of the hotel opens up for visitors and guests until the beginning of January. At this time, the entire construction is completed.|$|R
