500|$|In 1822, {{the first}} animal {{protection}} law was enacted in the British parliament, {{followed by the}} Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: [...] "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite {{agree that it is}} justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not <b>say</b> <b>another</b> <b>word</b> about it, else I shall not sleep to-night." [...] In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists [...] "mutual benefit and protection", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 [...] "to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them".|$|E
2500|$|Before 1966, local announcers {{exclusively}} {{called the}} World Series. Typically, the Gillette Company, the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC television would choose the announcers, who would represent {{each of the}} teams {{that were in the}} World Series for the respective year. For the 1966 World Series, Curt Gowdy called half of each game before ceding the microphone to Vin Scully in Los Angeles, and Chuck Thompson in Baltimore. Scully was not satisfied with the arrangement as he said [...] "What about the road? My fans won't be able to hear me." [...] In Game 1 of the 1966 World Series, Scully called the first 4½ innings. When Gowdy inherited the announcing reins, Scully was so upset that he refused to <b>say</b> <b>another</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{arriving}} at the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and a wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. Chris Carroll, the first Las Vegas police officer to arrive on the scene, heard Shakur's last words, [...] "fuck you". Carroll reports that he refused to <b>say</b> <b>another</b> <b>word</b> to him or another officer. According to {{an interview with the}} music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, Shakur received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record company and threatened Shakur. Gobi informed the Las Vegas police but said that the police claimed to be understaffed. No attackers came. At the hospital, Shakur was heavily sedated, was placed on life-support machines, and was ultimately put under a barbiturate-induced coma after repeatedly {{trying to get out of}} the bed.|$|E

2500|$|... "By the way, some of {{you have}} been reading wikipedia.com. I'm {{featured}} there. I'm so honored to be included there in what is sometimes {{little more than a}} scandalous website. But when you read there that I referred to Ray Gates as [...] "Father Ray," [...] I want you to know, {{with all due respect to}} everybody, it ain't so. It never happened. I will deny it until my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth and I can't get enough breath to <b>say</b> <b>another</b> <b>word.</b> It didn't happen. And it won't happen. He's not my father. I have a heavenly father who's in a class all by himself. I had an earthly father who in my opinion was in a class all by himself.
