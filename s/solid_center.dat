500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season one, Monica is 25 years old. Rita Loiacono of SheKnows Media believes that Monica is the show's most fully realized character {{from the very beginning}} of the series because her [...] "quirks were developed to a tee." [...] Like several strong female sitcom characters who were popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Monica possesses a natural maternal instinct, constantly [...] "vocalising a desire for motherhood." [...] As the group's [...] "unofficial den mother," [...] Monica occupies the role of their mother hen, and is thus often perceived as the most level-headed member of the sextet, with Ken Parish Perkins of the Chicago Tribune identifying Monica as the show's most grounded character. Jill O'Rourke of Crushable described her as [...] "the glue that held the group together." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly believes that Monica serves as [...] "the <b>solid</b> <b>center</b> in a circle of wacky pals" [...] due to her [...] "sunny" [...] personality, combined with the fact that she maintains a secure job while appearing to possess the most common sense. Furthermore, Tucker identified Monica as the show's [...] "straight woman." [...] Writing for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor believes that Monica exhibits [...] "the strongest ties to reality" [...] as the sitcom's most realistically portrayed character. Bustle's James Tison agreed that Monica is the show's most relatable character. Referring to Monica as one-half of the series' [...] "head friends," [...] the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Robert Bianco described the character as sensible, explaining that both her and brother Ross represent [...] "the relatively stable centers around which the other friends rotate." [...] Describing her as [...] "ultra-competent," [...] Natural Living Todays Emily Nussbaum likened Monica to the fairy tale character Snow White, on whose homemaking skills the five other main characters heavily rely, similar to the relationship between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Although Monica began Friends as the show's straight person, the writers eventually made her funnier by incorporating aspects of Cox's own personality into the character, in addition to writing wittier material for her.|$|E

Nanodots deposited from precursors {{with various}} SiCl 4 /CH 2 Cl 2 concentration ratios appeared {{to follow a}} universal lateral size versus beam dose trend. In addition to secondary electrons, the primary beam intensity is further important for determining the detailed structure of the deposited material: a fixed beam with lower intensity resulted in <b>solid</b> <b>centered</b> nanodots, while deposition under a strong beam resulted in hollow-centered nanostructures; a scanning beam with lower intensity tends to generate branched line structures, while deposition under a strong scanning beam is effective in creating unbranched nanolines on the Si 3 N 4 substrate.

The first Byrdlands were slim, custom built, L-5 models for guitarists Billy Byrd and Hank Garland. Later, a shorter neck was added. Other models such as the ES-350T and the ES-225T were introduced as less costly alternatives. In 1958, Gibson introduced the ES-335T model.
