5|$|Gebhard is chiefly {{noted for}} his {{conversion}} to the reformed doctrines, {{and for his}} marriage with the reportedly beautiful Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben, a canoness of Gerresheim. After living in concubinage with Agnes for two years, he decided, perhaps by the persuasion of her brothers, to marry her, doubtless intending {{at the same time}} to resign his <b>see.</b> <b>Other</b> counsels, however, prevailed.|$|E

5|$|Why Æthelberht {{chose to}} convert to Christianity is uncertain. Bede {{suggests}} that the king converted strictly for religious reasons, but most modern historians <b>see</b> <b>other</b> motives behind Æthelberht's decision. Certainly, given Kent's close contacts with Gaul, {{it is possible that}} Æthelberht sought baptism in order to smooth his relations with the Merovingian kingdoms, or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul. Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion, whether directly from the newly introduced church or indirectly from other Christian kingdoms.|$|E

5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to <b>see</b> <b>other</b> markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E
5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can <b>see</b> <b>other</b> children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to <b>see.</b> <b>Other</b> colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E

5|$|The {{church is}} thought to stand on, or near, {{the site of the}} first church {{established}} by St Erchard, the patron saint of Kincardine O'Neil, who brought Christianity here in the 5th century. He was taught at nearby Banchory by St Ternan. The church is located near a river (as common in early Christian sites), in this case the River Dee. There was an important river crossing point here, on the main route between Strathmore and Mar. The current church remains are thought to date to the 14th century. It was recorded that the church was built as a gift by Duncan, Earl of Fife. Alexander Kyninmund, Bishop of Aberdeen, rebuilt the church some time in the mid 14th century. A hospital was attached to the east of the church (thought to be in 1330) but was demolished some time before the church itself went out of use, leaving just the foundation stones (There was also an earlier hospital site in Kincardine O'Neil - <b>see</b> <b>other</b> site, 'Kincardine O'Neil Hospital Site'.). The church became ruinous after a new church was built in 1862. The interior was later converted into burial plots. The graveyard surrounding the church has many gravestones, mostly from the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Peer {{evaluations}} of performance increasingly {{are being used}} to make organizational decisions and to provide individuals with performance related feedback. Using Kenny’s social relations model (SRM), data from 14 teams of undergraduate students who completed performance ratings of themselves and other team members were analyzed. Results indicated a significant target variance effect for the majority of performance dimensions and a significant perceiver variance effect for all performance dimensions. Results further indicated that, in general, how individuals see themselves is not congruent with how <b>others</b> <b>see</b> them, how individuals see themselves is congruent with how they <b>see</b> <b>others,</b> how individuals are seen on a particular dimension is related to how they are <b>seen</b> on <b>other</b> performance dimensions, and, how a person is <b>seen</b> by <b>others</b> does not relate to how that individual <b>sees</b> <b>others.</b> Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research using the SRM are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The Battle of Wilkomierz (<b>see</b> <b>other</b> names) {{took place}} on September 1, 1435 near Ukmergė in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the help of {{military}} units from the Kingdom of Poland, the forces of Grand Duke Sigismund Kęstutaitis soundly defeated Švitrigaila and his Livonian allies. The battle was a decisive engagement of the Lithuanian Civil War (1432–38). Švitrigaila lost most of his supporters and withdrew to southern Grand Duchy; he was slowly pushed out and eventually made peace. The damage inflicted upon the Livonian Order {{has been compared to}} the damage of Battle of Grunwald upon the Teutonic Order. It was fundamentally weakened and ceased {{to play a major role}} in Lithuanian affairs. The battle can be seen as the final engagement of the Lithuanian Crusade.|$|E

40|$|How {{are people}} who {{generally}} <b>see</b> <b>others</b> positively evaluated themselves? We propose {{that the answer to}} this question crucially hinges on the content domain: We hypothesize that Agency follows a “zero-sum principle” and therefore people who <b>see</b> <b>others</b> as high in Agency are perceived as low in Agency themselves. In contrast, we hypothesize that Communion follows a “non-zero-sum principle” and therefore people who <b>see</b> <b>others</b> as high in Communion are perceived as high in Communion themselves. We tested these hypotheses in a round-robin and a half-block study. Perceiving others as agentic was indeed linked to being perceived as low in Agency. To the contrary, perceiving others as communal was linked to being perceived as high in Communion, but only when people directly interacted with each other. These results help to clarify the nature of Agency and Communion and offer explanations for divergent findings in the literature...|$|R
