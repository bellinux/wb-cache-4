40|$|Improving {{fertilizer}} {{practice at}} the level of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>adviser</b> and grower has become closely linked with a number of diverse public issues that would not have been associated with fertilizer use some 25 years ago. As governments implement policy decisions that change how we use plant nutrients, environmental regulation and health issues are balanced with the need to provide food security at a global level (Windridge 1998). Environment, health, food security: these are all issues that that most people will have strong opinions about and it is in all of our interests that views are not, and do not become, ill-informed or distorted. If <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> can provide an assurance that they are being kept up to date on new technologies and management methods then it is perceived that they are responsible enough to deal with maximizing resource efficiency. The aim of this paper is to show that one of the most important routes for the development of technical information transfer in agricultural industry is from the research community (past and present) to the adviser profession. Access to agricultural and environmental information is more open than ever before in the UK (DETR 1998) and it is obviously in the interests of the management of agricultural companies to be kept up to date and informed on latest research and policy developments. Agricultural fertilizer use in the UK is increasingly being regulated by policies that are enacted to maintain or improve air, water and soil quality (MAFF 199...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{changes and}} the {{associated}} higher frequency of heat waves in Middle-European countries will aggravate occupational heat stress experienced by Slovenian workers. Appropriate behavioral adaptations are important coping strategies and it is pertinent to establish if knowledge among advisers and workers is sufficient and identify the symptoms experienced by workers. Therefore a survey including 230 farmers and 86 <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> was completed. Thermal comfort ranged from hot to extremely hot for 85 ± 5  % of farmers working outside and heat stress had {{a negative impact on}} well-being (74 ± 6  %), productivity (68 ± 6  %) and concentration (34 ± 6  %). Reported symptoms were excessive sweating (84 ± 5  %), thirst (81 ± 5  %), and tiredness (59 ± 6  %). Women had a higher prevalence of headache (64 ± 10  %) compared to males (47 ± 8  %), higher frequency of fatigue (69 ± 10 vs 56 ± 8  %), and incidents with nausea or vomiting (19 ± 8 vs 9 ± 5  %). 81 ± 4  % of the responders reported that more time is required to complete tasks when the weather is hot. Nevertheless, 61 ± 6  % of farmers have never been informed of the impacts of heat stress and 29 ± 10  % of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> does not include this information in their guidance. This emphasizes the need for increased information and implementation of feasible solutions to mitigate the negative impact of heat stress on workers in the agricultural sector. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDrawing on a socio-historical {{analysis}} {{of the work of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers,</b> this article explores the conduct of modernisation policy following the Second World War. The advisers {{played a crucial role in}} this, by recommending new methods of production and encouraging farmers to mobilise as a group. They relied ontechnical know-how as well as their practical knowledge of the agricultural milieu. Above all, they showed huge ingenuity in demonstrating their devotion to their farmer clients, without evading the framework set by their employers. These capacities for adaptation so essential to their profession were initially highly valued. Then, from the 1970 s onwards, they attracted criticism for their failure to conform to the new imperatives of bureaucratisation, specialisation and commercialisation in agricultural advice...|$|R
