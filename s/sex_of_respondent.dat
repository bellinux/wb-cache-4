The three aspects of sexual behavior studied were necking, petting, and coitus. The effect of the variables of <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> and religious orthodoxy were explored. Religious orthodoxy was determined by using the scale developed by Snell Putney and Russell Middleton. In addition, the thesis compared the premarital sexual behavior of the students at the church-college to that of students at secular schools. A questionnaire was used to collect the data. responses were cross-classified with the variables of <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> and religious orthodoxy and Chi-square was computed to determine if the variables were related to sexual behavior.

40|$|ABSTRACT- 4 As {{it becomes}} {{socially}} less:acceptable to appear prejudiced, {{the difficulty in}} obtaining unbiased measures of attitudes toward women increases. The Situationil Attitude Scale-Women (SASW) was developed to. overcome this methodological. difficulty. The SASW consists of two parallel forms, one containing neutral situations involving "i person " and one containing situations involving "a woman. " These two forms control for positive bias. The SASW was completed by 334 dollege freshmen. R;sults showed that 55 of the 100 items-on the SASW elicited responses which were significantly different by form and 48 items elicited responses which differed significantly by <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent.</b> Interactions (N= 32) between form and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> {{were found to be}} significant. While many of they attitudes toward women. in various situations were positive,, much of thii positivity may beinterpreted as attributable to sex stereotyping. (Author/NRB) t j...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} if mental health literacy for depression is a multidimensional construct, {{and sought to}} identify its components and to construct empirically derived questionnaire subscales. Following a literature review, items were generated to produce five conceptual subscales. These were administered to 228 respondents (136 females, 92 males), along with others measuring psychological constructs of theoretical relevance, specifically assessing: emotional intelligence, mindfulness, interdependence and independence, rebelliousness, and depressive symptomatology. Principal components analysis of the 38 -item pool confirmed a 3 -factor solution: (1) Knowledge and belief in psychological strategies for reducing depression, (2) Ability to recognise depression, and (3) Knowledge and beliefs in positive self-care habits for reducing depression. These components comprise the Public Understanding of Depression Questionnaire (PUDQ). Interdependence, emotional intelligence, <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> and previous history of medication for mental health difficulties {{were found to be}} independently predictive of scores on the PUDQ subscales, supporting their construct validity, with Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients indicating their internal reliability.

Each of the photo reproductions was presented with a fictional descriptive sentence giving information on the depicted individual 2 ̆ 7 s social status (high or low) and character (history of cheating, irrelevant information, or history of trustworthiness). A week later subjects again rated photos-half repeated and half new-this time, without descriptions. Subjects were asked to report which of the photos they remembered from the previous week. Responses were analyzed in a 2 X 3 x 2 factorial design, with the third factor being <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent.</b> The predicted bias-that subjects would preferentially recognize faces initially presented as those of cheaters-was confirmed. There were also two significant interations: (1) the bias was mitigated when the face was also presented as a person of high status; and (2) the bias was stronger for males than for females. The results support the idea that we have evolved highly selective attention and storage mechanisms for processing social information, and that both character (cheating potential) and status are important features in the engagement of these mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Although {{gender is}} often {{acknowledged}} as a determinant of health, measuring its components, other than biological sex, is uncommon. The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) quantifies self-attribution of traits, indicative of gender roles. The BSRI {{has been used}} with participants across cultures and countries, but rarely in an older population in Brazil, as we have done in this study. Our primary objective {{was to determine whether}} the BSRI- 12 can be used to explore gender in an older Brazilian population. METHODS: The BSRI was completed by volunteer participants, all community dwelling adults aged 65 + living in Natal, Brazil. Exploratory factor analysis was performed, followed by a varimax rotation (orthogonal solution) for iteration to examine the underlying gender roles of feminine, masculine, androgynous and undifferentiated, and to validate the BSRI in older adults in Brazil. RESULTS: The 278 participants, (80 men, 198 women) were 65 - 99 years old (average 73. 6 for men, 74. 7 for women). Age difference between sexes was not significant (p = 0. 22). A 12 item version of the BSRI (BSRI- 12) previously validated among Spanish seniors was used and showed validity with 5 BSRI- 12 items (Cronbach= 0. 66) loading as feminine, 6 items (Cronbach= 0. 51) loading onto masculine roles and neither overlapping with the category of biological <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Although the BSRI- 12 appears to be a valid indicator of gender among elderly Brazilians, the gender role status identified with the BSRI- 12 was not correlated with being male or female...|$|E

40|$|The {{heart of}} this {{dissertation}} is the SCAPULA Information Retrieval System, used to create, maintain, and retrieve coded archaeological data for the Upper Wabash Drainage at the Archaeology Laboratory of Ball State University. Several existing archaeological data banks were surveyed and classified at first, and different file organizations, computer software and hardware were reviewed next using as a major criterion the needs of archaeologists at Ball State {{in order to determine}} the characteristics of the SCAPULA System. The encoding instructions and retrieval keywords are illustrated and listed, while the functions of the SCAPULA are introduced. With its straightforward query instructions and examples, the SCAPULA Information Retrieval System, a relational data bank, is very easy to use. The present study sought to examine the impact of victim-observer similarity, victim physical attractiveness, outcome severity and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> on responsibility attributions made toward a rape victim. Perceived attitudinal similarity, victim physical attractiveness, and outcome severity were experimentally varied. In addition this study sought to further examine sex differences, which prior research has indicated may influence how a rape victim is perceived. A modified version of Alexander's (1980) scale was used to measure the degree of responsibility attributed to the victim, to the assailant, to society and to chance in each condition. A research design was developed using two levels of each of the four factors. The experiment was conducted during regular class periods. The population consisted of 198 male and female undergraduate students. Prior to the actual experiment, Ss were randomly assigned to review an attitude questionnaire (supposedly completed by the victim), which was either similar or dissimilar to one completed previously by themselves. The attitude survey used in this study was the Important Issues Questionnaire (Novak & Lerner, 1968). The study was conducted such that Ss perceived the victim to be either like or unlike themselves in basic attitudes. Ss were then asked to view a videotape in which a sexual assault victim was interviewed. The victim was actually an actress who read a prepared script. Outcome severity was varied by the use of written vignettes and by the victim's (actress's) narration of either having suffered an attempted rape or a rape with physical injuries. Physical attractiveness was varied by the use of cosmetics and dress. Ss were tested in groups. Each group saw only one of the four videotapes. Ss were debriefed following the experiment. The study was designed to answer the following research questions: 1. Would Ss make significantly different responsibility attributions toward a victim they perceived as similar to themselves than toward a victim they perceived as dissimilar to themselves? 2. Would Ss make significantly different responsibility attributions toward a victim who suffered a non-severe outcome than toward a victim who suffered a severe outcome? 3. Would male Ss make significantly different attributions of responsibility toward a physically attractive victim than toward a physically unattractive victim? 4. Would the respondent's sex significantly affect the degree of responsibility attributed to the victim?A 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance was used to test the four research hypothesis. Significance was considered at an alpha level of. 05. FindingsThe results of this study indicated that no significant difference existed for similarity, outcome severity, <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> or physical attractiveness. There was however, a tendency for Ss to attribute more responsibility to the victim who had suffered a severe outcome, and also for the assailant in that condition to be assigned a harsher penalty. ConclusionPrior research in the area of rape victim culpability has offered conflicting results. The present study sought to provide clarity to the findings of previous research. Further research is needed in this area to gain a clearer understanding of factors which influence how victims of sexual assault are perceived. Thesis (Ph. D. ...|$|E

Student affairs employees in a contemporary university span multiple boundaries while providing services to current, former, and future students. However, {{little is known about the}} nature and function of boundary spanning activity (BSA) in student affairs work. This study examined employee interaction with persons outside their student affairs unit at a large, public university. Research questions guided the investigation of the nature and extent of BSA and the perceived purposes and experiences with BSA. Actual BSA included time involvement, focus, mode, specificity, and initiation of the interaction. Hierarchical level and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> were examined for moderating effects. Activity log and questionnaire data were obtained from 145 employees, hierarchically classified as administrative, professional/managerial, supervisory/technical, or support personnel. Data were analyzed and tested for significance through chi-square tests, factor analysis, and analysis of variance. Results indicated that student affairs workers spent a meaningful amount of time engaged in boundary spanning, and that the nature and extent of BSA varied significantly among hierarchy levels. Most BSA was initiated by others and was focused on students or on persons within the university rather than on persons outside the university. Student affairs workers used unscheduled and telephone modes of BSA more often than scheduled or written modes, and generally perceived their actions as standardized-routine. However, administrative and professional/managerial personnel commonly perceived their actions as discretionary-judgmental. Few actions were classified as creative-innovative. External representation was perceived as the predominant function of BSA. Within this function, the perceived primary purposes involved giving information and knowledge, and establishing credibility and rapport. Generally, employees had positive perceptions of the value and tone of their experiences with BSA; but perceptions of the structure and frequency of BSA were mixed or slightly negative. The results showed that employees were not maximizing the potential for information processing and proactive outreach BSA...|$|E

A sample of 403 college volunteers completed questionnaires which were designed to assess their attitudes toward abuse as it occurred in three separate vignettes depicting situations of emotional dependency, stress, and severity of abuse. Two variables, sex of the initiator and intensity of the situation, were manipulated in each vignette to determine the extent of their influence on attitudes toward the abuse. The research design required that four forms of the survey be developed for each vignette to reflect all possible combinations of the intensity (high and low) and sex of initiator (male and female) variables. The vignettes were counterbalanced to prevent ordering effects and the surveys were randomly distributed while controlling for sex of the respondent to ensure that equal numbers of males and equal numbers of females received each form of the survey. Separate 2 (sex of initiator) x 2 (intensity) x 2 (sex of the respondent) MANOVA's were conducted for each of the three precipitating circumstances with "necessary" and "normal" responses as dependent variables and sex of initiator, intensity, and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> as independent variables. Then three separate ANOVA's were conducted with the sum of the previous two responses as a "total" acceptance score or dependent variable and the same independent variables. Results indicate that it is more acceptable for females to initate abuse than for males to do so. With respect to intensity, it was found that respondents are more lenient in their assessment of abuse which occurs in high-intensity stress situations and low-intensity severity of abuse situations. No significant results were reported for emotional dependency. In terms of sex of the respondent, it was found that male respondents were more accepting of abuse in the severity situation than were females...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} {{to marry and}} choice of mate are two issues contemplated by most individuals during their lifetime. It is our belief that {{the manner in which}} an individual makes these decisions is a reflection of that individual’s level of emotional maturity. In our society, the right to enter into a marriage agreement is largely determined by chronological age. Our research problem began with the hypothesis that there is no direct relationship between chronological age and emotional maturity at the time of marriage. For our study, marriages were divided into two general categories: 1) teenage marriages in which at least one partner was 20 years of age or younger, and 2) adult marriages in which one partner was Z 1 years of age or older. The three independent variables studied were: age, <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent,</b> and sex of spouse. The dependent variable was emotional maturity. Emotional maturity was operationally defined by a questionnaire consisting of 67 statements about why people decide to marry, and why they chose their particular spouse. A panel of 12 experts in the field of marriage counseling were asked to rate each statement on a seven point scale of maturity-immaturity. The range and mode for each statement was computed and used to construct a new questionnaire consisting of 30 statements. Emotional maturity was defined by the absolute difference between the individual respondent’s rating and the expert’s modal response. A sample population was selected using recently married individuals who had applied for marriage licenses in Multnomah County, Oregon. The second questionnaire was mailed to the respondents. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was used to identify which variable or combination of variables accounted for any discrepancy. A multiple regression analysis and a F test were run to test the hypothesis of the study. The data received supported the null hypothesis. However, there were several conceptual and methodological limitations to the study which raise questions as to the reliability of the measuring instrument and use of the concept of emotional maturity...|$|E
40|$|Globally {{malnutrition}} {{is responsible}} for nearly half (45 %) of all deaths in children under fiveand responsible for around 3. 1 million deaths annually. Agricultural products provideenergy, protein, vitamins and minerals and critical to addressing malnutrition, particularlyamong children. Dairy products {{play a key role}} in healthy human nutrition and developmentthroughout life especially, in childhood because of the concentrated source of macro andmicronutrients. The aim of this study was to assess nutritional status of children two to fiveyears’ old, cow’s milk consumption pattern and other associated factors. Community basedcross-sectional survey was conducted in Kilteawlaelo district from April to June 2015. A totalof 530 households were included using two stage sampling technique. Mothers/care giverswere interviewed after consent was given to obtain the information on child care and feedingpractices. Anthropometric measurements were used to assess the nutritional status of children 2 to 5 years old. Among the 530 sampled children 19 % and 81 % was living in urban andrural respectively. The prevalence of stunting, underweight and wasting was 43 %, 26 % and 10. 9 % respectively. The Bivariate analysis, using chi square test revealed that marital status,occasion of soap use for hand washing, sex of care giver, most commonly consumed cereals,father’s occupation and birthplace showed significant association with all three indicators ofundernutrition. The multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regressions modeldemonstrated that age of children and commonly consumed cereals were significant predictorof stunting and underweight; mother’s educational level was significant predictor of wastingand underweight; sex of child, child vaccination status, source of cow milk and mother’soccupation were significant predictor of wasting only; marital status, occasion of soap use,father’s educational level and birthplace were significant predictor of stunting only; and sexof respondent were significant predictor of underweight only. The results of this studyindicate that under nutrition among 2 to 5 years old children is still a problem in Kilteawlaelodistrict. Child age, mother’s and father’s educational level, mother’s occupation, source ofcow milk, <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> and child, child vaccine, marital status, commonly consumedcereal and occasion of soap use were found to be significant risk factors of malnutrition.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} partial {{results of}} primary research on consumer purchasing behaviour {{with regards to}} the utilization of product leaflets. It deals with the consumer reaction on the use of these leaflets. The main goal is to assess the impulse to purchase goods on the basis of promotional leaflets in mailboxes, depending on the personal characteristics of the consumer. Partial goals are a brief theoretical basis of the examined issues and selected results of secondary research on consumer behaviour based on available statistical data and information. Consumer behaviour changes drastically in times of crisis. Czech consumer is addressed daily by a specific communication media of store chains – the leaflets. These appear daily in mailboxes and are generally positively accepted. There are also negative opinions, both from consumers as well as the EU. Respondents were asked about their financial situation, to what extent they change their buying behaviour with respect to the income level of households. It turned out that the impulse to purchase goods on the basis of promotional leaflets in mailboxes does not depend on the age and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents,</b> but depends on the income level and education. The largest proportion <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> considers leaflets because of promotional discounts...|$|R
40|$|The {{courts have}} made how women respond to alleged sexual {{harassment}} a primary issue in determining if legal sexual harassment has occurred. There is {{an expectation that}} women who are harassed, {{often referred to as}} targets of harassment, will demonstrate that the behavior was unwelcome by reporting the incident. There is limited empirical support for this notion that observers' judgments of harassment are influenced by the demonstration of unwelcomeness through the target's response. This study investigated this notion by examining what factors impact observers' ratings of sexual harassment and evaluations of the target of harassment and her response in sexual harassment scenarios by including several manipulated contextual variables. The target's response, the frequency of the alleged harassing behavior, and the target's history of complaining about other workplace conditions were manipulated. Respondents (an undergraduate sample of psychology students) read a lengthy written scenario of a sexual harassment trial. The <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>respondent</b> was also recorded to determine if this variable affected the ratings and evaluations. The frequency of the alleged harassing behavior, the target's history of complaining about other workplace conditions, and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>respondent</b> produced reliable differences in sexual harassment ratings. These ratings were higher in the conditions where the behavior was more frequent, the target did not have a history of complaining about other workplace conditions, and when the respondent was female. These same variables produced reliable differences in ratings of the target, with the target being viewed more favorably when the behavior was more frequent, the target did not have a history of complaining about other workplace conditions, and when the respondent was female. The target's response and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>respondent</b> produced reliable differences in ratings of the target's response with reporting the behavior having the highest ratings of appropriateness and men having higher ratings of response effectiveness than women in all conditions. Contrary to assumptions made in the law that reporting serves as a signal that the behavior was unwelcome and therefore harassing, target response did not impact any ratings of harassment or evaluations of the target...|$|R
