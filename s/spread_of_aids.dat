Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E

40|$|The 1980 s was {{a decade}} when {{homosexuality}} was frequently debated {{because of the}} contemporary incoming <b>of</b> <b>aids.</b> Since aids first affected homo- and bisexual men they became stigmatized as the risk group. The Swedish authorities started to act with epidemical methods at 1985 / 86, which restricted the sexual minority. This study, unlike others made before, contextualizes the lawmaking of Bastuklubbslagen, a prohibition concerning gaysaunas, by analyzing it with queer theoretic perspectives. Through an investigation of Bastuklubbslagen and contemporary sexual norms, this survey shows that the making of distinctions between hetero- and homosexuality were central to {{the context of the}} lawmaking. The outcome primarily shows that sexual norms were linked to a heteronormative point of view when Bastuklubbslagen was motivated by the authorities. Heteronormative ideals about monogamy and twosomeness made impact on the founding of the law. Sex between men was pointed out as harmful and gaysaunas as the explicit locations for the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>aids.</b> My survey is contextualizing behaviors as the authorities described meant a risk of being infected by aids, or to spread it. My study has shown that homo- and bisexuals were regarded as the active actors <b>of</b> <b>aids</b> increasing, while the heterosexual majority was passivated. In the field of historical queer studies this study enhances the greatness of heterosexual normativity within the stigmatization and sanctions made by the authorities’, as Bastuklubbslagen became an aids prevention strategy...|$|R

25|$|As raids {{occur to}} brothels that may house sex workers {{as well as}} sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general.

The physician's task of prevention is part of the comprehensive strategy of HIV-prevention in Switzerland (effect in width and depth on population- and target groups and on the individual level). It is naturally the physician's domain to look after and counsel individually. Most variable possibilities of beginning a conversation about Aids prevention offer themselves to him. He should put the indication for this as generous as possible and deal extensively with a possible risky behaviour which might not be conscious to both the patient and the physician. The HIV antibody test is indicated in certain situations, however the pre- and posttest counselling is in any case much more decisive than the result of the test. The preventive measures recommended up to now for the most important ways of transmission (sexual contact, intravenous drug use, perinatal transmission, blood/blood products) are still valid without modification...|$|R

500|$|In {{the second}} chapter Lewis {{discusses}} his history in Africa, {{beginning in the}} 1960s as an English teacher in Ghana.

He acknowledges the brain drain trend, noting [...] "there are more Malawian doctors in Manchester [...] than in Malawi". In the third chapter Lewis examines how the UN, World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) failed to fulfill promises of free access to primary education. In the instances where school entry fees were eliminated, additional fees (e.g. fees for uniforms, books, exams, and registration) had the same effect of limiting access. The fourth chapter elaborates on how women's issues are ignored or dismissed at international conferences and by African governments. Lewis identifies the gender discrimination that occurs even within the UN organization, whose management staff was dominated by males. He links the World Bank and IMF conditions of low social spending on education and healthcare by governments of recipient countries to the rampant <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> in those same countries.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{research}} paper {{is based on}} the perception of people over the death by HIV and Aids. It looks at the impact of culture and beliefs on the management <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids</b> in the community and also in the country as whole. This research aims to establish the root course of covering death of by HIV and Aids, often due to fear of discrimination and isolation. Communities need to be educated on discrimination and stigma that comes about with people living with HIV and Aids. This study was conducted at Mvelaphanda Primary School children, in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in Gauteng, South Africa. The main focus was on the death of parents of the learners at the school and ultimately learners themselves, who some of them where born with HIV epidemic. Some of the children became orphans of the disease. The collection of data was in three fold: questionnaire, interview and observation and discussions. The information gathered was manipulated to bring about the expected results. Analysis of the data indicated that where there is no behavioral and attitude change, there would be more death by the pandemic than ever before. It is the responsibility of everyone, be it heads of families, religious leaders, politicians, business people and teachers to fight against the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids</b> pandemic. This study has also discovered that medical report on the cause of death is concealed in order for policies to payout. This distortion of information does not help in the fight against the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids</b> All stakeholders should work together in the support of those will disclose their status without fear of rejection, isolation and discriminated against. Schools, churches and community gatherings should be better used as a plat-form for that. If such conditions are created the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the HIV will be reduced and the prevention strategy will succeed. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die navorsing handel oor die persepsie van mense teenoor dood as gevolg van MIV/Vigs. Dit ondersoek die impak van kultuur en geloof op die bestuur van MIV/Vigs binne 'n gemeenskap in die besonder en binne die land in die algemeen. Die doel van die navorsing was om die grondoorsaak waarom daar dikwels gediskrimeer word teenoor persone wat sterf weens MIV te identifiseer en om te bepaal waarom mense wat met MIV leef dikwels “uitgewerp” word uit die gemeenskap. Die studie is gedoen by die Mvelaphanda Primêre Skool in Tembisa, in die Ekuhuleni Metropool van die Gauteng provinsie van Suid-Afrika. Die primêre fokus van die studie was op die invloed wat die dood as gevolg van Vigs op die kinders in die skool gehad het. Data is ingesamel deur middel van vraelyste en onderhoude asook deur waarneming en besprekings. Ontleding van die data het aangetoon dat indien daar nie positiewe gedragverandering plaasvind nie, daar meer sterftes as gevolg van Vigs verwag kan word.
