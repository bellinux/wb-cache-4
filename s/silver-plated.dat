5|$|The major use {{of silver}} besides coinage {{throughout}} most of history was {{in the manufacture of}} jewellery and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver; in fact, most silverware is only <b>silver-plated</b> rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. <b>Silver-plated</b> glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum flasks, and Christmas tree decorations.|$|E
5|$|The church {{furniture}} (pews, pulpit, reading {{desk and}} chancel rail) {{is from the}} 19th century; all the items are all decorated with trefoil holes. A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded some plain <b>silver-plated</b> items (chalice, paten, flagon and alms dish) without inscriptions or dates.|$|E
5|$|The trophy for {{the main}} award is a <b>silver-plated</b> four-turret lens camera, and for the other awards smaller imitations of the main trophy are used. All of the BBC local regions hold their own {{independent}} award ceremonies, which take place before the main ceremony and are used to compile a shortlist for the BBC Sports Unsung Hero Award.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is useful}} in the {{manufacture}} of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver crucibles (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat) are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often <b>silver-plated.</b> Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment.|$|E
5|$|The James Mortimer Memorial Silver Trophy {{is awarded}} {{permanently}} should the dog win Best in Show on five separate occasions {{with the same}} owner, otherwise a <b>silver-plated</b> replica is awarded. As of 2010, the most successful dog to win Best in Show at Westminster was a Smooth Fox Terrier named Ch. Warren Remedy. She was the first winner of Best in Show and the only dog to have won it on three occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Norse-American medal {{is not a}} coin, and is {{not legal}} tender. Due to its {{similarity}} to a coin, {{and the fact that}} it was authorized by Congress, it is sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative coin series. Though the silver ones can be purchased for less than $100 up to $500, and the <b>silver-plated</b> one for between $500 and $3,500, the gold specimen has sold for as high as $40,000. Some medals were used as pocket pieces or worn in mountings to the fair, and display damage or wear.|$|E
5|$|Nagore dargah is {{a common}} place of worship for devotees of various {{religious}} faiths. According to {{the administration of the}} dargah, about 50–75 per cent of pilgrims visiting the dargah everyday are Hindus. The practise of offering flowers, sweetmeats and food, the way of conducting worship, and playing musical instruments like nadaswaram (a type of pipe instrument commonly used in Tamil Nadu) are atypical of Hindu tradition. Other worship practises include offering flags and lighting lamps of ghee at the saint's tomb. Devotees shave their heads near the tank and offer tin or <b>silver-plated</b> facsimiles of body parts, houses, sailboats matching their material needs.|$|E
5|$|Real-world {{historical}} {{designs were}} also adapted for the fictional world. Flying battleships of the Anatoray and Disith nations included components of Japanese dreadnoughts in commission {{at the turn}} of the twentieth century. Uniform designs for Anatoray's musketeers were based on Napoleon Bonaparte's army and American Civil War soldiers. On the other hand, Soviet Red Army fur coats provided the basis for Disith uniforms. Another inspiration for creators came from a silent film of the airship Hindenburg, which depicted the aircraft's UFO-like <b>silver-plated</b> design in contrast to the traditional buildings below. This imagery was reproduced in the series.|$|E
5|$|This {{weak point}} in the wiring also ran near a {{junction}} in an ethylene glycol/water cooling line that had been prone to leaks. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the silver anode was discovered at MSC on May 29, 1967 to be a hazard capable of causing a violent exothermic reaction, igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's pure oxygen atmosphere. Experiments at the Illinois Institute of Technology confirmed the hazard existed for <b>silver-plated</b> wires, but not for copper-only or nickel-plated copper. In July, ASPO directed both North American and Grumman to ensure no silver or silver-coated electrical contacts existed {{in the vicinity of}} possible glycol spills in the Apollo spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has an {{international}} reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. Many innovations in these fields {{have been made}} in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (<b>silver-plated</b> copper) in the early 18thcentury. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations. Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI), and William Cook Group.|$|E
5|$|The West Point Museum is {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} visitor's center, in the renovated Olmsted Hall {{on the grounds of}} the former Ladycliff College. Originally opened to the public in 1854, the West Point Museum is the oldest military museum in the country. During the summer months, the museum operates access to the Fort Putnam historic site on main post and access to the 282 acre Constitution Island. Some of the most notable items on display at the museum are George Washington's pistols, Napoleon's sword, a dagger carried by Hermann Goering when he was captured, a revolver that belonged to Goering, and a <b>silver-plated</b> party book, signed by Charles Lindbergh, Herbert Hoover and Mussolini, among others. Arguably, the most prized artifact on display is a gold-plated pistol that belonged to Adolf Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Most famous {{among the}} many temples built by the Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the Chamundi Hill. The {{earliest}} structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later patronised by the Mysore rulers. Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a Dravidian-style gopuram in 1827. The temple has <b>silver-plated</b> doors with images of deities. Other images include those of the Hindu god Ganesha and of Maharaja Krishnaraja III with his three queens. Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and inside the fort are a group of temples, built in various periods. The Prasanna Krishnaswamy Temple (1829), the Lakshmiramana Swamy Temple whose earliest structures date to 1499, the Trinesvara Swamy Temple (late 16th century), the Shweta Varaha Swamy Temple built by Purnaiah {{with a touch of}} Hoysala style of architecture, the Prasanna Venkataramana Swami Temple (1836) notable for 12 murals of the Wodeyar rulers. Well-known temples outside Mysore city are the yali ("mythical beast") pillared Venkataramana temple built in the late 17th century in the Bangalore fort, and the Ranganatha temple in Srirangapatna.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns (tandrotrano) formed {{at each end of the}} roof peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally <b>silver-plated,</b> and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the roof peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners of the roof in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E

25|$|The temple {{administration}} {{removed the}} <b>silver-plated</b> dwajasthambam ("kodi maram"; flag post) in late 2011 {{to allow for}} renovations to the temple. It is expected that a new brass-plated dwajasthambam will be installed before June 2012 to replace {{the one that had}} been removed. Currently the temple does not have a substitute.|$|E
25|$|A fourrée is a coin, {{most often}} a counterfeit, {{that is made}} from a base metal core that has been plated with a {{precious}} metal to look like its solid metal counterpart. The term is normally applied to ancient <b>silver-plated</b> coins such as the Roman denarius and Greek drachma, but the term is also applied to other plated coins.|$|E
25|$|Other {{objects are}} also {{associated}} with the church from colonial days. The <b>silver-plated</b> chalice is probably and earlier {{one that has been}} “reworked”. There is a sundial to the south of the church either donated or fabricated by Philip Smith in 1717. Five colonial grave markers are spaced throughout the churchyard: in 1963, three were illegible and two were table tombs moved from “Wilmington” (Wilmington, Virginia, is over one hundred miles northwest of Yeocomico).|$|E
25|$|Just as the Olympics awards gold, silver, {{and bronze}} medals for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place, respectively, the NCAA awards the National Champions a {{gold-plated}} wooden NCAA National Championship trophy. The loser of {{the championship game}} receives a <b>silver-plated</b> National Runner-Up trophy for second place. Since 2006, all four Final Four teams receive a bronze plated NCAA Regional Championship trophy; prior to 2006, only the teams who {{did not make the}} title game received bronze plated trophies for third place.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{products}} Matthew Boulton seeks {{to make in}} his new facility are sterling silver plate for those able to afford it, and Sheffield plate, <b>silver-plated</b> copper, for those less well off. Boulton and his father make small silver items throughout the 18th century, {{and there is no}} record of large items in either silver or Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before Boulton does so. To make items such as candlesticks more cheaply than the London competition, the firm makes many items out of thin, die-stamped sections, which are shaped and joined together.|$|E
25|$|Medal {{manufacturer}} Stange {{was authorized}} to begin producing Eagle Scout medals in 1968, {{at the same}} time as Robbins– they created six distinct models. The 1968 version is very similar to the Robbins version, but the bend in the scroll is much flatter, more like a sideways V as compared to the S on the Robbins scroll. The BSA was added back to the front, and the obverse was returned to a full feathered design in 1970. A major re-design of the eagle pendant was made in 1974 to match the new NESA logo. In 1978, Robbins ceased manufacturing Eagle Scout medals and Stange switched to the last design used by Robbins. Minor differences are in the white edged ribbon and the sterling silver markings. In 1980 the price of silver rose dramatically and the medal was changed to <b>silver-plated,</b> die-struck copper. Very early versions were <b>silver-plated</b> and oxidized, thus the scroll and pendant are black. Later versions were oxidized, buffed and lacquered to maintain the silver shine. Sterling silver medals were produced from the same dies and from this time were only available on special order. The year 1993 saw a number of changes. The clasp on the scroll was changed from the pin on type to a double clutch back. The pendant was changed to pewter and enlarged due to the lighter rigidity of the material.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins and}} purpose of this die remain unknown. Both Hunt and the authors of Eagle and the Shield {{speculate}} {{it was meant to}} be used by either the President of the Congress or later by the President of the United States, but there is no other evidence to support this. In October and November 2007, two more dies were discovered in Rhode Island with exactly the same design (though cut in relief), even down to the same small flaws. They were made of <b>silver-plated</b> lead, which is sometimes used as an engraving test since it is a cheaper metal.|$|E
25|$|The {{top left}} and the lower right have a red {{background}} with a gold Episcopal hat each. These parts of the coat of arms represent the old seat of San Blas de Illescas. The horse and the bull represent the cattle wealth of the population. The gold color that serves as background {{in contrast with the}} black color, recalls the yellowish reddish tone of the fields of Coamo during the droughts. The heavy border of the coat of arms contains the following figures: two flames; three bell towers with gold bells outlined in red; two red crosses with arms ending in three petals; and a circle with a surface divided by horizontal blue and <b>silver-plated</b> stripes.|$|E
25|$|Besides those school {{children}} who did exceptionally well in examinations, there were Members other than Fellows {{who were not}} engaged in science or art, but {{who were interested in}} those matters. They could submit examples of their work for examination in the hope of winning a silver or gold medallion of the SSLA. A fortunate member might receive a <b>silver-plated</b> bronze or gilt-bronze medallion, cast with a figure of Athena, goddess of wisdom and learning, dispensing laurel wreaths and surrounded by her scientific and artistic attributes (pictured above). On the reverse the name of recipient and date of award would be engraved within a laurel wreath. George Hawker's gilt-bronze medallion weighs approximately 24 grams and is a professional and clean casting. These medallions were not, however, cast by the Royal Mint.|$|E
25|$|During the 1670s, the Jesuits began accumulating more {{benefits}} and gifts: in 1671, Manuel Rodrigues Ramos {{and his wife}} (of Arneirós) gifted a golden chair; in September 1676, the bishop João de Melo, gave the Jesuits a <b>silver-plated</b> crown, encircled with 20 precious stones; in 1677, King Pedro II also donated a silver crown studded in diamonds; the clergy of the realm also donated, in 1678, a simple silver crown; on 3 September 1679, there was a donation of red canopy, flaked with silver, by the descendents of Soutelo; in August 1682, Isabel Proença, of Penamacor, donated an amber pear covered in flakes of gold and painted in green and white, to the Baby Jesus; {{another member of the}} congregation donated 17 reliquaries to the sanctuary; and, on 22 September, António Fernandes Matos sent from Pernambuco (in Brazil) 50$000 réis.|$|E
25|$|The Western concert flute, a {{descendant}} of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An embouchure hole is positioned near the top across and into which the flutist blows. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute's range were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by Theobald Boehm and greatly improved the instrument's dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors. With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm's design, known as the Boehm system. Beginner's flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is <b>silver-plated,</b> while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork. The wood is usually African Blackwood.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} also {{opened its}} grounds to archeological digs in 1994. Estimates of human occupation on Shooter's Hill go {{back as far}} as 3,000 BC. Shooter's Hill had been occupied by Native Americans, a mansion (in the 1830s and 1840s), a log cabin, Fort Ellsworth, a reservoir for the city's fresh water system, a park for outdoor dancing, and the Alexandria Golf Course among many others. Alexandria city archeologists used ground-penetrating radar to help identify sites of interest on Shooter's Hill, including a brick foundation wall. In the dig's first three seasons, a stone ax, pieces of ceramic pots, Civil War ammunition, various kinds of colored glass, a piece of jewelry shaped like a scarab, a Colonial-era mug imported from England, Native American spear points, a <b>silver-plated</b> spoon, a stoneware jar, and the bisque heads of dolls manufactured in Germany were found. In 2002, the memorial opened an exhibit designed to showcase some of the archeological evidence unearthed on the memorial grounds.|$|E
25|$|In 1941 the Uniform Regulations were {{modified}} to permit officers and enlisted men {{to wear the}} submarine insignia after they {{had been assigned to}} other duties in the naval service, unless such right had been revoked. The officer insignia was a bronze gold-plated metal pin, worn centered above the left breast pocket and above the ribbons or medals. Enlisted men wore an embroidered silk insignia {{on the outside of the}} right sleeve, midway between the wrist and elbow until 1947 when it was shifted to above the left breast pocket. In 1943 the Uniform Regulations were {{modified to}} allow enlisted men, who were qualified for submarine duty then subsequently promoted to commissioned or warrant ranks, to continue wearing the enlisted submarine insignia until they qualified as submarine officers when they were entitled to wear the officers submarine pin. A 1950 change to Uniform Regulations authorized the embroidered insignia for officers (in addition to pin-on insignia) and a bronze, <b>silver-plated,</b> pin-on insignia for enlisted men (in addition to the embroidered device).|$|E
500|$|The Sovereign {{was unusual}} because the casing {{was made from}} pressed steel, which gave it a much higher quality feel {{compared}} to injection moulded plastic. This allowed a variety of paint and plating options, including black painted, chrome-plated, <b>silver-plated,</b> and gold-plated, and a limited edition <b>silver-plated</b> version, inscribed to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, were also produced. Asprey of London was rumoured to have produced two Sovereigns in solid gold, costing [...] each.|$|E
500|$|The floors were {{constructed}} using [...] "knot-free heart-pine", and solid mahogany {{was used for}} the railing of the stairwell. Details include <b>silver-plated</b> doorknobs, [...] "hand-forged locks and latches", and [...] "a simple but visually striking Greek key pattern" [...] for moldings and trim. Camak House was built with closets – a very unusual feature for the time.|$|E
500|$|The Russian Empire {{took over}} the {{administration}} of the lighthouse in 1805. Major reconstruction of the tower began in 1810. A stone staircase was cut to the southern counterfort plus a room large enough for a team of six men. Into the upper part they made two subsidiary rooms, {{one on top of the}} other, and another, the topmost room, [...] from the ground, was for the lanterns. The lantern room housed twenty three oil lamps, using <b>silver-plated</b> brass reflectors. The lamps burned hemp oil, requiring [...] yearly.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Chicago skyscrapers buildings were relatively plain, the entrance ways and lobbies were fitted out in a grand style. The Unity Building, for example, was reported as including [...] "Numidian, Alps, Green and Sienna marbles... an artistic screen of glass and bronze... a marble balcony" [...] alongside [...] "Corinthian columns with finely carved capitals, gold-leaf and silver chandeliers, and <b>silver-plated</b> latticework" [...] on the elevators. The aim was to project a sense of prosperity and solid financial credentials, which in turn would attract tenants willing to pay high rents. For the tenants, such surroundings were good for their own business credibility and affirmed their own social status as professionals.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah's funeral {{services}} were held on August 31, 2001, at the Frank E.Campbell Funeral Home and St. Ignatius Loyola Church in Manhattan. Her body {{was set in}} a <b>silver-plated</b> copper-deposit casket, which was carried in a glass horse-drawn hearse. An estimated 800mourners were in attendance at the procession. Among those in attendance at the private ceremony were Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Gladys Knight, Lil' Kim and Sean Combs. After the service, 22 white doves were released to symbolize each year of Aaliyah's life. Aaliyah was initially entombed in a crypt at the Ferncliff Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York; she was later moved to a private room at the left end of a corridor in the Rosewood Mausoleum. The inscription {{at the bottom of}} Aaliyah's portrait at the funeral read: [...] "We Were Given a Queen, We Were Given an Angel." ...|$|E
500|$|Patton {{deliberately}} cultivated a flashy, distinctive {{image in}} the belief that this would inspire his troops. He carried an ivory-gripped, engraved, <b>silver-plated</b> Colt Single Action Army [...]45 revolver on his right hip, and frequently wore an ivory-gripped Smith & Wesson Model 27 [...]357 Magnum on his left hip. He was usually seen wearing a highly polished helmet, riding pants, and high cavalry boots. Likewise, Patton cultivated a stern expression he called his [...] "war face". He was known to oversee training maneuvers from atop a tank painted red, white and blue. His jeep bore oversized rank placards on the front and back, as well as a klaxon horn which would loudly announce his approach from afar. He proposed a new uniform for the emerging Tank Corps, featuring polished buttons, a gold helmet, and thick, dark padded suits; the proposal was derided in the media as [...] "the Green Hornet", and was rejected by the Army.|$|E
