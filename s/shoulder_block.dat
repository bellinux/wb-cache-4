5|$|The first main {{match was}} for the WWE Championship, in which {{champion}} Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita. In {{the beginning of the}} match, Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring. Van Dam, however, managed to execute a crossbody on Edge inside the ring, resulting in the two landing {{on the outside of the}} ring floor. Both men took the upper hand in the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title. Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title, but Van Dam dodged the hit as he performed a spinning kick on the title, resulting in hitting Edge's face. Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge went for the <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting in Edge to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle on Edge, which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{scheduled}} bout was a Three Way Elimination {{match between}} DDP, Kevin Nash, and Monty Brown. The winner of this match {{would go on}} to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. DDP eliminated Nash by performing a dropkick, which caused Nash to fall over the top rope and down to the floor. With Nash eliminated, it was down to Brown and DDP. After the two fought back and forth for a few minutes, Brown threw DDP against the ropes while he ran against the opposite ropes and performed a running <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> {{in the center of the}} ring to complete a move he named the Pounce.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was a triple threat match, a match {{involving}} three wrestlers, for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H, and Edge. The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but {{participated in the}} 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Triple H won the tournament. Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. The next night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship, but Edge and Lita (Edge's girlfriend) interrupted Triple H's segment. Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot, that he won at WrestleMania 21, and defeating Cena at the event, after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber, a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. Cena, however, reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble, when he defeated Edge. Edge claimed {{that it was time for}} a new opponent for the WWE Championship, after stating that at WrestleMania, Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena. All three men had a series of Handicap matches, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after tucking Cena's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat, a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree, Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU, and Edge executing a <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> takedown on Triple H and pinning him. It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash.|$|E

60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} the {{question}} was answered with a tongue of thunder. Morton had just placed {{himself in front of}} the nearest window, his broad <b>shoulders</b> <b>blocking</b> the aperture. For an instant it was lit from within as with red fire, followed by a thundering throng of echoes. The square shoulders seemed to alter in shape, and the sturdy figure collapsed among the tall, rank grasses {{at the foot of the}} tower. A puff of smoke floated from the window like a little cloud. The two men behind rushed to the spot and raised him, but he was dead.|$|R
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} a number one contender's non-title match between WWE Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy and Triple H. The pre-match stipulations {{were that the}} winner would get a WWE Championship match at Royal Rumble 2008 against the winner of Orton vs. Jericho match.

50|$|During {{the match}} between Savage and the Warrior, Miss Elizabeth was spotted in the crowd. During {{the course of}} the match cameras kept cutting to her as she grew {{concerned}} for Savage's well being. Despite taking five of Savage's flying elbow drops, Warrior won the match after hitting the Macho King with three jumping <b>shoulder</b> <b>blocks</b> and forced Savage to retire. After the match, Sherri came into the ring and attacked Savage, which prompted Elizabeth to charge into the ring and fight off the former Queen and save Savage.

50|$|Simpson {{was small}} in stature for a goalkeeper, at just 5 feet 10 inches. He {{compensated}} for this with an unorthodox style of shot-stopping, using his elbows and <b>shoulders</b> to <b>block</b> shots. Simpson also had top-class foot movement and ball distribution skills. In 2002, {{he was named}} in Celtic's greatest ever team, ahead of John Thomson and Pat Bonner.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test if valence and {{intensity}} dimensions of responses to general programming affect commercial processing in everyday life. Results from analyses on data from a large telephone survey showed that indicators of program-induced valence and intensity significantly affected several advertising processing measures. Intensity had a positive impact on measures of attention and recall, while valence was positively related to attitude toward the advertisement. Next, we investigated the moderating influences of variations in commercial placement on these relations. We found that effects of intensity and valence on commercial processing were stronger for interrupting <b>blocks</b> than <b>shoulder</b> <b>blocks.</b> However, the position of the commercial within the block did not have an impact on these carryover effects. The study on the effects of program responses on the processing of commercials placed at various positions in the program and the block was part of a Ph. D. project on the relationship between media environments and advertising effects conducted at ASCoR. The authors wish to thank John Faasse, Unilever, and Initiative for making the data available for analyses. ...|$|R
5000|$|During Waldorf's {{later years}} at Northwestern, he {{received}} {{assistance from the}} Chicago Bears in developing the T formation, a stance that the Bears were successful at deploying. Waldorf wrote:But we didn't adopt the same 'Man-in-Motion T' used by the Bears. Our version featured single-wing <b>shoulder</b> <b>blocking.</b> We wanted to move defenders {{on the edge of}} the defense out of the way to make the most of our halfacks' ability to get a quick start[...]. We developed a play called '42 Crossfire,' which accomplished this. It was a counter play, with the left half carrying off right tackle. The keys to this play were the quarterback making a good fake to the fullback and the right guard pulling out to block the man of the defense's perimeter.Waldorf also served as an unofficial coach on the annually voted for All-Star College Player v.

Terry Funk, Pat O'Connor and Lou Thesz were the special judges in the match in case the match went to the full 1-hour time limit. Flair started the match by performing a <b>Shoulder</b> <b>Block.</b> Flair and Steamboat competed for longer than half hour and exchanged momentum throughout the match. In the final moments of the match, Steamboat delivered a Superplex to Flair and applied a Double Chickenwing but Flair wrapped his legs into the ropes. Flair was smashed into the turnbuckle and Steamboat climbed the top rope. Flair fell into the ropes and Steamboat fell {{down on the floor}} which hurt his leg. Flair suplexed Steamboat back into the ring and began attacking his injured knee. Flair applied a Figure Four Leglock until Steamboat caught the ropes. Flair tried to attack Steamboat's knee but Steamboat delivered a Karate Chop and an Enzuigiri.

25|$|On the January 26, {{episode of}} Raw, Goldberg {{came to the}} ring, and demanded a match between himself against Brock Lesnar, {{with whom he had}} {{problems}} over the past two months. The night before, Goldberg was entered in the Royal Rumble match, only to have Lesnar (who, as the reigning WWE Champion, was not entered into the match) interfered and hit an F-5, causing Goldberg to be eliminated by Kurt Angle. The following week on an episode of Raw, {{as a result of the}} rivalry extending between the two programs, sheriff Steve Austin gave Goldberg the option of attending No Way Out by giving him a front-row ticket. At No Way Out, Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his front seat by security. Then SmackDown General Manager, Paul Heyman gave a promotional in-ring segment on how SmackDown! was the better program over Raw. Lesnar would come down to the ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg. Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade into the ring, where Lesnar performed a running <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> to Goldberg's stomach; however he recuperated and lifted Lesnar vertically in the air before slamming him down to perform the Jackhammer. Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security. During Lesnar's WWE title defense against Eddie Guerrero later that night, Goldberg returned to the arena and interfered by executing a spear, which caused Lesnar to lose the title after Guerrero nailed him with a Frog splash. On the February 22, 2004 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon named the Interpromotional singles match pitting Lesnar versus Goldberg for WrestleMania XX with Steve Austin as the special guest referee. During the match between McMahon and Eric Bischoff, Lesnar appeared on Raw and nailed Steve Austin with an F-5 then stole Austin's four-wheeler. A few days later on SmackDown!, Lesnar stated that he appeared on Raw just to get back at Austin for giving Goldberg the front-row seat ticket and suggesting that Goldberg would attack Lesnar at No Way Out. Behind the scenes, it was widely known that the match would be Goldberg's last in WWE. Only a week before WrestleMania, however, rumors surfaced that Lesnar, too, was leaving in order to pursue a career in the National Football League. On the last episode of SmackDown! prior to WrestleMania, Steve Austin appeared to get his fourwheeler back from Lesnar only for the entire roster to get in his way by orders of SmackDown! General manager Paul Heyman. Moments later, the entire roster had decided to move aside and let Austin by to confront Lesnar in the ring. As Austin got to the ring, he and Lesnar traded punches with Austin attempting to nail Lesnar with the Stone Cold stunner only for Lesnar to escape, leaving Austin to finally get back his fourwheeler and closing in on the show with his trademark beer bash.|$|E
500|$|The next match, {{which was}} billed as a [...] "Battle for Brand Supremacy", was between SmackDown's Batista and Raw's Umaga. Early in the match, both Batista and Umaga {{exchanged}} blows and Batista knocked Umaga outside with a <b>shoulder</b> <b>block.</b> Umaga later kicked Batista in the face, which caused him to fall back-first outside the ring from the ring-apron. As a result, Umaga started targeting Batista's injured back. In the end, however, when Umaga tried to perform his Samoan Spike, Batista countered the attempt {{and gave him a}} spinebuster. Batista won the match by pinning Umaga after a Batista Bomb.|$|E

60|$|With a vague {{sense of}} remorse, and yet a {{consciousness}} of some injustice done him, Mr. Kane resumed his occupation with filters and funnels, and mortars and triturations. He was so gloomily preoccupied {{that he did}} not, as usual, glance out of the window, or he would have observed the mining stranger of the previous night before it. It {{was not until the}} man's bowed <b>shoulders</b> <b>blocked</b> the light of the doorway that he looked up and recognized him. Kane was in no mood to welcome his appearance. His presence, too, actively recalled the last night's adventure of which he was a witness--albeit a sympathizing one. Kane shrank from the illusions which he felt he would be sure to make. And with his present ill luck, he was by no means sure that his ministrations even to HIM had been any more successful than they had been to the Frenchwoman. But a glance at his good-humored face and kindling eyes removed that suspicion. Nevertheless, he felt somewhat embarrassed and impatient, and perhaps could not entirely conceal it. He forgot that the rudest natures are sometimes the most delicately sensitive to slights, and the stranger had noticed his manner and began apologetically.|$|R
