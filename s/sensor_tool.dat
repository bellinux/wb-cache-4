40|$|This chapter {{describes}} how seam-tracking {{sensors can be}} integrated in a robotic laser welding system for automatic teaching of the seam trajectory {{as well as for}} correcting small errors from a pre-defined seam trajectory. Calibration procedures are required to derive accurate transformations of laser and <b>sensor</b> <b>tool</b> frames relative to each other or relative to the robot flange. A tool calibration procedure is described that involves movements of the tool above a special calibration object. The accuracy of this procedure is influenced by errors in the robot movement. Therefore, another calibration procedure is developed, which is a direct measurement of the <b>sensor</b> <b>tool</b> frame relative to the laser tool frame. A trajectory-based control approach is presented for real-time seam tracking, where a seam-tracking sensor measures ahead of the laser focal point. In this control approach, sensor measurements are related to the robot position to build a geometric seam trajectory, which is followed by the laser focal poin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A finite-volume (FV) {{technique}} is introduced to model directional resistivity logging sensors that employ tilted-coil antennas in 3 -D anisotropic earth formations. The algorithm {{is based on}} a coupled scalar–vector potential formulation on a 3 -D cylindrical staggered grid. The choice of discretization enforces the correct continuity equations across material boundaries, avoids spurious modes, and leads to a better conditioned system matrix. In order to model situations where the <b>sensor</b> <b>tool</b> axis does not coincide with the borehole axis (eccentered tools), a locally conformal FV scheme is also implemented. The proposed FV formulation is validated against pseudoanalytical solutions (in cases where the latter is applicable), showing very good agreement, and utilized to investigate the effects of the drill collar (borehole), anisotropy, and azimuthal rotations on the response of directional resistivity sensors.

It is therefore necessary to develop tools that allow identification of neuron types that express RNA-edited GlyR protein. In this study, we identify NH 4 as agonist of C-to-U RNA edited GlyRs. Furthermore, we generated a new molecular C-to-U RNA editing <b>sensor</b> <b>tool</b> that detects Apobec- 1 - dependent RNA editing in HEPG 2 cells and rat primary hippocampal neurons. Using this sensor combined with NH 4 application, we were able to identify C-to-U RNA editing-competent neurons and expression of C-to-U RNA-edited GlyR protein in neurons. Bioinformatic analysis of 1, 000 Genome Project Phase 3 allele frequencies coding for human Apobec- 1 80 M and 80 I variants showed differences between populations, and the results revealed a preference of the 80 I variant to generate RNA-edited GlyR protein. Finally, we established a new PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) approach to profile mRNA expression with regard to the genetic APOBEC 1 dimorphism of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (iTLE) and found that the patients fall into two groups. Patients with expression of the Apobec- 1 80 I variant mostly suffered from simple or complex partial seizures, whereas patients with 80 M expression exhibited secondarily generalized seizure activity. Thus, our method allows the characterization of Apobec- 1 80 M and 80 l variants in the brain and provides a new way to epidemiologically and semiologically classify iTLE according to the two different APOBEC 1 alleles. Together, these results demonstrate Apobec- 1 -dependent expression of RNA-edited GlyR protein in neurons and identify the APOBEC 1 80 I/M-coding alleles as new genetic risk factors for iTLE patients...|$|E
40|$|Interpretation of {{production}} logging in multi-phase flow wells is challenging, especially for highly deviated wells or horizontal wells. Flow regime-dependent flow conditions strongly affect the measurements {{of production}} logging tools. Segregation and possible back flow of denser phases result in misinterpretation of the inflow distribution. To assess the downhole flow conditions more accurately, logging tools {{have been developed}} to overcome the flow regime related issues. Multiple-sensor array tools measure the fluid properties at multiple locations around the cross-sectional area of the wellbore, providing a distributed measurement array that helps to relate the measurements to flow regime and translate the measurement to inflow distribution. This thesis present a methodology for using array data from production logging tools to interpret downhole flow conditions. The study uses an example logging tool that consists of 12 resistivity, 12 capacitance probes, and six spinners around the wellbore circumference. The method allows interpretation of phase volumetric flow rates in sub-divided cross-sectional areas based on sensor locations. The sub-divided area method divides the wellbore cross-sectional area into several layers depending on the number and arrangement of the sensors with each layer containing at least one sensor. Holdup and velocity outputs from sensors in each wellbore area segment are combined to calculate the volumetric flow rates of each phase in each segment. These results yield a profile of flow of each phase from the high side to the low side of the wellbore, and the overall flow rates of each phase at every location along the well where the interpretation method is applied. The results from different methods of interpreting production logging are compared in the thesis. Three Eagle Ford horizontal well examples are presented in the thesis; one has single sensor PLT measures, and the other two cases used a multiple <b>sensor</b> <b>tool</b> package. The examples illustrate differences of interpretation results by different methods, and recommend the procedures that yield better interpretation of multiple sensor array tools...|$|E
40|$|Since their {{discovery}} {{in the middle}} of the last century, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have become an important and very versatile tool in industry, medicine, and basic research. The aim of this work was to explore possible improvements and new applications of novel NMR methods. Frank-Sequence Excitation: Since the beginning of MRI, the strength of the main magnetic field has steadily increased because of the inherently higher signal-to-noise ratio. However, the radio-frequency (rf) power and energy absorbed in the body tissue, quantified scales with the square of the main magnetic field. Therefore, conventional rf-pulse excitation often exceeds legal limitations. This problem could be solved by novel rf-excitation pulse sequences. In the first part of the thesis, a new low-power rf excitation scheme termed Frank-sequence excitation was analyzed in detail, compared to conventional excitation, and was shown to be feasible for MRI. Frank sequences, which have recently been introduced as an excitation scheme for NMR, employ a series of phase-modulated low-amplitude rf pulses with interleaved signal acquisition. Simulations and experiments were performed in order to find and quantify advantages as well as drawbacks of this new technique. These studies revealed that the distribution of total rf energy over a longer period of time allows for significant reduction of peak rf power. The presented findings yield essential information for a deeper understanding of the new pulse scheme and will enhance future developments. Furthermore, the concept of Frank-sequence excitation was employed for MRI for the first time. With purpose-built phantoms, the feasibility of the method in combination with a two-dimensional radial imaging scheme was demonstrated. Together with a low-power slice selection sequence, three-dimensional MRI was successfully performed as well. A comparison with images that were acquired with conventional excitation and space encoding methods showed that the new technique provides a competitive alternative for future MRI applications. Besides offering the advantage of reduced rf power, Frank sequence MRI also provides a new modality to image hard materials and tissues like bones and teeth with short relaxation times in future applications. Hyperpolarized 129 Xe NMR and MRI: Another drawback of classical 1 H NMR and MRI is the low sensitivity. As a result, different hyperpolarization (HP) techniques have been developed, by which the polarization and consequently the NMR signal of 129 Xe can be enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude. Especially in biomedicine, HP 129 Xe has been proven a versatile <b>sensor</b> <b>tool</b> for molecular spectroscopy and imaging. As a consequence, the second part of the thesis focused on applications of HP 129 Xe for advanced studies of gas dissolution, blood-gas exchange dynamics, and blood rheology. Hyperpolarized 129 Xe was employed to analyze gas dissolution by means of hollow-fiber membranes. These so-called xenonizers, which resemble clinical oxygenators, were investigated in detail including a systematical comparison of different fibers. This is of great importance for future HP 129 Xe studies as well as for medical applications of the investigated fibers. On the basis of these results, blood-dissolved HP 129 Xe was used as a tool to monitor gas exchange in the fiber module online. The signals of HP 129 Xe in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin could be spectroscopically resolved for the first time. Thereby, the oxygen exchange that takes place even under stopped blood-flow conditions could be followed and quantified. Additionally, two-dimensional NMR was used to further analyze the exchange of HP 129 Xe between the various sites in the xenonizer. Exchange of xenon with red blood cells was found to not only be significant with the surrounding plasma, but also in a more direct way with the fiber pores. These results form the basis for better understanding of physiological gas-exchange phenomena as well as for xenon anesthesia. Possibilities for further quantitative assessments were presented and discussed together with future experiments to gain more knowledge of fundamental blood-gas dynamics as well as for gas-exchange membrane design. Dissolved HP 129 Xe was also applied as a sensor for rheological studies of blood flow in capillaries as well as for first tests in a Couette system. The chemical shift information achieved by HP 129 Xe was used as a means of molecular MRI. In combination with 1 H velocity MRI, a new method was presented for blood rheology investigations. While dissolved 129 Xe signals require further enhancement for applications in complex geometries, results in micro-capillaries already showed very good agreement with expected values. On the basis of the results presented, further studies of blood flow MRI in technical devices will be feasible...|$|E
