5000|$|Her husband {{attended}} the {{meetings of the}} spiritual association Federação Espírita do Estado de São Paulo but Gasparetto had {{to stay at home}} to look after the children. Once a week they studied together at home. On one occasion, Gasparetto felt a sharp pain in her arm which moved from side to side uncontrollably. After Aldo gave her a pen and paper, she started to write quickly, drafting what was to become her first novel O Amor Venceu (Love Won) signed by someone called Lucius. After the manuscript had been typed up, Gasparetto showed it to a history professor from the University of São Paulo who was also interested in spiritualism. Two weeks later she received confirmation that the book would be published by Editora LAKE. Gasparetto now says she uses her computer four times a week to write down the texts dictated by her voices. <b>She</b> <b>usually</b> <b>writes</b> in the evening for one or two hours. [...] "They spirits are not available to work many days per week," [...] she explains. [...] "I don't know why but each one of them only appears once a week. I tried to get them to change but I couldn't." [...] As a result, she usually keeps one evening a week free {{for each of the four}} spirits she communicates with. She has also published one of the stories dictated by Lucius as an audiobook with the book's characters voiced by actors.|$|E

5000|$|One of her best-known {{works is}} titled Topdog/Underdog. This play marked a {{departure}} from the heightened language <b>she</b> <b>usually</b> <b>wrote.</b> Parks is an admirer of Abraham Lincoln and believed he left a legacy for descendants of slaves. Topdog/Underdog explains what that legacy is. It tells the story of two African-American brothers: Lincoln and Booth. Lincoln works at a boardwalk arcade, dressing up like Abraham Lincoln and letting the tourists shoot him with plastic guns. He got this job because he could be paid less than the white man who had the job before. Parks does not judge Lincoln in this play, but rather enjoys bringing him into the other characters' lives and seeing how they are affected. She said, [...] "Lincoln is the closest thing we have to a mythic figure. In days of Greek drama, they had Apollo and Medea and Oedipus - these larger than life figures that walked the earth and spoke - and they turned them into plays. Shakespeare had kings and queens that he fashioned into his stories. Lincoln, to me, is one of those." [...] Parks also believes that Lincoln [...] "created an opening with that hole in his head." [...] She makes the case that everything we do has to pass through everything else, like the eye of a needle. She says we have all passed through the hole in Lincoln's head on our journey to whatever lies ahead. Like many of her other plays, Topdog/Underdog takes her characters on a quest to find out who they are and to examine the stories and experiences that have shaped their lives. More than anything, she believes that we have an important relationship with the past.|$|R
40|$|Iris Murdoch {{tells us}} that <b>she</b> does not <b>usually</b> <b>write</b> from live models. However, in her last novel, Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s Dilemma, Murdoch 2 ̆ 7 s private life does echo here and there. Especially Benet, a central {{character}} in Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s Dilemma has many similarities to Murdoch herself. When we see Benet 2 ̆ 7 s remorse and loneliness, we see Murdoch 2 ̆ 7 s remorse and loneliness in her old age. Jackson {{is described as a}} person who has the nature of Christ and Hindu gods. How Murdoch comes to terms with Christianity which she used to criticize will be clarified by examining how Benet accepts Jackson and how Mildred makes up her mind to become a priest. We see that Murdoch finds hope and a future in children when we examine her descriptions of Bran who straightens out the situation just as Prospero in The Tempest finds hope for the future in his daughter and her beloved...|$|R
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that [...] "it mostly overcomes some {{significant}} script flaws". He {{was critical of}} the fact that the script [...] "requires Scully to be a lot more naive than <b>she</b> <b>usually</b> is". Handlen <b>wrote</b> that, because the episode was not as believable as it could have been this far into the series, the reveal that The Smoking Man is using Scully is [...] "more disappointing than shocking." [...] Despite these setbacks, he concluded that the episode is largely sound because of the performances of Davis and Anderson, as well as the fact that the entry allowed the audience to gain insight into The Smoking Man's motives. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was not happy with the ambiguity of The Smoking Man, writing, [...] "Perhaps unsurprisingly, the episode provides few answers. And the ending, with its high degree of ambiguity, provides little satisfaction. This reviewer, for one, is puzzled about both CSM's physical condition and his state of mind." ...|$|R
