In addition, {{engineered}} systems such as insulated panels, non-insulated honeycomb panels, copper <b>screen</b> <b>panels,</b> and structural wall claddings are available. Horizontal copper siding provides a relatively flat appearance with fine horizontal lines. Beveled copper panels have depth for heavy-shadowed effects. Flat siding has minimal shadows. Structural panels {{are designed to be}} attached directly to a wall structure without the use of a continuous substrate. Diagonal flat lock panels are used on curved surfaces, such as domes, spires and vaults. Horizontal flat lock panels are basically identical to flat seam roofing applied on a vertical surface. Copper <b>screen</b> <b>panels</b> are a lightweight finish screen that can be perforated or have shaped openings to function as sun or decorative screens. A copper alloy curtain wall is a non-structural outer building covering that keeps out weather. Composite copper cladding is made by attaching copper sheeting to both sides of rigid thermoplastic sheet.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of quantitative assays for serum free light chains (FLC) {{has changed the}} approach to screening for monoclonal gammopathies.

40|$|A right {{only has}} any value {{if there is}} a remedy {{providing}} for the acknowledgement and enforcement thereof. An increase in medical malpractice claims can be expected in South Africa {{in view of the fact}} that the public is becoming more and more aware of its rights in respect of health services and health care. The public opinion calls for development of dispute resolution proceedings. The fact that the law is not accessible to everyone in South Africa is a matter of concern. High litigation costs, coupled with the time consuming protracted, formal and complicated process, call for a transformation towards an alternative, non-judicial process that is suitable for a particular dispute and apposite to the parties involved. Selection panels, the medical ombudsperson and arbitration clauses incorporated in doctor/patient agreements, are ADR mechanisms that have been proved by American law as suitable for resolution of medical malpractice claims. In this particular article attention is paid to <b>screening</b> <b>panels</b> as pre-trial mechanism with the exclusive purpose to select malpractice disputes, discourage unfounded disputes and to encourage an early settlement in case of a prima facie case. Several objections have been raised by critics in this regard, for instance, a <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> infringes on: the right of equal protection/the right of access to the courts/the right to a jury trial/the right to a due process as well as on the trias politica doctrine. These so-called infringements are attended to and eventually a positive conclusion regarding <b>screening</b> <b>panels</b> is made: medical <b>screening</b> <b>panels</b> (consisting generally of a medical doctor, a lawyer and a member of public), based on the American experience, is indeed an appropriate dispute resolution method.

40|$|The {{molecular}} receptive range (MRR) of a mammalian {{odorant receptor}} (OR) is {{the set of}} odorant structures that activate the OR, while the distribution of these odorant structures across odor space is the tuning breadth of the OR. Variation in tuning breadth {{is thought to be}} an important property of ORs, with the MRRs of these receptors varying from narrowly to broadly tuned. However, defining the tuning breadth of an OR is a technical challenge. For practical reasons, a <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> that broadly covers odor space must be limited to sparse coverage of the many potential structures in that space. When screened with such a panel, ORs with different odorant specificities, but equal tuning breadths, might appear to have different tuning breadths due to chance. We hypothesized that ORs would maintain their tuning breadths across distinct odorant panels. We constructed a new <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> that was broadly distributed across an estimated odor space and contained compounds distinct from previous panels. We used this new <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> to test several murine ORs that were previously characterized as having different tuning breadths. ORs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and assayed by two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. MOR 256 - 17, an OR previously characterized as broadly tuned, responded to nine novel compounds from our new <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> that were structurally diverse and broadly dispersed across an estimated odor space. MOR 256 - 22, an OR previously characterized as narrowly tuned, responded to a single novel compound that was structurally similar to a previously known ligand for this receptor. MOR 174 - 9, a well-characterized receptor with a narrowly tuned MRR, did not respond to any novel compounds in our new panel. These results support the idea that variation in tuning breadth among these three ORs is not an artifact of the screening protocol, but is an intrinsic property of the receptors...|$|R
40|$|Pre-litigation <b>screening</b> <b>panels</b> {{have been}} {{instrumental}} in streamlining medical malpractice litigation in the State of Maine by culling claims from superior court dockets, encouraging settlements, and providing findings of fact that could prove useful for a jury if the case proceeds to trial. In enacting one particular provision governing the confidentiality and the admissibility of the <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> process, however, the legislature may have sacrificed the constitutional rights of medical malpractice claimants {{in favor of a}} lighter docket. Two recent cases before the Law Court, Smith I and II, have challenged the constitutionality of Maine’s unique statutory approach to the admissibility of <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> findings at a subsequent trial. The legislature created a system of mandatory pre-litigation <b>screening</b> <b>panels</b> in sections 2851 through 2859 of the Maine Health Security Act (MHSA) with the express purpose of identifying those “claims of professional negligence which merit compensation” prior to the commencement of a lawsuit, and “encourag[ing] early withdrawal or dismissal of non-meritorious claims. ” Sections 2852 through 2854 outline the composition of the panel and the mandatory procedures that a claimant must follow to commence an action for professional negligence. Section 2855 provides that this panel shall hear evidence from both the claimant and the doctor accused of professional negligence in order to make three separate findings as to the doctor’s deviation from the standard of care, causation, and the claimant’s comparative negligence. Although plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of the <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> process as outlined in these sections, the Law Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of the process as a whole and deferred to the legislative purpose to promote pretrial resolution explicated in section 2851. The Smiths argued that section 2857 violated their fundamental right to a jury trial by “requiring that the jury be told a half-truth. ” The Law Court in Smith I did not {{go so far as to}} say that section 2857 is unconstitutional as written, but did hold that the application of the statute, which allows admission of only those findings favorable to the doctor, deprives the jury of the meaningful information required to render a fair verdict, and thus, deprives a malpractice claimant of his right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Maine Constitution. Whereas Smith I addressed a malpractice claimant’s constitutional challenge to section 2857 ’s substantive asymmetry, Smith II addresses whether the statute gives the party who prevailed at the panel stage the right to refuse to submit all unanimous findings. In a 4 - 2 majority opinion authored by Justice Calkins, the Law Court held that a doctor who has prevailed at the <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> stage with respect to either the question of breach of duty or causation should be permitted to refuse to submit all of the panel’s findings to the jury. Both Smith I and II illustrate an urgent need for the Maine Legislature to fundamentally reevaluate the structure, constitutionality, and effectiveness of the admissibility-oriented statutory disincentives in sections 2857 and 2858 of the MHSA. The Maine Legislature could avoid further constitutional challenges to section 2857 without sacrificing its interest in promoting pretrial settlements by amending the MHSA to provide (1) that all <b>screening</b> <b>panel</b> findings—unanimous and non-unanimous alike—shall be admissible at a subsequent trial, and (2) that reasonable attorneys’ fees shall be assessed against the party who unanimously loses at the panel stage, refuses to abandon or settle the claim, and then loses again at a subsequent trial...|$|R
