40|$|Control of {{moisture}} and heat flow through building enclosure assemblies {{is a critical}} component of overall building performance. This thesis shows that significant drying {{of moisture}} in wall assemblies is possible and that ventilation of cladding significantly increases the rate of drying in some assemblies without having detrimental impact on the enclosures thermal performance. A review found that thermal and moisture buoyancy, wind pressure gradients and mechanical equipment drive ventilation airflow. This ventilation flow can theoretically increase the effective water vapour permeance and thermal conductivity. Ventilation has the potential to increase outward drying through relatively impermeable claddings at the low flows expected to occur in service. The impact on thermal conductance is much less. A methodology for assessing the complicated airflow resistance characteristics of lap sidings was developed and applied to a representative vinyl siding. Field drying studies showed that the sample tested is well ventilated. Field brick veneer clad wall samples were also tested for system airflow resistance over a range of driving pressures. Theoretical predictions under-estimated the measured flow rate for given steady driving air pressures. Measurements of naturally driven cavity air speeds and smoke pencil testing showed that flow rates were commonly occurring that would in theory significantly affect the hygrothermal performance of the walls. This was confirmed with field drying studies. A field drying study of east-facing test wall with vinyl siding and brick veneer cladding was conducted in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Significant amounts of drying and inward moisture redistribution were measured. Wall sheathing dried quickly in hot summer conditions but in some cases significant inward driven moisture flow occurred. In cool and cold weather the wall dried more slowly and much less moisture moved inward. Increased cladding ventilation significantly increased drying rates and reduced internal wall assembly moisture levels. It was concluded that cladding ventilation acts to increase the effective vapour permeance of cladding and to reduce solar driven inward vapour drives. The use of <b>spun</b> <b>bonded</b> polyolefin sheathing membrane in lieu of # 15 asphalt impregnated felt was found to improved hygrothermal performance in the test walls. The difference observed was concluded to be due to the higher vapour permeance of the <b>spun</b> <b>bonded</b> polyolefin and may not hold for wall assemblies with lower permeance sheathings (e. g. oriented strand board and foam plastic). Walls clad with vinyl siding dried faster than those clad with brick veneer. It was concluded that the vinyl siding is a well ventilated cladding system...|$|E

40|$|Metastability is {{observed}} in fluids, solids, plasmas and other systems, and it often de-termines their behavior. A better microscopic {{understanding of this}} ubiquitous natural phenomenon, which is mathematically challenging,[1] is therefore of great practical and theoretical interest. In particular, metastability is relevant to the behavior of magnetic storage devices. Here one needs in practice to create and to control fine grains, i. e., mag-netic particles whose size ranges from mesoscopic to atomic levels, namely, clusters of 104 to 102 spins, and even smaller ones. The underlying physics is much less understood than for bulk properties. In particular, one cannot assume that such particles are neither infinite nor pure. That is, they have free borders, which results in a large surface/volume ratio inducing strong surface effects, and impurities. The microscopic nature of the latter, which shows up in actual specimens as <b>spin,</b> <b>bond</b> and/or lattice disorder and other in-homogeneities, quantum tunneling,[2] etc., suggests they might dominate the behavior of nearmicroscopic particles; in fact, they are known to influence even macroscopic systems.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{orders in}} Hubbard models on a Kagome lattice at van Hove filling are of intense current interest and debate. We study this issue using the singular-mode functional renormalization group theory. We discover a rich variety of electronic instabilities under short range interactions. With increasing on-site repulsion $U$, the system develops successively ferromagnetism, intra unit-cell antiferromagnetism, and charge bond order. With nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction $V$ alone (U= 0), the system develops intra-unit-cell charge density wave order for small $V$, s-wave superconductivity for moderate $V$, and the charge density wave order appears again for even larger $V$. With both $U$ and $V$, we also find <b>spin</b> <b>bond</b> order and chiral $d_{x^ 2 - y^ 2 } + i d_{xy}$ superconductivity in some particular regimes of the phase diagram. We {{find that the}} s-wave superconductivity {{is a result of}} charge density wave fluctuations and the squared logarithmic divergence in the pairing susceptibility. On the other hand, the d-wave superconductivity follows from bond order fluctuations that avoid the matrix element effect. The phase diagram is vastly different from that in honeycomb lattices because of the geometrical frustration in the Kagome lattice. Comment: 8 pages with 9 color figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the ground {{state of the}} $d^ 1 $ spin-orbital model for triply degenerate $t_{ 2 g}$ orbitals on a triangular lattice which unifies intrinsic frustration of spin and orbital interactions with geometrical frustration. Using full or Lanczos exact diagonalization of finite clusters we establish that the ground state of the spin-orbital model which interpolates between the superexchange and direct exchange interactions on the bonds is characterized by valence-bond correlations. In the absence of Hund's exchange the model describes a competition between various possible valence-bond states. By considering the clusters with open boundary conditions we demonstrate that orbital interactions are always frustrated, but this frustration is removed by pronounced spin singlet correlations which coexist with supporting them dimer orbital correlations. Such local configurations contribute to the disordered ground states found for the clusters with periodic boundary conditions which interpolate between a highly resonating, dimer-based, entangled spin-orbital liquid phase, and a valence-bond state with completely static spin-singlet states. We argue that these states are also realized for the infinite lattice and anticipate that pronounced transitions between different regimes found for particular geometries {{will turn out to}} smooth crossovers in the properties of the spin-orbital liquid in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we provide evidence that the resonating spin-orbital liquid phase involves entangled states on the bonds. In such a phase classical considerations based on the mean-field theory cannot be used, spin exchange interactions do not determine <b>spin</b> <b>bond</b> correlations, and quantum fluctuations {{play a crucial role in}} the ground states and magnetic transitions.

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) is used {{to rationalize}} magnetic parameters of hydrated electron trapped in alkaline glasses as observed using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies. To this end, model water cluster anions (n= 4 - 8 and n= 20, 24) that localize the electron internally are examined. It is shown that EPR parameters of such water anions (such as hyperfine coupling tensors of H/D nuclei in the water molecules) are defined mainly by the cavity size and the coordination number of the electron; the water molecules in the second solvation shell play a relatively minor role. An idealized model of hydrated electron (that is usually attributed to L. Kevan) in which six hydroxyl groups arranged in an octahedral pattern point towards the common center is shown to provide the closest match to the experimental parameters, such as isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants for the protons (estimated from ESEEM), the second moment of the EPR spectra, and the radius of gyration. The salient feature of these DFT models is the significant transfer (10 - 20 %) of spin density into the frontal O 2 p orbitals of water molecules. <b>Spin</b> <b>bond</b> polarization involving these oxygen orbitals accounts for small, negative hyperfine coupling constants for protons in hydroxyl groups that form the electron-trapping cavity.
