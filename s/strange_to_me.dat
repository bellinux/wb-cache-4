That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so I did find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [...] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [...] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|During her {{travels in}} China, Wong {{continued}} to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community. She had difficulty communicating {{in many areas of}} China because she was raised with the Taishan dialect rather than Mandarin. She later commented that some of the varieties of Chinese sounded [...] "as <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as Gaelic. I thus had the strange experience of talking to my own people through an interpreter." ...|$|E
500|$|... "What'd I Say" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists in many {{different}} styles. Elvis Presley used the song in a large dance scene in his 1964 film Viva Las Vegas and released it as a single with the title song on the B-side. It became a gold record. Cliff Richard, Eric Clapton with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, the Big Three, Eddie Cochran, Bobby Darin, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Nancy Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Trini Lopez, Roy Orbison, Bo Diddley, Johnny Cash and June Carter, Rare Earth and The Ronettes all put their own style on the song. [...] Checkmates, Ltd. released {{a version of the}} song as part of a medley on their 1967 debut album, Live! At Caesar's Palace. [...] Jerry Lee Lewis found particular success with his rendition in 1961, which peaked at number 30 and spent eight weeks on the charts. Charles noticed, later writing [...] "I saw that many of the stations which had banned the tune started playing it when it was covered by white artists. That seemed <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as though white sex was cleaner than black sex. But once they began playing the white version, they lifted the ban and also played the original." [...] In 2001 the italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari sampled part of the melody for his song Porca l'oca, included in the album Shake.|$|E

60|$|Then I {{saw some}} large bats with white heads flitting around in zigzag flights--assuredly new and <b>strange</b> creatures <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|When {{of tender}} {{mind and body}} [...] I was moved by minstrelsy, And that strain [...] "The Bridge of Lodi" [...] Brought a <b>strange</b> delight <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In September 2007, he elaborated: He {{believes}} that opposing capital punishment {{is consistent with}} being pro-life; in his book, Liberty Defined, stating [...] "It's <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that those who champion best the rights of pre-born are generally the strongest supporters {{of the death penalty}} and preventive, that is, aggressive, war." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was criticized}} {{throughout}} her career for being uneven with her talent in writing, something she recognized in herself, and that reflected periods {{of depression and}} artistic frustration. She {{has been described as}} having unique sensibilities; she wrote of feeling [...] "vibrations" [...] from the land, and often preferred long periods of solitude at Cross Creek. She was known for being remarkably strong-willed, but after her death, Norton Baskin wrote of her, [...] "Marjorie was the shyest person I have ever known. This was always <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as she could stand up to anybody in any department of endeavor but time after time when she was asked to go some place or to do something she would accept -'if I would go with her.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E
60|$|DAISY. Do {{you think}} you know me yet? I don't know myself. In my heart there are secrets that are <b>strange</b> even <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and spells <b>to</b> bind you <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and enchantments so that you will never weary.|$|R
60|$|Still {{trying to}} {{understand}} that I was little better than a stranger to her, and still bent on finding {{the secret of the}} sympathy that united us, Eunice put a <b>strange</b> question <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Still, {{in spite}} of the melancholy which {{sometimes}} overtook me, there were several little incidents that made me forget myself in the contemplation of the <b>strange</b> and <b>to</b> <b>me</b> most wonderful sights of the sea.|$|R
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
60|$|He {{pronounced}} {{that one}} {{word in a}} tone so utterly unlike his natural tone that his voice sounded quite <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “Something like that,” she confessed. “You understand, seal-hunters are so new and <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{am quite}} ready to expect anything.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no. But it is <b>strange,</b> even <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that {{loving it}} so much and being so much beloved in it, I can bear to cast it away. It seems so neglectful of it, so unthankful.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She writes {{like one}} dazed. I think that, like ourselves, she hardly realises it yet. She says, 'It all {{seems like a}} <b>strange</b> dream <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Anne.' That is the only {{reference}} she makes to herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know not," [...] {{answered}} Sally, fanning her fat {{face with}} a yellow pocket-handkerchief. [...] "They are <b>strange</b> people <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and thin with travelling, but they talk a kind of Zulu. The Baas wishes you to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} Hitchin again broke in,--"Heard a man speak of me--what man? Really, Mr Trembath, your conduct appears <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Will you explain yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, I {{would much}} rather stay here. Every one would be <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and {{having nothing to do}} I should feel in the way." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{opinion of}} the nine seems <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> for it is {{unsupported}} by authority, while {{there was at least}} constructive authority for the opposite view.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Strange</b> that <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that burning desert [...] Seems so dear. [...] The endless sky {{and lonely}} mesa, [...] Flat and drear, [...] Calls me, calls {{me as the}} flute of Utah [...] Calls his mate-- [...] This wild, sad, sunny, brazen country, [...] Hot as hate.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it is not}} my land," [...] said I. [...] "It is your father's for {{the time}} being. I have no right here whatever. I {{do not know how to}} explain, but you must think it very <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> find <b>me</b> here when you {{supposed}} I had started for Europe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care if it's only fotty cents. And I must say, Mr. Bennam, you're {{about the}} <b>strangest</b> vice-consul, <b>to</b> want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do it, that I eva saw." ...|$|R
60|$|And, ever as he spoke, {{she gazed}} {{on him with}} {{wonderful}} eyes, and in them shone a light of truth and honesty such as was <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems so}} <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Burke," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, {{after a few}} moments' silence. [...] "I never {{imagined}} that you would care for Willy Croup." ...|$|E
60|$|Early on {{the morning}} of the fourth day, just before sunrise, a trifling {{incident}} happened, which was noticeable, nevertheless, as being <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my experience of myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she replied. [...] "Strange {{things happen}} sometimes. If <b>strange</b> things happen <b>to</b> <b>me</b> will you let Frank come {{back before the}} five years are out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{trust me}} for any {{harmless}} purpose," [...] I said. [...] "If it troubles you <b>to</b> explain your <b>strange</b> situation <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> don't think {{of returning to}} the subject again. I {{have no right to}} ask you for any explanations. Tell me how I can help you; and if I can, I will." ...|$|R
60|$|This was a <b>strange</b> name <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but I {{afterwards}} ascertained {{it belonged}} to a respectable young man who visited Mrs. Bradfort's, and who stood very well with all his acquaintances. I looked at Rupert, to note the effect; but Rupert was as calm as Grace herself had been, when he gave Miss Winthrop.|$|R
60|$|JOHN. The little things! It seems <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to {{hear you}} call me by my name, Maggie. It's as if I looked on you for the first time.|$|E
60|$|I {{noticed that}} the men wore spurs, which seemed <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But when, late in the afternoon, we arrived at their encampment, I {{discovered}} that my captors were cavalrymen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} thought that I {{should like to}} talk to you again," [...] she said, immediately. [...] "It seems <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> how many things I said to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{good many}} <b>strange</b> things {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and my mates at sea. Would you and that other lady like to hear any of them?" [...] asked Captain Bird.|$|R

60|$|A {{different}} goddess the Eryx Astarte, {{the woman}} Ashtaroth, Erycina ridens must have been, in her prehstoric dark smiling, watching the fearful sunsets beyond the Egades, from our gold-lighted Apollo of the Ionian east.
