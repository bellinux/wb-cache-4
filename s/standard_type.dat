5|$|By 1887 {{the threat}} of {{extinction}} was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England. The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn {{up at the same}} time. The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further {{the best interests of the}} breed, and both were keen to produce a <b>standard</b> <b>type</b> of beagle. By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.|$|E
5|$|Despite having {{settled on}} a new <b>standard</b> <b>type,</b> Gresley {{continued}} to experiment on individual locomotives, in one of which experiments ACFI feedwater heaters were installed in A1 2576 The White Knight and A3 2580 Shotover. However, on the Pacifics the increase in efficiency was deemed insufficient and the apparatus was eventually removed. In 1935, number 2544 Lemberg received Trofimoff piston valves of an ingenious design with automatically varying steam passages.|$|E

Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many peripheral devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors {{as though they had}} a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople's {{cultural}} influence {{extended from}} Sicily to Russia. Armenia, as a border state between the Roman-Byzantine and Sasanian empires, {{was influenced by}} both. The exact relationship between Byzantine architecture {{and that of the}} Caucasus is unclear. Georgia and Armenia produced many central planned, domed buildings in the 7th century and, after a lull during the Arab invasions, the architecture flourished again in the Middle Byzantine Period. Armenian church domes were initially wooden structures. Etchmiadzin Cathedral (c. 483) originally had a wooden dome covered by a wooden pyramidal roof before this was replaced with stone construction in 618. Churches with stone domes became the <b>standard</b> <b>type</b> after the 7th century, perhaps benefiting from a possible exodus of stonecutters from Syria, but the long traditions of wooden construction carried over stylistically. Some examples in stone as late as the 12th century are detailed imitations of clearly wooden prototypes. Armenian church building was prolific in the late 6th and 7th centuries and, by the 7th century, the churches tend to be either central plans or combinations of central and longitudinal plans. Domes were supported by either squinches (which were used in the Sasanian Empire but rarely in the Byzantine) or pendentives like those of the Byzantine empire, and the combination of domed-cross plan with the hall-church plan could have been influenced by the architecture of Justinian. Domes and cross arms were added to the longitudinal cathedral of Dvin from 608 to 615 and a church in Tekor. Other domed examples include Ptghnavank in Ptghni (c. 600), a church in T'alinn (662-85), and the Cathedral of Mren (629-40).|$|E

Optical fibers may be connected to each other by connectors or by splicing, that is, joining two fibers {{together to form a}} continuous optical waveguide. The generally accepted splicing method is arc fusion splicing, which melts the fiber ends together with an electric arc. For quicker fastening jobs, a “mechanical splice” is used.|$|E
25|$|An unusual local {{variant of}} the Type 24 can be found along the River Wey in Surrey between Godalming and Albury. Known as a Mowlem Drum after the {{contractor}} that built them, these are Type 24s that have had circular external shuttering used to produce very thick walls. Internally they are identical to a <b>standard</b> <b>Type</b> 24. Most are fully circular but some still have the flat rear wall of a normal Type 24 allowing the two rear embrasures to be present. There are 25 examples of this type still extant.|$|E

25|$|DH.9A – (also {{referred}} to as the Nine-Ack) was designed for Airco by Westland Aircraft {{to take advantage of the}} 400hp (298kW) American Liberty L-12 engine. Apart from the new engine and slightly larger wings it was identical to the DH.9. Initially it was hoped to quickly replace the DH.9 with the new version, but the shortage of Liberty engines available to the RAF limited the new type's service in the First World War, and it is best known as a <b>standard</b> <b>type</b> in the postwar RAF, serving as a general purpose aircraft for several years. 2,300 DH.9As were built by ten different British companies.|$|E
25|$|The Mk XI (type 365 <b>standard,</b> <b>type</b> 370 tropicalised) {{was based}} on a {{combination}} of features from the marks VII, VIII and IX. The Mk XI was the first PR variant to have the option of using two vertically mounted F52 cameras with 36-inch-focal-length lens in the fuselage behind the cockpit. Several other configurations could be fitted, depending on mission requirements; the X Type installation, for example had two vertically mounted F24s with 14-inch lens and an oblique F24 with an 8-inch lens mounted above and facing to port. PR Mk XIs used for tactical reconnaissance had an additional, vertically oriented camera in a fairing under each wing.|$|E
25|$|The {{legions of}} the late Republic and early Empire are often called Marian legions. Following the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian {{soldiers}} Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, <b>standard</b> <b>type</b> based on the Principes: armed with two heavy javelins called pila (singular pilum), the short sword called gladius, chain mail (lorica hamata), helmet and rectangular shield (scutum).|$|E
