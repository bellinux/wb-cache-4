40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate an irrigation controller that was mechanically actuated by soil-water tension within laboratory conditions. The controller was designed and constructed using readily available hydraulic fittings and other componentry. The main components of the controller were a tensiometer; a rubber diaphragm that moves according to the variation in tension inside of the tensiometer; an activation rod that transfers the movement from diaphragm to the switch valve; and a steel spring that regulates the activation of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension.</b> Six irrigation controller samples were tested in the laboratory to evaluate the mechanical performance and component forces required to activate the controllers. The relationship between spring adjustment and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> required to open the irrigation valve was linear with a gradient ranging from 1. 10 to 1. 41 kPa mm- 1 and a coefficient of variation of 9. 2 %. However, differences observed in the activation of the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> could also be reduced by individual controller calibration. The calibration of the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> required to initiate irrigation was easily set by adjusting the spring. The proposed controller is functional, simple to use, can be easily adjusted, and does not require electricity to operate...|$|E

At present, {{information regarding the}} best <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> for beginning sweet sorghum irrigation is not available; hence, this study aimed to determine the adequate <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> under field conditions for beginning irrigation of four cultivars of sorghum. Two experiments were conducted at Nova Porteirinha, MG, in a randomized block design with sub-subdivided plots having four replications. Each experiment comprised six treatments of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> (plots) - 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 kPa-for resuming sweet sorghum irrigation, and four sweet sorghum cultivars (subplots) -BRS 508, BRS 509, BRS 511, and CMSXS 647. After planting, the soil water level in the plots was elevated to field capacity (10 kPa), and then the treatments were applied. During treatment application, irrigation was resumed when the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> reached the limit established in order to elevate the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> to 10 kPa. The amount of water replaced during each irrigation was determined by generating a soil water retention curve for the experimental area. The following parameters were evaluated: green mass production, juice volume, soluble solids (Brix), and tons of Brix per hectare (TBH). The different soil water tensions and cultivars, agricultural year, and interaction between tension and year significantly affected (p ? 0. 05) the characteristics evaluated, according to the F test. The agronomical characteristics of the evaluated cultivars showed linear relationship with water supply in the soil. According to TBH, irrigation of sweet sorghum needs to be performed when the soil tension reaches 20 kPa.

The use of silicon in its cultivation becomes important, since this nutrient provides higher rigidity, lower transpiration and higher resistance to dry spells in rice plants. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of silicon fertilization and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tensions</b> on upland rice development and yield in a Cerrado Oxisol. A 5 x 5 fractionated factorial with five <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tensions</b> (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 kPa) and five silicon doses (0, 120, 240, 480 and 960 mg dm- 3) was used, which were distributed in a randomized block design, with four replicates. Plant height, number of tillers, number of panicles, number of grains per panicle, numbers of full and empty grains and percentage of empty grains were evaluated. Silicon fertilization promotes increased tillering in rice plants at the dose of 960 mg dm- 3. The numbers of tillers and panicles decreased with the application of silicon up to the doses of 460 and 490 mg dm- 3, respectively.

The research objectives were: 1) to determine quantities of nitrogen and water applied through a subsurface drip irrigation system to cantaloupe and watermelon which would optimize fruit yield while minimizing losses of nitrogen and; 2) to develop specific monitoring techniques for assessing the water and nitrogen status of melon crops throughout the growing season. Four years of field research were conducted from 1988 to 1991 at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center, Maricopa, AZ. The {{first two years of}} research determined which varieties of cantaloupe and watermelon would grow best under drip irrigation and the feasibility of using plant tissue tests to aid in N fertilizer scheduling. The last two years of research used a factorial design with levels of N and target <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> to determine response surfaces for fruit yield and net return. Information from tensiometers was used to schedule irrigations. Watermelon petiole nitrate levels at critical growth stages were used to recommend application rates of nitrogen fertilizer. In 1991, an N difference method was used to estimate N which was unaccounted for in this watermelon cropping system. Petiole nitrate levels were highly responsive to N fertilizer treatments and accurately quantified visual observations of crop N status. Petiole nitrate results also indicated that preliminary nitrogen fertilizer management guidelines using a tissue nitrate test was reasonably accurate in predicting optimum nitrogen 'management.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop automated pivot sprinkler irrigation systems and determine if such systems use less water and energy than manually operated systems. The {{study was conducted}} near Earth, Texas, using irrigation systems located on producers farms. Sensors with transmitters and receivers were constructed and tested so that the irrigation systems can be controlled by wind, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension,</b> and rainfall. The sensors can be used separately or in combination to control the irrigation systems. For several reasons {{it was not possible to}} determine if automated systems use less water and energy than manually operated systems. The major reason was the low capacity of the wells (114 to 204 m 3 /hr) supplying the irrigation systems. To meet crop water requirements and losses due to evaporation and runoff, the well capacity should be at least 284 m 3 /hr. Since the wells could not supply adequate water, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> was out of the tensiometer range for the last 60 days of the growing season. Considerable variation in <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> and content was noted between irrigation systems and within quadrants of each irrigation system.

When soil cores taken during the 1997 - 98 winter season were incubated at room temperature (24 ± 2 °C), denitrification rates were five to 50 {{times higher than the}} rates evaluated at ambient temperature. The denitrification rate measured at room temperature in the cauliflower winter season was similar to the rate observed in the sweet corn during summer. Soil cores from the cauliflower 1997 - 98 season that received 100 kg N ha⁻¹ had denitrification rates from 10 to 45 g N ha⁻¹ d⁻¹; when these cores were amended with additional soluble carbon, the denitrification rate increased to 800 to 3500 g N ha⁻¹ d⁻¹. All of the three experiments showed higher denitrification rates {{at the end of the}} season. This trend coincided with increases in denitrifying enzyme activity and soluble organic carbon. The denitrification loss of fertilizer N was < 1 % in cauliflower and almost 2 % in summer sweet corn, when irrigated at the higher <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension.</b> Lower <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> did not increase the denitrification rate in the winter, but in the summer the loss of N due to denitrification increased to almost 6 % of the applied N...|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} {{aeration system}} {{was used to}} measure the 14 CO 2 generated in the soil samples of the adaptation experiment with fluctuating <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> and in the liquid cultures. The soil samples, incubated in 100  ml glass flasks, were connected to a CO 2 -trapping system consisting of two wash bottles, each filled with 10  ml of a 0.1  N NaOH solution for collecting 14 CO 2 [36] (modified). The soil was aerated continuously (1.3  l h− 1) with dried air to enable drying of the soils for the fluctuating <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tension</b> experiment. The NaOH solution was exchanged three times per week to quantify the trapped 14 CO 2 by taking an aliquot of 2  ml, mixing it with 3  ml Ultima Flo and measuring it in a liquid scintillation counter. The liquid cultures, enriched in Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated on a shaker (75  rpm), were connected to this trapping system and aerated (1.3  l h− 1) three times per week for 1  h. After each aeration step, the NaOH was exchanged and a 2  ml aliquot was measured for radioactivity as described above.|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{importance}} of the macroporosity for the water transport properties of soils, its quantitative assessment is a challenging task. Measurements of hydraulic conductivity (K) at different <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tensions</b> and the quantification of water-conducting macropores (&# 952;M) of a soil under different tillage systems could help understand the effects on the soil porous system and related hydraulic properties. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of Conventional Tillage (CT), Chisel Plow (CP) and No Tillage (NT) on &# 952;M and on K; and to quantify the contribution of macroporosity to total water flux in a loam soil. A tension disc infiltrometer was used at two <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> pressure heads (- 5 cm, and 0) to infer &# 952;M and K, during fallow. Macroporosity was determined based on the flow contribution between 0 and - 5 cm water potentials (K 0, K 5, respectively), according to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The K 0 values were statistically higher for CT than for NT and CP. The K 5 values did not differ statistically among treatments. The mean K values varied between 0. 20 and 3. 70 cm/h. For CT, &# 952;M was significantly greater than for CP and NT, following the same trend as K 0. No differences in &# 952;M were detected between CP and NT. With CT, the formation of water-conducting macropores with persistence until post-harvest was possible, while under CP preparation, the water-conducting macropores were not persistent. These results support the idea that tillage affects the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> movement mainly by the resulting water-conducting macropores. Future studies on tillage effects on water movement should focus on macroporosity...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} water stress effect on total phenolics and total antioxidants of selected African nightshades and determine any possible variations in the amount of total phenolics and total antioxidants among the accessions grown. Study Design: Study was conducted on the basis of randomized complete block design. Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out in Kenyatta University Agricultural farm in Kiambu County of Kenya. Greenhouse experiments were carried out in the same farm. Methodology: A greenhouse and field experiment was conducted to investigate effects of water stress on total phenolic and total antioxidant contents of Solanum scabrum and Solanum villosum. The two African nightshades were subjected to different <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tensions</b> of 15 cbars, 50 cbars and 85 cbars. After a month of transplanting, samples from the different blocks were collected fortnightly and prepared for total phenolic and total antioxidant determination. Results: Obtained data showed that Solanum villosum had a higher concentration of both the total phenolics and antioxidant activity in the shoots (46. 41 g/Kg total phenolic content and 52. 68 % total antioxidant activity) while Solanum scabrum had higher concentration in the roots (25. 06 g/Kg total phenolic content and 27. 18 % total antioxidant activity).

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} {{continuous}} (1 · 0 mg/l) and concentrated (10 mg/l) irrigation water-added polyacrylamide (PAM) on infiltration {{of a highly}} erodible Mediterranean soil were studied using recirculating furrow infiltrometers. Polyacrylamide avoided the seal formation observed in the wetted surface of the control furrow and helped to maintain higher infiltration rates for both PAM treatments. Mean final cumulative infiltration for the continuous and concentrated PAM experiments increased by 20 and 14 %, respectively, {{as the result of}} reduced seal formation and surface sealing. Steady-state furrow infiltration rates, evaluated with disc infiltrometers 15 h after irrigation and under <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tensions</b> of 40 and 100 mm, confirmed the infiltration benefit of PAM treatments. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity calculated under the same tensions revealed that the PAM-treated furrows were about 95 % more permeable than the control. Polyacrylamide application also increased average saturated conductivity by 168 % because of more unblocked pores in the treated furrows. The ability of PAM to influence surface soil conditions and improve infiltration can greatly enhance management of irrigated Mediterranean soils by allowing longer irrigation and higher inflow rates. Application of 10 mg/l in the inflow only during the advance phase of the irrigation can reduce labour, and ensures that loss of PAM from furrow tail water is minimized and that quantities applied during the season are reduced...|$|R

The experiment {{described in the present}} work was conducted in the IFTM, Uberaba, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, aiming to evaluate the muskmelon yield under different soil water tensions. A randomized block experimental design was used with five treatments (soil water tensions of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 kPa) and four replications (plots of two rows of 14 plants). Two harvests were carried out and the fruit yield, stem diameter, number of fruits per plant and efficiency of water use were evaluated. Irrigation was performed with a drip irrigation system and managed with tensiometry. The cultivar Bonus n. 2 was used with spacing of 1. 0 x 0. 6 m. The data of the variables were subjected to the F test and regression test. The treatments showed statistical differences in number of fruits per plant, fruit weight (fruit yield) and stem diameter.

40|$|Knowledge of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> {{conductive}} porosity is {{of paramount}} importance for understanding the water and solute movement in soil. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe and evaluate an alternative pore index, i. e., the representative mean pore radius for two consecutive <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tensions</b> (lambda(Delta psi)), for characterizing the water-transmitting macro- and mesoporosity of soil. The hydraulic conductivity (K) and related hydraulic parameters were measured using a tension disk infiltrometer at - 14, - 4, - 1, and 0 cm water pressure heads at a soil depth of 2 cm on a long-term conservation tillage experiment (after 9 yr of trial) under conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-tillage (NT) treatments. The soil was loam (Xerollic Calciorthid). The measurements were performed within the first half of a 16 - to 18 -mo-long fallow period. Unlike the model based on the classical capillary rise theory, which assumes no differences between measurement sites (e. g., tillage treatments) for the corresponding equivalent pore radius (CD) for macro- and mesopores, significant differences in lambda(Delta psi) values for macro- and mesopores were found between the three tillage systems tested. The number of water-transmitting macro- and mesopores per unit area estimated by means of the capillary rise approach was significantly greater than that calculated using the lambda(Delta psi) pore index. Although significantly higher values of lambda(Delta psi) for both macro- and mesopores were observed under NT a significantly lower near-saturation K was found under NT than CT and RT treatments due to the lower density of water-transmitting macro- and mesopores.

40|$|A pedon scale {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the degree of chloride leaching from a de-watered saline soil profile in the non-irrigated wheatbelt region of south-western Australia. Within the surface 250 mm of the soil profile was a dispersed layer acting as a hydraulic throttle. <b>Soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>tensions</b> and chloride concentrations were obtained over a two-year period over depths ranging from 0. 2 m to 1. 5 m. In the first year the soil surface remained untouched. In the second year, the throttle layer was fractured by ripping to a depth of 250 mm. Rainfall, runoff and potential evaporation were also measured at the site. These data were used to calibrate and run the MACRO solute transport model using three surface treatment management scenarios: I. the soil surface remains unchanged (`Do nothing'); II. the soil surface is continually ripped; III. the soil surface is ripped followed by surface scaling. The time period required, effectively, to leach the chloride from the profile, to a depth of 1. 5 m, was predicted. Effective leaching would take at least 400 years and possibly in excess of 200, 000 years for Treatment I, 5 years for Treatment II and 90 years for Treatment III. Macropores that were observed within the sub-surface soil profile played no significant role in the leaching of the chloride. However, the rip fractures were treated as macropores by the MACRO model and as such allowed greater infiltration of water that resulted in the mobilisation of chloride within the rest of the soil profile...|$|R
