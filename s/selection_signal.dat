Negative selection leads to lower average wages of employer changers in the first skilled job in comparison to stayers. Entry wages of employer changers are specifically reduced by high occupation and training firm retention rates.

However, only a few African populations have been investigated using these genome-wide approaches. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis for evidence of recent positive selection in a sample of 120 individuals of Wolaita ethnicity belonging to Omotic-speaking people who have inhabited the mid- and high-land areas of southern Ethiopia for millennia. Using the 11 HapMap populations as the comparison group, we found Wolaita-specific signals of recent positive selection in several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci. Notably, the selected loci overlapped with HLA regions that we previously reported to be associated with podoconiosis-a geochemical lymphedema of the lower legs common in the Wolaita area. We found <b>selection</b> <b>signals</b> in PPARA, a gene involved in energy metabolism during prolonged food deficiency.

We investigated signals of positive selection in gene sets involved in the metabolism, regulation and action of these two vitamins in worldwide populations sequenced by Phase I of the 1000 Genomes Project. Comparing allele frequency-spectrum-based summary statistics between these gene sets and matched control genes, we observed a <b>selection</b> <b>signal</b> specific to East Asians for a gene set associated with vitamin D action in bones. The <b>selection</b> <b>signal</b> was mainly driven by three genes CXXC finger protein 1 (CXXC 1), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP 5) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX 2). Examination of population differentiation and haplotypes allowed us to identify several candidate causal regulatory variants in each gene. Four of these candidate variants (one each in CXXC 1 and RUNX 2 and two in LRP 5) had a > 70 % derived allele frequency in East Asians, but were present at lower (20 – 60 %) frequency in Europeans as well, suggesting that the adaptation might have been part of a common response to climatic and dietary changes as humans expanded out of Africa, with implications for their role in vitamin D-dependent bone mineralization and osteoporosis insurgence. We also observed haplotype sharing between East Asians, Finns and an extinct archaic human (Denisovan) sample at the CXXC 1 locus, which is best explained by incomplete lineage sorting.

In the present study, we explored the developmental effects of BCL-XL, a repressor of apoptosis. We found that endogenous BCL-XL is down-regulated by both positive and negative <b>selection</b> <b>signals</b> at the CD 4 FCD 8 F stage of thymocyte development. We examined the role of BCL-XL regulatable apoptosis in T cell development {{in the context of an}} αβ TCR transgene, Rag- 1 deficiency and the scid model. We found that BCL-XL expression promoted accumulation of CD 8 single-positive thymocytes even in MHC class II-restricted TCR transgenic mice. However, the apoptotic resistance conferred by BCL-XL could not fully substitute for TCR-mediated positive <b>selection</b> <b>signals</b> nor did it prevent negative selection. Overexpression of BCL-XL promoted partial maturation of CD 4 –CD 8 – thymocytes to CD 4 FCD 8 F cells in a Rag-deficient, but not a scid background. Thus, TCR-mediated signals mediate the regulation of endogenous BCL-XL during thymocyte development, indicating that the principal protection of double-positive thymocytes by BCL-XL occurs prior to selection. The impact of BCL-XL on the CD 8 but not CD 4 lineage supports the asymmetric model of lineage commitment.

Genome re-sequencing datasets of the two breeds were analyzed to further explore the genetic variation of the regions initially identified as putative <b>selection</b> <b>signals.</b> ResultsBased on the 50  K-chip genotypes, we used the overlapping <b>selection</b> <b>signals</b> (SS) identified by four selection sweep mapping analyses (that detect genetic differentiation, reduced heterozygosity and patterns of haplotype diversity) to define 18 convergence candidate regions (CCR), five associated with positive selection in Australian Merino and the remainder indicating positive selection in Churra. Subsequent analysis of whole-genome sequences from 15 Churra and 13 Merino samples identified 142, 400 genetic variants (139, 745 bi-allelic SNPs and 2655 indels) within the 18 defined CCR. Annotation of 1291 variants that were significantly associated with breed identity between Churra and Merino samples identified 257 intragenic variants that caused 296 functional annotation variants, 275 of which were located across 31 coding genes. Among these, four synonymous and four missense variants (NPR 2 _His 847 Arg, NCAPG_Ser 585 Phe, LCORL_Asp 1214 Glu and LCORL_Ile 1441 Leu) were included. ConclusionsHere, we report the mapping and genetic variation of 18 selection signatures that were identified between Australian Merino and Spanish Churra sheep breeds, which were validated by an additional contrast between Spanish Merino and Churra genotypes. Analysis of whole-genome sequencing datasets allowed us to identify divergent variants that may be viewed as candidates involved in the phenotypic differences for wool, growth and meat production/quality traits between the breeds analyzed. The four missense variants located in the NPR 2, NCAPG and LCORL genes may be related to selection sweep regions previously identified and various QTL reported in sheep in relation to growth traits and carcass composition...|$|R
