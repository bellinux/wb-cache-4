40|$|The {{attachment}} of Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan I) and two {{strains of}} group A and G streptococci on glass cover <b>slips</b> <b>coated</b> with fibronectin, fibronectin fragments, or fibrinogen was studied. The attachment was quantitated by counting the attached bacteria on glass surfaces {{coated with a}} similar molarity of the proteins. Fibronectin was a more effective attachment factor than fibrinogen for staphylococci, while group G streptococci attached better on fibrinogen- than on fibronectin-coated cover slips. In this system, group A streptococci bound almost exclusively to substrate-bound fibrinogen. Attachment experiments involving the use of staphylococci pretreated with soluble fibronectin or fibrinogen revealed that bacterium-bound fibronectin and fibrinogen were able to enhance the adherence on cover <b>slips</b> <b>coated</b> with fibronectin. The 30 -kilodalton NH 2 -terminal and the 120 - to 140 -kilodalton COOH-terminal fragments of fibronectin, both of which contain bacterial binding sites, mediated the staphylococcal attachment, suggesting that both parts of the molecule {{are involved in the}} attachment mediated by fibronectin...|$|R

30|$|The high {{absorption}} coefficient enables {{it as an}} amazing absorber, which was first applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to replace organic dye by Kojima et al. [13], Horvath et al. [49]. The further investigation shows that they not only {{play the role of}} the light absorbers, but also can be viewed both as electron- and hole-transporting media, owing to their ambipolar charge transport character [50]. In perovskite film synthesis, a nonporous homogenous perovskite film must be deposited in order to avoid shunting in planar devices. However, films produced by conventional spin coating methods were found to be comprised of large CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 microwhiskers and many uncovered void areas [51]. Dendrite crystal growth implies that organolead iodide perovskite (OIP) exhibits preferential growth. Inspired by that phenomenon, the synthesis of OIP nanowires (NWs) was investigated and implemented in our group [52]. In addition to our work, Swiss scientists Endre Horvá et al. pioneered the synthesis of OIP NWs by a simple <b>slip</b> <b>coating</b> method during a similar period [53].

30|$|The {{surfaces}} used to {{seal the}} observation chamber and for the motility analysis were either acid washed glass (AWG) cover slips (Carl Roth GmbH) or cover <b>slips</b> <b>coated</b> with FOTS or polyethyleneglycoltriethoxysilane (PEG). FOTS silane was coated on glass cover slips through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for 2  h at 80  °C [10]. Subsequently samples were rinsed with ethanol (p.A.) and dried with N 2 gas. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) triethoxysilane (PEG 2000 -urea) was synthesized according to previously published protocols [23]. Prior to <b>coating,</b> glass cover <b>slips</b> were activated by piranha solution (H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2  =  3 : 1). 0.25  mM PEG silane and 2.5  µM triethylamine were dissolved in dried toluene (p.A.). The activated glass cover slips were immersed in this solution and allowed to react for 48  h at 55  °C. Subsequently, the samples were rinsed with ethyl acetate (p.A.) and sonicated in ethyl acetate for 2  min and then rinsed again with ethyl acetate and methanol (p.A.). All surface coatings were characterized by ellipsometry, XPS, and contact angle goniometry. The AWG coverslips were prepared by immersion in 0.1  M HCl for 24  h, before washing extensively in deionised water and blowing dry in a stream of nitrogen.

The platelet integrin αIIbβ 3 is primarily responsible for the interaction between platelets and fibrinogen and consecutive thrombus growth. In this study, we evaluated platelet adhesion onto immobilized fibrinogen under venous and arterial flow conditions in men and women. Methods Platelets in whole anticoagulated blood were labelled with the fluorescence dye Mepacrine and perfused through the rectangular flow chamber over glass cover <b>slips</b> <b>coated</b> with fibrinogen (shear rates of 50 s - 1, 500 s - 1 and 1500 s - 1). A fluorescence laser-scan microscope was used for visualisation and quantification of platelet adhesion at 15 seconds, 1 and 5 minutes {{after the start of}} perfusion. Results During perfusion, the platelet adhesion linearly increased in regard to exposition time and shear rate. After five minutes of perfusion the platelet adhesion onto immobilized fibrinogen showed no significant gender related difference, neither at 50 s - 1 nor at 500 s - 1 and 1500 s - 1 (p > 0. 05), respectively. No significant difference in platelet adhesion onto immobilized fibrinogen, in regard to the menopausal status, was either observed (p > 0. 05). Conclusion In our in vitro experimental system, hormonal {{differences between men and women}} did not influence platelet adhesion onto immobilized fibrinogen, neither under venous nor under arterial rheological conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{internal}} mechanisms controlling fault friction {{is crucial for}} understanding seismogenic slip on active faults. Displacement in such fault zones is frequently localized on highly reflective (mirrorlike) <b>slip</b> surfaces, <b>coated</b> with thin films of nanogranular fault rock. We show that mirror-slip surfaces developed in experimentally simulated calcite faults consist of aligned nanogranular chains or fibers that are ductile at room conditions. These microstructures and associated frictional data suggest a fault-slip mechanism resembling classical Ashby-Verrall superplasticity, capable of producing unstable fault slip. Diffusive mass transfer in nanocrystalline calcite gouge is shown to be fast enough for this mechanism to control seismogenesis in limestone terrains. With nanogranular fault surfaces becoming increasingly recognized in crustal faults, the proposed mechanism may be generally relevant to crustal seismogenesis...|$|R

40|$|It is now {{recognized}} that angiogenesis, the induction of capillary proliferation, {{is important for}} the continued growth of solid tumors (1 - 3). Kessler et al. (4) reported that mast cells assemble at a tumor site before the ingrowth of new capillaries; it was proposed that mast cells {{may play a role in}} tumor angiogenesis. Mast cells are also found in increased numbers in other pathologic states associated with angiogenesis, such as psoriasis (5, 6), chronic inflammation (7, 8), and immune rejection (9, 10). However, the exact function of the mast cells in angiogenesis is not understood. Previously, Ausprunk and Folkman (11) reported that capillary endothelial cell migration was one of the major components of the growing capillary sprouts that arise in angiogenesis. After bovine capillary endothelial cells were cloned and carried in long-term culture (12) in this laboratory, Zetter (13) developed a quantitative assay in vitro for measuring the migration of these cells. In this assay, bovine capillary endothelial cells were plated sparsely on glass cover <b>slips</b> <b>coated</b> with colloidal gold so that their migration generated a phagokinetic track, the area of which could be measured accurately. We now report that mast cells release a factor that stimulates migration of capillary endothelial cells. We have investigated the effect of isolated mast cell products on bovine capillary endothelial cell migration, and we demonstrate that heparin is the mast cell factor responsible for capillary endothelial cell migration in vitro. Materials and Methods Assay for Endothelial Cell Migration. 3, 000 cells (bovine capillary endothelial, MDCK, Swiss 3 T 3, human fibroblast, or bovine aortic endothelial cells) were seeded onto 22 -mm ~ glass cover slips (Rochester Scientific Co., Rochester, N.

Layered {{structure}} with composition gradient between inner layer of alumina (Al 2 O 3) and outer layer of zirconia (ZrO 2 - 3 mol % Y 2 O 3;TZ- 3 Y) was fabricated using a gel casting {{process for the}} inner layer and a dip coating process for the outer layer in an aqueous system. The interlayer with composition gradient was prepared by mixing the Al 2 O 3 and TZ- 3 Y slips as a volume ratio. Dried green bodies of the inner layer were pre-sintered at 1100 °C for 5 hr. After pre-wetting the pre-sintered bodies, the dip coating was preformed with mixed slips. Two kinds of composition gradients in the interlayer were prepared to observe the effect of composition gradient on mechanical properties, with same thickness. One is continuous composition gradient from Al 2 O 3 to TZ- 3 Y with 9 : 1 to 1 : 9 volume ratios, {{and the other is}} layered {{structure with}} 8 : 2, 6 : 4, 4 : 6, and 2 : 8 volume ratios of Al 2 O 3 and TZ- 3 Y.

For measurement of flexural strength, a standard four-point banding test was conducted. Also, hardness and modulus were measured using micro- and nano-indentation techniques.
