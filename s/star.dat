5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} <b>star</b> is Alpha Antliae, {{an orange}} giant {{that is a}} suspected variable <b>star,</b> ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29.

Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single <b>star.</b> Two <b>star</b> systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable <b>star</b> of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable <b>star</b> designation HO Librae. This is a <b>star</b> that exhibits variability {{because of the presence}} of <b>star</b> spots combined with the rotation of the <b>star.</b> However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E

5|$|A <b>star</b> remains {{near its}} initial {{position}} on the main sequence until {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous <b>star.</b> (On the HR diagram, the evolving <b>star</b> moves up and {{to the right of the}} main sequence.)

5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. <b>Star</b> formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young <b>star.</b> This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of <b>star</b> formation. A Sun-like <b>star</b> usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E

5|$|Also {{known as}} Nova Muscae 1983, GQ Muscae is a binary system {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and small <b>star</b> that is about 10% as massive as the Sun. The two orbit each other every 1.4hours. The white dwarf accumulates material from its companion <b>star</b> via its accretion disc. After a certain amount has accumulated the <b>star</b> erupts, {{as it did in}} 1983, reaching a magnitude of 7.2. Discovered with a magnitude of 7.1 on 18 January 1983, it was the first nova from which X-rays were detected. The soft X-ray transient GRS 1124-683 (also known as Nova Muscae 1991) is a binary object {{consisting of a}}n orange main-sequence <b>star</b> (GU Muscae) of spectral type K3V–K4V and a black hole of around 6 solar masses.

GR Muscae is an X-ray source composed of a neutron <b>star</b> of between 1.2 and 1.8 times the mass of our Sun and a low-mass <b>star</b> likely to be around the mass of the Sun in close orbit. Finally, SY Muscae is a symbiotic <b>star</b> system composed of a red giant and white dwarf, where although the larger <b>star</b> is transferring mass to the smaller, there is no periodic eruption nor accretion disc formed.
