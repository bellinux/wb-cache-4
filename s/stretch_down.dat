5|$|The {{old town}} of Roskilde is centred around the main square, Stændertorvet, {{just south of}} the cathedral. The {{original}} street plan is preserved in nearby Skomagergade, Algade and Hestetorvet although most of the buildings were rebuilt after serious fires in the 18th century. The area is flanked to the north by two large parks, Byparken and Folkeparken, which <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> to Roskilde Fjord.|$|E
25|$|Ancient birds (Avialae) {{include both}} the Aves, which {{are defined as}} {{descendants}} of the common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx, and the more primitive Epidendrosaurus. Fossil birds <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> from 154Ma through the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event at 65Ma to the present day. Scores of complete skeletons have now been found of the more recent Confuciusornis, which is an early representative of the Ornithurae. Ornithurans all have a bony pygostyle, to which tail feathers are anchored. For more details {{on the evolution of}} birds, see Evolution of birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} the iliopsoas, {{a group of}} two or three muscles with a shared insertion on the lesser trochanter of the femur. The psoas major originates from the last vertebra and along the lumbar spine to <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> into the pelvis. The iliacus originates on the iliac fossa on the interior side of the pelvis. The two muscles unite to form the iliopsoas muscle which is inserted on the lesser trochanter of the femur. The psoas minor, only present in about 50 per cent of subjects, originates above psoas major to stretch obliquely down to its insertion on the interior side of the major muscle.|$|E

25|$|The fenlands, that <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> {{as far as}} Norfolk, {{are former}} {{wetlands}} consisting both of peat bogs and tidal silt marshes which were virtually all drained {{by the end of}} the 19th century when Firsby had its longest period of growth. The former peat fens and silt marshes provided a rich loamy soil that was ideal for the growing of cereal and vegetable crops, and gave Lincolnshire its reputation as being the 'bread basket' of England. The resulting flat lands also made an ideal environment for the later mechanisation of farming in the mid-20th century. Firsby has always been an agriculturally based village with a dark and rich loamy soil over a heavy clay subsoil.|$|E

2500|$|A {{horse is}} warmed up and cooled down without the side reins, {{allowing}} the neck to <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> {{and the back}} muscles to relax. Side reins are most useful for work in the trot and canter, where the neck, back and hindquarter muscles are engaged. Working a horse in side reins at the walk actually discourages a relaxed, forward-moving gait. [...] Side reins are not used for jumping, as they restrict {{the use of the}} neck too much, and may even cause the horse to fall.|$|E
2500|$|The short stretch between Otiria and Kawakawa was {{retained}} as {{a link to}} {{the national}} network, but has since been dismantled and is now used as a footpath connecting Kawakawa with Moerewa (a disused siding terminates at Moerewa). [...] The tourist trains operated between Kawakawa and Opua until 2001, when the Land Transport Safety Authority withdrew the line's operating licence. [...] Currently, operations run between Kawakawa, including the <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> the main street, to Taumarere. The terminus in Opua is on land now owned by Far North Holdings, the trading arm of Far North District Council, and negotiations are under way so that trains can return to Opua in the near future.|$|E

[...] Köpmangatan ("Merchant's Street"), paralleled by Trädgårdsgatan ("Garden Street") north of it, leads east to Köpmantorget ("Merchant's Square"), Köpmanbrinken ("Merchant's Slope") and Österlånggatan ("Eastern Long Street"), and {{used to be the}} only street leading through the eastern city wall down to Fisketorget, a former square and for hundreds of years the largest in Stockholm. [...] Furthermore, a number of alleys connect to the immediate surrounding blocks: [...] On the northern side, Trångsund and Källargränd stretch to Storkyrkobrinken and Slottsbacken {{on either side of the}} Stock Exchange Building.

60|$|The Naabs had hemmed {{him in a}} triangle, Dave and Billy at {{the broad}} end, August at the apex, and now the real race began.

To cover this broad end of the open required riding the like of which Hare had never dreamed of.

6000|$|After {{browsing}} {{among the}} stately ruins of Rome, of Baiae, of Pompeii, and after glancing {{down the long}} marble ranks of battered and nameless imperial heads that <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> the corridors of the Vatican, one thing strikes me with a force it never had before: the unsubstantial, unlasting character of fame. Men lived long lives, in the olden time, and struggled feverishly through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory, in generalship, or in literature, and then laid them down and died, happy {{in the possession of}} an enduring history and a deathless name. Well, twenty little centuries flutter away, and what is left of these things? A crazy inscription on a block of stone, which snuffy antiquaries bother over and tangle up and make nothing out of but a bare name (which they spell wrong)--no history, no tradition, no poetry--nothing that can give it even a passing interest.

60|$|The reader may {{remember}} that we started post haste from Cape Town, and, having {{the good fortune to}} pass along the southern frontier from De Aar to Stormberg by the last train before the interruption of traffic, had every hope of reaching Ladysmith while its investment was incomplete. I had looked forward to writing an account of our voyage from East London to Durban while on board the vessel; but the weather was so tempestuous, and the little steamer of scarcely 100 tons burthen so buffeted by the waves, that I lay prostrate in all the anguish of sea-sickness, and had no thought for anything else. Moreover, we were delayed some twenty hours by contrary winds; nor was it until we had passed St. John's that the gale, as if repenting, veered suddenly to the south-west and added as much to our speed as it had formerly delayed us. With the change of the wind the violence of the waves to some degree abated, and, though unable to then record them on paper, I had an opportunity of gaining some impressions of the general aspect of the coasts of Pondoland and Natal. These beautiful countries <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> to the ocean in smooth slopes of the richest verdure, broken only at intervals by lofty bluffs crowned with forests. The many rivulets to which the pasture owes its life and the land its richness glide to the shore through deep-set creeks and chines, or plunge over the cliffs in cascades which the strong winds scatter into clouds of spray.|$|E

England should be the ideal democracy of the world. Your laws admit of it, your Government admits of it. Neither birth nor money are indispensable to success. The way is open for the working man to pass even to the Cabinet. And you are nothing of the sort. The cause of the people is not in any country so shamefully and badly represented. You have a bourgeoisie which maintains itself in almost feudal luxury by means of the labour which it employs, and that labour is content to squeak and open its mouth for worms, when it should have the finest fruits of the world. And all this is for want of leadership. Up you come you David Sands, you Phineas Crosses, you Nicholas Fenns, you Thomas Evanses. You each think that you represent Labour, but you don't. You represent trade--the workers at one trade. How they laugh at you, the men who like to keep the government of this country in their own possession! They <b>stretch</b> <b>down</b> a hand to the one who has climbed the highest, they pull him up into the Government, and after that Labour is well quit of him. He has found his place with the gods. Perhaps they will make him a `Sir' and his wife a `Lady,' but for him it is all over with the Cause. And so another ten years is wasted, while another man grows up to take his place." ...|$|E
