5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative <b>self-representation</b> is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E
40|$|<b>Self-representations</b> are multi-faceted and complex. Frontotemporal lobar {{degeneration}} (FTLD) is a {{neurodegenerative disease}} that selectively atrophies anterior brain regions (e. g., frontal pole, insula, anterior cingulate cortex) that are thought to subserve <b>self-representations.</b> While past work has extensively characterized the changes that occur in FTLD patients' comprehension of the social world, relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the changes that occur in the <b>self-representations</b> of patients themselves. The present study assessed five domains of self-representations: (1) self-conscious emotion, (2) self-monitoring, (3) self-focus, (4) self-reflection, and (5) insight in individuals with a neurodegenerative disease (i. e., FTLD, Alzheimer's disease, corticobasal degeneration, supranuclear palsy) and without (i. e., healthy control participants). Multiple methods were used to evaluate participants' behavioral (i. e., emotional facial expressions and eye movements), physiological, and experiential responses. <b>Self-representations</b> in the FTLD and control groups were compared, and the neural correlates of <b>self-representations</b> were investigated across diagnostic categories. Results supported the hypothesis of altered <b>self-representations</b> in FTLD, with FTLD patients exhibiting significantly lower levels of self-conscious emotion, self-monitoring, self-reflection, and insight and significantly higher levels of self-focus than controls. In terms of the neural correlates, three medial right hemisphere regions emerged as being significant predictors of <b>self-representations.</b> In line with expectations, smaller rostral anterior cingulate volumes predicted less self-conscious emotional responding, smaller frontal pole volumes predicted less self-monitoring, and smaller amygdala volumes predicted greater self-focus. FTLD is a disease in which changes in self are common. The present study expanded upon past work by detailing the specific domains of <b>self-representations</b> that are disrupted in FTLD and investigating the neural correlates of these <b>self-representations</b> in a sample of neurodegenerative patients and controls. The findings of the present study have implications for improving the diagnosis and treatment of FTLD and add to our basic understanding of the neural substrates of <b>self-representations...</b>|$|R

In general, the Tulip Revolution did not have the same resonance in Russian public discourse as the Rose, and in particular, Orange Revolutions, mostly because Ukraine had a place in Russian <b>self-representations</b> that Kyrgyzstan did not.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments of the disability rights movement was the growth of the independent living movement, which emerged in California in the 1960s through the efforts of Edward Roberts and other wheelchair-using individuals. This movement, a subset of the disability rights movement, postulates that people with disabilities are the best experts on their needs, and therefore they must take the initiative, individually and collectively, in designing and promoting better solutions and must organize themselves for political power. Besides de-professionalization and <b>self-representation,</b> the independent living movement's ideology comprises de-medicalization of disability, de-institutionalization and cross-disability (i.e. inclusion in the independent living movement regardless of diagnoses). Similarly, The Architectural Barriers Act was passed in 1968, mandating that federally constructed buildings and facilities be accessible to people with physical disabilities. This act is generally considered to be the first ever-federal disability rights legislation. Unfortunately for those with cognitive disabilities, their disability made it more difficult to be the best expert of their own needs, hindering their ability to self-advocate as their wheelchair-using counterparts could. <b>Self-representation</b> was much more difficult for those who could not articulate their thoughts, leading to their dependence on others to carry on the movement.|$|E

Further, we analysed <b>self-representations</b> of relevant technology centres or platforms supporting commercialization activities (e.g. webpages, flyers).

500|$|The word [...] "Maya" [...] {{was likely}} {{derived from the}} postclassical Yucatán city of Mayapan; its more {{restricted}} meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the Yucatán Peninsula. The broader meaning of [...] "Maya" [...] now current, while defined by linguistic relationships, {{is also used to}} refer to ethnic or cultural traits. Most Mayans identify first and foremost with a particular ethnic group, e.g. as [...] "Yucatec" [...] or [...] "K'iche'"; but they also recognize a shared Maya kinship. [...] Language has been fundamental in defining the boundaries of that kinship. Fabri writes: [...] "The term Maya is problematic because Maya peoples do not constitute a homogenous identity. Maya, rather, has become a strategy of <b>self-representation</b> for the Maya movements and its followers. The Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG) finds twenty-one distinct Mayan languages." [...] This pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different Mayan languages, some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language. But, given that the term [...] "dialect" [...] has been used by some with racialist overtones in the past, as scholars made a spurious distinction between Amerindian [...] "dialects" [...] and European [...] "languages", the preferred usage in Mesoamerica {{in recent years has been}} to designate the linguistic varieties spoken by different ethnic group as separate languages.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} reliability and validity of a procedure for identifying and assessing core beliefs, the Core Beliefs Assessment Procedure (CAP). The CAP comprised a semi-structured interview, set of markers, and rating system. Twenty participants were administered the CAP. Participants were clients receiving psychotherapy from a community-based mental health service. Core and peripheral case formulations were developed for each participant. Ten participants completed a second assessment session, with a different interviewer, one week later. The CAP showed strong interviewer reliability. In addition, high inter-rater reliability regarding the intensity of affect (r =. 87) and the commonness (r =. 96) and vividness (r =. 93) of metaphor was achieved. Findings suggested that 8 of 12 markers, proposed in the study, adequately distinguished between core and peripheral self-knowledge. Interviewer ratings showed that core <b>self-representations</b> had significantly higher levels of affect, metaphor, and redundancy (i. e., process markers) than peripheral <b>self-representations.</b> Participant ratings showed that core <b>self-representations</b> had significantly higher levels of self-worth contingency, temporal stability, cross-situational consistency and problem relevance (i. e., content markers) than peripheral <b>self-representations.</b> Significant differences were not observed between core and peripheral <b>self-representations</b> on participant ratings of developmental primacy. The relevance of core and peripheral case formulations to the participants' problems were rated both from the perspective of participants and the participants' therapists in order to determine the validity of the CAP. Core case formulations were rated as being more relevant to the participants' problems and as having more utility for guiding treatment than peripheral case formulations. Therapists may find case formulations derived from the CAP useful for guiding treatment. Future research should test the hypothesis that a therapist following a core case formulation has greater treatment success than a therapist following a peripheral case formulation...|$|R

The findings challenge scholars informed by the theory of Giorgio Agamben, since they point out that asylum seekers uphold different positionings depending on their gender, background and ethnicity.

The method has shown potential in facilitating <b>self-representations</b> and challenging existing dehumanizing discourses on asylum seekers, however the process has been challenging due to matters of trust amongst residents to the participants, lack of control of the research process and displacement of participants.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} Karl Ove Knausgård’s six-volume autobiography My Struggle in {{the frame}} of an emerging cross-medial aesthetics of the ‘serial self’. This aesthetics is informed by the technological potentialities of digital media, and by social media practices like taking a selfie or posting a blog every single day and accumulating these <b>self-representations,</b> without selection. The serial self is marked by continuity, real-time effects, open-endedness, rhythm, repetition, and a thematic attention to the mundane. It can be discerned in the daily comic strip, the daily selfie, and time-lapse cinema. The article embeds My Struggle in this larger, intermedial framework. Moreover, it refers to the work of psychologist Galen Strawson to argue that the <b>self-representations</b> in Knausgård’s work should be understood as episodic rather than diachronic in nature. This results in a sequential and paratactic, rather than causal and hierarchical, presentation of memorial material. It is claimed that serial <b>self-representations</b> of this type are increasingly central to our current media ecology. They offer a valuable medium for investigating, materializing, and mapping on the page the traces left by the passage of time, as serialization lends itself to performative and cumulative representations of a ‘self’ in flux, that dramatize and perform the struggles of the episodic personality in search for continuity...|$|R
2500|$|The European Enlightenment, American independence, {{and later}} the French Revolution reinvigorated {{interest}} in the concepts of republicanism, popular sovereignty, and <b>self-representation</b> in late 18th century Britain, spurring the creation of various politically motivated organizations and societies, most prominently the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI).

[...] Morever, Hardy quickly realized that the general public needed to be educated on the subject of their political rights, and the LCS's secondary aim became to provide cheap, accessible publications and open meetings to the masses.

The film was inspired by his conversations with Alicia Hall Moran and Jason Moran about their ideas for Bleed, their residency for the biennial. Threshold is a continuum of images from popular culture produced {{during the period of}} or about the historic civil rights movement. It riffs on the crossing of thresholds—walking through doors, boarding trains and buses, entering cars, gliding across stages, stepping up to podiums, and even the imagined passage from Earth to heaven—that have defined the voice, place, and aspirations of a people.
