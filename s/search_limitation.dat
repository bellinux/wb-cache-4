40|$|Abstract—With {{the growing}} {{awareness}} of data privacy, more and more cloud users choose to encrypt their sensitive data before outsourcing them to the cloud. Search over encrypted data is therefore a critical function facilitating efficient cloud data access given the high data volume that each user has to handle nowadays. Inverted index {{is one of the}} most efficient searchable index structures and has been widely adopted in plaintext search. However, securing an inverted index and its associated search schemes is not a trivial task. A major challenge exposed from the existing efforts is the difficulty to protect user’s query privacy. The challenge roots on two facts: 1) the existing solutions use a deterministic trapdoor generation function for queries; and 2) once a keyword is searched, the encrypted inverted list for this keyword is revealed to the cloud server. We denote this second property in the existing solutions as one-time-only <b>search</b> <b>limitation.</b> Additionally, conjunctive multi-keyword search, which is the most common form of query nowadays, is not supported in those works. In this paper, we propose a public-key searchable encryption scheme based on the inverted index. Our scheme preserves the high search efficiency inherited from the inverted index while lifting the one-time-only <b>search</b> <b>limitation</b> of the previous solutions. Our scheme features a probabilistic trapdoor generation algorithm and protects the search pattern. In addition, our scheme supports conjunctive multi-keyword search. Compared with the existing public key based schemes that heavily rely on expensive pairing operations, our scheme is more efficient by using only multiplications and exponentiations. To meet stronger security requirements, we strengthen our scheme with an efficient oblivious transfer protocol that hides the access pattern from the cloud. The simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is suitable for practical usage with moderate overhead. I...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) has {{a substantial}} mortality rate and annually affects more than 140, 000 {{people in the}} USA alone. Standard management includes lung protective ventilation but this impairs carbon dioxide clearance and may lead to right heart dysfunction or increased intracranial pressure. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal {{has the potential to}} optimize lung protective ventilation by uncoupling oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance. The aim {{of this article is to}} review the carbon dioxide removal strategies that are likely to be widely available in the near future.

Queries were performed by using the search terms ECCOR, AVCO 2 R, VVCO 2 R, respiratory dialysis, and by combining carbon dioxide removal and ARDS.

40|$|Objective(s) : Haemostasis {{prevents}} {{blood loss}} following vascular injury. It {{depends on the}} unique concert of events involving platelets and specific blood proteins, known as coagulation factors. The clotting system requires precise regulation and coordinated reactions to maintain {{the integrity of the}} vasculature. Clotting insufficiency mostly occurs due to genetically inherited coagulation factor deficiencies such as hemophilia. Materials and Methods: A relevant literature search of PubMed was performed using the keywords coagulation factors, Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and premature translation termination codons. <b>Search</b> <b>limitations</b> included English language and human-based studies. Results: Mutations that cause premature translation termination codons probably account for one-third of genetically inherited diseases. Transcripts bearing aberrant termination codons are selectively identified and eliminated by an evolutionarily conserved posttranscriptional pathway known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). There are many pieces of evidence of decay among coagulation factor genes. However, the hemophilia gene (F 8) {{does not seem to be}} subjected to NMD. Since the F 8 gene is located on the X-chromosome, a connection between X-linked traits and mRNA decay could be assumed. Conclusion: Considering that not all genes go through decay, this review focuses on the basics of the mechanism in coagulation genes. It is interesting to determine whether this translation-coupled surveillance system represents a general rule for the genes encoding components of the same physiological cascade...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays cloud {{computing}} {{is widely used}} by users and organization to get benefit of many services in cloud. Huge datasets in cloud persuade users to outsource their information and documents to the untrusted Cloud Service Provider (CSP). On the other hand, there are some privacy and security problems in cloud storage considering as main drawbacks of extending it among users. One of the solutions for providing confidentiality of data in cloud storage is encrypting data before sending to cloud. This satisfies data confidentiality and makes users feel more confidence on the CSP. However, this prevents user to search the outsourced documents directly. Regular encryption algorithms such as AES, RC 4 and DES mechanisms have <b>searching</b> <b>limitation,</b> in which the whole ciphertext needs to be retrieved and then decrypt before search procedure can be performed.

The Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by Graham and colleagues in the 2000 s, following a review of 31 planned action theories. The framework has two components: Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two questions: 'Is the KTA Framework used in practice? And if so, how?' METHODS: This study is a citation analysis and systematic review. The index citation for the original paper was identified on three databases-Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar-with the facility for citation <b>searching.</b> <b>Limitations</b> of English language and year of publication 2006 -June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum of usage was developed. Only studies applying the framework to implementation projects were included. Data were extracted and mapped against each phase of the framework for studies where it was integral to the implementation project. RESULTS: The citation search yielded 1, 787 records. A total of 1, 057 titles and abstracts were screened. One hundred and forty-six studies described usage to varying degrees, ranging from referenced to integrated. In ten studies, the KTA Framework was integral to the design, delivery and evaluation of the implementation activities. All ten described using the Action Cycle and seven referred to Knowledge Creation. The KTA Framework was enacted in different health care and academic settings with projects targeted at patients, the public, and nursing and allied health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The KTA Framework is being used in practice with varying degrees of completeness. It is frequently cited, with usage ranging from simple attribution via a reference, through informing planning, to making an intellectual contribution. When the framework was integral to knowledge translation, it guided action in idiosyncratic ways and there was theory fidelity. Prevailing wisdom encourages the use of theories, models and conceptual frameworks, yet their application is less evident in practice. This may be an artefact of reporting, indicating that prospective, primary research is needed to explore the real value of the KTA Framework and similar tools...|$|R
