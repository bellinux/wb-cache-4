40|$|Objectives:To {{investigate}} whether {{the provision of}} dental services is influenced by economic incentives in a third-party funded dental service in the Republic of Ireland. Methods:Four treatment items were identified as outcome variables. These items were characterised by variation in regulation among administrative regions or variation in regulation over time. The items were Extra Oral Radiographs, Endodontics, Prolonged Periodontal Treatment, and <b>Surgical</b> <b>Extractions.</b> Claims data {{were obtained from the}} Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS), formerly known as the General Medical Services Payments Board (GMSPB). Population data were obtained from the Central Statistics Office. Data were obtained from the Principal Dental Surgeons in Ireland who apply local regulatory or price controls for certain items of treatment. The data were analysed to determine the impact of the variation in regulatory approach on claims data among the eight regional health administrative areas whilst controlling for known clinical or population structural factors. Results There was a substantially lower than average provision of Extra-Oral Radiographs in regions where regulation was stringently applied. The provision of Prolonged Periodontal Treatment was positively correlated with price. The dentist-to-population ratio is positively correlated with claims for <b>Surgical</b> <b>Extractions.</b> ConclusionsThere is evidence from within the funding system that economic incentives, arising from either the contract itself or due to the geographical structure of the dentist workforce in Ireland, leads to variations in certain items of service provision which are potentially inefficient and independent of known treatment need...|$|R

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the occurrence of}} bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) in patients exposed to nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) requiring <b>surgical</b> tooth <b>extraction.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty high-risk patients exposed to NBPs underwent <b>surgical</b> tooth <b>extraction</b> with bone biopsy and were treated with a 7 -day cycle of oral antibiotics and discontinuation of NBPs for 1 month. BRONJ {{was defined as the}} occurrence of any BRONJ stage (0 - 3) at 3, 6, or 12 months of follow-up. Inferential analysis was performed on a per-bone (maxilla and/or mandible) basis (n = 72). The time to BRONJ was calculated, and age, gender, cancer diagnosis, and baseline osteomyelitis were evaluated as potential predictors. Exact logistic regression was used to model the time-to-outcome relationship, and hazard rates were calculated from logistic probabilities. RESULTS: BRONJ was detected at 3 months' follow-up in 4 bones and at 6 months in 1 further bone. In the whole cohort of bones, the hazard rate of BRONJ was 5. 6 % at 3 months and 1. 5 % at 6 months. Baseline osteomyelitis was a strong risk factor for BRONJ development (odds ratio, 156. 96; exact 95 % confidence interval, 18. 99 to infinity; exact P <. 0001). CONCLUSION: In this 12 -month follow-up study, BRONJ was a rare outcome in high-risk NBP users who underwent <b>surgical</b> tooth <b>extraction.</b> Moreover, baseline osteomyelitis was a very strong risk factor for BRONJ development...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between preoperative findings and short-term outcome in third molar surgery. Study design: A prospective study was carried out involving 80 patients who required 160 <b>surgical</b> <b>extractions</b> of impacted mandibular third molars between January 2009 and December 2010. All extractions were performed under local anesthesia by the same dental surgeon. Swelling and maximal inter-incisor distance were measured at 48 h and on the 7 th day postoperatively. Mean visual analogue pain scores were determined at four different time periods. Results: One-hundred eight (67. 5 %) of the 160 extractions were performed on male subjects and 52 (32. 5 %) were performed on female subjects. Median age was 22. 46 years. The amount of facial swelling varied depending on gender and operating time. Trismus varied depending on gender, operating time and tooth sectioning. The influence of age, gender and operating time varied depending on the pain evaluation period (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Short-term outcomes of third molar operations (swelling, trismus and pain) differ depending on the patients' characteristics (age, gender and body mass index).

5000|$|Luxation of the {{adjacent}} tooth: The application of force, during the extraction procedure, must strictly {{be limited to}} the tooth that requires the extraction. Most cases of <b>surgical</b> <b>extraction</b> procedures, require that, the forces are diverted, from the tooth, itself, to areas such as bone surrounding the tooth, to ensure adequate bone removal, before proceeding any further in the extraction procedure. Either way, the forces applied by various instruments during, both, simple, and complicated surgical procedure, may loosen the teeth present, both, in front of, or, behind the tooth, depending upon the impact direction and location of the force being applied and, that happening, only if the forces divert from the actual tooth that needs extraction. Such deleterious forces may weaken the anchorage of adjacent teeth from within their boney socket, and, hence, result in weakening of {{the adjacent}} teeth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{study on}} the {{efficacy}} of oral analgesics reported that no single class of drug is effective in post-surgical dental pain. Pain following removal of third molar is most commonly used and widely accepted acute pain model for assessing the analgesic effect of drugs in humans. Reports demonstrated that analgesic efficacy in the human dental model is highly predictive. The high incidence of false-negative findings in analgesic investigations hinders the process of molecular discovery. Molecular mechanism of post-surgical pain is not known. More importantly, the animal model for postoperative dental pain is not well established. In an attempt to discover an effective post-surgical dental pain blocker with acceptable side effects, {{it is essential to}} elucidate the molecular mechanism of post-operative dental pain. The present study investigated mandibular molars extraction in rat as an animal model for the post-operative dental pain in central nervous system. Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that pre administration of GBP (150 mg/kg. i. p) significantly (p< 0. 01) neutralized the <b>surgical</b> molar <b>extraction</b> induced c-Fos expression bilaterally in rat hypothalamus. Present results indicate that pain after <b>surgical</b> molar <b>extraction</b> might follow novel neural pathways therefore difficult to treat with existing anti-nociceptive drugs...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{existence}} of intraorbital foreign bodies and its frequency and association with fracture by using computerized tomography (CT) in patients with maxillofacial or orbital injuries. Methods: Maxillofacial or orbita evaluations and hospital charts of patients, who were admitted to our hospital due to maxillofacial or orbital injuries and who underwent CT using the axial examination and reformatted coronal views with spiral scanning and 3 mm slice width by using the General Electric HiSpeed Nx/i dual CT device in our in emergency CT unit were retrospectively evaluated. Results: During the 15 month study period, 38 (9. 0 %) out of the total of 420 study patients had intraorbital foreign bodies (IOFB). Among the 76 IOFBs confirmed, 72 (94. 7 %) were metallic or non-metallic inorganic, and 4 were bone fragments accepted as organic foreign bodies. Of all cases, 28 (73. 7 %) had no fracture. Conclusions: It is essential that the presence and locations of IOFBs should be determined correctly for their successful <b>surgical</b> <b>extractions.</b> CT imaging is the preferential method for determining of presence and locations of foreign bodies. In the low energy traumas, IOFBs without fractures may be seen frequently and therefore, emergency department practitioners should be on alert about this possibility...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Odontogenic {{cutaneous}} sinus tract is {{a relatively}} rare occurrence that can be complicated to diagnose. The presence of a cutaneous lesion is often not even partly associated with a dental etiology because of the less frequency of occurrence {{in the case of}} dental symptoms. Consequently, the underlying dental cause is often missed leading to inappropriate diagnosis and treatment. Case presentation: Here, we report the case of a 45 -year-old man who presented with a persistent lesion of the cervical region. At the time of presentation, the lesion had been present for approximately one year with a gradual increase in size but no specific symptoms. The patient had previously undergone punch resection under local anesthesia, which resulted in a histopathological diagnosis of inverted follicular keratosis. A diagnosis was made of an odontogenic cutaneous sinus tract secondary to chronic apical periodontitis of the left mandibular second molar. Discussion: Cutaneous sinus tract in the face and neck is most likely to develop intraorally. Root canal treatment or <b>surgical</b> <b>extractions</b> are the common treatment choices. A previously reported review of 137 cases found that 106 (77 %) were treated by extraction and 27 (20 %) were treated by surgical or conservative nonsurgical endodontic therapy. Conclusion: Early diagnosis of cutaneous sinus tract using proper aid is responsible for shortening the treatment duration and avoiding unnecessary treatment...|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the cyst in the body, the patient could be asymptomatic even though the cysts have grown to be very large, or be symptomatic even if the cysts are absolutely tiny. If the patient is symptomatic, the symptoms will depend largely on where the cysts are located. For instance, if the patient has cysts in the lungs and is symptomatic, they will have a cough, shortness of breath and/or pain in the chest. On the other hand, if the patient has cysts in the liver and is symptomatic, they will suffer from abdominal pain, abnormal abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly with an abdominal mass, jaundice, fever and/or anaphylactic reaction. In addition, if the cysts were to rupture while in the body, whether during <b>surgical</b> <b>extraction</b> of the cysts or by trauma to the body, the patient would most likely go into anaphylactic shock and suffer from high fever, pruritus (itching), edema (swelling) of the lips and eyelids, dyspnea, stridor and rhinorrhea.|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} {{whether there}} is a high enough risk of bleeding in patients who take oral anticoagulants, such that it would justify not using oral anticoagulants when performing a dental extraction, as well as if the reason for and anatomical location of the extraction increases such risk. Study We performed a bibliographic search in order to carry out a meta-analytic study using descriptive statistics. We compiled a sample of 1194 patients from the articles selected. Of these patients, a total of 2392 simple, serial <b>surgical</b> <b>extractions</b> were performed; none of the patients interrupted their anticoagulant treatment with warfarin sodium. Of the sample, 83 patients presented a certain degree of bleeding; in 77 of such cases, the bleeding was controlled with local hemostasis, whereas 6 patients required their dose of oral anticoagulants to be adjusted. There was a higher incidence of bleeding in patients presenting a periodontal pathology, compared to deep caries and pericoronitis. Patients being treated with oral anticoagulants represent a risk that we should be aware of, but local hemostasis has proven to be effective when performing extractions, provided that the INR value is less than 4. There is an increased incidence of bleeding in patients with periodontal problems, due to the greater presence of inflammation in the soft tissues. If the extraction is performed in the maxilla, the incidence of hemorrhagic complications is slightly higher than in the mandible, although this difference is considered to be insignificant...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} efficacy {{of a combination}} of oral midazolam plus low-dose ketamine for reducing anxiety during surgery and in preventing postoperative pain and swelling after the <b>surgical</b> <b>extraction</b> of third molars. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients requiring bilateral <b>surgical</b> <b>extraction</b> of mandibular third molars were included in this study. Prior to extraction of the tooth on the right side, a combination of oral midazolam and low-dose ketamine was given to the patient, while this protocol was not followed for extraction of the tooth on the left side. Anxiety levels were checked before surgery. The postoperative pain and swelling and patient′s comfort with and without the premedication were compared. Results: Facial swelling on the postoperative days was lower on the right side than on the left. Pain scores at 30 minutes and 24 hours after surgery were significantly higher on the left side. Also, anxiety during the surgery was less and comfort levels were higher postoperatively when the combination of oral midazolam plus low-dose ketamine was used. Conclusions: Premedication with midazolam plus low-dose ketamine prior to <b>surgical</b> <b>extraction</b> of third molars can provide the patient with a comfortable procedure and good postoperative analgesia, with less swelling and significantly less pain...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} current therapeutical {{processes}} choroidal neovascularization (CNV) leads to severe alteration of visual functions in several diseases. Its most frequent causes are degenerative processes in age-related macular degeneration. Less frequently {{they are a}} result of inflammation, trauma, degenerative processes in high myopia and in angioid streaks, or they may develop after retina laser photocoagulation for other pathological conditions. Until now no effective treatment reducing the incidence of CNV manifestation in age-related macular degeneration or CNV of other etiology has been found. In the last decade several therapeutical techniques to treat the most severe manifestations of this illness with otherwise poor prognosis have been proposed. These techniques include pulse photocoagulation lasers of various wavelength, photodynamic therapy using exogenous chromatophors, infrared laser coagulation, laser photocoagulation on the basis of ICG, transpupillary termotherapy, application of antiangiogenic agents, radiation therapy and <b>surgical</b> <b>extraction</b> of CNV. <b>Surgical</b> <b>extraction</b> represents the only way of complete removal of neovascular pathological tissue.

5000|$|Sinus {{exposure}} and oral-antral communication: This can occur when extracting upper molars (and in some patients, upper pre-molars). The maxillary sinus sits right above {{the roots of}} maxillary molars and pre-molars. There is a bony floor of the sinus, dividing the tooth socket from the sinus itself. This bone can range from thick to thin, from tooth to tooth, from patient to patient. In some cases it is absent and the root is, in fact, in the sinus. At other times, this bone may be removed with the tooth, or may be perforated during <b>surgical</b> <b>extractions.</b> The doctor typically mentions this risk to patients, based on evaluation of radiographs showing {{the relationship of the}} tooth to the sinus. The sinus cavity is lined with a membrane called the Sniderian membrane, {{which may or may not}} be perforated. If this membrane is exposed after an extraction, but remains intact, a [...] "sinus exposed" [...] has occurred. If the membrane is perforated, however, it is a [...] "sinus communication". These two conditions are treated differently. In the event of a sinus communication, the dentist may decide to let it heal on its own, or, may need to surgically obtain primary closure—depending on the size of the {{exposure and}} the likelihood of the patient to heal. In both cases, a resorbable material called [...] "gelfoam" [...] is typically placed in the extraction site to promote clotting and serve as a framework for granulation tissue to accumulate. Patients are typically provided with prescriptions for antibiotics that cover sinus bacterial flora, decongestants, and careful instructions to follow during the healing period.|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the third}} molar surgery, it is {{important}} to focus not only on surgical skills, but also on patient satisfaction. Classically studies have been focused on surgery and surgeon’s empathy, but there are non-surgical factors that may influence patient satisfaction. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 100 patients undergoing <b>surgical</b> <b>extractions</b> of impacted mandibular third molars treated from October 2013 to July 2014 in the Oral Surgery Unit of the University of Valencia. A questionnaire (20 questions) with a 10 -point Likert scale was provided. The questionnaire assessed the ease to find the center, the ease to get oriented within the center, the burocratic procedures, the time from the first visit to the date of surgical intervention, waiting time in the waiting room, the comfort at the waiting room, the administrative staff (kindness and efficiency to solve formalities), medical staff (kindness, efficiency, reliability, dedication), personal data care, clarity in the information received (about the surgery, postoperative care and resolution of the doubts), available means and state of facilities. Outcome variables were overall satisfaction, and recommendation of the center. Statistical analysis was made using the multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Significant correlations were found between all variables and overall satisfaction. The multiple regression model showed that the efficiency of the surgeon and the clarity of the information were statistically significant to overall satisfaction and recommendation of the center. The kindness of the administrative staff, available means, the state of facilities and the comfort at the waiting room were statistically significant to the recommendation of the center. Conclusions: Patient satisfaction directly depends on the efficiency of the surgeon and clarity of the clinical information received about the procedure.
