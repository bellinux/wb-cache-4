40|$|Wessex Archaeology was {{commissioned}} by Utility Consulting, on behalf of EDF Energy, to undertake an archaeological watching brief during the installation of a 33 kv underground cable and overhead line works running from the Ratfyn Amesbury MOD electricity substation for approximately 2. 5 km towards Bulford Army Camp. The site is located immediately east of the UNESCO designated Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site (WHS) and lies within an area rich in prehistoric archaeology which includes a number of extant Bronze Age barrows and extensive Iron Age or Romano British field systems. The watching brief involved the monitoring of the excavation of the easement for the underground cable run and the excavation of three new pits for double electricity poles and stays and a further 13 <b>screw</b> <b>bore</b> holes for single poles. Despite {{the line of the}} Scheme passing through an area rich in prehistoric activity no archaeological features were revealed. A number of undated tree throws and modern features were identified. The watching brief took place intermittently during April and May 2010...|$|E
50|$|Leonard Fairclough & Son {{were the}} contractors, and the {{prestressed}} concrete sections {{were made at}} its operations in Adlington, Lancashire. The contractor's site compound was in Loxford Street. The piling was completed by Pigott Foundations of Ormskirk with auger (<b>screw)</b> <b>boring</b> with reinforcement cages. The piling went 50 ft (15 m) deep through the boulder clay to the Bunter sandstone (Buntsandstein). The road on the structure and kerbing was built by Wilson and Wilkinson of Worsley in Salford.|$|R
40|$|An anti-subsidence, anti-translocation, fusion {{compression}} cervical plate {{system with}} interface visualization, drill guide and temporary pin is provided. In one embodiment {{the invention provides}} a vertebral plate for minimizing the ability of an inter-body cage, filled with bone (or BMP-soaked sponges, etc.), to telescope into the vertebral body and to minimize failure due to cages that telescope into adjacent vertebral bodies on a delayed basis after surgery, as well as creation of reverse lordosis due to such telescoping. Another embodiment provides method to reduce {{the gap between the}} inter-body cage and the vertebral body end plate intra-operatively using compression from the plate caused by an offset between the <b>screw</b> <b>bores</b> on the plate and the drill holes, as established with an asymmetric drill guide...|$|R
50|$|Propulsion was by {{a direct}} connected, four cylinder, double opposed piston Sun-Doxford diesel {{developing}} 6,000 shaft horsepower at 92 revolutions on the single 20 ft diameter, 21 ft pitch <b>screw.</b> Piston <b>bore</b> was 32 in and combined stroke of 95 in. At {{the time this}} was the most powerful marine diesel built in the United States and was capable of operating two hours under 25% overload for 7,500 horsepower. Exhaust heat, or oil for port or emergencies, drove a steam generator providing steam for cooking, heating and hot water services. Three 250 kilowatt diesel generators provided electrical service.|$|R
60|$|They used {{to show to}} {{visitors}} the implements of torture wherewith the Three were wont to worm secrets out of the accused--villainous machines for crushing thumbs; the stocks where a prisoner sat immovable while water fell drop by drop upon his head till the torture was more than humanity could bear; and a devilish contrivance of steel, which inclosed a prisoner's head like a shell, and crushed it slowly {{by means of a}} <b>screw.</b> It <b>bore</b> the stains of blood that had trickled through its joints long ago, and on one side it had a projection whereon the torturer rested his elbow comfortably and bent down his ear to catch the moanings of the sufferer perishing within.|$|R
40|$|In {{paper the}} {{technological}} tools requirements, used for micro-extrusion of metals in cold and warm conditions are presented. Theconstructive principles for the micro-tools are also described. The {{influence of the}} size effect in a workpiece and a tool top layersroughness form on extrusion processes in microscale are showed. The tool, designed to an experimental verification of the size effectinfluence, in a tool roughness form, on the metal rod forward extrusion are presented. This tool {{is made in the}} form of two halves, joined together by the pegs and <b>screws.</b> It has <b>bored</b> two dies profiles with the same dimensions, the only difference is a degree of the containers roughness. That solution gives a possibility to specify the influence of the tool roughness degree on the extrusion forces, deformation process and a product quality. Described tool was designed in such a way to manufacture it with using conventional machining equipment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} packaging and labeling attributes of sugarcane spirit on consumers' behavior by applying the results of conjoint analysis in sugarcane spirit market share simulation. Firstly, a conjoint analysis was performed aiming to estimate the part-worths of each consumer for some sugarcane spirit packaging and labeling attributes. These part-worths {{were used in the}} market share simulation using the maximum utility model. It was observed that some packaging and labeling attributes affected consumer's purchase intention and that most consumers showed a similar preference pattern regarding these attributes. These consumers showed preference for the Seleta brand, which was bottled in 700 mL clear glass bottles with a metal <b>screw</b> cap that <b>bore</b> a label illustration unrelated to sugarcane spirit production process and had the information "aged 36 months in oak barrels". This study also showed that conjoint analysis and the use of its results in the market share simulation proved important tools to better understand consumer behavior towards intention to purchase sugarcane spirit...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{advanced}} adaptive boring heads with automatic metal-cutting elements is developed. It allows {{setting up the}} heads for the finishing of inner cylindrical surface with the required accuracy, depending on the surface diameter, the value of tolerance field and its placement schemes. We describe {{the structure of the}} adaptive boring heads and how it works. To reduce shock loads when metal-cutting elements embedded for thrust adjustment screws, elastic dampers are used. On the basis of the settlement scheme analytical dependences for determination of the clearance gap between a thrust <b>screw</b> and a <b>boring</b> head regulating <b>screw</b> are developed. The value to process the holes of various accuracy with the same structural and geometrical parameters of metal-cutting elements is defined as well as the value and placement of tolerance field. The graphs of dependences of the value Î” on a nominal diameter of inner cylindrical surface of machined holes and various accuracy degrees are drawn. An image dependencies have practical value and can be used to directly configure heads of production units. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} using a collar or large {{cylindrical}} object to increase shear strength in wood construction {{has been around for}} several centuries in the forms of split rings and shear plates. [...] Shear plates provide a larger load-carrying capacity in shear than can be otherwise achieved by a bolt alone. [...] Because this idea utilized less bolts for equal strength, it transferred well into the use of live trees, as they compartmentalize more efficiently with a single, larger cut than several, smaller cuts. [...] Michael Garnier became involved in treehouse construction beginning in 1990 when he built his first treehouse in Josephine County, Oregon. Two years later, he was ordered by County official to close the treehouse to the public. He began developing what would become the Garnier limb, a high-strength alloy steel engineered bolt that can be <b>screwed</b> into a <b>bore</b> in the trunk of tree. In 1997 Garnier met Arborist Scott D. Baker who shared his knowledge of tree biology and tree structural responses. By 1998, Garnier had developed a commercial bolt product which he called Artificial Limbs. The Garnier limb was primarily developed to satisfy the safety requirements of the Josephine County Building and Safety building permit process.|$|R
