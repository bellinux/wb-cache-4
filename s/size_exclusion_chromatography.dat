The oligonucleotides are then released from the solid phase and deprotected (base and phosphate) by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, their mixtures, gaseous ammonia or methylamine or, less commonly, solutions of other primary amines or alkalies at ambient or elevated temperature. This removes all remaining protection groups from 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides, resulting in a reaction mixture containing the desired product. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2'-O-protected ribonucleotide residues, the deprotection protocol includes the second step where the 2'-O-protecting silyl groups are removed by treatment with fluoride ion by various methods. The fully deprotected product is used as is, or the desired oligonucleotide can be purified by a number of methods. Most commonly, the crude product is desalted using ethanol precipitation, <b>size</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>chromatography,</b> or reverse-phase HPLC. To eliminate unwanted truncation products, the oligonucleotides can be purified via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or anion-exchange HPLC followed by desalting.|$|E

More recently, the Petunia 3 β-hydroxylase was cloned and shown to be encoded in a 41   655 Da polypeptide. In order to characterize the molecular composition, the enzyme was expressed in a highly active state in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. <b>Size</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>chromatographies</b> of the pure, recombinant enzyme revealed that this flavanone 3 β-hydroxylase exists in functional monomeric and oligomeric forms. Protein cross-linking experiments employing a specific homobifunctional sulfhydryl group reagent or the photochemical activation of tryptophan residues confirmed the tendency of the enzyme to aggregate to oligomeric complexes in solution. Thorough equilibrium sedimentation analyses, however, revealed a molecular mass of 39. 2 ± 12 kDa for the recombinant flavanone 3 β-hydroxylase.
