50|$|Like Ethernet, 802.11 {{uses the}} same range of MAC {{addresses}} to map IP multicast addresses. However, an 802.11 wireless network will handle multicast traffic differently, depending on the configuration of delivery traffic indication message (DTIM), and beacon interval settings. If no stations within the basic service set are in power <b>save</b> <b>mode,</b> multicast packets are sent immediately when they arrive. If there are one or more stations in power <b>save</b> <b>mode,</b> access points then only deliver multicast traffic after each DTIM interval, and transmit {{at one of the}} supported rates in the basic rate set. In most retail wireless access points/routers, this interval is either 102.4 ms (Beacon interval = 100ms, DTIM = 1) or 204.8 ms (Beacon interval = 100ms, DTIM = 2) and the transmit rate is either 1 Mbit/s or 6 Mbit/s, depending on the operating band and protection mode. As a result, the DTIM and beacon interval settings should be adjusted for optimum performance when implementing multicast in wireless networks.|$|E

50|$|Most {{access points}} allow the {{changing}} of the beacon interval. Increasing the beacon interval will cause the beacons to be sent less frequently. This reduces load on the network and increases throughput for clients on the network; however, it has the undesirable effect of delaying association and roaming processes as stations scanning for access points could potentially miss a beacon while scanning other channels. Alternatively, decreasing the beacon interval causes beacons to be sent more frequently. This increases load on the network and decreases throughput for users, but it does result in a quicker association and roaming process. An additional downside of decreasing the beacon interval is that stations in power <b>save</b> <b>mode</b> will consume more power as they must more frequently awake to receive beacons.|$|E

In this scheme, we leverage the low power consumption of the audio interfaces (mic/speaker) to reduce the wakeup events of the Wi-Fi interface when it is in Power <b>Saving</b> <b>Mode.</b> In this paper, we develop a small-scale prototype testbed on real smartphones to evaluate the proposed A 2 PSM scheme.

By utilizing the dynamic Power <b>Save</b> <b>Mode</b> (PSM), our study proposes an adaptive RTP packet transmission scheme for multimedia traffic. By merging the outbound packet delivery timing with inbound packet reception and estimating each delay component along the packet processing and trans-mission path, each client manages to meet the stringent end-to-end latency for packets while creating longer sleep intervals. As a benefit it involves no cross-layer communication overhead as the interface state transitions are completely transparent to the application.
