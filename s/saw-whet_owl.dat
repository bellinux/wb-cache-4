50|$|A {{study by}} Engel et al. (2015) {{suggest that the}} Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owl’s</b> diet may vary in the winter. On average, the owl’s diet {{consists}} mostly of small prey. Studies by Swengel and Swengel (1992) showed that Midwest owls preferred a diet of deer mice (Peromyscus) and shrew (Sorex cinereus and Blarina brevicauda). This contrasted to what was discovered in Chain O'Lakes State Park, Illinois, {{during the winter of}} 1987-88. At times, Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> may hunt larger prey, such as meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus).|$|R

40|$|Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) are long-distance migrants, while Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> (Aegolius acadicus) exhibit more {{variable}} migration tendencies. I {{investigated the}} migratory behavior {{of these species}} using orientation cages and tested hypotheses concerning (1) the presence of migratory restlessness and orientation, (2) inter-specific differences in migratory restlessness and orientation, and (3) correlates of migratory restlessness and orientation. Only four of 16 Flammulated Owls displayed activity consistent with migratory restlessness although all four owls exhibited significant directionality in their movements. Alternatively, 59 of 97 Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> exhibited activity consistent with migratory restlessness with most of these 59 owls showing preferred directions of orientation. Neither species oriented consistently as a group and, contrary to expectation, Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> exhibited more restlessness in orientation cages. The relative lack of migratory restlessness in Flammulated Owls might {{be a function of}} small sample sizes or simply this particular species’ reaction to an unfamiliar situation. In Flammulated Owls, migratory restlessness increased with decreasing natural cloud cover, and was more pronounced in birds with larger flight muscles. Contrary to predictions, Flammulated Owls also showed a marginal increase in restlessness in response to decreasing furcular fat stores which could be a function of small samples sizes. Restlessness in Flammulated Owls did not vary with wind speed, moon disk illumination, nor did restlessness change throughout the migration season.

40|$|Spatially {{explicit}} models depicting species occupancy offer {{a useful}} conservation tool for land managers. Using occurrence data collected in 2009 and 2010 from the Boise National Forest, Idaho, we developed distribution models for Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) and Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> (Aegolius acadicus) to explore associations between habitat factors and owl occupancy. We then spatially applied these models in a Geographic Information System. We considered land cover and topographic variables at three spatial scales: 0. 4 -km, 1 -km, or 3 -km-radius plots centered on point-count locations (n  =  150) with resolution of land covers at 30 m. Flammulated Owls occupied 27 (18 %) point-count locations and occurred {{in areas with}} {{a higher proportion of}} Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at the 0. 4 -km scale, less diverse land cover composition at the 1 -km scale, and in south-facing aspects at the 3 -km scale. Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> occupied 45 (30 %) point-count locations and were associated with relatively flat terrain at the 0. 4 -km scale that had larger proportions of non-forest land cover. At the 1 -km and 3 -km scales, Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> occurred in areas with south-facing aspects having a higher proportion of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), respectively.

50|$|The {{northern}} <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owl</b> has a {{very sophisticated}} hearing. It is due to vertically asymmetrical ears and different shape of the ear openings. Because the sound reaches the ears at a different time and is of different intensity, the northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owl</b> can very precisely localize its prey. Such accurate sound localization allows it to hunt in a complete darkness by hearing alone.|$|E

50|$|These birds wait {{on a high}} perch {{at night}} and swoop down on prey. They mainly eat small organisms {{with a focus on}} small mammals in their diet. A test done by Swengel and Swengel found that the {{northern}} <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> most often eat deer mice, 67% and voles, 16% of the time in Wisconsin. A similar test done by Holt and Leroux in Montana found that these owls ate more voles than other mammal species. This shows that these owls can change their main prey depending on what is available. Also researched by Holt and Leroux was the eating habits of northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> and northern pygmy owls and found that they prey on different animals for their main food source, showing that they can adapt not only depending on the prey but also with the other predators in the areas where they live.|$|R
40|$|Migrating Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> were {{captured}} and banded {{at a site}} in the Virginia Piedmont {{in the fall of}} 2005, and the results were compared with the results of banding from the previous three years. The results were also compared to similar efforts to monitor migration that were made on the coastal plains and the mountain regions of Virginia in these same years. Migration volume was higher in the mountains compared to the piedmont and coast, and the mountains experienced the earliest migration peak, followed by the piedmont, and then the coastal plain. There was not a significant difference between adult and immature Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> in their migration timing. Adults made up the bulk of migrating owls in the mountains and on the piedmont, which is consistent with these years being non-invasion years. The coastal site, however, had a nearly even ratio of adults to immatures, which may reflect a geographic variation in migratory route in these two age classes...|$|R
40|$|Except for a {{few studies}} in the eastern United States, little has been {{published}} on hemoparasites in owls. We surveyed the blood parasites of 108 Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> (Aegolius acadicus) and 24 Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) in Idaho during autumn migration in 1999 and 2000. We also surveyed 15 Flammulated Owls (FLOW) during breeding season in Utah from 2000. Leucocytozoon ziemanni, Haemoproteus syrnii, Haemoproteus noctuae,and Trypanosoma avium were identified. The overall prevalence of infection was 53 % (78 / 147) and for the combined species, prevalences ofHaemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Trypanosoma species were 20 %, 39 %, and 4 %, respectively. Northern <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>Owls</b> (NSWO) had an overall prevalence of 51 % (55 / 108), with prevalences of 6 %, 47 %, and 4 % by hemoparasite genus, respectively.

50|$|Northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> lay {{about five}} or six white-colored eggs in natural tree {{cavities}} or woodpecker holes. The father does the hunting while the mother watches and sits on her eggs. Females can have more than one clutch of eggs each breeding season with different males. Once the offspring in the first nest have developed their feathers the mother will leave the father to care for them and go find another male to reproduce with. This type of mating is sequential polyandry. They compete with boreal owls, starlings and squirrels for nest cavities and their nests may be destroyed or eaten by those creatures as well as nest predators such as martens and corvids. <b>Saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> of all ages may be predated by any larger species of owl, of which there are at least a dozen that overlap in range. They are also predated by Accipiter hawks, which share with the saw-whet a preference for wooded habitats with dense thickets or brush.|$|R
40|$|Birds undergo many {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} changes {{in preparation for}} migration, such as zugunruhe, hyperphagia leading to pre-migratory fattening, and heightened immune system function. Birds in poor condition, without insufficient reserves, may not complete or even begin migration. Many aspects of the physiological changes occurring during migration are poorly understood, especially in raptors. I investigated the relationship between body condition and heterophil to lymphocyte (H:L) ratios in fall migrating northern saw-whet (Aegolius acadicus) and flammulated owls (Otusflammeolus). Blood smears were made and 200 white blood cells counted on each smear. There was a significant negative relationship between H:L ratios and body condition index in northern saw-whet owls: as body condition decreased, H:L ratios increased. An increased H:L ratio is indicative of increased stress on the immune system. There was no detectable relationship between H:L ratio and body condition index in f 1 ammulated owls; however, the sample size was low. While the H:L ratio {{may be a good}} index for chronic stress, this ratio may not be as useful during migration when most migrating birds are in good condition. A relationship has been shown between hemoparasites and body condition during the breeding season. I investigated this relationship during the migration season in the same owl species as above. Blood smears were made and hemoparasites counted per 200 white blood cells. For northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> in 1999, prevalence was 53 % (n = 30). In year 2000, northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls,</b> prevalence was 47 (n = 70). In year 1999, f 1 ammulated owls had a prevalence of 44 % (n = 16). In 2000 prevalence was 33 % (n = 6). Three genera of hemoparasites were found in both owl species: Haemoproteus spp., Leucocytozoon spp., and Trypanosoma spp. Northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> were primarily infected with L. ziemanni, while flammulated owls were primarily infected with H. noctuae and H. syrnii. There was no detectable correlation between presence/absence of parasites and body condition index in flammulated <b>owls.</b> Traditionally, northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> are sexed in the field using a morphometric chart that was created from a discriminate function of mass and wing. However, this chart has an area of overlap between small females and large males requiring those birds to be classified in the field as unknown sex. Moreover, in flammulated owls, there is not enough dimorphism to allow them to be sexed by external measurements. I compared three methods of DNA sexing using two sets of primers: P 2 and P 8, and P 2550 and P 2718. All methods gave consistent and comparable results, and were used to successfully sex 44 flammulated owls and 210 northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls.</b> DNA sexing allowed me to assign sex to 112 of 141 owls that would have been classified as unknown by the chart. When compared to DNA sexing results, morphometric methods had an accuracy rate of 97 % on owls definitively sexed by the morphometric chart. DNA sexing is recommended for monomorphic species and any birds that cannot be sexed by morphometric means...|$|R
50|$|Some {{have begun}} to move more {{southeast}} in Indiana and neighboring states. Buidin et al. did a study of how far north the northern <b>saw-whet</b> <b>owls</b> breed and they found that they can breed northward to > 50° N, farther than ever recorded before.
