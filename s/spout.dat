40|$|Abstract. <b>Spouted</b> {{bed with}} porous draft tube is an {{improved}} type of conventional <b>spouted</b> bed {{which is a}} special kind of fluidized bed. Hydrodynamic characteristics are vital to design and normal operating of <b>spouted</b> bed with porous draft tube, but less research has been carried out. Two key hydrodynamics factors including maximum <b>spouted</b> bed height and minimum <b>spouting</b> velocity were studied by a series of experiments. The effects and mechanisms of features of draft tube including diameter, installing position and hole opening ratio on hydrodynamics factors were analyzed. The results are of great value to the design and optimization of <b>spouted</b> bed with porous draft tube and broad the engineering application sphere of <b>spouted</b> bed...|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in a semi-cylindrical <b>spouted</b> bed column of diameter 150 mm, height 1000 mm, conical base included angle of 60 degrees and inlet orifice diameter 25 mm. Pressure transducers at several axial positions were used to obtain pressure fluctuation time series with 1. 2 and 2. 4 mm glass beads at U/U-ms from 0. 3 to 1. 6, and static bed depths from 150 to 600 mm. The conditions covered several flow regimes (fixed bed, incipient <b>spouting,</b> stable <b>spouting,</b> pulsating <b>spouting,</b> slugging, bubble <b>spouting</b> and fluidization). Images of the system dynamics were also acquired through the transparent walls with a digital camera. The data were analyzed via statistical, mutual information theory, spectral and Hurst`s Rescaled Range methods to assess the potential of these methods to characterize the <b>spouting</b> quality. The results indicate that these methods have potential for monitoring <b>spouted</b> bed operation...|$|R

It is used inorganically materials with different sizes, shapes and densities. The materials are classified in group D, according with Geldart classification, adequate to the <b>spouted</b> bed processing. The main dynamic parameters studied were: the minimum <b>spouted</b> velocity, the minimum pressure drop, maximum <b>spouted</b> bed height. By experimental data processing it was obtained empirical relationships specific to the studied system. The obtained relations can be used at <b>spouted</b> bed apparatus design...|$|R

Experimental fluid dynamic tests were carried out in a conical square-based <b>spouted</b> bed reactor using a mixture of straw and silica, the latter acting as inert material. The influence of the initial bed of particles {{and the presence of}} coarse particles in the mixture on the pressure drop and minimum <b>spouting</b> velocity were evaluated. As a result, lower values of pressure drop along the bed were found compared to conventional fluidisation processes. Higher initial bed heights and higher percentage of straw in the mixture resulted in higher values of pressure drop and minimum <b>spouting</b> velocity.

40|$|This paper deals {{especially}} with <b>spouting</b> stability in a slot-rectangular (prismatic) <b>spouted</b> bed. The flow stability {{was characterized by}} the pressure drop evaluation (the uniformity and amplitude of the fluctuations) and visual observations (the flow symmetry). The effect of several geometrical conditions, such as the inlet design, prismatic angle and draft plates on the bed behaviour was investigated for different particles and bed inventories exposed to different air flow rates. The prismatic angle {{was found to have}} a strong impact on the <b>spouting</b> characteristics. A method to improve significantly the <b>spouting</b> quality and to make the <b>spouting</b> stability independent on the gas inflow velocity is presented. Compared to the reference geometry the prismatic angle was changed to a higher value and the apparatus was equipped with draft plates. Whereas, to achieve a stable <b>spouting</b> {{in a wide range of}} the air flow rates the design of draft plates should be customized to the bed inventory. Dependent on the static bed height full or open-sided draft plates should be used. In the proposed apparatus implementation, the maximum <b>spouting</b> velocity was almost eliminated for large particles (Geldart D), i. e. a highly coherent dense <b>spouting</b> can pass continuously into the dilute-like stable regime, without stability loss at intermediate gas velocities. The <b>spouting</b> of Geldart B particles is also improved...|$|R
40|$|Pulp fibers can be <b>spouted</b> in a conical vessel if {{the inlet}} Reynolds number is above a {{critical}} value which varies linearly with mass of pulp in the vessel. Continuous pulp <b>spouting</b> is also feasible in a wedge-like vessel within certain limits of flow rate and inlet pulp consistency. <b>Spouting</b> hydrodynamics and particle separation behavior in both vessels were investigated for pulp fibers and recycled pulp suspensions. The minimum <b>spouting</b> velocity (MSV), <b>spouting</b> stability {{and the pressure}} drop-flow rate relationship were determined for liquid <b>spouting</b> of pulp fibers and of rigid particles. Liquid <b>spouting</b> of rigid particles is similar to gaseous spouting; pulp <b>spouting</b> is different. The liquid flow field in a conical <b>spouted</b> bed of pulp fibers is of a jet expansion type. A model for predicting the MSV for <b>spouting</b> pulp fibers was developed based on visual observation of the transition of the jet flow patterns in the conical vessel. Small particles including both ink and pulp fines can be elutriated from a <b>spouted</b> bed of a recycled pulp suspension, with little fiber loss, in both semi-batch and continuous modes using conical and wedge-like vessels, respectively. Both processes were studied using on-line measurement of the exit particle concentration. For the semi-batch process, the first order elutriation coefficient increased with the flow rate, but {{was about the same}} for all pulps. Based on the analysis of the flow field around a porous spherical particle in a shear flow, an elutriation model was developed for fine particle removal from a suspension of porous coarse particles. For the continuous operation, the particle separation mechanism and the fractional particle removal were investigated. Separation occurs by excluding fibers from the top stream, while fines are split according to the ratio of top to bottom flow rates...|$|R

5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the <b>spout</b> could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E

5|$|This {{foundation}} stallion {{produced a}} descendent, named Old Tobe, {{who became the}} more modern father of the Rocky Mountain Horse breed.

For most of the 20th century, Tuttle was a prominent breeder of Rocky Mountain Horses, and helped to keep the strain alive during the Great Depression and World War II. After World War II, despite declining horse populations in the US, Tuttle kept his herd, and continued to use Old Tobe as a breeding stallion.

The son of John Crabtree, a Lancashire farmer of comfortable means, and Isabel Crabtree (née Pendleton), he was educated at a grammar school in Manchester– probably the forerunner of Manchester Grammar School, which was then situated between the Collegiate Church and what is now Chetham's School of Music. He worked in Manchester, married into a wealthy family and in his spare time studied mathematics and astronomy. He carefully measured the movements of the planets, undertook precise astronomical calculations and rewrote the existing Rudolphine Tables with improved accuracy. He maintained an active correspondence, much of it now lost, with Horrocks, two other young astronomers– William Gascoigne and Christopher Towneley– and Samuel Foster, Professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London and alumnus of Emmanuel College. It is not known whether Horrocks and Crabtree ever met in person but from 1636 they corresponded regularly, and, because of their shared interest in the work of Johannes Kepler, referred to themselves, along with William Gascoigne, as nos Keplari (we Keplarians).|$|E
5|$|Uttar Pradesh, with a {{total area}} of , is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area. It is {{situated}} on the northern <b>spout</b> of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover {{most of the state}} are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.|$|E
