The main contribution of the work presented here is the new formulation to account SLR correlations in ISO 13790, obtained for sunspaces, but generalizable for other solar systems with known SLR functions. Simulation models are used to perform a sensitivity analysis of internal gains and heat transfer through <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces,</b> both issues that distinguishes ISO 13790 from Load Ratio methods. The analysis shows that internal gains {{can be added to}} the heat source term or subtracted to heat transfer term without influencing the utilization factor dependence with the gain-to-loss ratio. On the other hand, the SLR assumption that <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces</b> are neutral elements and, therefore, not added to the heat transfer term, results in large inconsistencies between SLR and ISO 13790 methods. The detailed monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fairly reproduces results obtained by simulation. However, predictions from the simplified monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fail in mid season months and coldest months...|$|R

Thus, it is required to determine the optimum tilt as for Equator facing and for Pole oriented collectors. In addition, the question that may arise: how many times is reasonable for adjusting collector tilt angle for a definite value of surface azimuth angle? A mathematical model was used for estimating the solar radiation on a tilted surface, and to determine the optimum tilt angle and orientation (surface azimuth angle) for the <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> at any latitude. This model was applied for determining optimum tilt angle and orientation in the tropical zones, on a daily basis, as well as for a specific period.

The results reveal that changing the tilt angle 12 times in a year (i. e. using the monthly optimum tilt angle) maintains approximately the total amount of solar radiation near the maximum value that is found by changing the tilt angle daily to its optimum value. This achieves a yearly gain in solar radiation of 11 % to 18 % more than the case of a <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> fixed on a horizontal surface. </p...|$|R

The optimum ratio of bed volume to <b>collector</b> <b>surface</b> was estimated to be near 0 · 20. An installation of a 400 m 2 <b>collector</b> <b>surface</b> and an 80 m 3 concrete storaage bed can provide more than 95 % of the thermal duty of 1 m 3 s- 1 process air at 60 °C during the 6 months from April to September. © 1986...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use {{of solar}} energy for {{greenhouse}} heating has gained an increasing acceptance {{during the last}} years. Active solar systems applied to greenhouses can supply {{a significant part of}} the heating requirements. However, there are some problems related to the cost of the heat collection unit and the heat storage methods. In this context several techniques were born. The most famous of these techniques is the seasonal storage of thermal heat in soil. The objective of our work is to study a system of thermal energy storage conceived in our Laboratory (LEPT, Tunisia). The system is composed of a vat having a large dimension (6 m 3) filled with fin sand. Inside the vat three batteries of capillary exchangers are buried at three different levels. To heat the accumulator soil, we use a <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> with a <b>surface</b> equal to 6 m 2. In order to size the heat accumulating system, a numerical study is started. It allows evaluating the soil temperature as well as the energy cumulated inside the accumulator during the charging and the discharging period...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of solar assisted air conditioning {{in an office}} building under Tripoli weather conditions is investigated in this paper. A single-effect lithium bromide absorption cycle powered by means of flat-plate <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> was modeled in order to predict {{the potential of the}} solar energy share. The cooling load profile was generated by using an detailed hourly based program and Typical meteorological year for Tripoli. System performance and solar energy fraction were calculated by varying two major parameters (collector’s slope angle and collector area). The maximum solar fraction of 48 % was obtained by means of 1400 m 2 of <b>collector</b> <b>surface</b> area. Analysis of results showed that, besides the <b>collector</b> <b>surface</b> area, the main factors affecting the solar fraction were the local weather conditions (intensity of incident solar radiation) and the time of day when the plant was operated...|$|R
