40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{technical}} report is to describe the proof-of-concept of the CEN-DSRC imple- mentation of the remote interrogation function of the {{new version of the}} digital tachograph. The current digital tachograph (DT) system to monitor the driving time in commercial ve- hicles above 3. 5 tons is governed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821 / 85 of 20 December 1985, which was modified at several occasions and more recently in 2006, when the digital tachograph was introduced, and in 2009, when it was updated to technical progress to avoid fraud and reduce the administrative burden. In July 2011 the Commission made a proposal (COM(2011) 451 final) to modify the tachograph regulation, which has been the object of discussions in Council and Parliament {{in the course of the}} ordinary legislative procedure. The final version of the approved regulation was published in February 2014 (Regulation 165 / 2014 (Commission, 2004)). The technical specifications of the <b>smart</b> <b>tachograph</b> were published as Regulation 799 / 2016 (Commission, 2011). One of the main functions is the remote interrogation of the <b>Smart</b> <b>Tachograph</b> (ST) installed in the commercial vehicle through the CEN-DSRC standard. The function supports law enforcers in the checking of potential frauds or malfunctions in the ST. To support the future deployment of the <b>smart</b> <b>tachograph</b> and to validate the technical specifications of the <b>smart</b> <b>tachograph</b> regarding the remote interrogation function, JRC issued a tender to the DSRC manufacturer Q-FREE to implement a prototype of the new remote interrogation systems. The prototype was successfully implemented and tested. It was shown during the JRC Open day in May 2016 to thousands of visitors at the stand of the <b>smart</b> <b>tachograph</b> organized by unit DG. JRC. E 3. JRC.

40|$|In {{order to}} aid manufacturers, {{component}} personalisers, certification authorities and other Digital Tachograph stakeholders {{with the development}} and testing of equipment and systems complying with the Generation- 2 <b>Smart</b> <b>Tachograph</b> specifications, a comprehensive set of Generation- 2 sample cryptographic keys and digital certificates has been developed. This document serves to detail the contents of this sample set and the values chosen for individual fields in the certificates. It also explains which kind of tests can be done using the cryptographic material in the set, as well as identifying some tests that cannot be done with this set. JRC.

40|$|The new Regulation (EU) N° 165 / 2014 {{adopted in}} February 2014 by the European Parliament and the Council {{foresees}} {{the introduction of}} a new generation of digital tachographs, called the "smart tachographs", with new security mechanisms, a GNSS component and different communication interfaces. According to the Regulation, the European Commission intends to adopt in March 2016 an implementing act whereby the industry will receive a new technical annex specifying the requirements for the <b>smart</b> <b>tachograph.</b> This paper intends to present the process for elaborating this technical document, its content and the timing for the introduction of the new systemsJRC.

40|$|Today's {{insurance}} rates are often only a rough approximation {{of the actual}} risks they insure, categorizing insurance takers into coarse classes based on long-term demographic facts such as age or address. This not only negatively affects the care with which the insured good is treated, but also often implies {{a significant amount of}} cross-financing from low-risk customers to high-risk customer. By being able to measure the risk an insured good is subjected to in real-time, insurers could offer real-time {{insurance rates}} that would both encourage safe treatment of the insured good, as well as reward low-risk customers with lower insurances rates. The video presents the <b>Smart</b> <b>Tachograph,</b> an example of such a real-time risk-measurement system in the car insurance domain. It further demonstrates vividly how a risky driving style could significantly increase an individual's insurance rate...|$|E

They are typically distributed evenly among a large fraction of drivers, which is both unfair and economically inefficient. We have built a prototypical platform, called the “Smart Tachograph”, {{that allows us to}} measure traffic-related costs on an individual basis, thus supporting a more fine-granular charging of the responsible parties. Sensors observe the manner and circumstances in which a vehicle is driven, while several accounting authorities can evaluate this information and charge motorists on a pay-per-use basis. The <b>Smart</b> <b>Tachograph</b> offers valuable insights for the deployment of future ubiquitous computing services in general: its implementation has obvious requirements in terms of security and privacy; its deployment model is realistic through the strong economic incentives it offers; and its usage directly affects core societal values such as fairness and trust. This paper summarizes our design considerations and discusses the feasibility and wider economic and societal implications of fielding such a system. ...|$|E
