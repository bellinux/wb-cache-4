25|$|Candy apples, {{also known}} as toffee apples outside of North America, are whole apples covered in a hard <b>sugar</b> <b>candy</b> coating. While the topping varies from place to place, they are almost always served with a wooden stick of sorts in the middle making them easier to eat. Toffee apples are a common treat at autumn festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night because these festivals fall {{in the wake of}} the annual apple harvest. Dipping fruits into a sugar syrup is an ancient tradition. However, the origin of the red candy apple is {{attributed}} to Newark, New Jersey candymaker who conceived the idea of dipping apples into a red cinnamon candy mixture he had on hand. In addition, dipping apples in hot caramel a 1950s American invention attributed to Kraft salesman Dan Walker.|$|E

5000|$|Jellies and gums:Jellies and gums are thick liquid <b>sugar</b> <b>candies.</b> [...] Gums, such as wine gums, are drier than jellies. They {{are made}} from sugar syrup plus a gelling agent. They are cooked to the lowest {{temperature}} of all <b>sugar</b> <b>candies</b> and consequently have the highest water content of <b>sugar</b> <b>candies,</b> about 20 to 25% water. Their stiffness depends on the type and amount of gelling agent, the final concentration, the pH of the product, and other factors. The most popular forms of gelling agent are gelatin, agar-agar, starch (more typical of American jelly candies), and pectin (more typical of European candies). These produce different effects. For example, starch produces cloudy jellies, while high-methoxyl pectin produces clear ones. Agar-based jellies are harder to dissolve, and gelatin-based jellies have a more rubbery texture.|$|R
25|$|In Spain {{and some}} Latin American countries, Epiphany day is called El Día de los Reyes i.e., {{the day when}} a group of Kings or Magi, as related in the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, arrived to worship and bring three gifts to the baby Jesus after {{following}} a star in the heavens. This day is sometimes known as the Día de los Tres Reyes Magos (The day of the Three Royal Magi) or La Pascua de los Negros (Holy Day of the Black men) in Chile, although the latter is rarely heard. In Spanish tradition on January 6, three of the Kings: Melchior, Gaspar, and Balthazar, representing Arabia, the Orient, and Africa, arrived on horse, camel and elephant, bringing respectively gold, frankincense and myrrh to the baby Jesus. Before going to bed on the eve of January 6, children polish their shoes and leave them ready for the Kings' presents to be put in them. The next morning presents will appear under their shoes, or if the children are deemed to have misbehaved during the year, coal (usually a lump of hard <b>sugar</b> <b>candy</b> dyed black, called Carbón Dulce). Most towns in Spain arrange colorful parades representing the arrival of the Reyes Magos to town so children can see them in their camels or carriages before they go to bed. The oldest of this parades is held in Alcoi, Alacant – Alicante (Valencian Community) which has hosted an annual parade since 1885. Sweet wine, nibbles, fruit and milk are left for the Kings and their camels. In Spain, children typically receive presents on this day, rather than on Christmas, though this tradition has changed lately, and children now receive presents on both days. The Epiphany bread/cake is known as Roscón, Tortell de Reis in Catalan, and in Mexico as Rosca de reyes.|$|E
2500|$|Under materialism or even {{embodiment}} values, or in {{any system}} that recognizes the validity of ecology as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, Earth. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to what else could be achieved there. In other words, [...] good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant <b>sugar</b> <b>candy)</b> as [...] "not good enough", one works within its constraints.

6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--Since I last {{laid down}} my pen, I have written and rewritten The Beach of Falesá; {{something}} like sixty thousand words of sterling domestic fiction (the story, you will understand, {{is only half}} that length); and now I don't want to write any more again for ever, or feel so; and I've got to overhaul it once again to my sorrow. I was all yesterday revising, and {{found a lot of}} slacknesses and (what is worse in this kind of thing) some literaryisms. One of the puzzles is this: It is a first person story--a trader telling his own adventure in an island. When I began I allowed myself a few liberties, because I was afraid of the end; now the end proved quite easy, and could be done in the pace; so the beginning remains about a quarter tone out (in places); but I have rather decided to let it stay so. The problem is always delicate; it {{is the only thing that}} worries me in first person tales, which otherwise (quo' Alan) [...] "set better wi' my genius." [...] There is a vast deal of fact in the story, and some pretty good comedy. It is the first realistic South Sea story; I mean with real South Sea character and details of life. Everybody else who has tried, that I have seen, got carried away by the romance, and ended in a kind of <b>sugar</b> <b>candy</b> sham epic, and the whole effect was lost--there was no etching, no human grin, consequently no conviction. Now I have got the smell and look of the thing a good deal. You will know more about the South Seas after you have read my little tale than if you had read a library. As to whether any one else will read it, I have no guess. I am in an off time, but there is just the possibility it might make a hit; for the yarn is good and melodramatic, and there is quite a love affair--for me; and Mr. Wiltshire (the narrator) is a huge lark, though I say it. But there is always the exotic question, and everything, the life, the place, the dialects--trader's talk, which is a strange conglomerate of literary expressions and English and American slang, and Beach de Mar, or native English,--the very trades and hopes and fears of the characters, are all novel, and may be found unwelcome to that great, hulking, bullering whale, the public.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dental {{cavities}} are a kind {{of disease}} that is increasing. The quantitative change has also produced qualitative changes concerning the type, extension and location of the lesions. Objective: To identify the selected risks of dental cavities among the students of a primary school. Methods: An analytic investigation of the controls and cases performed during academic course 2004 to 2005. The universe was constituted by 320 students where 204 were selected for this study. The cases were selected among the children who were affected by cavities (102) and the controls were selected by a simple randomized sample, i. e. a control one for each case (102). A consultation was carried out in the school to value the risks and the presence of the disease. Affectation due to cavities, malocclusion, and parodontopathies, age, sex, scholar degree, bad oral hygiene, previous experience of cavities in primary and permanent dentition, saliva viscosity, dental overlapping, orthodontic treatment, and <b>sugar</b> <b>candies</b> ingestions were the variables analyzed. Results: It was corroborated that the 49. 5 % of the cases were affected by cavities, 23 % by malocclusion, and parodontopathies were observed in the 2, 0 %.

5000|$|Hard candies {{and pulled}} candies:Hard candies (also called boiled sweets) are single-phase, {{amorphous}} <b>sugar</b> <b>candies</b> that are commonly {{made from a}} combination of sucrose and glucose syrups. [...] They are typically about 98% or more solid sugar. They have a glassy, translucent appearance.

50|$|Chemically, <b>sugar</b> <b>candies</b> are broadly {{divided into}} two groups: {{crystalline}} candies and amorphous candies. Crystalline candies are not as hard as crystals of the mineral variety, but derive their name and their texture from their microscopically organized sugar structure, formed {{through a process of}} crystallization, which makes them easy to bite or cut into. Amorphous candies have a disorganized crystalline structure. Hard candies are non-crystalline, amorphous candies containing about 98% (or more) solid sugar.|$|R
