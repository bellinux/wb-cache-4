5|$|Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes {{are all in}} {{straightforward}} ternary or episodic form, {{sometimes with}} a coda. The mazurkas often <b>show</b> <b>more</b> folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies {{and the use of}} drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op.63 No.3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.|$|E
5|$|Move is {{the tenth}} studio album by Christian rock band Third Day. Released on October 19, 2010, {{the album was}} the band's first after guitarist Brad Avery left Third Day. The band wanted the album to be a {{departure}} from the modern rock stylings of Revelation (2008), intending to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> of their southern rock roots. Third Day chose to work with producer Paul Moak on the album and recorded it at their own studio, feeling it offered them more creative freedom. Primarily a southern rock album, Move also has significant influence from gospel music.|$|E

5|$|Six {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognised, characterised principally by differences {{in size and}} plumage. There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish plumage, larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also <b>show</b> <b>more</b> white plumage in the tail, with less whiteness on the wing.|$|E
5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds <b>show</b> <b>more</b> evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.|$|E
5|$|The {{trioxide}} is {{volatile and}} sublimes at high temperatures. This prevents {{formation of a}} continuous protective (passivating) oxide layer, which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal. Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left). The chemistry and the compounds <b>show</b> <b>more</b> similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, contrasts with {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), while the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2.|$|E

5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|Four {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished by}} polyatomic bonding in their standard states, in either discrete or extended molecular forms: carbon (C, as graphite sheets); phosphorus (as P4 molecules); sulfur (as S8 molecules); and selenium (Se, as helical chains). Consistent with their higher coordination numbers (2 or 3), the polyatomic nonmetals <b>show</b> <b>more</b> metallic character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals; {{they are all}} solid, mostly semi-lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to moderately high (2.19–2.58). Sulfur is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals given its dull appearance, brittle comportment, and low conductivity—attributes common to all sulfur allotropes. It nevertheless shows some metallic character, either intrinsically or in its compounds with other nonmetals. Examples include the malleability of plastic sulfur and the lustrous-bronze appearance and metallic conductivity of polysulfur nitride (SNx).|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they <b>show</b> <b>more</b> reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
5|$|Johansen rapidly climbed {{prospect}} charts for the 2010 NHL Draft, {{starting the}} year as a potential second round selection, before rising to 16th among North American skaters when the NHL Central Scouting Bureau (CSB) released its mid-season ranking. Johansen's coach with Penticton noted that, {{as one of the}} younger players of his draft class, his skill was often overlooked. NHL scouts praised his speed, playmaking ability and vision on the ice but believed he needed to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> consistency and physicality. He had been compared to Ottawa Senators centre Jason Spezza, while Johansen had said he tried to model his game after San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton. He finished the season as the tenth ranked skater according to Central Scouting and was projected to be a top 20 pick, perhaps as high as top 10. With the fourth overall pick in the 2010 NHL Draft, Johansen was chosen by the Columbus Blue Jackets.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} having secret {{meetings}} in the parking lot, where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company. However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> respect for Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E

5|$|On 7 and 8 March 1894, he {{experimented with}} {{expanding}} his shows {{and held his}} first Cat conformation show. The first show had over 600 entries, becoming easily the biggest of its kind so far, with patrons that included the Duchess of Newcastle, the Countess de Sefton and Lady de Trafford. The publication Fur and Feather praised the new venture and encouraged more. Crufts however wasn't so sure as the initial show had lost over a hundred pounds, and entries {{in some of the}} classes were restricted to only a handful of cats. He held a second show in March 1895, which once again Fur and Feather heaped praise upon, despite the cutbacks that Cruft had initiated to make the <b>show</b> <b>more</b> profitable. Fur and Feather announced in March 1896 that the cat show had been postponed due to Cruft's other business commitments, but he never went on to run such a show again.|$|E
5|$|Other sites <b>show</b> <b>more</b> circumstantial {{evidence}} of mammoth hunting, such as piled bones bearing butcher marks. Some {{of these sites}} are not closely associated with Clovis points. The Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site and the Dent Site, where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with butcher marks and in association with Clovis points, were once interpreted as the killing of entire herds by Clovis hunters. However, isotope {{studies have shown that}} the accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of the year, and therefore not herds killed in single incidents. Many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time, and are therefore ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.|$|E
5|$|The Brooklyn native {{began the}} busier fighter, using the jab {{and trying to}} land uppercuts {{for the first two}} rounds, while Matthysse worked on the body. In round three, a clash of heads opened a cut outside of the left eye of Judah. Matthysse {{displayed}} more aggression and became the aggressor in the third and the fourth round and Judah switched to a defensive tactic. In the next two rounds, the American boxer picked up the pace, beginning to land more combinations. The seventh round was less active but in the eight, Judah landed some hard right counter shots. Judah continued to box throughout the ninth round but Matthysse began to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> power in the tenth, focusing on the head of his opponent and knocking down the American boxer after a hard right hand to the jaw. Judah got up but he was hurt, and the Argentine fighter tried to press the attack after the knockdown. However, Judah held and worked on the defensive and managed to finish the bout. Two judges scored the fight 114–113 for Judah, while the other judge scored it 114–113 for Matthysse.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{rigorous}} {{definition of}} a nonmetal. They <b>show</b> <b>more</b> variability in their properties than metals do. The following {{are some of the}} chief characteristics of nonmetals. Physically, they largely exist as monatomic gases, with a few having more substantial (but still open-packed) diatomic or polyatomic forms, unlike metals, which are nearly all solid and close-packed; if solid, they generally have a submetallic or dull appearance and are brittle, as opposed to metals, which are lustrous, ductile or malleable; they usually have lower densities than metals; are poor conductors of heat and electricity when compared to metals; and have significantly lower melting points and boiling points than those of metals (with the exception of carbon). Chemically, the nonmetals have relatively high ionisation energy and high electronegativity; they usually exist as anions or oxyanions in aqueous solution; generally form ionic or interstitial compounds when mixed with metals, unlike metals, which form alloys; and have acidic oxides whereas the common oxides of the metals are basic.|$|E
