40|$|Abstract It is {{well known}} that the large round trip time and the highly {{variable}} delay in a cellular network may degrade the performance of TCP. Many concepts have been proposed to improve this situation, including performance enhancing proxies (PEPs). One important class of PEPs are <b>split</b> <b>connection</b> proxies, which terminate a connection from a server in the Internet in a host close to the Radio Access Network (RAN) and establish a second connection towards the mobile User Equipment (UE). This connection splitting can be done either purely on the transport layer (TCP proxy) or on the application layer (HTTP proxy in the case of web traffic). While it is clear that an application layer proxy also infers the splitting of an underlying transport layer connection, the performance of applications may be essentially different for both approaches. In this paper, we first study the general impact of a <b>split</b> <b>connection</b> proxy on TCP bulk data transfer. We then focus on the case of web traffic and investigate the TCP connection behavior of the Mozilla web browser. Based on this, we study the performance of TCP and HTTP proxies in UMTS networks under different scenarios and for different HTTP configurations. ...|$|E

Varying channel properties, roaming etc. which {{interfere with the}} TCP retransmission and congestion control mechanisms can be alle-viated by <b>split</b> <b>connection</b> techniques and performance enhancing proxies (PEP). However, current <b>split</b> <b>connection</b> techniques and PEP do not sufficiently maintain end–to–end congestion control and rate control. Flow control and window clamping techniques, which are often used for this purpose, do not solve but work around the problem and undermine TCP’s sliding window mechanism. In this paper we propose the concept of Path Tail Emulation to overcome this weak-ness. A TCP flow is split at the gateway from the Internet into the mobile network. The mobile network is then hidden behind an emulated loss free link, the bandwidth and capacity of which correspond to the mobile network’s properties. Using Path Tail Emulation, congestion control and acknowledgement pacing is done {{exactly the same way}} as in pure wirebound networks, thus TCP can fully exploit the available network capacity without suffering from any adverse interaction with lower layers. The behaviour of a mobile network behind a PEP using Path Tail Emulation is reduced to a network which is compliant to the network model used for TCP in wire-bound networks and therefore can be handled with well known and well proven tech-niques. ...|$|E

40|$|Wireless Communication, {{one of the}} {{important}} demanding technologies basically suffers from unreliable nature due to its high bit error rate caused by handoffs. Transmission Control Protocol, the reliable successful Transport Protocol, basically designed for a wired network handles network congestion effectively. When TCP is implemented over Wireless Network, there will be significant loss due to the unreliable nature of wireless link rather than by congestion. But, TCP implicitly assumes the loss is due to congestion and reacts by invoking congestion control algorithm which degrades throughput, delay, packet discard ratio; finally ending up with inefficient utilization of bandwidth. There are two approaches to handle the situation, either hide the non-congestion losses from TCP sender or differentiate the non-congestion losses from congestion losses. The mechanisms proposed based on the two approaches can be classified into three groups (1) End-to-end protocol, (2) <b>Split</b> <b>Connection</b> protocol, and (3) Link Layer protocol. These schemes are compared and surveyed based on the metrics affecting both Wireless Network and TCP, and a comprehensive report is generated in this survey paper...|$|E

In the proposed algorithm, the TULIP communicates with MAC protocol which provides efficient and reliable frame exchange over the shared wireless channels.

Much of this energy powers idle links, switches, and network-connected hosts and is thus wasted. This dissertation contains the first-ever investigation into the energy efficiency of Ethernet networks. A method for matching Ethernet link data rate with link utilization, called Adaptive Link Rate (ALR), is designed and evaluated. ALR consists of a mechanism to change the link data rate and a policy to determine when to change the data rate. The focus of this dissertation is on the analysis and simulation evaluation of two ALR policies. The simplest ALR policy uses output buffer thresholds to determine when to change data rate. This policy is modeled using a Markov chain. A specific challenge was modeling a state-dependent service rate queue with rate transition only at service completion. This policy was shown to be unstable in some cases, and an improved policy based on explicit utilization measurement was investigated. This more complex policy was evaluated using simulation. A synthetic traffic generator was developed to create realistic synthetic network traffic traces for the simulation evaluation. Finally, an improved method for detecting long idle periods using quantile estimation was investigated. Characterization of network traffic showed that proxying by a low power device for a high power device is feasible. A prototype proxy for a Web server was developed and studied.

40|$|A incorporação de uma perspectiva geográfica a ecologia, tem promovido {{insights}} através dos quais modelos de paisagem fornecem quadros para o entendimento das variabilidades hidrológicas e geológicas nas regiões estuarinas. Nesse contexto, os arranjos geomorfológicos têm explicado a estrutura do nécton em diferentes escalas. Tais modelos fundamentam-se em duas hipóteses: i) a paisagem determina a configuração das variáveis fisioquímicas, e hidrodinâmicas, ii) a geomorfologia pode afetar a distribuição e uso do hábitat pelas espécies uma vez que determinadas geometrias podem suportar ou atrair maiores densidades. Estes fatores são observados nas redes de drenagem que compõem os estuários, os canais de maré. Nestes locais, processos como a dissipação da energia tidal estratificação, maré e circulação de nutrientes, são fatores decisivos na estruturação das assembleias. Em tal contexto peixes estuarinos, tendem a ter um gasto de energia significativo adequando-se as condições de salinidade e temperatura. Desta forma, canais podem ofertar refúgio tidal e térmico, nas estruturas que formam sua paisagem, desempenhando um papel na persistência das espécies durante os ciclos de maré. Os estreitamentos na geometria dos canais provocam a dissipação da maré, sobretudo devido principalmente a frenagem ocasionada pela fricção das margens. A mediada que o canal se estreita observa -se a formação de um gradiente físico e químico associado a geomorfologia. Assim, assembleias podem diferir ao longo de porções distintas dos canais. Por exemplo a dinâmica hidráulica e a circulação hialina pode ser determinante na presença de certas espécies. comprimento, acarretam mudanças na composição das assembleias de peixes estuarinos. Então canais com morfometrias distintas devem diferir quanto a sua estrutura populacional. Assume-se, portanto que a geomorfologia inerente as redes de drenagem estão diretamente ligadas a função das mesmas no ambiente estuarino, ou seja, variações físicas e químicas ligadas a paisagem atraem espécies de peixes em busca refúgio, alimento e reprodução. Por esta razão, o presente trabalho buscou verificar a maneira que as características geomorfológicas (comprimento, largura, divisões, conexão com o canal principal e número de meandros) em dois canais de maré de segunda ordem, afetam a composição, distribuição e abundância das assembleias de peixes ao longo de um gradiente salino em um regime sazonal. Para tanto foram realizadas seis excursões (3 no período seco e 3 no chuvoso). Em cada canal foram estabelecidos quatro pontos amostrais, dois dos quais representavam a zona inferior e dois a porção superior. Em cada ponto foram realizados três arrastos utilizando uma rede beach seine. Os fatores ambientais foram aferidos através de uma soda Logo variações nas medidas geomorfológicas, tais como largura e multiparamétrica. A geomorfometría foi obtida através de imagens de satélite. Um total de 6. 901 indivíduos, pertencentes a 76 espécies, foram capturados. Nesse estudo constatou-se diferenciação entre as zonas, onde as regiões próximas a conexão com o canal principal paresentaram maior riqueza e densidade de peixes. Atribuiu-se tal padrão a proximidade destas zonas com o canal principal, tamanho da abertura da boca do canal bem como a largura do mesmo. As zonas inferiores apresentaram-se mais instáveis em termos de salinidade e oxigênio dissolvido, desta forma as zonas superiores foram caracterizadas pela dominância de pequenos gobídeos. The {{incorporation of}} a geographic perspective on ecology, has promoted insights were landscape models provide frameworks {{for understanding the}} hydrological and geological variability in estuarine regions. In this context, the geomorphological arrangements have explained the Nekton structure at different scales. These models are based on two hypothesis : i) the landscape determines the hydrodynamics and {{the configuration of the}} fiscal chemist variables ii) the geomorphology may affect the distribution and habitat use by species since certain geometries can support or attract higher densities. These factors have been observed in drainage systems that composed estuaries, the tidal creeks. In these sites, processes such as energy dissipation tidal stratification, tide and circulation of nutrients, are decisive factors in the structuring of the assemblages. In this context estuarine fish, they tend to have a significant energy expenditure adapting to the conditions of salinity and temperature. In this way, creeks can offer tidal and thermal refuge on the structures that form their landscape, playing a role in the persistence of the species during the tidal cycles. The narrowing of the channels geometry causes the dissipation of the tide, especially due to the braking caused by the friction of the banks. Mediated the channel narrows it had observed physical and chemical gradient associated with geomorphology. Thus assemblies may differ over different portions of the channels. For example, the hydraulic dynamics and hyaline circulation can be decisive in the presence of certain species. Soon varations in geomorphological measures, such as length and width, cause changes in the composition of estuarine fish assemblages. Then channels with different morphometric must differ in their population structure. Therefore, it had assumed therefore that the geomorphology inherent to drainage networks are directly connected to their function in the estuarine environment, so physical and chemical changes associated to landscape can attract fish species seeking for refuge, food and reproduction sites. For this reason the present work aimed to verify the way that the geomorphological features (length, width, <b>split,</b> <b>connection</b> to the main channel and meanders), in two second order creeks, affects the composition, distribution and abundance of fish assemblages over a salt gradient on a seasonal basis. Therefore, we made six excursions (3 in the dry and 3 in the rainy season). In each channel, were set four sample points, two of then represented the lower and other two the upper part. At each point were performed three hauls using a beach seine. Environmental factors were measured using a multiparameter meter. The geomorphometrie was obtained through satellite images A total of 6901 individuals included in 76 species of fish were caught. In this study, we found differentiate between areas next the connection with the main channel that show a greater richness and fish density. We attributed this pattern to the proximity of these zones with the main channel, the creek moth size and the width. The lower portions presented more stable in terms of salinity and dissolved oxygen, thus the upper zone was characterized by dominance of small gobiidae...|$|E
