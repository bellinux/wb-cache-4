25|$|Throughout the {{production}} {{life of the}} BAe 146, British Aerospace proposed a number of specialised military versions, including side- and rear-loading transports, an airborne tanker version, and a carrier onboard delivery version. Out of these proposals came the BAe 146STA (<b>Sideloading</b> Tactical Airlifter), based on the BAe 146QT cargo aircraft and sharing its cargo door {{on the left side}} of the rear fuselage. This military transport version has a refuelling probe protruding from the nose; a demonstrator, fitted with a dummy refuelling probe and an air-openable paratroop door was displayed at the 1989 Paris Air Show and carried out extensive demonstration tours, but no orders resulted.|$|E
50|$|Today, <b>sideloading</b> is {{widespread}} and virtually every mobile device {{is capable of}} <b>sideloading</b> {{in one or more}} ways.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sideloading</b> is an {{excellent}} mechanism for proximity marketing.|$|E
50|$|Some {{wireless}} carriers (most notably Verizon Wireless) {{require that}} handset manufacturers limit the <b>sideload</b> capabilities of devices on their networks {{as a form}} of vendor lock-in. This usually results in the loss of USB and Bluetooth as <b>sideload</b> options (though memory card transfer is still available).|$|R
50|$|MP3tunes {{asserted}} that EMI had {{no evidence of}} the actual acts of copying, only the existence of copies <b>sideloaded</b> from allegedly unauthorized distributors. The court rejected this view, holding that EMI's testimony and documents were sufficient to establish that copying had occurred, since they showed that MP3tunes lockers contained EMI-owned songs <b>sideloaded</b> from unauthorized distributors.|$|R
40|$|This note {{covers the}} {{development}} of two strain-gauge balances for use on the Whirling Arm Facility of the College. The main requirements for this balance were:- (a) to withstand 700 lbs of <b>sideload</b> without it interfering with the lift, drag and pitching moment measurements, (b) {{to have a high}} sensitivity without too heavy a structure. The balance originally designed for this purpose proved to be unacceptable because of undue interference due to <b>sideload</b> and the non-repetitive nature of its calibration curves. With the information gained from this first balance a second balance of exceedingly simpler design, was manufactured and was found to give good calibration curves and sensitivity, with little interference from <b>sideloads.</b> A trouble free method of recording the signals from the strain-gauge bridges is being developed and should be operating within the near future. It concluded that a new model, with its c. g. lying on the transverse centre-line of the balance, will be needed if <b>sideload</b> interference is to be further reduced...|$|R
50|$|Windows Store is {{the primary}} means of distributing Windows Store apps to users. Although <b>sideloading</b> apps from outside the store is supported, out-of-box <b>sideloading</b> support on Windows 8 is only {{available}} for Windows 8 Enterprise computers that have joined a Windows domain. <b>Sideloading</b> on Windows RT and Windows 8 Pro devices, and Windows 8 Enterprise computers without a domain affiliation, requires purchase of additional licenses through volume licensing. Windows 10 removes this requirement, allowing users to enable the installation of universal apps from outside of Windows Store using a switch in the developer menu of Settings app.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{wireless}} data charges. <b>Sideloading</b> delivery {{does not}} involve a wireless carrier.|$|E

5000|$|Support for browser extensions, {{which can}} either be {{installed}} from the Windows Store or be <b>sideloaded</b> from external sources ...|$|R
50|$|Streaming {{media is}} {{generally}} preferred to downloading due to limited storage, thus {{there is limited}} content available to download and <b>sideload.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sideloaded</b> - a game {{binary file}} is loaded onto the phone while {{connected}} to a PC, either via USB cable or Bluetooth.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sideloading</b> of {{information}} may be accomplished {{by way of the}} microSD or microSDHC card. This device supports up to 4 gigabytes.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{geographic}} {{limitations on}} the delivery of content for <b>sideloading</b> as are implicit in the limited coverage of wireless networks.|$|E
50|$|This is {{potentially}} {{the quickest way}} of <b>sideloading</b> several files at once, {{as long as the}} user knows where to put the media files.|$|E
50|$|The {{jailbreak}} is semi-untethered, {{and requires}} to be rerun upon reboot. However, the app certificate expires seven days after <b>sideloaded</b> using Cydia Impactor.|$|R

25|$|Retail {{versions}} of Windows 8 are {{only able to}} install these apps through Windows Store— a namesake distribution platform that offers both apps, and listings for desktop programs certified for comparability with Windows 8. A method to <b>sideload</b> apps from outside Windows Store is available to devices running Windows 8 Enterprise and joined to a domain; Windows 8 Pro and Windows RT devices that {{are not part of}} a domain can also <b>sideload</b> apps, but only after special product keys are obtained through volume licensing.|$|R
50|$|Bluetooth <b>sideloading</b> is {{an option}} that is {{generally}} only available to mobile phones and some PDAs as it is not adopted in portable media players.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sideloading</b> via {{a memory}} card {{requires}} that the user {{have access to a}} memory card writer. Audio and video files can be written directly to the memory card and then inserted into the mobile device.|$|E
50|$|Transfer {{performance}} of USB <b>sideloading</b> varies greatly, {{depending on the}} USB version supported, and further still by the actual engineering implementation of the USB controller. USB is available in Low-Speed, Full-Speed, and Hi-Speed levels, with High-Speed USB transferring up to 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s). However, the majority of mobile phones as {{of the time of}} writing of this article are Full-Speed USB. Of the mobile products supporting USB 2.0 Hi-Speed, the actual <b>sideloading</b> performance usually ranges between 1-5 MB/s. However, the popular BlackBerry mobile phones by RIM and the iPods by Apple distance themselves at higher performing speeds of roughly 15.7 MB/s and 9.6 MB/s, respectively.|$|E
50|$|EMI {{alleged that}} because MP3tunes did not {{terminate}} users who had <b>sideloaded</b> infringing music from unauthorized websites, MP3tunes was not executing an adequate repeat infringer policy. The court disagreed, holding that because users {{could not know}} whether {{the source of their}} music files is infringing or not, the users who <b>sideloaded</b> music for personal use do not constitute repeat infringers. Furthermore, the court found MP3tunes' existing repeat infringer policy, under which MP3tunes terminated 153 users who illegally shared music, to be adequate for safe harbor requirements.|$|R

50|$|The 16 GB {{version was}} {{announced}} on November 7, 2011, and became available on November 17 for US $249. Of the 16 GB internal storage, 13 GB {{is available for}} content, with only 1 GB available for <b>sideloaded,</b> non-Barnes & Noble content. Barnes & Noble announced that from March 12, 2012, users could bring their Nook Tablets 16 GB into stores for repartitioning to increase the internal storage for <b>sideloaded</b> content. On August 12, 2012, Barnes & Noble lowered the price to US$199 {{to compete with the}} Kindle Fire. On November 4, 2012, the price was further reduced to US$179.|$|R
50|$|The Windows Phone 8.x Marketplace {{allows users}} to {{download}} APPX files to an SD Card and install them manually. In contrast, <b>sideloading</b> is prohibited on Windows 8.x, unless the user has a developers license or in a business domain.|$|E
50|$|Open Garden's {{founder and}} CEO, Micha Benoliel, stated {{that his company}} does not do {{anything}} illegal. The block remains in force as of January 2014 but can be circumvented by <b>sideloading</b> of the APK made available on Open Garden's mobile website.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sideloading</b> over a {{standardized}} USB (Micro-USB) connection was an agreement come {{to by the}} OMTP in late 2007. Until this time, mobile phone manufacturers had tended to adopt proprietary USB transfer solutions requiring the use of bundled or third party cables and software.|$|E
50|$|While it is {{possible}} to <b>sideload</b> other Android apps on the device over Android Debug Bridge (ADB), their usability is impaired by the small screen, and an inability to access the Internet directly.|$|R
50|$|In May 2011, AT&T {{issued an}} update {{allowing}} unknown sources to be installed, which {{allows users to}} <b>sideload</b> applications. On 25 July 2011 AT&T issued Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread, HTC Sense 2.1, and various fixes to the phone.|$|R
50|$|Google has {{announced}} that as of the 1st May 2016, MyTracks will be deprecated and no longer available in the Google Play Store. The app itself continues to work and is still available to <b>sideload</b> via APK repositories.|$|R
50|$|UWP apps can be {{downloaded}} from Windows Store or sideloaded from another device. The <b>sideloading</b> requirements were reduced significantly from Windows 8.x to 10, but the app must still be signed by a trusted digital certificate that chains to a root certificate.|$|E
50|$|Windows Store is {{available}} in Windows Server 2012 but is not installed by default. It is unavailable in Windows Server 2016. However, line-of-business UWP apps or UWP apps acquired from Microsoft Store for Business (formerly Windows Store for Business) can be installed through <b>sideloading.</b>|$|E
50|$|BlackBerry {{announced}} on March 24, 2011, {{that it would}} expand its application ecosystem for the PlayBook to include BlackBerry Java and Android-based applications. In a press release, BlackBerry stated that developers {{would be able to}} simply repackage, code sign, and submit their Android apps into BlackBerry App World, however for the first update, only Android 2.3 applications will be able to run on the PlayBook. These applications became available in the BlackBerry Tablet OS 2.0, released on February 21, 2012. However, Java applications will not be available until a future update. Popular Android applications that have not been ported onto BlackBerry world such as Pinterest and Whatsapp can be installed by users through the <b>sideloading</b> process. However, after the 2.1 OS update, RIM denied this <b>sideloading</b> process.|$|E

50|$|Bluetooth’s OBEX/OPP {{profiles}} {{allow for}} file transfer between a PC and a mobile device. Using this option is slightly {{more complicated than}} using a USB connection as the two devices have to be paired first. Also, unlike the familiar drag and drop that is usually available via USB, Bluetooth implementation is specific to the Bluetooth transceiver and drivers being used.Files that are <b>sideloaded</b> to mobile devices via Bluetooth are often received as messages, {{in the same way}} that SMS texts would be received. While these files can be saved to any storage medium, their initial location is the handset’s internal memory. As such the limitations of the internal memory have to be taken into account before beginning the <b>sideload.</b>|$|R
