2500|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{specimens}} submitted for surgical pathology analysis: biopsies and surgical resections. [...] A biopsy is {{a small piece of}} tissue removed primarily for surgical pathology analysis, most often in order to render a definitive diagnosis.

The pathologist's interpretation of a biopsy is critical to establishing the diagnosis of a benign or malignant tumor, and can differentiate between different types and grades of cancer, as well as determining the activity of specific molecular pathways in the tumor. Surgical resection specimens are obtained by the therapeutic surgical removal of an entire diseased area or organ (and occasionally multiple organs).

Methods Setting: Community-based cross sectional OC screening. Participants: With help from the Department of Health (DOH), Haryana and the local communities, we visited three villages and recruited 761 participants of ages 45 - 95 years.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} multiple instance learning (MIL), using generic tile-based spatio-temporal features, for {{the classification of}} benign and malignant lesions in breast cancer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

40|$|Abstract Introduction A burned-out seminoma of the testis is an {{exceptionally}} rare clinical entity, with few reports {{found in the}} literature. Case presentation A case of burned-out tumor of the testis in a 31 -year-old man is reported. The tumor presented as a retroperitoneal mass with histological characteristic of a seminoma. The testes on clinical examination were normal, and a <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesion</b> in the scrotum was only identified after ultrasound. Incision of the abdominal mass was decided, followed by orchectomy. Histological examination of the testis revealed a <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesion</b> with characteristics of spontaneous regression of germ cell tumors.

40|$|PURPOSE: Although breast dynamic contrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) demonstrates high sensitivity for malignant tumor detection, a major limitation is the relative low specificity, resulting in many false-positive diagnoses of <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesions</b> (BI-RADS assessment of 4 or 5) in clinical practice and consequently producing a relatively low positive predictive value (PPV) for biopsies. The most enhanced areas in the malignant tumors show a typical washout (WO) kinetic feature for the postcontrast signal intensity time courses and also correlate with microvessel density. Benign proliferative breast diseases can also produce the WO curve, yielding an equivocal kinetic behavior for the benign lesions and rendering their diagnoses as <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesions</b> in clinical practice. Considering that tumor angiogenesis is essential to an aggressive cancer tumor growth, the authors hypothesize that the WO volume fraction, i. e., the total volume of the WO voxels that demonstrate the WO curve within the tumor, is relatively large for malignant tumors in comparison to that for benign lesions. In this study, the authors present a lesion fractional volume WO kinetic analysis for improving the characterization of <b>suspicious</b> breast <b>lesions.</b> METHODS: A method to automatically detect the boundary of a manually selected contrast-enhanced lesion was introduced and tested, utilizing the signal intensity difference between the contrast-enhanced lesion and its surrounding tissues. The kinetic features of the postcontrast signal intensity time courses were quantitatively analyzed voxel-by-voxel with emphasis on {{the examination of the}} WO behavior. The WO volume fraction relative to the whole lesion volume was introduced and tested as a biomarker for improving the characterization of <b>suspicious</b> breast <b>lesions.</b> The sample for this test consisted of 28 <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesions</b> with correlative histopathology reports available. The lesions included 10 malignant tumors and 18 benign lesions, yielding a 35. 7...|$|R

The ICG-enhanced optical images coregistered accurately with Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images validating the ability of DOT to image breast tissue. In contrast to simple transillumination, we found that DOT provides for localization and quantification of exogenous tissue chromophore concentrations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{differentiation}} between benign and malignant strictures at the hepatic hilum is difficult. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the clinical and radiographical features of hilar lesions in a series of patients resected for a presumed cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: Of 132 consecutive patients undergoing resection for a <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesion</b> at the hepatic hilum, 20 (15 per cent) had a histopathologically proven benign tumour, diagnosed as chronic fibrosing or erosive inflammation, sclerosing cholangitis, or a granular cell tumour. All medical files and radiological examinations of the patients were reassessed. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms were considered suspicious in 16 of 19 patients. At ultrasonography only one of 16 patients had an unsuspicious examination. In 14 of 18 patients cholangiographic images were considered suspicious. Overall reassessment confirmed a <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesion</b> in all 20 patients.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the issue of}} {{malignant}} female disease, breast cancer, has been increasingly discussed. On top of biological behaviour, the prognosis of the disease depends manly on early diagnosis.

There is {{a decrease in the}} number of open biopsies and unnecessary surgeries of the breast gland. Locating and biopsy of a <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesion</b> may be done via mammography or ultrasound. The most common method of mammography nowadays is digital stereotaxis, the most recent used method is vacuum biopsy. Locating <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesion</b> via mammography is particurarly used for micro-caltifications, which can be visualised only via mammography.

30|$|It is {{critical}} to emphasise that when a targeted TRUS-guided biopsy performed for a <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesion</b> detected on MP-MRI (using either cognitive registration or fusion software) is negative, the MP-MRI should be reviewed {{in the context of}} the biopsy results and other clinical factors in order to consider the possibility of an erroneous targeted biopsy.

40|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance iimaging- (MRI-) ultrasound (US) guided biopsy, <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesions</b> are identified on MRI, registered on US, and targeted during biopsy.

Previous studies showed that software registration is fairly accurate in locating <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesions</b> and helps to improve the cancer detection rate. Here, the performance of visual registration was examined for ability to locate <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesions</b> defined on MRI. This study consists of 45 patients. Two operators with differing levels of experience (< 1 and 18 years) performed visual registration. The overall spatial difference by the two operators in 72 measurements was 10. 6 [*]±[*] 6. 0 [*]mm.

There were {{significant differences between the}} two operators (unpaired, P value[*]=[*] 0. 042; paired, P value[*]=[*] 0. 044). The substantial differences by the two operators suggest that visual registration could improperly and inaccurately target many tumors, thereby potentially leading to missed diagnosis or false characterization on pathology...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMalignant tumours {{may have}} a cystic appearance. They are {{dominated}} by multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, usually low-grade, which rarely metastasize. The Bosniak classification distinguishes non <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesions</b> (type I and II) from <b>suspicious</b> <b>lesions</b> (type III and IV) requiring resection and lesions requiring follow-up (type IIF). The main feature suggestive of malignancy is the enhancement of the septa and {{the walls of the}} cyst.
