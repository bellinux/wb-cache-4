5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters of lakes and rivers {{in the area are}} <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E

25|$|The {{flood of}} Scots-Irish, German, and others {{immigrants}} kept coming. Over 200,000 pioneers {{came over the}} Wilderness Road, enduring severe hardships. In the winter of 1778-79, the weather was <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> the Kentucky River froze {{to a depth of}} two feet. The frontier settlements alongside the road struggled to survive. Many of the cattle and hogs froze to death. The settlers had to eat frozen cattle and horses to survive.|$|E

If they do not, then the customer may request a coupon for a free Blizzard to use on their next visit, though this is at the owner's discretion.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, he bowled 422 overs {{for his new}} county, conceding just 516 {{runs and}} {{capturing}} 41 wickets. The following year, at Trent Bridge (when it was <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> KS Ranjitsinhji kept {{his hands in his}} pockets and fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.|$|E

25|$|The {{late night}} scenes caused {{issues with the}} cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she {{continued}} filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days.|$|E
25|$|Here Strabo {{launches}} another quibble. Hipparchus, {{relying on}} Pytheas, according to Strabo, places this area south of Britain, but he, Strabo, calculates {{that it is}} north of Ierne. Pytheas, however, rightly knows what is now Scotland as part of Britain, land of the Picts, even though north of Ierne. North of southern Scotland the longest day is 19 hours. Strabo, based on theory alone, states that Ierne is <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> any lands north of it must be uninhabited. In the hindsight given to moderns Pytheas, in relying on observation in the field, appears more scientific than Strabo, who discounted the findings of others merely because of their strangeness to him. The ultimate cause of his skepticism is simply {{that he did not}} believe Scandinavia could exist. This disbelief may also be the cause of alteration of Pytheas' data.|$|E
25|$|The Italian {{government}} {{became increasingly}} aggravated in 1915 with the passive {{nature of the}} Serbian army, which had not engaged in a serious offensive against Austria-Hungary for months. The Italian government blamed Serbian military inactiveness for allowing the Austro-Hungarians to muster their armies against Italy. Cadorna suspected that Serbia was attempting to negotiate an end to fighting with Austria-Hungary and addressed this to foreign minister Sidney Sonnino, who himself bitterly claimed that Serbia was an unreliable ally. Relations between Italy and Serbia became <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> the other Allied nations were forced to abandon the idea of forming a united Balkan front against Austria-Hungary. In negotiations, Sonnino remained prepared to allow Bosnia to join Serbia, but refused to discuss the fate of Dalmazia, which was claimed both by Italy and by Pan-Slavists in Serbia. As Serbia fell to the Austro-Hungarian and German forces in 1915, Cadorna proposed sending 60,000 men to land in Thessaloniki to help the Serbs now in exile in Greece and the Principality of Albania to fight off the opposing forces, but the Italian government's bitterness to Serbia resulted in the proposal being rejected.|$|E

25|$|Wanyan Heda's army {{still had}} more than 100,000 men after the battle at Mount Yu, and the Mongols adopted a {{strategy}} of exhausting the enemy. The Jin troops had little rest {{all the way from}} Dengzhou, and had not eaten for three days because of the severing of their supply lines. Their morale was plummeting and their commanders were losing confidence. When they reached Three-peaked Hill, a snowstorm suddenly broke out, and it was <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> the faces of the Jin troops went as white as corpses, and they could hardly march. Rather than attack them when they were desperate with their backs to the wall, the Mongols left them an escape route and then ambushed them when they let down their guard during the retreat. The Jin army collapsed without a fight, and the Mongols pursued the fleeing Jin troops relentlessly. Wanyan Heda was killed, and most of his commanders also lost their lives. After the Battle of Three-peaked Hill, Kaifeng was doomed and Emperor Aizong soon abandoned the city and entered Hebei Province in a vain attempt to reestablish himself there. Thousands of people offered a stubborn resistance to the Mongols, who entrusted the conduct of the attack to Subutai, the most daring of all their commanders. Emperor Aizong was driven south again, and by this time Kaifeng had been taken by the Mongols so he established his new capital at Caizhou (present-day Runan County, Henan Province). Subutai wished to massacre the whole of the population. But fortunately for the Khitans, Yelü Chucai was more humane, and under his advice Ögedei Khan rejected the cruel proposal.|$|E
500|$|Several {{of those}} {{affected}} {{by the events of}} the Antinomian Controversy went north with John Wheelwright in November 1637 to found the town of Exeter in what became New Hampshire. [...] A larger group of men were uncertain where to go, so they contacted Roger Williams who suggested that they purchase land from the Narragansett people along the Narragansett Bay, near his settlement of Providence Plantations. [...] John Clarke apparently did both, based on what he wrote in his book: [...] "By reason of the suffocating heat of the summer before , I went to the North to be somewhat cooler, but the winter following [...] proved <b>so</b> <b>cold,</b> <b>that</b> we were forced in the spring to make towards the South." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the FIVB's mandating of the bikini {{ran into}} problems. Some sports {{officials}} consider it exploitative and impractical in colder weather. It also drew {{the ire of}} some athletes. At the 2006 Asian Games at Doha, Qatar, only one Muslim country– Iraq– fielded a team in the beach volleyball competition because of concerns that the uniform was inappropriate. They refused to wear bikinis. The weather during the evening games in 2012 London Olympics was <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings. Earlier in 2012, FIVB had announced it would allow shorts (maximum length [...] above the knee) and sleeved tops at the games. Richard Baker, the federation spokesperson, said that [...] "many of these countries have religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible".|$|E

500|$|Due to its low budget, Becoming Jane {{was filmed}} on a [...] "tight" [...] {{schedule}} of eight weeks from March to May 2006. Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse {{was not a}} film studio, he had more creative freedom. Bernstein stated of filming, [...] "We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with. But hopefully we can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club, the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen's fiction. They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen." [...] Jarrold found filming [...] "very difficult. We {{had to make it}} work in the locations that we had as efficiently as possible." [...] Filming outdoors was often <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> Hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines; Automated Dialogue Replacement in post-production helped correct this by re-dubbing her lines.|$|E
500|$|ZANU and ZAPU {{announced}} on 9 October {{that they would}} attend this conference and any thereafter as a joint [...] "Patriotic Front" [...] (PF), including members of both parties under a combined leadership. Kaunda and Nyerere welcomed the new negotiations, but with the Soviet Union proposing that they once again alter their line, the talks were delayed indefinitely. In an attempt to encourage the other parties to travel to Switzerland, British mediator Ivor Richard asked the Rhodesian delegation to hasten their arrival, which they did, leaving Salisbury on 20 October 1976. Richard himself did not arrive until two days later. Some of the guerrillas arriving for the conference from the heat of Mozambique were unprepared for the Swiss winter: Rex Nhongo, for example, felt <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> he turned every heating appliance in his room, including the stove, to maximum and went to sleep. When the room caught fire, {{he was forced to}} jump from the balcony in his pyjamas.|$|E
500|$|... "Naomi" [...] {{was filmed}} in October 2008, {{in the same}} {{production}} block as the series' fourth episode, [...] "Pandora", and the series' opening title sequence. The riot scene {{in front of the}} college was filmed with 100 extras; Cook's petrol-bombing of the car was described by costume assistant Ros Marshall as [...] "probably the most hi-tech special effect we've had while filming Skins". The students' college common room was filmed in the show's production canteen. Originally, an entire scene was supposed to be filmed with Naomi and Emily in the lake, but the water was <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> the actors were unable to stay in the water, and Kathryn Prescott was taken to a standby ambulance with suspected hypothermia. Director Simon Massey choreographed Naomi and Emily's sex scene prior to filming so that, on the set, the actions would come instinctively to the actors and {{they would be able to}} complete the scene in a limited number of takes. While Lily Loveless enjoyed filming those scenes because [...] "stuff like that gives you experience", Prescott said that it concerned her, though she said that she was not pressured to do anything in the script that made her uncomfortable.|$|E

500|$|The battle's {{main focus}} was around a road dubbed [...] "Route 29", a {{strategically}} important line of communication to the UN forces in central Korea. Wonju {{was a critical}} crossroad village on Route 29 which ran north to south and connects Chuncheon on the 38th parallel with Daegu on the Pusan Perimeter. Another road, which ran from the northwest, connected Route 29 and the South Korean capital of Seoul at Wonju. Between Chuncheon and Wonju stood the town of Hoengseong, and from Wonju to Daegu were a series of towns such as Chechon, Tanyang, Punggi and Andong. The entire road network was situated within the rough hilly terrains of the Taebaek Mountain Range. The fighting around Wonju occurred during {{some of the worst}} Korean winter conditions, with temperatures as low as [...] and snow as thick as [...] on the ground. Indeed, the weather was <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> metal on artillery pieces would crack, while water could take an hour-and-a-half to boil. At times the cold weather alone was enough to stall all military activities, while frostbite caused more casualties than combat {{during the course of the}} battle.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] was {{directed}} by Diane Martel and filmed in upstate New York in June 1993. The video features scenes of Carey swimming in a small pond by a waterfall, boarding a colorful hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. As the video begins, Carey is swimming underwater while wearing clothing. She is soon gasping for air and climbing into a flower bed above. As she frolics and rolls in a field, scenes of Carey boarding a hot air balloon are inter-cut. Her dog Jack makes a cameo appearance, as he follows her through the field and pond. After a short interval of dancing alongside several male dancers, Carey leaves with her dog as the video concludes. After filming the video, Carey revealed that the water was <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> she refused to swim until the director, Martel, dived in first. Author Chris Nickson felt the video captured the song's soft and relaxed nature: [...] "The casual feel, almost like clips from home movies edited together, captured the song's off-the-shoulder airiness." [...] The video received heavy rotation on several video music channels, which added to the song's chart performance.|$|E
500|$|In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is {{described}} as a [...] "fine, free hitter with excellent defence", who could also [...] "bowl a very useful medium-paced ball". He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> <b>that</b> catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. [...] "C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt certain I should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!" [...] Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University {{at the end of the}} season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue—the awarding of the Cambridge [...] "colours" [...] to sportsmen—by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. In all, during his time at Cambridge, Roe played 13 first-class matches for the university, scoring 246 runs at an average of 11.18, with just one score greater than 50. He also took ten wickets at 15.60.|$|E
