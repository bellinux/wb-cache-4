50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} {{have been described as}} <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> due to their ability to improve soil quality. Some examples include biochar, bone meal, blood meal, coffee grounds, compost, compost tea, coir, manure, straw, peat, sphagnum moss, vermiculite, sulfur, lime, hydroabsorbant polymers, and biosolids. Many <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> {{come in the form of}} certified organic products, for people concerned with maintaining organic crops or organic gardens. <b>Soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> of almost every description are readily available from online stores or local nurseries as well as garden supply stores.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use of <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> {{is to improve}} soil structure. Soils tend to become {{compacted}} over time. Soil compaction impedes root growth, decreasing the ability of plants to take up nutrients and water. <b>Soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> can add more loft and texture to keep the soil loose.|$|R

The New Zealand (NZ) Government's commitment to a sustainable, low emissions energy future may be met, in part, by expanding bioenergy systems fuelled by short rotation forestry through utilising lower quality land affecting soil organic matter content and soil CO 2 flux. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the carbon sequestration potential of a range of <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> in order to minimise or offset carbon emissions due to ground disturbance. Design/methodology/approach ??? Seven <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> are evaluated using incubation chambers to measure the affect of their incorporation within three NZ soil types on soil respiration. Findings ??? Charcoal is found to produce a distinct and significant carbon sequestering trend, as do newspaper and whey. Conversely, vegetable oil, paper mill pulp, biodiesel and methanol showed overall carbon emitting trends. Research limitations/implications ??? The research is limited as only CO 2 is monitored within the incubation chambers rather than the whole gaseous carbon profile. No microbial observations are conducted. Practical implications ??? The investigation concluded that of the conditioners observed, charcoal, newspaper and whey warrant further observation as carbon sequestration <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners.</b> Originality/value ??? The paper forms part of the foundations within the development of <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> specifically designed for carbon sequestration...|$|R

25|$|The solid, fibrous {{component}} of the digested material {{can be used as}} a <b>soil</b> <b>conditioner</b> to increase the organic content of soils. Digester liquor {{can be used as a}} fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is, therefore, more carbon-intensive than the use of anaerobic digester liquor fertiliser. In countries such as Spain, where many soils are organically depleted, the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas.|$|E

30|$|So, {{on these}} premises, {{the aim of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} from the perspective of the theory of commitment costs if the level of farmer understanding about digestate attributes could influence the WTP. Thus, research was carried out in Sicily (Italy) on a sample of 223 Sicilian farmers to correlate their WTP for digestate with a set of eight attributes which usually characterise organic <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners.</b> An experimental design was set up so that participants were given different waiting times to decide on their WTP and different levels of information on the attributes of organic <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners.</b> In this way, it was possible to determine which digestate attributes influenced their WTP by varying waiting times and information levels.|$|R

2500|$|The {{collected}} fecal sludge should preferably {{be processed}} at dedicated fecal sludge treatment plants, {{instead of being}} co-treated with sewage in municipal sewage treatment plants, unless these are {{able to take the}} additional load, and solids liquid separation facilities are available. A variety of mechanized and non-mechanized technologies may be used, including constructed wetlands, anaerobic digestion, and waste stabilization ponds. The treatment process can produce useful products such as treated effluent {{that can be used for}} irrigation. Another possibility is to use the treated fecal sludge after composting as a <b>soil</b> <b>conditioner</b> or for the production of biogas, charcoal, biodiesel, powdered industrial fuel and electricity.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the growth}} in {{biological}} farming practices becoming more common throughout the Australia, traditional synthetic based fertilisers are replaced {{by the use of}} organic fertilisers in the form of compost and soil conditioners. Compost can improve overall soil health when incorporated into the soil or surface-applied as a <b>soil</b> <b>conditioner.</b> Despite differing in nutrient requirements, crops such as wheat, barley, oats, maize, canola, lucerne, fruit trees, grapes, sugar cane and much more can all benefit from the addition of pasteurised and composted organic materials. Compost can improve the soil’s physical, biological and chemical properties and positively enhance actively growing crops. Australian farmers are leading the way in the [...] of organic materials both above and below the soil surface. This continued used of composted organics completes the law of return cycle in the soil food chain, where nutrients removed through the plants, are returned to the soil.|$|E
2500|$|A urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT) {{is a type}} of dry toilet with urine {{diversion}} {{that can}} be used to provide safe, affordable sanitation in a variety of contexts worldwide. Through the separate collection of feces and urine without any flush water, many advantages can be realized, such as odor-free operation and pathogen reduction by drying. While dried feces and urine harvested from UDDTs can be and routinely are used in agriculture (respectively, as a soil amender and nutrient-rich fertilizer—this practice being known as reuse of excreta in agriculture), many UDDTs installations do not make use of any sort of recovery scheme. The UDDT is an example of a technology {{that can be used to}} achieve a sustainable sanitation system. This dry excreta management system (or [...] "dry sanitation" [...] system) is an alternative to pit latrines and flush toilets, especially where water is scarce, a connection to a sewer system and centralized wastewater treatment plant is not feasible or desired, fertilizer and <b>soil</b> <b>conditioner</b> are needed for agriculture, or groundwater pollution should be minimized.|$|E
40|$|In organic {{production}} only organic fertilizers and <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> {{can be used}} to supply the soil with nitrogen. The mineralization of these products is slow and so there can be problems with the supply of nitrogen, when the demand of the plants is high. The supply of nitrogen from organic products depends on the speed of their mineralization which is primarily influenced by the composition and formulation of their raw material. In apple production in the Alps-region especially during spring problems with nitrogen supply are common. In that period, the weather conditions are sometimes bad, the temperature in the soil is low and mineralization starts slowly - apple trees demand more nitrogen than the soil can deliver. To compensate the demand of the apple tree organic growers can not use mineral fertilizers but only organic fertilizers and <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> whose mineralization rate is often unknown. There is a strong need in organic fruit production to receive more information about the behaviour of fertilizers in the soil especially concerning their N-release under different conditions. To acquire that information, incubation experiments under controlled conditions (temperature, type of soil, humidity of the soil) were carried out in the laboratory to determine the mineralization-rate of different organic fertilizers and <b>soil</b> <b>conditioners</b> which are available in our region...|$|R

Without it, farmers’ WTP decreases drastically probably due to phenomena correlated to what economic theory calls commitment costs.|$|R
