25|$|Anticipating {{that its}} long-planned {{peripheral}} {{would become a}} commercial failure, Nintendo initially sold the Randnet <b>Starter</b> <b>Kit</b> via mail order. Later, very limited quantities of the standalone 64DD and games were made available through stores.|$|E
500|$|One {{element that}} did receive near-universal {{criticism}} was the game's price of $80 for the base game. PC World called the price the game's [...] "biggest flaw", Yahoo! Tech called it [...] "hefty" [...] and [...] "a steep investment", and VentureBeat called it [...] "quite the price tag", but qualified their statement {{by pointing to}} {{the large number of}} items that come with the <b>starter</b> <b>kit.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although PlayStation Move is {{implemented}} {{on the existing}} PlayStation 3 console, Sony states that it is treating Move's debut as its own major [...] "platform launch", planning an aggressive marketing campaign to support it. In addition to selling the controllers individually, Sony also plans to provide several different bundle options for PlayStation Move hardware; including a <b>starter</b> <b>kit</b> with a PS Eye, a Move motion controller, and a demo/sampler disc, priced under US$100; a full console pack with a PS3 console, DualShock 3 gamepad, PS Eye, and Move motion controller; and bundles of a Move motion controller with select games.|$|E

50|$|Spain {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} to join the eurozone. The Spanish <b>starter</b> <b>kits</b> or “Monedero Euro” had a face value of €12,02 equivalent to 1999.96 pesetas, however, they were sold for 2000 pesetas. These kits were released on 15 December 2001. On 1 September 2001, special <b>starter</b> <b>kits</b> for merchants were issued. The latter had a face value of €30,41 (5060 pesetas).|$|R
500|$|The golems, cards, {{and game}} board {{are covered in}} small {{magnetic}} dots. A Bluetooth stylus {{that comes with the}} <b>starter</b> <b>kit</b> reads the dots to transmit information from the board to a mobile app. Gameplay information such as the position of all of the golems, terrain and map effects, and the game's rules are stored in the app, which uses that information to determine and present players with available moves, attack accuracy and damage, and other statistics. Players then use the stylus to choose where to move and what actions to take; players still have to move the physical pieces on the board, but their moves are also reflected in the app.|$|E
500|$|The Get Up Kids {{have had}} a lasting impact on the music scene, having been cited as inspirations to several {{prominent}} bands and artists. Blink-182 bassist and singer Mark Hoppus is a vocal fan, having proposed to his wife to The Get Up Kids song [...] "I'll Catch You." [...] They were also {{a major influence on}} the rest of the band, even at their peak popularity around the release of Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. The members of Fall Out Boy cite The Get Up Kids' influence, particularly their album Four Minute Mile. In a 2005 interview with Alternative Press, Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz stated that the band had a huge influence on him and the other members of Fall Out Boy. [...] "There should be a How To Be a Pop-Punk Kid <b>starter</b> <b>kit</b> with bands like Get Up Kids, so kids would know whose shoulders bands like us are standing on. Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Warren Truitt of About.com described the album as Cyrus' attempt to gradually capture a more mature audience by sharing the album with artists like the Rascal Flatts and Swift. Truitt also made musical comparisons to Shania Twain in [...] "Dream", Kelly Clarkson in [...] "Don't Walk Away", Avril Lavigne in [...] "The Good Life", and Gwen Stefani in [...] "Spotlight" [...] and [...] "Let's Get Crazy". Heather Phares of Allmusic noted {{the presence of}} many drastically different genres makes the album [...] "a little weird". She stated that Cyrus' songs which were performed as herself were [...] "the best songs", and also compared Cyrus to Twain. Phares also noted that Swift's [...] "Crazier" [...] was [...] "the best song on Hannah Montana: The Movie". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "the distance between tween and twang isn't actually all that far; think of this [...] {{as a sort of}} country-lite <b>starter</b> <b>kit</b> for her legion of young Disney-fed fans". In the end, she said Hannah Montana: The Movie was [...] "the Miley show — whether it broadcasts from Nashville or Hollywood", despite appearances by other artists.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Robert Florence {{praised the}} app for calculating {{variables}} like movement range and tracking statistics like health and ability cooldowns, but {{spoke of a}} disconnect caused by constantly shifting focus between the screen and the board. While ultimately questioning {{the need for the}} physical components at all, Florence also saw the game as having potential in the future. Chris Hutton of Tom's Guide took a much more negative view. Hutton found it cumbersome that the <b>starter</b> <b>kit</b> came with only one stylus and that only one device running the app could be synced to a given game at a time, necessitating that the screen and stylus be passed back and forth between players. He also found the stylus itself to be unresponsive, slowing the game down to the point that he lost interest. VentureBeats Jay Henningsen, on the other hand, had nothing but praise for the app and stylus. After fifteen minutes he found using the stylus to be [...] "almost natural", and found that the app handling all of the rules and stat-keeping made for [...] "one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had getting into a new game". He {{went on to say that}} players will look to see the technology spread to other miniature wargaming products.|$|E

50|$|Forty {{thousand}} <b>starter</b> <b>kits,</b> worth €172 each, {{were available}} for businesses, but only 22.000 were sold. Since these <b>starter</b> <b>kits</b> contained rolled coins, the remaining kits could easily {{be used by the}} banks after €-day. Another 250,000 mini-kits, worth €17.09 (CYP 10) each, {{were available for}} the general public. Some 189,000 mini-kits were sold. According to the Eurobarometer survey, more than 70% of the citizens who had bought a mini-kit opened it and used the coins after the changeover while some 20% kept it untouched. As from the changeover, the unsold mini-kits have been exported to satisfy the demand of coin collectors abroad. Cypriot euro coins worth €3.5 million were exported in the first three weeks of January.|$|R

2500|$|Schneider {{liked the}} overall product value {{provided}} by the Randnet <b>Starter</b> <b>Kit,</b> including hardware, games, accessories, and Internet subscription. However, the platform's abrupt discontinuation proved to limit the appeal to a per item basis {{rather than as a}} whole. [...] Because these items were sold only as a soon-discontinued bundle, all with such ultimately limited application, he found the disks' cheaper prices to be aggregated back up to the level of cartridges.|$|E
