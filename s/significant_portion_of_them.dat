40|$|Single-marker linkage-disequilibrium (LD) methods cannot fully {{describe}} disequilibrium in an entire chromosomal region surrounding a disease allele. With {{the advent of}} myriad tightly linked microsatellite markers, {{we have an opportunity}} to extend LD analysis from single markers to multiple-marker haplotypes. Haplotype analysis has increased statistical power to disclose the presence of a disease locus in situations where it correctly reflects the historical process involved. For maximum efficiency, evidence of LD ought to come not just from a single haplotype, which may well be rare, but in addition from many similar haplotypes that could have descended from the same ancestral founder but have been trimmed in succeeding generations. We present such an analysis, called the “trimmed-haplotype method. ” We focus on chromosomal regions that are small enough that disequilibrium in <b>significant</b> <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> may have been preserved in some pedigrees and yet that contain enough markers to minimize coincidental occurrence of the haplotype in the absence of a disease allele: perhaps regions 1 – 2 cM in length. In general, we could have no idea what haplotype an ancestral founder carried generations ago, nor do we usually have a precise chromosomal location for the disease-susceptibility locus. Therefore, we must search through all possible haplotypes surrounding multiple locations. Since such repeated testing obliterates the sampling distribution of the test, we employ bootstrap methods to calculate significance levels. Trimmed-haplotype analysis is performed on family data in which genotypes have been assembled into haplotypes. It can be applied either to conventional parent–affected-offspring triads or to multiplex pedigrees. We present a method for summarizing the LD evidence, in any pedigree, that can be employed in trimmed-haplotype analysis as well as in other methods...|$|R
40|$|Acidovorax citrulli is a seedborne {{bacterium}} {{that causes}} bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbit plants including watermelon and melon. A. citrulli strains {{can be divided}} into two major groups based on their host preference, DNA fingerprint analyses and biochemical properties. Group I strains have been generally isolated from non-watermelon cucurbits, while group II strains are closely associated with watermelon. In the present study, we report the genome sequence of M 6, a group I model A. citrulli strain, isolated from melon. We used comparative genome analysis to investigate differences between the genome of strain M 6 and the genome of the group II model strain AAC 00 - 1. The draft genome sequence of A. citrulli M 6 harbors 139 contigs, with an overall approximate size of 4. 85 Mb. The genome of M 6 is ~ 500 Kb shorter than that of strain AAC 00 - 1. Comparative analysis revealed that this size difference is mainly explained by eight fragments, ranging from ~ 35 to 120 Kb and distributed throughout the AAC 00 - 1 genome, which are absent in the M 6 genome. In agreement with this finding, while AAC 00 - 1 was found to possess 532 open reading frames (ORFs) that are absent in strain M 6, only 123 ORFs in M 6 were absent in AAC 00 - 1. Most of these M 6 ORFs are hypothetical proteins and most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were also detected in two group I strains that were recently sequenced, tw 6 and pslb 65. Further analyses by PCR assays and coverage analyses with other A. citrulli strains support the notion that some of these fragments or <b>significant</b> <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are discriminative between group I and II strains of A. citrulli. Moreover, GC content, effective number of codon values and cluster of orthologs’ analyses indicate that these fragments were introduced into group II strains by horizontal gene transfer events. Our study reports the genome sequence of a model group I strain of A. citrulli, {{one of the most important}} pathogens of cucurbits. It also provides the first comprehensive comparison at the genomic level between the two major groups of strains of this pathogen...|$|R

We describe the bottom-up approach and analyze its costs and benefits. An experimental evaluation on two standard data corpora shows that bottom-up climbing removes forty to sixty six percent of branching operations and consequently saves twenty one to thirty two percent of construction time. However, a theoretical analysis of the worst-case behavior reveals that the time complexity of the bottom-up approach is superlinear. This is remedied by a combination of both approaches that removes nearly as many branching operations as the bottom-up climb, but still runs in linear time like the top-down descent...|$|E

40|$|Background: No {{formulation}} of exogenous insulin available {{to date has}} yet been able to mimic the physiological nictemeral rhythms of this hormone, and despite all engineering advancements, the theoretical proposal of developing a mechanical replacement for pancreatic β cell still has not been reached. Thus, the replacement of β cells through pancreas and pancreatic islet transplantation are the only concrete alternatives for re-establishing the endogenous insulin secretion in type 1 diabetic patients. Since only 1 to 1. 5 % of the pancreatic mass corresponds to endocrine tissue, pancreatic islets transplantation arises as a natural alternative. Data from the International Islet Transplant Registry (ITR) from 1983 to December 2000 document a total of 493 transplants performed around the world, with progressively worse rates of post-transplant insulin independence.

To achieve this aim, the Leopold matrix model, used for assessing anthropogenic influence on the environment, has been chosen. The specificity of this issue of protecting and preserving elements of an ecological network resulted in the need to isolate and evaluate the factors affecting the preservation of habitats and functionality of ecosystems, unlike the concept of Leopold matrix, which treats all factors as equally important in the process of evaluation.

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from AIDS develop ocular complications, {{the most frequent}} being HIV retinopathy. It is however not clear, if functional visual impairments can be observed as early indicators of ocular complications, before clinical diagnosis of HIV retinopathy is made at fundus examination. To address this issue, we measured colour vision {{in a group of}} 49 AIDS subjects with normal clinical fundi using the 'two equation method'. This method, combining red-green Rayleigh and the blue-green Moreland metameric matches, enables more complete and quantitative assessments of colour vision than those based on pigmentary tests. Data were collected on our computer controlled colorimeter and compared to those of normal subjects. While most AIDS subjects without HIV retinopathy demonstrated normal colour vision, a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had wider matches than normal subjects (11 % for the Rayleigh equation and 16 % for the Moreland equation). Furthermore, matching ranges of the Moreland equation were significantly correlated with CD 4 lymphocyte counts. Patients with low CD 4 values tended to produce larger matching ranges than the patients with high CD 4 values. A within subject study on 17 patients confirmed this trend and showed that the patients who increased/decreased their CD 4 blood counts generally improved/impaired their colour discrimination in the Moreland match. No such correlation was found between the matching ranges of the Rayleigh equation and the CD 4 counts. These results show that colour discrimination is slightly reduced in some AIDS subjects, although there are no detectable ocular complications. They also suggest two different types of colour vision impairments in AIDS patients without retinopathy: one reversible process affecting colour discrimination in the blue-green range; and another irreversible process affecting colour discrimination in the red-green range...|$|E

40|$|Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} (EDS) types I and II, which {{comprise the}} classical variety, are well characterized from the clinical perspective, {{but it has}} been difficult to identify the molecular basis of the disorder in the majority of affected individuals. Several explanations for this failure to detect mutations have been proposed, including genetic heterogeneity, failure of allele expression, and technical difficulties. Genetic heterogeneity has been confirmed as an explanation for such failure, since causative mutations have been identified in the COL 5 A 1, COL 5 A 2, and tenascin X genes and since they have been inferred in the COL 1 A 2 gene. Nonetheless, in the majority of families with autosomal dominant inheritance of EDS, there appears to be linkage to loci that contain the COL 5 A 1 or COL 5 A 2 genes. To determine whether allele-product instability could explain failure to identify some mutations, we analyzed polymorphic variants in the COL 5 A 1 gene in 16 individuals, and we examined mRNA for the expression of both alleles and for alterations in splicing. We found a splice-site mutation in a single individual, and we determined that, in six individuals, the mRNA from one COL 5 A 1 allele either was not expressed or was very unstable. We identified small insertions or deletions in five of these cell strains, but we could not identify the mutation in the sixth individual. Thus, although as many as one-half of the mutations that give rise to EDS types I and II are likely to lie in the COL 5 A 1 gene, a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> result in very low levels of mRNA from the mutant allele, as a consequence of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay...|$|E

Despite the barriers remaining today, in 2013 Europe was almost entirely shut to Demand Response while today consumers in some Member States {{have the opportunity to}} participate in Demand Response programs. In particular, the Energy Efficiency Directive Article 15. 8 establishes consumer access to energy markets by asking Member States to encourage Demand Response. The paper summarises the status of Member States legislations, market rules and technical regulations to enable Demand Response. In reviewing Member States progress in enabling Demand Response and consumer load aggregation, it emerges that a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have yet to begin their regulatory review with any seriousness. However those Member States who have looked to enable Demand Response are succeeding despite continued challenges. In successful cases, TSOs and regulators are using the deregulated and competitive market structures to empower providers and encourage market entry for consumers. Europe’s energy market is unique, and there is the opportunity to create unique solutions, combining competitive market structures with the decarbonisation agenda. Finally the paper identifies and proposes regulatory initiatives that would significantly further facilitate this development. An important consumer enabler is to define and allow full Aggregation of Consumer Load. European market design should enable the participation of Demand Response and other distributed resources, to the same degree they now facilitate centralized generation units. Design elements include frequent auctions, short time durations, small minimal bid sizes, and the acceptance of asymmetrical bids.

The main strategies to optimize islet transplantation aim at improving all these aspects. Conclusion Human islet transplantation should be regarded as an intervention that can decrease the frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes and improve glycemic control in selected patient for whom benefits of 4 - 5 years duration would be very valuable.
