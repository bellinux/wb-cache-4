The effective theory for the <b>soft</b> <b>fields</b> {{can be obtained}} by first integrating out the momentum scale T, which yields the well known hard thermal loop effective theory. Then the latter is used to integrate out the scale gT. One obtains a Boltzmann equation, which can be solved in a leading logarithmic approximation.

40|$|We derive {{the hard}} thermal loop action for <b>soft</b> {{electromagnetic}} <b>fields</b> in the finite temperature world-line formulation at imaginary time, by first integrating {{out the hard}} fermion modes from the microscopic QED action. Further, using the finite T world-line method, we calculate all static higher order terms in the <b>soft</b> electromagnetic <b>field.</b> At high T, the leading non-linear terms are independent of the temperature and, except for a term quartic in the time component of the vector potential, they cancel exactly against the vacuum contribution.

50|$|Proper braking {{technique}} is essential. The brakes {{should be applied}} firmly until reaching a point just short of a skid. At {{the first sign of}} a skid, the pilot should release brake pressure and allow the wheels to spin up. Directional control should be maintained as far as possible with the rudder. Remember that in a crosswind, if aquaplaning should occur, the crosswind will cause the aircraft to simultaneously weathervane into the wind (i.e. the nose will turn toward the wind) as well as slide downwind (the plane will tend to slide in the direction the air is moving). For small aircraft, holding the nose up as if performing a <b>soft</b> <b>field</b> landing and using the rudder to aerodynamically maintain directional control while holding the upwind aileron {{in the best position to}} prevent lifting the wing should help. However, avoid landing in heavy rain where the crosswind component of the wind is higher than the maximum demonstrated crosswind listed in the Pilot Operations Handbook.|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} tomography (EIT) {{seeks to}} image the electrical conductivity {{of an object}} using electrical impedance measurement data at its periphery. Ultrasound reflection tomography (URT) is an imaging modality that is able to generate images of mechanical properties of the object in terms of acoustic impedance changes.
