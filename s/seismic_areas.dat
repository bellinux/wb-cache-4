5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, among the most active <b>seismic</b> <b>areas</b> in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes, a few of which have caused damage. The frequency for non-damaging earthquakes from this zone measures out to about one per year, and it has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs. Such earthquakes have been helpful in highlighting the activity of faults below the Paleozoic detachment. Fault-plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout the area confirmed strike-slip faulting between two steeply declining planes. Both right and left-lateral movement occurs in the area, most movement being associated with north-to-south planes (right-lateral) and east-to-west planes (left-lateral). All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more-recent faults. These basement faults probably converge on one another, and one being strong and the other being weak, produce earthquakes.|$|E

40|$|In {{designing}} modern composite steel-concrete {{structures for}} <b>seismic</b> <b>areas</b> buildings with ductile behaviour {{can be produced}} {{that are able to}} withstand even high-intensity earthquakes, at the cost, however, of their sustaining significant damages.
