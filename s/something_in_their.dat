5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
5|$|Stela 4 {{was found}} in the {{northern}} part of the East Plaza. It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location. Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4. The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic text with a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's Emblem Glyph. This side of the stela depicts a Maya bloodletting ritual with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg. The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it. This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at Naranjo. The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile. A child or youth is seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hands that cannot now be distinguished. Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names. The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is different, with the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front. This probably indicates that both sides were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the floor level of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.|$|E
500|$|In another temple {{there is}} an {{octagonal}} kiosque, having from the top to the bottom fifteen stories. Each story contains apartments decorated with lacquer in the Cathayan manner, with ante-rooms and verandahs...It is entirely made of polished wood, and this again gilded so admirably {{that it seems to}} be of solid gold. There is a vault below it. An iron shaft fixed {{in the center of the}} kiosque traverses it from bottom to top, and the lower end of this works in an iron plate, whilst the upper end bears on strong supports in the roof of the edifice which contains this pavilion. Thus a person in the vault can with a trifling exertion cause this great kiosque to revolve. All the carpenters, smiths, and painters in the world would learn <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> trades by coming here! ...|$|E

500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later on as his Motown career developed, Gaye {{would seek}} {{inspiration}} in fellow label mates such as David Ruffin of The Temptations and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops as their grittier voices led to Gaye and his producer seeking a similar sound in recordings such as [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is". Later in his life, Gaye {{reflected on the}} influence of Ruffin and Stubbs stating, [...] "I had heard <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> voices something my own voice lacked". He further explained, [...] "the Tempts and Tops' music made me remember that when a lot of women listen to music, they want to feel the power of a real man." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Tyndale Bible Dictionary {{concludes that}} Paul {{probably}} did not approve the practice of baptism for the dead. He refers to its practitioners as [...] "they", not as [...] "you" [...] (the Corinthian Christians to whom he wrote). The note in the Catholic New American Bible is more cautious: [...] "Baptized for the dead: this practice is not further explained here, nor is it necessarily mentioned with approval, but Paul cites it as <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> experience that attests in one more way to belief in the resurrection." [...] In this, it stays close to what Tertullian wrote in the year 207 or 208, {{when he said that}} Paul's only aim in alluding to the practice of baptism for the dead, [...] "whatever it may have been", was [...] "that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{document}} Responses to some questions regarding {{certain aspects of}} the doctrine on the Church of 29 June 2007 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith reiterated that, {{in the view of the}} Roman Catholic Church, the Christian communities born out of the Protestant Reformation and which lack apostolic succession in the sacrament of orders are not [...] "Churches" [...] in the proper sense. The Eastern Christian Churches that are not in communion with Rome, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East, are Churches in the proper sense and sister Churches of the Catholic particular Churches, but since communion with the Roman Pontiff is one of the internal constitutive principles of a particular Church, they lack <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> condition, while on the other hand the existing division means that the fullness of universality that is proper to the Church governed by the successor of St Peter and the bishops in communion with him is not now realised in history.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} during their appearance at Rock in Rio in September 2017, Noodles and Holland {{talked about the}} new Offspring album, with the former commenting, [...] "We've got a few songs already done. We wanna do a couple more, and we definitely want to get something out soon. Our fans have waited long enough, I think, so we wanna get <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I think I want to do like an EP. It's kind of what people are doing these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us {{so we have a}} few songs together and I'm hoping to get something out by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there. He also stated that the band is no hurry to finish the album.|$|E

2500|$|Problems with {{dentures}} {{may arise}} because patients {{are not used}} to having <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> mouth that is not food. The brain senses the appliance and interprets it as 'food', sending messages to the salivary glands to produce more saliva and to secrete it at a higher rate. This usually only happens in the first 12 to 24 hours, after which the salivary glands return to their normal output. [...] New dentures can also be the cause of sore spots as they compress the denture-bearing soft tissues (mucosa). [...] A few denture adjustments in the days following insertion of the dentures can take care of this problem. [...] is another problem encountered by a minority of patients. [...] At times, {{this may be due to}} a denture that is too loose, too thick or extended too far posteriorly onto the soft palate. [...] At times, gagging may also be attributed to psychological denial of the denture. Psychological gagging is the most difficult to treat since it is out of the dentist's control. [...] In such cases, an implant-supported palateless denture may have to be constructed. Sometimes there could be a gingivitis infection under the completed dentures, caused by the accumulation of dental plaque. One of the most common problems for wearers of new upper complete denture is a loss of taste sensations.|$|E
