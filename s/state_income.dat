He previously owned a penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Trump World Tower. Regarding his official residence, Jeter settled a tax {{dispute with the}} New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in 2008. New York State alleged that Jeter should have paid <b>state</b> <b>income</b> tax from 2001 to 2003, as Jeter resided in the Manhattan apartment he bought in 2001; Jeter claimed to have established his residence in Tampa, Florida, in 1994 {{and that he was}} still a resident of Florida at the time. Florida has no <b>state</b> <b>income</b> tax.|$|E

50|$|A <b>stated</b> <b>income</b> loan is a {{mortgage}} where the lender does not verify the borrower's income {{by looking at}} their pay stubs, W-2 (employee income) forms, income tax returns, or other records. Instead, borrowers are simply asked to <b>state</b> their <b>income,</b> and taken at their word. These loans are sometimes called liar loans or liar's loans. <b>Stated</b> <b>income</b> loans were originated by Ameriquest.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stated</b> <b>income</b> {{loans are}} still offered {{typically}} by small local banks.

5|$|After {{a decade}} out of politics, Willis was chosen without {{opposition}} as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1943. Infighting among the state's Democrats combined with Willis's popular proposal {{to eliminate the}} <b>state</b> <b>income</b> tax carried him to a narrow victory over J. Lyter Donaldson. Willis was opposed by Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the Kentucky General Assembly. The end of World War II in 1945 brought sizable budget surpluses to the state, and disagreements over how to spend the excess funds spilled over into special legislative sessions. Willis was not able to realize his campaign promise of eliminating the <b>state</b> <b>income</b> tax because the legislature expanded the budget far beyond what he proposed. Nevertheless, he was able to forge a record of modest accomplishments, including constructing five tuberculosis hospitals across the state and significantly increasing funding for education. Following his term as governor, he served on various state boards and commissions, but failed in his only attempt to return to elective officea 1952 campaign against Bert T. Combs to return to the Court of Appeals. Willis died on April 1, 1965, and is interred at Frankfort Cemetery in the capital city of Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{economic}} times marked Brown's term in office. During his tenure, the state's unemployment rate climbed from 5.6 percent to 11.7 percent. Brown {{stuck to his}} campaign promise not to raise taxes. When <b>state</b> <b>income</b> fell short of expectations, he reduced the state budget by 22 percent and {{cut the number of}} state employees from 37,241 to 30,783, mostly through transfer and attrition. At the same time, his merit pay policies increased salaries for the remaining employees by an average of 34 percent. He cut the executive office staff from ninety-seven to thirty, and sold seven of the state's eight government airplanes.|$|E
50|$|Ameriquest {{was one of}} the United States' largest sub-prime {{mortgage}} lenders {{until it}} was shut down in September 2007. Its loan origination practices were {{at the heart of the}} Financial crisis of 2007-2010. Ameriquest promoted the <b>stated</b> <b>income</b> loan, which allowed potential borrowers to <b>state</b> their <b>income</b> without any process of verification. Many of these <b>stated</b> <b>income</b> loans were the catalyst to the ultimate failure of Ameriquest itself, and a key factor in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.|$|R

5|$|Collins {{followed}} up her {{success in the}} 1985 special session with a push for more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers obliged by approving an additional $100million for {{higher education in the}} biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' request for an additional $3.9million to improve the state's vocational education system. Legislators approved calling a referendum on a constitutional amendment– supported by Collins– to make the state superintendent of education an appointive, rather than elective, office. The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a Collins-led campaign in favor of it. The increased corporate tax intended {{to cover the cost of}} the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the <b>state</b> <b>income</b> tax was abandoned when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of <b>state</b> <b>income</b> tax rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation}} in per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

5|$|Until the Song dynasty took {{advantage}} of a large rebellion within the Liao Kingdom in 1125, the Song had to conduct cordial relations with the Liao. Skilled ambassadors were sent on missions to court the Liao and maintain peace, such as the renowned horologist, engineer, and state minister Su Song. The Song also prepared for armed conflict, increasing the overall size {{of the armed forces}} to a million soldiers by 1022. By that time, however, the military was consuming three-quarters of the tax revenues gathered by the state, compared to a mere 2 or 3 percent of <b>state</b> <b>income</b> that would be consumed by just providing the Liao with tribute. Due to these circumstances, intense political rivalries would later arise in the Song court over how to handle these issues.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William's {{excise tax}} (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the <b>state</b> <b>income</b> increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{was happy}} to take over Abir's {{concession}} as the State had built up sufficient income {{to be able to}} afford to run tax collections by itself. In addition the Free State was embarrassed by the continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover in the hope that the Free State would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the Free State in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders that he expected exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the Free State dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. <b>State</b> <b>income</b> was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still making a profit by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure.|$|E

25|$|The states {{effectively}} {{lost the}} ability to raise income tax during the Second World War. In 1942, Canberra invoked its Constitutional taxation power (s. 51 (ii)) and enacted the Income Tax Act and three other statutes to levy a uniform income tax across the country. These acts sought to raise the funds necessary to meet burgeoning wartime expenses and reduce the unequal tax burden between the states by replacing <b>state</b> <b>income</b> taxes with a centralised tax system. The legislation could not expressly prohibit <b>state</b> <b>income</b> taxes (s. 51(ii) does not curtail the power of states to levy taxes) but the federal government's proposal made localised income tax extremely difficult politically. The federal government offered instead compensatory grants authorised by s. 96 of the Constitution for the loss of <b>state</b> <b>income</b> (State Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942).|$|E
