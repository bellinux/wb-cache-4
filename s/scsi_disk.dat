A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for <b>SCSI</b> <b>Disk</b> Mode.

50|$|Originally called <b>SCSI</b> <b>Disk</b> Mode, {{a special}} cable (SCSI System Cable) allowed the {{original}} PowerBook series to attach to a desktop Mac as an external <b>SCSI</b> <b>disk.</b> A unique system control {{panel on the}} PowerBook was used to select a non-conflicting SCSI ID number from the host Mac.This also {{made it possible to}} select the disk in the Startup control panel and boot up from it.|$|E

50|$|With {{the change}} to IDE drives {{starting}} with the PowerBook 150 and 190, Apple implemented HD Target Mode, which essentially enabled <b>SCSI</b> <b>Disk</b> Mode by translating the external SCSI commands via the ATA driver. Officially reserved for Apple's portables only, all PowerBooks exclusively supported disk mode except the 140, 145, 145B, 150 and 170. However, <b>SCSI</b> <b>Disk</b> Mode can be implemented unofficially on any Macintosh with an external SCSI port, by suspending the startup process with the interrupt switch, as long as all internal drives on the chain can be set to different IDs than the active host system's devices.|$|E

5000|$|All SGI Indigo² {{models can}} {{accommodate}} two 3.5" [...] sized <b>SCSI</b> <b>disk</b> drives and one 5.25" [...] sized SCSI CD-ROM drive inside bays {{on the front}} of the machine, using specially designed Indigo2 drive sleds with proprietary connectors. All of three drive bays are easily accessed when removing the stylish and recognisable Indigo2 front bezel. The internal SCSI bus speed of the Indigo2 is about 10Mbyte/s. The usual hard disk devices used by the manufacturer were narrow or SCSI-1 5200rpm and 7200rpm drives. All of the Indigo2 drive sleds have classic 50 pin female SCSI-1 connector + standard 4 pin power connector. Advanced U160 and U320 <b>SCSI</b> <b>disk</b> drives can also be used but then one needs appropriate adapters (80/68pin to 50pin SCSI).|$|E
