25|$|The coins of Phanes {{are known}} to be amongst the {{earliest}} of Greek coins, a hemihekte of the issue was found in the foundation deposit of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (the oldest deposit of electrum coins discovered). One assumption is that Phanes was a wealthy merchant, another that this coin is associated with Apollo-Phanes and, due to the Deer, with Artemis (twin sister of the god of light Apollo-Phaneos). Although only seven Phanes type coins were discovered, it is also notable that 20% of all early electrum coins also have the lion of Artemis and the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> of Apollo-Phaneos.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} 1954 specifications of {{the award}} was a circle made of gold [...] in diameter with a centred <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> design on the obverse side. The text [...] "Bharat Ratna", in Devanagari Script, is inscribed on the upper edge in silver gilt with a wreath set along on the lower edge. A platinum State Emblem of India {{was placed in the}} centre of the reverse side with the national motto, [...] "Satyameva Jayate" [...] (Truth alone triumphs) in Devanagari Script, inscribed in silver-gilt on the lower edge.|$|E
500|$|A year later, {{the design}} was modified. The current medal {{is in the}} shape of a peepal leaf, {{approximately}} [...] long, [...] wide and [...] thick and rimmed in platinum. The embossed <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> design, made of platinum, on the obverse side of the medal has a diameter of [...] with rays spreading out from [...] to [...] from the center of the Sun. The words [...] "Bharat Ratna" [...] on the obverse side remained the same as the 1954 design as did the emblem of India and [...] "Satyameva Jayate" [...] on the reverse side. A [...] white ribbon is attached to the medal so it can be worn around the neck. In 1957, the silver-gilt decoration was changed to burnished bronze. The Bharat Ratna medals are produced at Alipore Mint, Kolkata along with the other civilian and military awards like Padma Vibushan, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri, and Param Veer Chakra.|$|E

60|$|Night drew on and {{the setting}} <b>sun,</b> <b>bursting</b> through the {{envelope}} of cloud, filled earth and sky with fire, and it came into Rachel's heart, she knew not whence, that fire was near, that soon it would swallow up all this place.|$|R
6000|$|... [The heavy sky {{begins to}} clear {{with the full}} arrival of the [...] morning. The <b>sun</b> <b>bursts</b> out, and the {{previously}} dark and gloomy [...] masses glitter in the rays. It is now seven o'clock, and with the [...] shining of the sun, the battle is resumed.|$|R
60|$|All waited impatiently {{and watched}} the sky. When it was a quarter to twelve the clouds rolled away to the eastward, and the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> forth with {{dazzling}} brightness.|$|E
60|$|The new <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> {{upon them}} as they topped a grassy hill. The dew-bespangled blades scintillated beneath the {{gorgeous}} rays which would presently sweep them away again into the nothingness from which they had sprung.|$|E
60|$|A little cloud then cloaked us, {{and there}} flew an irised rain, And the Atlantic dyed its levels {{with a dull}} misfeatured stain, And then the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> out again, and purples prinked the main.|$|E

60|$|January 10.--When I rose {{this morning}} the weather was changed and the ground covered with snow. I am sure it's winter fairly. We {{returned}} from Mertoun after breakfast through an incipient snowstorm, coming on partially, and in great flakes, the <b>sun</b> <b>bursting</b> at intervals through the clouds. At last Die Wolken laufen zusammen. We made a slow journey of it through the swollen river and heavy roads, but here we are at last.|$|R
60|$|Then the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> forth, {{flooding}} {{all with}} a golden radiance that was magical in its gorgeous effects. Patsy came on deck and stood beside her uncle, lost in rapturous admiration. Beth soon followed her.|$|E
60|$|His {{last words}} were still ringing {{in my ears}} as I entered my room, and undrew the window-curtains, {{just in time to}} see the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> in glory from his ocean-prison, and clothe the world in the light of a new day.|$|E
60|$|There, as they kneeled, {{and as the}} old man blessed them, {{the setting}} <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> forth from mists, gilded the island round about, shed rays upon their heads, and went down in a glory--all the East radiant with red burnings, like an altar-fire.|$|E
6000|$|... {{so lovely}} Morning soon fades. The <b>sun</b> <b>bursts</b> {{up from behind}} the main, a fierce enemy, a foe that will force every one to crouch before him. He dyes the sky orange, and the sea [...] "incarnadine," [...] where its violet surface is stained by his rays, and he mercilessly puts to flight the mists and haze and the little agate-coloured masses of cloud that were before {{floating}} in the firmament. The atmosphere is so clear that {{now and then a}} planet is visible. For the two ...|$|R

60|$|So Marius looked, methinks, and Cromwell so, Not in {{the purple}} born, to those they led Nearer {{for that and}} costlier to the foe, New moulders of old forms, by nature bred The exhaustless life of manhood's seeds to show, Let but the ploughshare of portentous times Strike deep enough to reach them where they lie; Despair and danger are their {{fostering}} climes, And their best <b>sun</b> <b>bursts</b> from a stormy sky: He was our man of men, nor would abate The utmost due manhood could claim of fate.|$|R
6000|$|He looked {{without seeing}} anything--thinking of himself. Before his eyes {{the light of}} the rising <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> above the forest with the suddenness of an explosion.

60|$|By {{one o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> through the mist and an hour later the entire river was clear, so that they could see steamboats and sailboats a long distance off. The captain of the tug brought forth his spyglass and they took turns in looking through the instrument.|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> forth {{in all his}} golden glory. Water, earth, and sky glowed {{as if they had}} been set on fire. What a blessed {{influence}} the sun has upon this world! It resembles the countenance of a loving father beaming in upon his family, driving away clouds, and diffusing warmth and joy.|$|E
60|$|About {{five o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} we rolled into Darbyville. While crossing the Pass River the <b>sun</b> had <b>burst</b> through the clouds, and now all was as bright and fresh as ever.|$|R
5000|$|George Bower (or Bowers) (fl. 1664-1689), was a medallist to King Charles II, James II and William III, and an {{engraver}} to the Royal Mint.Although {{his work}} displays considerable skill it is inferior in finish and execution {{to that of}} the Roettiers, well-known medallists of the same period. The most interesting of Bower's medals may be the specimen struck to commemorate the acquittal of the Earl of Shaftesbury of high treason. It has a bust of the earl on the obverse; on the reverse is the legend [...] "LÃ¦tamur, 24 Nov. 1681", and a view of London with the <b>sun</b> <b>bursting</b> from behind a cloud.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{we shall}} be paid for it," [...] cried Will, {{clapping}} her hands with the double delight of telling {{the best part of}} her story, and seeing Jimmy's sober face clear suddenly as if the <b>sun</b> had <b>burst</b> forth with great brilliancy.|$|R
60|$|But the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> up {{from the}} plain, the prairie-chickens took up their mighty chorus on the hills, robins met them on the way, flocks of wild geese, honking cheerily, drove far {{overhead}} toward the north, and, with these sounds of a golden spring day in her ears, the bride grew cheerful, and laughed.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{almost as}} {{suddenly}} as it began, the storm ceased. The hail stopped, the thunder rolled and muttered away to the eastward, and the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> out merry and radiant over a world so changed that it seemed an absurd thing {{to think that a}} scant three quarters of an hour could have effected such a transformation.|$|E
60|$|While he ate, {{the sun set}} {{beyond a}} dip in the rim of the curved wall. As the morning <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> wondrously through a grand arch into this valley, in a golden, {{slanting}} shaft, so the evening sun, at the moment of setting, shone through a gap of cliffs, sending down a broad red burst to brighten the oval with a blaze of fire. To Venters both sunrise and sunset were unreal.|$|E
60|$|They soon {{entered a}} winding {{path through the}} wood which was the {{background}} of their dwelling. Lady Annabel was silent, and lost in her reflections; Venetia plucked the beautiful wild hyacinths that then abounded in the wood in such profusion, that their beds spread like patches of blue enamel, and gave them to Mistress Pauncefort, who, as the collection increased, handed {{them over to the}} groom; who, in turn, deposited them in the wicker seat prepared for his young mistress. The bright <b>sun</b> <b>bursting</b> through the tender foliage of the year, the clear and genial air, the singing of the birds, and the wild and joyous exclamations of Venetia, as she gathered her flowers, made it a cheerful party, notwithstanding the silence of its mistress.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately {{it was a}} {{short-lived}} gale. When it had passed away and the sea had returned to something like its former quiescent state, and the <b>sun</b> had <b>burst</b> through and dissipated the grey clouds, our female voyagers returned to the deck and to their wonted condition of health.|$|R

60|$|And {{the rain}} did what Tarzan {{knew that it}} would do--it wiped the spoor of the quarry {{from the face of the}} earth. For a half hour the torrents fell--then the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> forth, jeweling the forest with a million scintillant gems; but today the ape-man, usually alert to the {{changing}} wonders of the jungle, saw them not. Only the fact that the spoor of Teeka and her abductor was obliterated found lodgment in his thoughts.|$|E
60|$|Woot {{was so busy}} {{watching}} a score of lovely maidens--sisters of Polychrome--who were leaning {{over the edge of}} the bow, and another score who danced gaily amid the radiance of the splendid hues, that he did not notice he was growing big again.

60|$|The weather cleared before morning. Red {{and bright}} the <b>sun</b> <b>burst</b> {{out of the}} east to flood that low basin land with light. Jean found that Queen had {{traveled}} on and on, hoping, no doubt, to regain what he had lost. But in the darkness he had climbed to the manzanita slopes instead of back up the canyon. And here he had fought the hold of that strange brush of Spanish name until he fell exhausted.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had crossed}} the road {{dividing}} the Gardens from the Park, and, seeing that Mr. Stone had already seen the water where {{he was about to}} bathe, and would now see nothing else, Hilary stopped beside a little lonely birch-tree. This wild, small, graceful visitor, who had long bathed in winter, was already draping her bare limbs in a scarf of green. Hilary leaned against her cool, pearly body. Below were the chilly waters, now grey, now starch-blue, and the pale forms of fifteen or twenty bathers. While he stood shivering in the frozen wind, the <b>sun,</b> <b>bursting</b> through the hail-cloud, burned his cheeks and hands. And suddenly he heard, clear, but far off, the sound which, of all others, stirs the hearts of men: [...] "Cuckoo, cuckoo!" ...|$|R

6000|$|But a scene ensued {{like that}} in the hall of Seyd. All who {{attempted}} to obey the command of the incensed despot fell back from the Fakir, as they would from the Angel of Death. He flung his cap and fictitious beard on the ground, and the incensed countenance of Tippoo was subdued in an instant, when he encountered the stern and awful eye of his father. A sign dismissed him from the throne, which Hyder himself ascended, while the official menials hastily disrobed him of his tattered cloak, and flung on him a robe of regal splendour, and placed on his head a jewelled turban. The Durbar rung with acclamations to Hyder Ali Khan Behauder, [...] "the good, the wise, the discoverer of hidden things, who cometh into the Divan like the <b>sun</b> <b>bursting</b> from the clouds." ...|$|R
