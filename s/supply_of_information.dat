500|$|The Lancastrian {{regime was}} founded and legitimised by formal lying {{that was both}} public and official. This has been {{described}} as [...] "a series of unconstitutional actions" [...] based [...] "upon three major acts of perjury". The historian K.B. McFarlane found it hard [...] "to think of another moment of comparable importance in medieval English political history when the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> was so effectively manipulated as it was by Henry IV on this occasion". The Lancastrians patronised poets for panegyric purposes for years before Henry IV ascended the throne, including Geoffrey Chaucer who dedicated The Book of the Duchess to Blanche of Lancaster around 1368. In 1400, poets in the pay of Henry IV were directed to propaganda purposes. John Gower based his Cronica Tripertita on the official Lancastrian accounts of the usurpation:"The Record and Process of the Deposition of Richard II" [...] from 1399. Gower also produced a number of further favourable works including [...] "In praise of peace" [...] which was dedicated to Henry IV.|$|E
500|$|Having {{built up}} a fortune in {{newspapers}} and purchased apartment buildings in the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, McBride in 1930 went into business for himself. In 1931, he bought a majority stake in Cleveland's Zone Cab Company, which later merged with the Yellow Cab Company to form the city's biggest taxi operator. He also had taxi businesses in Akron and Canton, two cities southeast of Cleveland. As his taxi businesses prospered, McBride invested in real estate in Cleveland, Chicago and Florida. In the late 1930s, he leveraged his newspaper connections to launch a wire service that supplied bookmakers {{with the results of}} horse races. This put him in contact with organized crime figures who were behind gambling operations that relied on such services. He invested in the Continental Press and Empire News, both based in Cleveland and run by mobsters Morris [...] "Mushy" [...] Wexler and Sam [...] "Gameboy" [...] Miller. James Ragen, another friend and associate in the wire business, was murdered in 1946 in a Chicago gangland feud. A federal grand jury in 1940 indicted 18 people, including McBride and Wexler, over the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> used in gambling. [...] The allegations were based on federal laws that forbade interstate transmission of lottery results; prosecutors treated the race results as lottery lists. He was never arrested or tried over his role in the business, however.|$|E
500|$|During the American Civil War, Gray was a steadfast {{supporter}} of the North and the Republican Party. About February 1861two months before the war started, Gray lost part of his left thumb, just above {{the base of the}} nail, in an accident in the garden. Despite now being 50 years old, he regretted that this accident ended his [...] "fighting days". After hostilities began, he joined a company that guarded the Massachusetts State Arsenal in Cambridge. He also bought war bonds, was surprised more people did not do likewise, and supported a 5%tax to support the war. Gray regretted not having children because he had [...] "no son to send to the war". Gray considered Abraham Lincoln as a second George Washington {{because of the way he}} managed to preserve the Union during the war. He also predicted that the fate of slavery depended upon the length and bitterness of the war, and the longer it lasted the more disastrous it would be for the South. As a corollary, he felt that if the South had given up early in the war, they would have had a chance of preserving slavery longer. Regarding his botanical endeavors, the war sundered his <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and specimens from the South. Even the Southern botanists who supported the North, such as Alvan Wentworth Chapman and Thomas Minott Peters, were soon forced to cease communications with Gray. It was during the war that Gray first began to think of retiring from his professorial duties so he could concentrate on completing Flora of North America.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{attempts}} to highlight {{some of the}} characteristics of present-day literary criticism in Spain: its social invisibility and public inoperability, the measured tone (rather muttered and descriptive), the absence of a strong dose of moral commitment {{on the part of the}} critics.
