5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image</b> compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E

25|$|Because {{multimodality}} {{is continually}} evolving from a solely print-based to a screen-based presentation, {{the speaker and}} audience relationship evolves as well. Due to the growing presence of digital media over the last decade, the central mode of representation {{is no longer just}} text; recently, the use of imagery has become more prominent. In its current use for Internet and network-based composition, the term “multimodality” has become even more prevalent, applying to various forms of text such as fine art, literature, social media and advertising. An important related term to multimodality is multiliteracy, which is the comprehension of different modes in communication – not only to read text, but also to read other modes such as <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image.</b> Whether and how a message is understood is accredited to multiliteracy.|$|E

500|$|Fans, critics, and {{the band}} {{have come to see}} Sad Wings of Destiny as the album on which Judas Priest {{consolidated}} their <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image.</b> [...] Martin Popoff cites the album's [...] "reinvention" [...] of the heavy metal genre. [...] The technical dexterity and operatic vocals pointed toward trends in heavy metal that later in the decade New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands such as Iron Maiden were to follow, and the album's dark themes reappeared in the 1980s American thrash metal, such as in the music of Slayer and Metallica. [...] An early sign of the band's influence was that Van Halen included [...] "Victim of Changes" [...] in their sets before achieving fame. [...] Dave Mustaine of Megadeth relates that his father-in-law punched him in the face for listening to Sad Wings of Destiny; Mustaine called this a turning point, where he chose heavy metal as a career as [...] "revenge".|$|E
500|$|The title {{stems from}} a comment by Dave Mustaine's former Metallica bandmate Lars Ulrich, who {{suggested}} to Mustaine that he should take more [...] "risks" [...] with his music. According to Mustaine, he was also encouraged to experiment by Marty Friedman’s desire to indulge in his pop sensibilities. On the other hand, newcomer Jimmy DeGrasso {{wanted to do a}} [...] "heavy record", unlike the rest of the band who wanted to try out something different. As bassist David Ellefson recalls, the band's manager Bud Prager had told them that they needed [...] "to do something that will make all of their contemporaries knock themselves on the head and say, 'Why didn't we think of that'?". This decision resulted in mixed reviews for both the band and the album; a good portion did not favor the new <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image,</b> while others were more receptive to the band's attempts at experimenting with their sound and trying something different.|$|E
500|$|But Gaga {{addressed}} the viewer {{directly in the}} video while singing the song, which led Moralde to deduce that [...] "She's not in the moment, but is instead playing a feminized role in a dreamlike space; this quality is accentuated by the bright and blown-out color palette, and the numerous shots of Gaga in bed or sleeping. The cumulative effect is that it asserts the Lady Gaga of the previous videos {{to be the real}} one, and the Gaga in 'Eh, Eh' is a character that she is playing." [...] His view was shared by Chris Kingston from The Harvard Crimson who noted during the release of the music video for Gaga's 2010 single [...] "Telephone", that the video shows [...] "the crazy party girl we know [...] actually has a weirdly girlish, domestic side." [...] In The Oxford Handbook of <b>Sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>Image</b> in Digital Media, author Carol Vernallis divided Gaga's persona into three categories. The personality portrayed in the [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] video was named as [...] "Friendly Peer" [...] archetype; someone with a girl-next-door image and approachable behavior.|$|E

Negra argues that Cher's [...] "flamboyant and self-authored body" [...] {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "the possibility of self-transformation". In addition, her voice, heard via songs like [...] "Walking in Memphis", is associated with the idea of [...] "circumvent patriarchy." [...] Negra notes that Cher's music is used in scenes during The Great Mutato's sexual encounters with women. Negra asserts that [...] "this juxtaposition of <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image</b> cues our perception that we have entered the realm of carnival where the normal order of things is inverted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club reasons that the ending was not the actual conclusion of the episode, but rather the fanciful and elaborate happy ending that was concocted by Izzy Berkowitz, the writer of the comic book, after talking to Mulder. In this manner, VanDerWeff notes, [...] "the episode abandons logic and reality and, {{for lack of a better}} word, transcends." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com postulates that the entire episode never happened [...] "rom a canonical perspective" [...] due to the entry's comic book setting, the various meta-references and the [...] "happy ending".|$|E

Two months later, the Music Machine, who reached the top 20 with fuzz guitar-driven [...] "Talk Talk",} had a <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image</b> that helped pave the way for later acts such as the Ramones. [...] The Syndicate of Sound's [...] "Little Girl", which featured a cocksure half-spoken lead vocal set over chiming 12-string guitar chords, reached No.8 on the Billboard charts and was later covered by acts such as the Dead Boys, the Banned, and the Chesterfield Kings. [...] Discovered by a Pittsburgh disc jockey in 1965, the resulting success of [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] by a defunct group, the Shondells, whose membership included Tommy James, revived James' career, where he assembled a new group under the name Tommy James and the Shondells.

Billboard wrote that Duff's [...] "continued evolution in <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image</b> ... may have resulted in her losing some of her much younger fans." [...] The album has sold a total of 412,000 copies in the US by June, 2015. The album debuted at number twenty-five in the UK with first-week sales of over 8,000 copies. The album spent three weeks in the top seventy-five of the UK Albums Chart. Dignity broke Duff's streak of consecutive number-one debuts in Canada, entering the albums chart at number three with 20,000 copies sold. In response, Duff said she [...] "couldn't be happier" [...] and felt lucky that Dignity sold the amount it did, noting the state of the marketplace and the moderate sales figures for other albums that week. The album debuted at number seventeen on the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia, selling roughly 2,300 copies in its first week.

The same year she received two Grammy Award nominations—Best R Vocal Performance, Female and Best R Song for [...] "That's The Way Love Goes"—winning Best R Song. Several critics asserted she was unjustly {{overlooked in the}} Grammy's three major categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the Year. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated, [...] "Jackson again was denied a nomination for album of the year, even though 'janet' (Virgin) has remained in the Top 10 since its release last summer and has been critically acclaimed." [...] He adds that [...] "the oversight is doubly vexing, because —in a songwriting and production partnership with Jimmy Jam (aka James Harris III) and Terry Lewis—is not just a multiplatinum pop act but an artist who has reshaped the <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image</b> of rhythm and blues over the last decade." [...] Kot laid blame to the oversight {{on the fact that}} many believed her to be a producer-dependent artist—an opinion he found to be in error. Similarly, producer Jimmy Jam stated: [...] "It's easy to say that the two albums she did before she met us weren't successful and when she got with us she became successful... 'Control' was the first album she actually had input. I think that's just as significant as the fact we (Jam and Lewis) did the record." ...|$|E

[...] Cabin also felt that [...] "the show’s use of <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image</b> to infer or suggest {{as much as any}} line of dialogue...continues to set this series apart from its half-measured kin." [...] He added that the season [...] "goes to great lengths to make the stakes of" [...] the moral and ethical issues, as seen by pitting Daredevil's methods against the Punisher, [...] "intensely involving and thrilling," [...] while also praising the action sequences of the season and the [...] "streamlined focus on character in the writing", claiming that [...] "none of the [...] films have even an iota of the seductive intimacy and heart of this show." [...] Dennis Perkins writing for The A.V. Club awarded the season a [...] "B+", missing D’Onofrio’s [...] "towering menace as Wilson Fisk", but feeling that Bernthal and Yung [...] "make Castle and Elektra an effective season-long two-pronged assault on Matt Murdock’s heroic identity, which gives Daredevils supporting characters a clearer purpose as well." [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler, after reviewing all the episodes of season two individually, gave the season a 9.3 out of 10, saying that it [...] "excelled at both action and story while giving us a more complex and layered season than the first....Gone was a notable 'main villain', but instead we were given fantastic performances by not only the main cast but by newcomers Jon Bernthal and Elodie Yung." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{music has}} {{encompassed}} {{a broad range}} of genres. Her records from the 1980s have been described as being influenced by Prince, as her producers are ex-members of The Time. Sal Cinquemani wrote that in addition to defining Top 40 radio, she [...] "gave Prince's Minneapolis sound a distinctly feminine—and, with songs like 'What Have You Done for Me Lately?,' 'Nasty,' 'Control,' and 'Let's Wait Awhile,' a distinctly feminist—spin." [...] On Control, Richard J. Ripani documented that she, Jam and Lewis had [...] "crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility." [...] Author Rickey Vincent stated that she has often been credited for redefining the standard of popular music with the industrial-strength beats of the album. She is considered a trendsetter in pop balladry, with Richard Rischar stating [...] "the black pop ballad of the mid-1980s had been dominated by the vocal and production style that was smooth and polished, led by singers Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and James Ingram." [...] Jackson continued her musical development by blending pop and urban music with elements of hip-hop in the nineties. This included a softer representation, articulated by lush, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance beats. She is described by music critic Greg Kot as [...] "an artist who has reshaped the <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>image</b> of rhythm and blues" [...] within the first decade of her career. Critic Karla Peterson remarked that [...] "she is a sharp dancer, an appealing performer, and as 'That's the Way Love Goes' proves—an ace pop-song writer." [...] Selected material from the following decade has been viewed less favorably, as Sal Cinquemani comments [...] "except for maybe R.E.M., no other former superstar act has been as prolific with such diminishing commercial and creative returns." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cortical}} {{integration of}} auditory and visual features {{is crucial for}} efficient object recognition. Previous {{studies have shown that}} audiovisual (AV) integration is affected by where and when auditory and visual features occur. However, because relatively {{little is known about the}} impact of what is integrated, we here investigated the impact of semantic congruency and object familiarity on the neural correlates of AV integration. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify regions involved in the integration of both (congruent and incongruent) familiar animal <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> of arbitrary combinations of unfamiliar artificial <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> object <b>images.</b> Unfamiliar object <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> were integrated in the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), possibly reflecting learning of novel AV associations. Integration of familiar, but semantically incongruent combinations also correlated with IFC activation and additionally involved the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). For highly familiar semantically congruent AV pairings, we again found AV integration effects in pSTS and additionally in superior temporal gyrus. These findings demonstrate that the neural correlates of object-related AV integration reflect both semantic congruency and familiarity of the integrated <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R
