50|$|There {{are three}} primary types of solid {{supports}}: gel-type supports, <b>surface-type</b> supports, and composites. Gel-type supports are highly solvated polymers {{with an equal}} distribution of functional groups. This type of support is the most common, and includes polystyrene (styrene cross-linked with 1-2% divinylbenzene), polyacrylamide (hydrophilic alternative to polystyrene), polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEG-polystyrene (PEG-PS) is more stable than polystyrene and spaces the site of synthesis from the polymer backbone), and PEG-based supports composed of a PEG-polypropylene glycol network or PEG with polyamide or polystyrene. <b>Surface-type</b> supports: Many materials {{have been developed for}} surface functionalization, including controlled pore glass, cellulose fibers, and highly cross-linked polystyrene. Composites are gel-type polymers supported by rigid matrices.|$|E

50|$|Of the 35 {{nuclear tests}} in Operation Hardtack I, four were surface burst shots: Cactus, Koa, Quince and Fig. These tests took place from May to August 1958, {{all at the}} Enewetak Atoll. Surface tests {{inherently}} present the potential for more radioactive exposure issues than the high-altitude or underwater detonations. This is because there is more material present to be converted to radioactive debris by excess neutrons due to the proximity to the Earth’s surface, and due to the soil and other minerals excavated from the craters created by these blasts. The existence of this extra material allows for larger radioactive particles to be created and lifted into the blast cloud, falling {{back to the surface}} as fallout.Though surface and near-surface tests have a higher probability of radioactive exposure problems, the radioactive elements have significantly shorter residence times when injected into the atmosphere. As radioactive clouds from <b>surface-type</b> tests reach heights of around 20 kilometers at maximum, and thus cannot extend higher than the lower stratosphere, the residence times can be up to 13 years less than the high-altitude blasts. During original concept planning in 1954, Enewetak {{was supposed to be the}} location of the smaller tests conducted during Operation Hardtack I. Due to poor weather conditions and policy changes in 1958, five of the UCRL tests which were planned to be conducted at the Bikini Atoll were moved to Enewetak. This included the later two surface blast devices in the Quince and Fig tests.|$|E

To balance the difficulty and cost of producing these mirrors, the classical Wolter-I structure has previously been replaced with a conical Wolter-I structure, but {{it can lead to}} significantly poorer angular resolution. In this paper, we consider changing one of the mirror shapes (paraboloid or hyperboloid) of the Wolter-I structure to a conical mirror shape, while the other mirror shape remains a quadric <b>surface-type</b> structure, which could thus ensure the imaging quality. Based on a theoretical analysis and the results of simulations, the cone-hyperboloid and paraboloid-cone structures are found to provide the best angular resolutions, and the cone-hyperboloid structure is shorter than the paraboloid-cone structure at the focal length.

We synthesized coesite and cristobalite, and obtained natural samples of tridymite, opal-A, and opal-CT. The thermal emission spectra of these silica phases were analyzed and related to their crystal structure and crystallinity. Structural differences between the polymorphs result in unique spectral character and the degree and type of crystal ordering in opal-CT results in cristobalite-or tridymite-like spectral features. These spectra will be useful for analysis of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) data from Mars.

30|$|There {{are three}} types of {{catalysis}} of solid HPAs; surface type, bulk type I, and bulk type II catalysis. <b>Surface-type</b> catalysis is the ordinary heterogeneous catalysis, where the reactions {{take place on the}} two-dimensional surface of solid catalysts. The reaction rate is proportional to the surface area in principle. In the bulk-type (I) catalysis, e.g., acid-catalyzed reactions of polar molecules over the hydrogen forms and group A salts at relatively low temperatures, the reactant molecules are absorbed in the interpolyanion space of the ionic crystal and react there, and then the products desorbed from the solid. The solid behaves in a sense like a solution and the reaction field becomes three dimensional. Therefore, it is called “pseudoliquid” catalysis. The reaction rate is proportional to the volume of catalyst or, for example, the rate of acid-catalyzed reaction is governed by the bulk acidity. This type of catalysis has been observed not only for gas–solid but also for liquid–solid systems.|$|E

The deduced ionization potentials extrapolate precisely to the bulk work function, and the internal cluster temperatures are in close agreement with values expected for an ensemble of freely evaporating clusters. Supplementing an earlier application to potassium clusters, these results suggest that the Fowler formalism, which is straightforward and physical, may be of significant utility in metal cluster spectroscopy.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} micromorphic {{modeling of}} a granular material.

The discrete expressions for the divergence of <b>surface-type</b> quantities (fluxes) are obtained {{with the help of}} discrete–continuum analogy for the discrete balance equations. We demonstrate that the discrete formulation of stress tensor in the dynamic condition, which involves both contributions from body forces and relative particle accelerations in a macroelement, can be simply expressed in terms of contact forces and branch vectors. This study constructs complete discrete-type and continuum-type balance equations for a granular material in a macroelement and at a macroscopic point, using the discrete–continuum correspondence for these field quantities...|$|E
40|$|The {{reflection}} and transmission amplitudes of waves in disordered multimode waveguides are studied {{by means of}} numerical simulations based on the invariant embedding equations. In particular, we analyze the influence of <b>surface-type</b> disorder {{on the behavior of}} the ensemble average and fluctuations of the {{reflection and}} transmission coefficients, reflectance, transmittance, and conductance. Our results show anomalous effects stemming from the combination of mode dispersion and rough surface scattering: For a given waveguide length, the larger the mode transverse momentum is, the more strongly is the mode scattered. These effects manifest themselves in the mode selectivity of the transmission coefficients, anomalous backscattering enhancement, and speckle pattern both in reflection and transmission, reflectance and transmittance, and also in the conductance and its universal fluctuations. It is shown that, in contrast to volume impurities, surface scattering in quasi-one-dimensional structures (waveguides) gives rise to the coexistence of the ballistic, diffusive, and localized regimes within the same sample.

In terms of the fact that the shape deformability of red blood cell brings more difficulty in detecting and recognize for operating automatically, we believed that the recovered 3 D shape surface feature would give more information than traditional 2 D intensity image processing methods. This paper proposed a combined approach for complex surface segmentation of red blood cell based on shape-from-shading technique and multiscale surface fitting. By means of the image irradiance equation under SEM imaging condition, the 3 D height field could be recovered from the varied shading. Afterwards the depth maps of each point on the surfaces were applied to calculate Gaussian curvature and mean curvature, which were used to produce <b>surface-type</b> label image.

As brine flows upward past the separator, 90 percent of the brine methane is extracted while 60 percent and 19 percent of the brine carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, respectively, are extracted. The preferential extraction of methane over carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, achieves a purification of the product gas. Subsequently, the brine flows further upward and into a shallower disposal reservoir penetrated by the same wellbore; surface brine handling is entirely eliminated.
