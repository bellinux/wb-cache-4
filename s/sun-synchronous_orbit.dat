25|$|PSLV-C6 carried and {{deployed}} two Indian satellites, Cartosat-1 (a.k.a. IRS-P5) and HAMSAT {{into the}} <b>Sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbit.</b> Built by ISRO, Cartosat-1 was a stereoscopic remote sensing satellite and {{first of the}} Cartosat series of satellites. HAMSAT was a microsatellite, built for providing satellite based amateur radio satellite to the national {{as well as the}} international community of amateur radio operators (HAM).|$|E
25|$|PSLV-C6 was {{the sixth}} {{operational}} launch and overall ninth {{mission of the}} PSLV program. This launch was also the fifty-fourth launch by Indian Space Research Organisation since its first mission on 1 January 1962. The vehicle carried and injected India's two satellites; Cartosat-1 (a.k.a.

40|$|Solar sail is used {{to achieve}} a geocentric <b>sun-synchronous</b> frozen <b>orbit.</b> This kind of orbit {{combines}} the characteristics of both <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> and frozen orbits. Furthermore, the impossible orbits for a typical spacecraft such as <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> whose inclination is less than 90 ° are also possible for solar sail. To achieve a <b>sun-synchronous</b> frozen <b>orbit,</b> the characteristic acceleration of the sail is chosen properly. In addition, {{the attitude of the}} sail is adjusted to keep the sun-synchronous and frozen characteristics. The perturbations including atmosphere drag, third-body gravitational forces and shaded regions are discussed, where the atmosphere drag is cancelled by solar radiation pressure force, third-body gravitational forces have negligible effects on the orbit and the shaded region can be avoided by choosing the classical orbit elements of the sail. At last, a numerical example is employed to validate the sun-synchronous frozen characteristics of the sail...|$|R

25|$|Retrograde orbit: An orbit with an {{inclination}} of {{more than}} 90°. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbit,</b> few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them {{is much greater than}} for a prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude.|$|E
25|$|Indian Remote Sensing {{satellites}} (IRS) are {{a series}} of earth observation satellites, built, launched and maintained by ISRO. The IRS series provides remote sensing services to the country. The Indian Remote Sensing Satellite system is the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites for civilian use in operation today in the world. All the satellites are placed in polar <b>Sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> and provide data in a variety of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions to enable several programmes to be undertaken relevant to national development. The initial versions are composed of the 1 (A, B, C, D) nomenclature. The later versions are named based on their area of application including OceanSat, CartoSat, ResourceSat.|$|E
500|$|Landsat 2 is {{the second}} {{satellite}} of the Landsat program. The spacecraft originally carried a designation of ERTS-B (Earth Resource Technology Satellite B) but was renamed [...] "Landsat 2" [...] prior to its launch on January 22, 1975. The objective of the satellite was to acquire global, seasonal data in medium resolution from a near-polar, <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbit.</b> The satellite, built by General Electric, acquired data with the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS).

Opened in 1997, it is operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), {{a joint venture}} between Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace and the Norwegian Space Centre (NSC). SvalSat and KSAT's Troll Satellite Station (TrollSat) in Antarctica are the only ground stations that can see a low altitude polar orbiting satellite (e.g., in <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbit)</b> on every revolution as the earth rotates.

40|$|Exploration of {{the inner}} planets of the Solar System is vital to {{significantly}} enhance {{the understanding of the}} formulation of the Earth and other planets. This paper therefore considers the development of novel orbits of Mars, Mercury and Venus to enhance the opportunities for remote sensing of these planets. Continuous acceleration is used to extend the critical inclination of highly elliptical orbits at each planet and is shown to require modest thrust magnitudes. This paper also presents the extension of existing <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> around Mars. However, unlike Earth and Mars, natural <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> do not exist at Mercury or Venus. This research therefore also uses continuous acceleration to enable circular and elliptical <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>orbits,</b> by ensuring that the orbit's nodal precession rate matches the planets mean orbital rate around the Sun, such that the lighting along the ground-track remains approximately constant over the mission duration. This property is useful both in terms of spacecraft design, due to the constant thermal conditions, and for comparison of images. Considerably high thrust levels are however required to enable these orbits, which are prohibitively high for orbits with inclinations around 901. These orbits therefore require some development in electric propulsion systems before becoming feasible...|$|R
