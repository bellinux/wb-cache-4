50|$|In 2013 the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) {{introduced}} the series production version of PRE-SCAN, {{but with a}} stereo camera instead of laser projectors. The system dubbed Magic Body Control is fitted with a road-sensing system (Road Surface Scan) that pre-loads the shocks for the road surface detected. Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to 130 kph mph, and it adjusts the shock damping at each wheel to account for imperfections in the road. Initially only available on 8-cylinder models and above, Magic Ride Control attempts to isolate the car's body by predicting rather than reacting to broken pavement and speed humps. The ABC has undergone major modifications for the new S-Class: the wheel damping is now continuously adjustable, the <b>spring</b> <b>strut</b> response has been improved and the pump efficiency has been further enhanced. A digital interface connects the control unit and the sensors, while the fast FlexRay bus connects the control unit and the vehicle electronics. Processing power is more than double that of the previous system.|$|E
50|$|In the ABC system, a {{computer}} detects body movement from sensors located throughout the vehicle, and controls {{the action of}} the active suspension with the use of hydraulic servomechanisms. The hydraulic pressure to the servos is supplied by a high pressure radial piston hydraulic pump. A total of 13 sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle level and supply the ABC controller with new data every ten milliseconds. Four level sensors, one at each wheel measure the ride level of the vehicle, three accelerometers measure the vertical body acceleration, one acceleration sensor measures the longitudinal and one sensor the transverse body acceleration. At each hydraulic cylinder, a pressure sensor monitors the hydraulic pressure. As the ABC controller receives and processes data, it operates four hydraulic servos, each mounted in series on a <b>spring</b> <b>strut,</b> beside each wheel. Almost instantaneously, the servo regulated suspension generates counter forces to body lean, dive and squat during various driving maneuvers. A suspension strut, consisting of a steel coil spring and a shock absorber are connected in parallel, as well as a hydraulically controlled adjusting cylinder, are located between the vehicle body and wheel. These components adjust the cylinder {{in the direction of the}} suspension strut, and change the suspension length. This creates a force which acts on the suspension and dampening of the vehicle in the frequency range up to five hertz.|$|E
40|$|Commodities are {{transferred}} between the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) crew module (CM) and service module (SM) via an external umbilical that is driven apart with spring-loaded struts after the structural connection is severed. The spring struts must operate correctly for the modules to separate safely. There was no vibration testing of strut development units scoped in the MPCV Program Plan; therefore, any design problems discovered {{as a result}} of vibration testing would not have been found until the component qualification. The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) and Lockheed Martin (LM) performed random vibration testing on a single <b>spring</b> <b>strut</b> development unit to assess its ability to withstand qualification level random vibration environments. Failure of the strut while exposed to random vibration resulted in a follow-on failure investigation, design changes, and additional development tests. This paper focuses on the results of the failure investigations including identified lessons learned and best practices to aid in future design iterations of the <b>spring</b> <b>strut</b> and to help other mechanism developers avoid similar pitfalls...|$|E

40|$|The Fraunhofer Gesellschaft is {{the largest}} {{organization}} for applied research in Europe, having a staff of some 12, 700, predominantly qualified scientists and engineers, with an annual research budget of over one billion euros. One of its current internal Market-oriented strategic preliminary research (MaVo) projects is FASPAS (Function Consolidated Adaptive Structures Combining Piezo and Software Technologies for Autonomous Systems) which aims to promote adaptive structure technology for commercial exploitation within the current main research fields of the participating FhIs, namely automotive and machine tools engineering. Under the project management of the Fraunhofer-Institute Structural Durability and System Reliability LBF the six Fraunhofer Institutes LBF, IWU, IKTS, ISC, AiS and IIS bring together their competences ranging from material sciences to system reliability, in order to clarify unanswered questions. The predominant goal is to develop and validate methods and tools to establish a closed, modular development chain for the design and realization of such active structures which shall be useful in its width and depth, i. e. for specific R&D achievements such as the actuator development (depth) {{as well as the}} complete system design and realization (width). FASPAS focuses on the development of systems and on the following scientific topics: 1.) on design and manufacturing technology for piezo components as integrable actuator/sensor semi-finished modules, 2.) on development and transducer module integration of miniaturized electronics for charge generating sensor systems, 3.) on the development of methods to analyze system reliability of active structures, 4.) on the development of autonomous software structures for flexible, low cost electronics hardware for bulk production and 5.) on the construction and validation of the complete, cost-effective development chain of function consolidated structures through application oriented demonstration structures. The research work will be oriented towards active vibration control for existing components on the basis of highly integrated, both, more or less established and highly innovative piezoelectric actuator and sensor systems in compact, cost-effective and robust design combined with advanced controllers. Within the presentation the project work will be shown using the example of one demonstration structure which is a robust interface, here for being integrated within an automotive <b>spring</b> <b>strut</b> system. The interface is designed as a modular, scalable subsystem. Being such, it can be used for similar scenarios in different technology areas e. g. for active mounting of vibration-inducing aggregates. The interface design allows for controlling uniaxial vibrations (z-direction) as well as tilting (normal to the uniaxial effect) and wobbling (rotating around the z-axis) ...|$|E

25|$|Armstrong Whitworth's chief designer, Frederick Koolhoven's first {{design to}} meet this requirement, {{probably}} designated F.K.5, was a large, single-engined tractor triplane with the middle wing having a much greater span than {{the upper and lower}} wings. The gunners were housed in two long nacelles mounted on top of the middle wing, allowing them to be seated ahead of the propeller disc, with the pilot's cockpit situated behind the wings in the slim central fuselage, giving a poor view. The undercarriage consisted of a <b>sprung</b> <b>strut</b> carrying two mainwheels underneath the engine, with two stabilsing wheels at the wingtips of the lower wing, with a tailskid just aft of the trailing edge of the lower wing. This design never flew, with the head of Armstrong Whitworth's Aircraft department, I. Fairbairn-Crawford, forbidding test flights.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 {{the model}} 210G {{introduced}} a cantilever wing replacing the strut-braced wing. Its planform {{changed to a}} constant taper from root chord to tip chord. In 1970 the 210K became the first full six-seat model. This was achieved by replacing the flat leaf-springs used for the retractable main landing gear struts (undercarriage) with tapered tubular steel struts of greater length. This allowed the tires to be nested farther {{to the rear of}} the fuselage, making room for the full-size rear seats. In 1979 the 210N model eliminated the folding doors which previously covered the two retracted main wheels. The tubular <b>spring</b> <b>struts</b> retract into shallow channels along the bottom of the fuselage and the wheels fit snugly in closed depressions on the underside of the fuselage.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{good reasons to}} use a {{framework}} when you are developing a new web application. We often here that: 	*** frameworks use known patterns that result in an easily extendable architecture 	*** frameworks result in loose couplings between different modules in the application 	*** frameworks allow developer to concentrate on business logic instead of reinventing wheels that is already reinvented several times 	*** frameworks are often thoroughly tested and contains less bugs than custom solutions But security is rarely mentioned in this setting. Our main motivation in this thesis is therefore to discuss what three popular web application frameworks do to improve the overall security level. In this thesis we have chosen to research <b>Spring,</b> <b>Struts</b> and JSF. We use them to develop small applications and test whether they are vulnerable to different types of attacks or not. We focus on attacks involving metacharacters such that SQL-injection and cross-site scripting, but also security pitfalls connected to access control and error handling. We have found out that all three frameworks do implement some metacharacter handling. Since Spring tries to fill {{the role of a}} full-stack application framework, it provides some SQL metacharacter handling to avoid SQL-injections, but we have identified some implementation weaknesses that may lead to vulnerabilities. Cross-site scripting problems are handled in both <b>Spring,</b> <b>Struts,</b> and JSF by HTML-encoding as long as custom RenderKits are not introduced in JSF. When it comes to access control, the framework support is somewhat limited. They do support a role-based access control model, but this is not sufficient in applications where domain object access is connected to users rather than roles. To improve the access control in Struts applications, we provide an overall access control design that is based on aspect-oriented programming and integrates with standard Struts config files. Hopefully, this design is generic enough to suit several application's needs, but also useable to developers such that it results in a more secure access control containing less bugs than custom solutions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mercedes-Benz has {{recently}} added a crosswind stabilization function to the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension for the 2009 S-Class. For this purpose the ABC uses the yaw rate, lateral acceleration, steering angle and velocity sensors of the Electronic Stability Program ESP to vary the wheel load distribution via the ABC <b>spring</b> <b>struts,</b> {{depending on the}} direction and intensity of the crosswind. This function has to distinguish between vehicle reactions caused by crosswind, by driver interaction, and by road unevenness. The effects of the crosswinds can be compensated in this way, or reduced to a minimum {{in the case of}} strong gusts. For developing this function Mercedes Benz used the test case generator TestWeaver to generate thousands of different driving and crosswind scenarios. The scenarios have been executed using a co-simulation of: (i) a dynamic vehicle model (based on the inhouse tool CASCaDE), (ii) a road and crosswind model implemented in C and (iii) a MathWorks/Simulink model of the crosswind stabilization function. This simulation-based approach helped considerably to validate and iteratively improve the safeguarding algorithms of the stabilization function through all design phases...|$|R
