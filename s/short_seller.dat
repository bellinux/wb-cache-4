40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> {{in the context of}} stakeholder theory and poses the question: should <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> be considered as stakeholders? The paper examines the conditions under which <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> operate and how short selling can be a profitable activity. Next the paper considers the view of <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> {{from the perspective of the}} finance literature and this perspective is contrasted with concerns which are frequently expressed in the news media about the activities of <b>short</b> <b>sellers.</b> The constraints on short selling are discussed, together with the phenomenon of optimism in analysts’ forecasts which is believed to support ‘high’ share prices. The usefulness of the preceding analysis is then discussed in the context of stakeholder theory and the paper discusses some potential policy implications in terms of corporate governance and financial reporting. The paper concludes that <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> can legitimately be regarded as stakeholders and, indeed, encouraging <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> to operate more effectively in the market as well as providing fuller disclosure of their activities could provide a useful anti-dote to some of the excessive and unjustified share price rise which have been seen in recent years in failing companies...|$|R
50|$|Short squeezes result when <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> {{cover their}} {{positions}} on a stock, resulting in buying volume that drives the stock price up. This can occur if the price has risen {{to a point where}} <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> must make margin calls, or more loosely if <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional margin calls and short covering.|$|R

40|$|We {{test the}} Chen and Singal (2003) {{hypothesis}} that speculative <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> {{add to the}} selling pressure on Mondays, and hence add to the weekend effect, by examining evidence from 60 market indices. We find strong evidence that, until about a decade ago, the actions of <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> could explain the weekend ef- fect. Recently, however, the relationship between short sales and the weekend effect is gradually dissi- pating in developed markets, {{probably due to the}} cross-market hedges of <b>short</b> <b>sellers.</b> These findings strongly support, rather than weaken, the Chen and Singal hypothesis. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the trading behavior of institutional investors and <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> around earnings announcements. The results suggest that institutional investors, {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>short</b> <b>sellers,</b> successfully anticipate earnings news. In the period immediately after the earnings announcement, both types of traders are active in the market and trade in response to the earnings announcement. In particular, <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> are quick to increase their short positions when a company releases bad news. Institutional traders also trade in response to the news; however, they take longer to react. 23 page(s...|$|R
30|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that short selling constraints bias {{upward or downward}} the security prices (Miller 1977; Jarrow 1980; Figlewski 1981). Financial theories {{on the role of}} <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> and their consequences of trading are mixed. On the one hand, <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> are considered as informed traders (Boehmer et al. 2008; Diamond and Verrecchia 1987), who move the mispriced securities closer to their fundaments by actively trading. On the other hand, trade-based manipulation schemes and predatory trading strategy of <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> move the securities prices deviated from their fundaments (Allen and Gale 1992; Brunnermeier and Pedersen 2005; Goldstein and Guembel 2008). Therefore, it is an empirical question to ask what the role of <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> in China is. The primary motivation of this paper, is the empirically findings of this rarely-concerned question.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Short</b> <b>sellers</b> were {{blamed for}} the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Regulations {{governing}} short selling were implemented in the United States in 1929 and in 1940. [...] Political fallout from the 1929 crash led Congress to enact a law banning <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> from selling shares during a downtick; this {{was known as the}} uptick rule, and this was in effect until 3 July 2007 when it was removed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC Release No. 34-55970). [...] President Herbert Hoover condemned <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> and even J. Edgar Hoover said he would investigate <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> for their role in prolonging the Depression. A few years later, in 1949, Alfred Winslow Jones founded a fund (that was unregulated) that bought stocks while selling other stocks short, hence hedging some of the market risk, and the hedge fund was born.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Short</b> <b>sellers</b> tend {{to temper}} {{overvaluation}} by selling into exuberance. [...] Likewise, <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> {{are said to}} provide price support by buying when negative sentiment is exacerbated after a significant price decline. [...] Short selling can have negative implications if it causes a premature or unjustified share price collapse when the fear of cancellation due to bankruptcy becomes contagious.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} informativeness of <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> by {{directly}} measuring the abnormal returns earned on individual short sales on the New York Stock Exchange. We find that <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> correctly predict permanent negative future returns and improve market efficiency by trading against instances of overpricing. Their informational advantage is greater in small stocks, stocks with low book-to-market ratios and stocks with low analyst coverage; but smaller in the 2008 bear market than the 2006 bull market. <b>Short</b> <b>sellers</b> {{are less likely}} than non-short sellers to be associated with large negative return reversals indicative of predatory trading or bear raid manipulation. However, our results indicate that some naked <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> may be involved in manipulation. Our findings suggest regulators should not restrict short selling in general because such actions are expected to impair market efficiency. However, restrictions on naked short selling are likely to enhance market integrity...|$|R

25|$|A <b>short</b> <b>seller</b> {{typically}} borrows {{through a}} broker, who is usually holding the securities for another investor {{who owns the}} securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the <b>short</b> <b>seller.</b> The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities {{for a number of}} investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} a {{setting in which}} there is a predictable incentive for <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> to manipulate prices, and we find patterns consistent with <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> manipulating prices. Specifically, we find that stocks with high short interest experience abnormally low returns on the last trading day of the year. This effect is strongest among stocks that are easily manipulated and during the last hour of trading. Further, this effect reverses at the beginning of the year, consistent with the temporary nature of price manipulation. We show that hedge funds’ portfolios are closely related to market-wide short interest, suggesting that hedge funds, with their convex compensation structures, may generate the patterns we observe. In additional analysis, we find that larger price effects are associated with higher idiosyncratic volatility, offering a potential explanation for why temporary price effects are allowed to persist in the presence of rational arbitrageurs, but we find no evidence to suggest that extended non-trading-day holding periods play a role in the magnitude of the effects. Finally, we provide evidence of mutual funds and <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> avoiding each other, and we show that downward pressure by <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> is outweighed by upward pressure by buyers. In other words, since short sellers’ incentives are mirrored by buyers’ incentives in the opposite direction, our experiment provides evidence that <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> manipulate prices in much the same way buyers do, and manipulation by <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> is no stronger than manipulation by buyers...|$|R
40|$|During {{the current}} {{financial}} crisis, <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> have {{been blamed for}} causing or at least accelerating {{the crash of the}} financial market. They have been accused of manipulating stock prices so that they would fall and getting rich at the 'naive' investors' expense. This study investigates the validity of these accusations by following the TA 100 Index and four designed portfolios during the period 2006 to 2008. The designed portfolios were constructed in accordance with the weekly report on short selling activity issued by the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The results show that <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> did not succeed in outperforming the market during that 3 -year period. Moreover, the portfolios that did not include the stocks picked by the <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> performed more poorly (they should have been sold short) than the portfolios that included stocks chosen by the <b>short</b> <b>sellers.</b> These results contradict the hypothesis that short selling disrupts market efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|We create proxies for {{constrained}} {{supply of}} lendable shares by combining unique data on loan fees, stock lending activity, and failures {{to deliver to}} examine how often contrarian short sale strategies are affected by constraints. We find that constraints, as captured by our measures, clearly affect the strategies of NYSE and Nasdaq <b>short</b> <b>sellers.</b> In some cases 30 %- 40 % of the cross-section experiences {{a significant reduction in}} the contrarian response of <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> to past returns. However, only for extremely high levels of our constraint measures (top 1 %) is contrarian behavior by <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> completely eliminated. We also find that high minus low daily short selling activity portfolios produce abnormal returns for both constrained and unconstrained stocks. ...|$|R
25|$|Potential loss on a {{short sale}} is {{theoretically}} unlimited, {{as there is no}} theoretical limit to a rise in the price of the instrument. However, in practice, the <b>short</b> <b>seller</b> is required to post margin or collateral to cover losses, and inability to do so in a timely way would cause its broker or counterparty to liquidate the position. In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities to effect delivery in the short sale. In some cases, the <b>short</b> <b>seller</b> must pay a fee to borrow the securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{short selling}} (also known as {{shorting}} or going short) is {{the practice of}} selling securities or other financial instruments that are not currently owned (usually borrowed), and subsequently repurchasing them ("covering"). In {{the event of an}} interim price decline, the <b>short</b> <b>seller</b> profits, since the cost of (re)purchase is less than the proceeds received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the short position closes out at a loss if the price of a shorted instrument rises prior to repurchase.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the {{eruption}} of the massive China stock frauds on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the <b>short</b> <b>seller.</b> The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy trading halts that froze the values of shorted stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings {{at least until the}} halts were lifted.|$|E
40|$|Both {{institutional}} {{owners and}} <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> decrease their positions prior to earnings announcements, and increase their {{positions in the}} post-announcement period. Preannouncement changes in institutional holdings and short interest have significant explanatory power with respect to abnormal earnings announcement returns, {{where most of the}} power comes from institutions and <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> closing positions in order to avoid losses. Analysis of post-announcement returns indicates that aggressive trading by <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> in reaction to earnings releases enhances immediate price discovery, which reduces their ability to profit from post-earnings announcement drift. The more muted reaction of institutional traders to earnings releases has no significant impact on earnings response coefficients, and allows institutions to successfully target stocks that underreact to earnings news.

25|$|The {{particular}} synthetic CDO {{that the}} SEC's 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1. Unlike {{many of the}} Abacus securities, 2007-AC1 did not have Goldman Sachs as a <b>short</b> <b>seller,</b> in fact, Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal. That position {{was taken by the}} customer (John Paulson) who hired Goldman to issue the security (according to the SEC's complaint). Paulson and his employees selected 90 BBB-rated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for. Paulson and the manager of the CDO, ACA Management, worked on the portfolio of 90 bonds to be insured (ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson's short position), coming to an agreement in late February 2007. Paulson paid Goldman approximately US$15 million for its work in the deal. Paulson ultimately made a US$1 billion profit from the short investments, the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers. These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank (US$150 million loss), and the investors and insurers of another US$900 million—ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.|$|E

40|$|In a well-regulated {{market with}} minimal risk of abuse, the {{liquidity}} and information efficiency benefits of short selling far outweigh its potential harm. Contrary {{to the recent}} hostility <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> face from market regulators and the popular press, <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> in aggregate are neither market villains nor agents of destruction. While {{a small minority of}} <b>short</b> <b>sellers</b> have exploited lax regulation and inattentive enforcement of anti-abuse rules to manipulate stock prices and earn substantial fees, these rare episodes suggest that the world 2 ̆ 7 s major capital markets need better enforcement of existing rules and not new rules per se.
