40|$|A {{plantain}} chips {{slicing machine}} was designed, fabricated and tested. This {{is perhaps a}} major advancement {{in the development of}} plantain chips. A cam and spring return mechanism was used to achieve both the feeding and the slicing operations. The machine was made as simple as possible for easy repairs and maintenance. It is designed such that the machine slices one tuber of plantain over one revolution of the cam. A conveyor rolls sliced chips to a tray {{with the help of a}} Geneva drive mechanism (or timer). A variable <b>speed</b> <b>pulley</b> system was used to reduce the motor speed to desired value. Test performance gave an efficiency of 74 per cent. Further modification is in view to further improve on the efficiency...|$|E

50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads. Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, <b>speed,</b> and <b>pulley</b> diameters. Belt tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|R
50|$|In 1879 Reeves {{worked in}} a sawmill in Columbus. He noticed that workers could not control the <b>speed</b> of the <b>pulleys</b> used to power the saws. This caused the wood to split and {{a large amount of}} wastage. After some months of study and experimentation, Reeves invented a variable-speed {{transmission}} to control the saws speed.|$|R

The loose pulley ('idler') allows the machine to be stopped in isolation - necessary for changing <b>speed.</b> The stepped <b>pulleys</b> (left) provide three drive speeds for the machine tool (not shown), depending on which pair of pulleys is connected by the belt.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the various methods available to predict the discharge angle of material as it leaves the head pulley of a conveyor belt. This discharge angle prediction is a vital component in the overall determination of the discharge trajectory of material and as a result will dictate the design of a transfer chute to adequately feed downstream components in a system. The discharge angle will also dictate the location of a stockpile if this is the desired application of the conveyor belt. Included in this paper are numerical comparisons of the methods presented to quantify similarities and differences between individual approaches by using a range of belt <b>speeds</b> and <b>pulley</b> diameters. Observations made on the various methods will be discussed, including advantages, disadvantages and limitations...|$|R

They considered that CVT {{could provide a}} wider range transmission ratio, good fuel economy, smoothly shifting of ratio, and excellent drivability. They also noted that, with CVT, {{it was possible to}} maintain a constant engine speed based on either its optimum control line or maximum engine power characteristic. With their work, the use of Adaptive Neural Network Optimization Control (ANNOC) was brought in to indirectly control the engine <b>speed</b> by adjusting <b>pulley</b> CVT ratio [5].|$|R
40|$|The design {{objective}} is {{to come up with}} a mower that is portable, durable, easy to operate and maintain. It also aims to design a self-powered mower of electrical source; a cordless electric lawn mower. The heart of the machine is a battery-powered dc electric motor. It comprises of a system of <b>speed</b> multiplication <b>pulleys</b> which drive the cutting blades and the charging unit comprising of a 12 V alternator and a lift mechanism meant to alter the height of cut. This is achieved by means of a system of v-belt pulleys with minimal slip effect; collapsible blades to reduce the common problem of wear. The use of collapsible blades and incorporation of an alternator for recharging the battery make the design unique such that no engine is involved. Performance test gave a cutting efficiency of 89. 55 % with 0. 24 kN human effort. Thus, the machine is considered highly efficient and is readily adaptable to different cutting conditions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{developed}} {{with the main}} objective to manufacture briquettes to improve the Urea application and to fill the necessity that the rice crops has. Nowadays, the Urea is spread over the rice plantations; this process causes a huge waste. Therefore the application of briquettes in this soils of rice crops is proposed. This will reduce the big amount of waste, so in this way, its consumption will be reduce. The briquettes will be manufactured by a briquette machine, that is the main objective of this thesis and it is detailed as continues. In order to start designing, first I searched for all the theoretical knowledge of the briquettes machine, then the materials {{that are going to}} be use into the briquettes and finally the main parameters to be used for starting design this machine. Then, I made the machine's design and each one of its components like: structure, alveolus cylinders, the feeding's hopper, etc; once designed the machine's shape, I proceed with the calculation of components such as: the straight teeth Gear, the alveolus cylinders, the cylinders shaft, etc. Also, with the calculations results, I proceed with the accessories selection; like the driving <b>pulley,</b> <b>speed</b> reducer <b>pulley,</b> V bands, bearings case, electrical motor, etc. These selections were carried out based on tables, mechanical pieces catalogues and the mine own experience, obtaining a final result. Then the blue print of the machine and the parts for its construction. Also, a construction program {{was developed}}. In this program I included a process work plan and a GANTT plan. Then according the cost, I made an estimated budget for the machine's construction. Considering, special attention for all accessories and materials that are available in the local market. Finally, I approach conclusions and recommendations about this work...|$|R
5000|$|The process {{consists}} of two conductive pulleys (step pulleys) which the wire passes across after it is drawn. The two pulleys have an electrical potential across them, which causes the wire to form a short circuit. The Joule effect causes {{the temperature of the}} wire to rise to approximately 400 °C. This temperature is affected by the rotational <b>speed</b> of the <b>pulleys,</b> the ambient temperature, and the voltage applied. Where [...] is the temperature of the wire, [...] is a constant, [...] is the voltage applied, [...] is the number of rotations of the pulleys per minute, and [...] is the ambient temperature: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pitch line}} is {{the line between the}} inner and outer {{surfaces}} that is neither subject to tension (like the outer surface) nor compression (like the inner). It is midway through the surfaces in film and flat belts and dependent on cross-sectional shape and size in timing and V-belts. Calculating pitch diameter is an engineering task and {{is beyond the scope of}} this article. The angular speed is inversely proportional to size, so the larger the one wheel, the less angular velocity, and vice versa. Actual <b>pulley</b> <b>speeds</b> tend to be 0.5-1% less than generally calculated because of belt slip and stretch. In timing belts, the inverse ratio teeth of the belt contributes to the exact measurement.The speed of the belt is: ...|$|R
30|$|In the {{mechanical}} part, the float moves {{up and down}} driven by waves, pulling pulley 2 and pulley 3 to rotate in opposite directions. During the wave falling period, only pulley 2, ratchet wheel 1 and driving pulley 4 work to drive the driving pulley 6. If the rotating <b>speed</b> of <b>pulley</b> 2 is {{equal to that of}} driving pulley 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between pulley 2 and driving pulley 4 is maintained by ratchet wheel 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only pulley 3, ratchet wheel 2 and driving pulley 5 work to drive the driving pulley 6. When pulley 3 keeps pace with driving pulley 5 through ratchet wheel 2 and the driving force is continually on pulley 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two ratchet wheels ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type wave power system, which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{engine speed}} {{corresponding}} to load variations and road condition {{has always been}} a challenge to automotive engineers. However, with the introduction of electromechanical CVT, maintaining constant engine speed based on its optimum control line characteristic could be made possible. This paper describes the simulation work in this area carried out by the Drivetrain Research Group at the Automotive Development Center, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai Johor. The developed drive train model is highly non-linear, it could not be controlled satisfactorily by common linear control strategy such as PID controller. To overcome the problem, the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed to indirectly control the engine <b>speed</b> by adjusting <b>pulley</b> CVT ratio. Computer simulations showed that applying artificial neural network (ANN) into drive train model could select a proper transmission ratio where the engine could be maintained to run at certain desired speed...|$|R
40|$|Continuously {{variable}} transmissions (CVT) {{have received}} great interest as {{viable alternative to}} discrete ratio transmission in passenger vehicle. It is generally accepted that CVTs {{have the potential to}} provide such desirable attributes as: a wider range ratio, good fuel economy, shifting ratio continuously and smoothly and good driveability. With the introduction of Continuously Va riable Transmission (CVT), maintaining constant engine speed based on either its optimum control line or maximum engine power characteristic could be made possible. This paper describes the simulation work in drivetrain area carried out by the Drivetrain Research Group (DRG) at the Automotive Development Centre (ADC), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai Johor.

40|$|From {{transportation}} of bulk materials in underground and open-cut mines to applications in power stations and processing plants to name but a few, belt conveyors {{are widely used}} as an economical continuous conveying method. Most of these industries rely strongly on conveyor transfers to divert material from one conveyor to another {{at some point in}} their system. The unfortunate reality is that some companies will be driven by cost minimisation for the short-term rather than planning for the long-term. This will result in bad decisions being made and the incorrect conveyor transfer being installed with flow-on effects such as downtime for modifications or even replacement. There are many facets to the design of a successful transfer chute including minimising product impact, degradation, chute wear, noise, dust and spillage while maximising the material velocity to allow the product to leave the chute at or near the speed of the receiving conveyor. Fully understanding the behaviour of a material is paramount to designing a successful transfer chute. Accurately determining the material discharge and trajectory from the head pulley is the first step in this design process. This paper will focus on the determination of the material trajectory as it leaves the belt conveyor head pulley. This process will also determine the point at which the material leaves the belt, referred to as the discharge angle. There are numerous methods available in the literature focusing on the modelling of material discharge and trajectory, including C. E. M. A. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], M. H. E. A. [6, 7], Booth [8], Golka [9, 10], Korzen [11], Goodyear [12] and Dunlop [13]. These methods have been evaluated for both horizontal and inclined belts for a range of belt <b>speeds</b> and <b>pulley</b> diameters to evaluate both low and high-speed conditions. The results of these evaluations have been compared to allow comment on their ease of use, completeness and potential accuracy...|$|R
