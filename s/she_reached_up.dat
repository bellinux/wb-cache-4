500|$|On 4 June 1913 Davison {{obtained}} two flags {{bearing the}} suffragette colours of violet, white and green from the WSPU offices; she then travelled by train to Epsom, Surrey, {{to attend the}} Derby. She positioned herself at Tattenham Corner, the final bend before the home straight. At {{this point in the}} race, with some of the horses having passed her, she ducked under the guard rail and ran onto the course; she may have held in her hands one of the suffragette flags. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to the reins of Anmer—King George V's horse, ridden by Herbert Jones—and was hit by the animal, which would have been travelling at around [...] per hour, four seconds after stepping onto the course. Anmer fell in the collision and partly rolled over his jockey, who had his foot momentarily caught in the stirrup. [...] Davison was knocked to the ground; some reports say she was kicked in the head by Anmer, but the surgeon who operated on Davison stated that [...] "I could find no trace of her having been kicked by a horse". The event was captured on three news cameras.|$|E

6000|$|The {{cause of}} it had resumed her sad gaze at the fire. Presently, without turning her head, <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> her long, graceful arm, and {{clasping}} her brother's neck, brought his face down in profile with her own, cheek against cheek, until they looked like the double outlines of a medallion. Then she said--to the fire: ...|$|E
50|$|The novel {{begins with}} Hind running down three {{flights of stairs}} in his building. Intending to visit Sylvia, his estranged wife living one block away, on a peace mission, he surprises a very tall - <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>up</b> to his {{shoulder}} - elderly woman putting a note in his mailbox. Unusually, she is not fazed by his height.|$|R
60|$|Presently <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> {{her hands}} <b>up</b> to his face, made brave {{to do it}} by the {{sheltering}} darkness.|$|R
5000|$|She signals {{with her}} eyes, and the {{scientist}} {{moves to the}} security door that connects his room to hers. He activates the security code and opens the door. Inside she is waiting for him. He walks {{into the room and}} embraces her. <b>She</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>up,</b> gently holds {{the back of his head}} with one hand. And suddenly - her jaw extends and she pulls his head into her mouth, then lifts him into the air and swallows him whole, vomiting up his shredded clothes. She climbs back into the bath and lies there, caressing her now massively enlarged belly, and the scientist inside it - still alive.|$|R
6000|$|At {{least so}} {{her husband and}} lover thought, as he moved tenderly towards her. She met his first kiss on her forehead; the second, a supererogatory one, based on some {{supposed}} inefficiency in the first, fell upon a shining band of her hair, beside her neck. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> her slim hands, caught his wrists firmly, and, slightly putting him aside, said: ...|$|E
60|$|As he came {{his upper}} lip curled into a snarl, exposing his {{fighting}} fangs, and a deep growl rumbled from his cavernous chest. Taug looked up, batting his blood-shot eyes. Teeka half raised herself and looked at Tarzan. Did she guess {{the cause of his}} perturbation? Who may say? At any rate, she was feminine, and so <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> and scratched Taug behind one of his small, flat ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather's God {{is simply}} awful. When I'm playing the fiddle, I can feel God; but grandfather's {{is such a}} stuffy God--you know what I mean: the sea, the wind, the trees, colours too--they make one feel. But I don't believe that life was meant to 'be good' in. Isn't there {{anything}} better than being good? When I'm 'good,' I simply feel wicked." [...] <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up,</b> caught a flower from the hedge, and slowly tore its petals.|$|E
50|$|Edith Maersk is a {{container}} ship and the sister ship of Emma Maersk, thus {{one of the}} world's largest cargo ships. She has capacity for 13,500 containers; calculations from Maersk Line company say that it has only 11,000 TEUs capacity. <b>She</b> can <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to 15,200 TEUs according to specialists.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{you are my}} uncle, then!' <b>she</b> cried, <b>reaching</b> <b>up</b> {{to salute}} him. 'I thought I liked you, though you were cross at first.

50|$|The {{music video}} for Superhero begins with Barlow {{witnessing}} a car crash. He manages {{to avoid getting}} hurt himself, but soon discovers that the driver {{of one of the}} vehicles involved has been seriously injured. He manages to pull her free, and as a thank you, <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>up</b> and kisses Barlow on the cheek. He then leaves the scene. Months later, Barlow witnesses a house fire, and while trying to save the occupants of the house, he discovers that the female is the same woman he helped in the car crash. She once again rewards him with a kiss on the cheek. The video concludes with the woman visiting Barlow at his house and thanking him for all he has done.|$|R
60|$|Alvina lit the {{incandescent}} gas-jet {{that hung}} {{in the middle of}} the room. The hard white light showed her somewhat haggard-looking as <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to it. But Albert watched her, smiling abstractedly. It seemed as if his words came off him without affecting him at all. He did not think about what he was feeling, and he did not feel what he was thinking about. And therefore she hardly heard what he said. Yet she believed he was clever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor, dear head." [...] <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> a {{hand and}} passed the fingers soothingly through his hair. [...] "Let it go around no more. Let us begin anew, now. I loved you all the time. I know that I was weak in {{yielding}} to my mother's will. I should not have done so. Yet I have heard you speak so often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of humankind. Extend that charity to me. I acted mistakenly. Forgive me." ...|$|E
60|$|This must be love, she thought, {{in the one}} {{rational}} {{moment that}} was vouchsafed her. If it was not love, it was too shameful. It could be nothing else than love. She loved the man whose arms were around her and whose lips were pressed to hers. She pressed more, tightly to him, with a snuggling movement of her body. And a moment later, tearing herself half out of his embrace, suddenly and exultantly <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> and placed both hands upon Martin Eden's sunburnt neck. So exquisite was the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan, relaxed her hands, and lay half-swooning in his arms.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the single}} {{features}} a woman played by Sasha Wexler who is found at a park, presumably deceased, and shows how she is passed from an ambulance on a stretcher, into a mortuary, and finally on an autopsy table. Throughout the video, she is shown moving her fingers little by little, even as she is put in a freezer. At {{the end of the}} video, as a medical examiner is about to perform the autopsy, her fingers move again, accompanied by a stream of tears. As the doctor brings his saw to her head, <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>up</b> and grabs his wrist tightly. The final scene shows the saw spinning on the floor. There is no blood on it.|$|R
50|$|On the way home, Fisher asks Jimmy {{to stop at}} {{the same}} levee they went to before the party so she can see the moon on the water. They stand on the levee together, and Fisher tells him that she intends to fix her father's mistake and that she can't run away anymore. She makes an offer to Jimmy: that his mother will be taken care of, his father will always have a job, and while she knows that no one could ever love her, he could get used to her. <b>She</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>up</b> to touch his face, but he pulls away again. Heartbroken, Fisher turns to walk away, only to find that Jimmy had grabbed her hand - a silent {{agreement}} to her proposal. She turns back to him and once again rests her head on his shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Flipkens began 2014 by {{reaching}} a semifinal in Auckland, where she lost to Ana Ivanovic, 0-6, 6-7. The next week, <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> the quarterfinal of Hobart (losing to Garbiñe Muguruza). She then beat Laura Robson in the Australian Open 2014, where <b>she</b> ended <b>up</b> <b>reaching</b> {{the second round}} {{in which she was}} defeated by Casey Dellacqua.|$|R
6000|$|Then in the white, rapt face, in the unfathomable eyes, Venters saw Jane Withersteen in {{a supreme}} moment. This moment was one wherein <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to the height for which her noble soul had ever yearned. He, after disrupting the calm tenor of her peace, after {{bringing}} {{down on her}} head the implacable hostility of her churchmen, after teaching her a bitter lesson of life--he was to be her salvation. And he turned away again, this time shaken {{to the core of}} his soul. Jane Withersteen was the incarnation of selflessness. He experienced wonder and terror, exquisite pain and rapture. What were all the shocks life had dealt him compared to the thought of such loyal and generous friendship? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew what}} she was doing. There was a hook and line {{attached}} to the pole, and with womanly dexterity she was fastening the hook to the extreme end of the rod. Soon <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up,</b> and gently struck at my legs. After a few attempts the hook caught in my trousers, a little below my right knee. Then there was a slight pull, a long scratch down my leg, and the hook was stopped by the top of my boot. Then came a steady downward pull, and I felt myself descending. Gently and firmly the rod was drawn down; carefully the lower end was kept free from the ground; and in a few moments my ankle was seized with a vigorous grasp. Then some one seemed to climb up me, my feet touched the ground, an arm was thrown around my neck, the hand of another arm was busy {{at the back of my}} knapsack, and I soon stood firmly in the road, entirely divested of negative gravity.|$|E
60|$|She looked up, {{and in the}} {{darkness}} saw his face above her, his shapely, male face. There seemed a faint, white light emitted from him, a white aura, {{as if he were}} visitor from the unseen. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up,</b> like Eve reaching to the apples on the tree of knowledge, and she kissed him, though her passion was a transcendent fear of the thing he was, touching his face with her infinitely delicate, encroaching wondering fingers. Her fingers went over the mould of his face, over his features. How perfect and foreign he was--ah how dangerous! Her soul thrilled with complete knowledge. This was the glistening, forbidden apple, this face of a man. She kissed him, putting her fingers over his face, his eyes, his nostrils, over his brows and his ears, to his neck, to know him, to gather him in by touch. He was so firm, and shapely, with such satisfying, inconceivable shapeliness, strange, yet unutterably clear. He was such an unutterable enemy, yet glistening with uncanny white fire. She wanted to touch him and touch him and touch him, till she had him all in her hands, till she had strained him into her knowledge. Ah, if she could have the precious KNOWLEDGE of him, she would be filled, and nothing could deprive her of this. For he was so unsure, so risky in the common world of day.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a real, honest, good fellow," [...] said Babie. [...] "I'm {{sorry for}} Bobus, but I've known Cecil almost all my life, and I can't have him abused. I do {{really believe that}} Essie will be happier with a simple-hearted fellow like him, than with a clever man like Bobus, who has places in his mind <b>she</b> could never <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to, and lucky for her too," [...] half whispered Babie at the end.|$|R
60|$|I went in, as usual, {{through the}} door between our two bedrooms, to bid Laura good-night {{before she went to}} sleep. In stooping over her to kiss her I saw the little book of Hartright's {{drawings}} half hidden under her pillow, just in the place where she used to hide her favourite toys when she was a child. I could not find it in my heart to say anything, but I pointed to the book and shook my head. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> both hands <b>up</b> to my cheeks, and drew my face down to hers till our lips met.|$|R
60|$|Then Brangwen, {{talking to}} the child, or to the dog between his knees, would be aware of his wife, as, in her tight, dark bodice and her lace fichu, <b>she</b> was <b>reaching</b> <b>up</b> to the corner cupboard. He {{realized}} with a sharp pang that she belonged to him, and he to her. He realized that he lived by her. Did he own her? Was she here for ever? Or might she go away? She was not really his, {{it was not a}} real marriage, this marriage between them. She might go away. He did not feel like a master, husband, father of her children. She belonged elsewhere. Any moment, she might be gone. And he was ever drawn to her, drawn after her, with ever-raging, ever-unsatisfied desire. He must always turn home, wherever his steps were taking him, always to her, and he could never quite reach her, he could never quite be satisfied, never be at peace, because she might go away.|$|R
5000|$|Reason: Lillian {{refused to}} come to her classes, causing Mrs. Shrager and Ms Harbord to step forward and demand answers from her. Ms. Harbord asked Lillian to define [...] "respect" [...] to which she replied that shes [...] "not a dictionary," [...] making her {{expelled}} instantly. Maddy overly drank at her Wine Tasting Lesson, until <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to the point of telling the girls that she wanted to go home, and eventually told her teachers, making her eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to local}} popular legend a {{daughter}} of the last Sassanian King Yazdgerd III became a wife to Hussein ibn Ali, the 3rd Shia Imam. She {{was present at the}} Battle of Karbala and could escape after Ashura. Pursued by her enemies <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to Ray in Iran. On the slope of the mountain her enemies threatened to get hold of her. With the last of her strength she asked God to deliver her and the mountain miraculously opened and gave refuge to the princess. However, a tail of her dress remained wedged in the rock when it closed behind her. When her pursuers and other people found the cloth in the rock, they realised the miracle and acknowledged Sharbanu as a saint.|$|E
5000|$|By 11 December, {{the work}} had been {{completed}} and she was dispatched from San Francisco to Santa Barbara for an official speed trial. Once in the harbor, heavy fog delayed the ship for four days. On the 15th, Olympia sailed into the Santa Barbara Channel, the [...] "chosen race-track for California-built cruisers," [...] and began a four-hour time trial. According to the navy, she had sustained an average speed of 21.67 kn, though <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to 22.2 kn—both well above the contract requirement of 20 kn. While returning to San Francisco, Olympia participated in eight experiments that tested various combinations of steering a ship by rudder and propellers. The new cruiser was ultimately commissioned on 5 February 1895. For several months afterwards, she was the largest ship ever built on the western coast of the US, until surpassed by the battleship [...]|$|E
5000|$|Hawkins recalls having visited Reed for {{the last}} time at Christmas 1985, just days before her death of cancer: [...] "I really loved that woman [...] [...] [...]is a scene in It’s A Wonderful Life where she touched my cheek. Well, {{flashback}} to the eighties, Donna was really ill, it was around Christmas time, and I went to visit her at her home, I brought her an [...] "It's A Wonderful Life" [...] Christmas ornament for her tree. She asked me to put it on her tree, and we visited, but it was hard for her to expend any energy; so I wished her a Merry Christmas and told her I had to go, and then <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> her hand <b>up</b> to touch my cheek just like she did when I was in that scene with her when she drew me in, and in just two weeks, she died." ...|$|R
60|$|One Wednesday {{afternoon}} in late September, Ann Veronica Stanley {{came down from}} London {{in a state of}} solemn excitement and quite resolved to have things out with her father that very evening. She had trembled on the verge of such a resolution before, but this time quite definitely she made it. A crisis had been <b>reached,</b> and <b>she</b> was almost glad it had been <b>reached.</b> <b>She</b> made <b>up</b> her mind in the train home that it should be a decisive crisis. It is for that reason that this novel begins with her there, and neither earlier nor later, for it is the history of this crisis and its consequences that this novel has to tell.|$|R
6000|$|... (Margaret {{looks at}} {{documents}} lying on open cover of dispatch box and glancing quickly about room, takes a sudden resolution. She seizes documents, makes {{as if to}} run wildly from the room, stops abruptly to reconsider, and changes her mind. She looks about room for a hiding place, and her eyes rest on portrait of Lincoln. Moving swiftly, picking up a light chair on the way, she goes to corner of bookcase nearest to portrait, steps on chair, and from chair to ledge of bookcase where, clinging, <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> out and <b>up</b> and drops documents behind portrait. Stepping quickly down, with handkerchief she wipes ledge on which she has stood, also {{the seat of the}} chair. She carries chair back to where she found it, and reseats herself in chair by desk.)

2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale. He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — <b>she</b> even <b>reaches</b> <b>up</b> {{with her hand}} and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|R
