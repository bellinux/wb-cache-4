50|$|The Sepung {{bridge is}} a curved {{one with a}} radius of 2000m. In {{order to reduce the}} {{deformation}} of the pylons {{toward the center of the}} circle, two cables are established from the top to the bottom of the pylon. It is also effective for increasing the torsional rigidity. This bridge is designed to accommodate dual four-lane traffic; its design incorporates a curved <b>stiffening</b> <b>girder</b> and additional transverse cables to stabilize each tower. The striffening girder is designed as a PC box using reinforced concrete of grade 40MPa; It is 3.3m deep and almost 24m wide, and incorporates steel struts and FRP pipe struts filled with concrete in the internal and external box respectively, to resist the local tensile stress. These internal and external struts are placed at typical centers of 6m and 3m respectively and give the <b>stiffening</b> <b>girder</b> and increased torsional rigidity and make the decks 20% lighter than a traditional concrete box girder. In this bridge, a single plane multiple cable system with harp arrangement was chosen in order to reduce the longitudinal and transverse deformation of the towers. As the shear center deviates from the center of the <b>stiffening</b> <b>girder</b> due to the application of the asymmetric cable forces and self-weight, twisting and transverse deformation may occur.|$|E

40|$|The <b>stiffening</b> <b>girder</b> of self-anchored {{suspension}} bridge (SSB) {{is subjected to}} huge axial force because the main cable is directly anchored {{on the end of}} the <b>stiffening</b> <b>girder.</b> To obtain a simple model and accurately understand the mechanical behavior of the whole structure in preliminary design, this paper proposed an analytical calculation method considering the combined effects of the main cable-suspender-stiffening girder.

The static pushover analysis were carried out using three loading cases which are considering the dead load,live load, impact load and earthquake load, according to Japan Specifications for Highway Bridges (JSHB) loading condition. These results were being compared with the results from dynamic analysis. The dynamic response analyses were carried out using earthquake waves in transverse and longitudinal directions in order to investigate the seismic behavior of the arch bridge model.

40|$|Part I of {{this thesis}} {{contains}} {{a review of}} the basic theory of the cable and <b>stiffening</b> <b>girder</b> combination according to the method of Dr. Rode which takes into account the inevitable longitudinal displacements of the suspender connections, when the cable is deflected from its normal configuration. Numerical calculations have been carried out to establish the order of magnitude of approximations in the ordinary deflection theory as developed in this country by F. E. Turneare from the work of J. Melan. Besides the essential omission which is evident in the comparison of the fundamental differential equation of Rode's theory with that of the ordinary deflection theory, the most significant error is the neglect of the effect of inclination of the suspenders on cable deflection. It would appear that an error of three percent can arise from this source which although unimportant from the structural engineer's point of view, is important as a limit on accuracy required of any theory which neglects it. Rode's differential equation is not integrable and an approximation has been developed which is tractable by the methods of Part II and yet does not sacrifice entirely the improved representation of structural action given by Rode's theory. Part II utilizes trigonometric series {{for the development of a}} simple method of determination of the deflections and girder bending moments in a span. As applied to the ordinary deflection theory there result formulae of extreme simplicity which bring into sharp perspective the related functions of cable and <b>stiffening</b> <b>girder.</b> From these formulae a pictorial representation of bridge stiffness in terms of certain basic parameters has been developed. The theory and method of computation have then been extended to take into account the effect of a prestress introduced by arbitrary adjustment of suspender lengths which may be necessary in the rehabilitation of old structures or reduction of peak bending stresses in new designs. The approximation to Rode's theory developed in Part I is then solved in terms of the methods developed for the simple theory and formulae result which are but slightly more complicated than the elegant formulae of the previous work. The practicability of application has been tested by examples. Finally, in order to dispel certain erroneous conceptions of the efficacy of the <b>stiffening</b> <b>girder</b> in controlling the bending moments, (and consequently, the deflections) in a span, the method has been extended to permit the investigation of the influence of variation in flexural rigidity of the girder. This leads to formulae, not overly lengthy, which show in proper relation the influence of the various harmonic components of the flexural rigidity of the girder. The methods of this thesis are simple in conception and application while still retaining a proper physical basis, and are capable of extension beyond the bounds of current methods without loss of algebraical and arithmetical tractability...|$|E

Thin plated girders used to support loads over long spans develop significant post-critical resistance after the plate buckling occurs. To achieve better understanding of longitudinally <b>stiffened</b> plated <b>girders</b> subjected to high bending moments and shear forces, four experimental tests on large scale test specimens were performed. The results of these tests were used to verify the numerical model, which was employed for further parametric studies. With numerical simulations the influence of initial imperfections and residual stresses on the capacity of girders was investigated. Initial imperfections were considered as actual measured initial imperfections, as positive buckling modes and as deformed shapes, based on preliminary nonlinear calculations of perfect girders. Residual stresses were considered with a simplified stress pattern where the level of compression stresses was varied. The final residual stresses were determined {{on the basis of}} residual stresses measured in the tested girder. With a verified simplified numerical model a parametric nonlinear analysis was systematically carried out to determine the resistance of longitudinally <b>stiffened</b> plated <b>girders.</b> Based on 630 numerical simulations a new equation for interaction at high bending moments and shear forces, as well as the section, where the check should be performed is proposed.

Reliability analysis based on real-time SHM data can provide more timely and accurate assessment of present and future conditions of structures. Many researchers studied the reliability of bridges based on the field measurement data. However, most of the past researches focused on the reliability of certain component of bridges, such as the main cables. the suspenders. the <b>stiffening</b> <b>girders</b> and so on. Few literatures could be found on the reliability of entire bridge system.
