25|$|The Loggia dei Lanzi, {{also called}} the Loggia della Signoria, is a {{building}} on {{a corner of the}} Piazza della Signoria in Florence, Italy, adjoining the Uffizi Gallery. It consists of wide arches open to the street. The arches rest on clustered pilasters with Corinthian capitals. The wide arches appealed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Florentines that Michelangelo proposed that they should be continued all around the Piazza della Signoria.|$|E
25|$|Canopies {{for each}} cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity.

Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, {{the population of the}} College of Cardinals had increased <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point that they would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row.|$|E

Returning to San Francisco 5 January 1945, she embarked troops and sailed 19 January for the Western Pacific where she shuttled troops to Finschhafen and Hollandia, New Guinea; Leyte, Philippines; Ulithi, Caroline Islands; and Kossol Roads, Palaus. Loaded with medical patients and returning veterans, she departed Hollandia for the United States 22 March and arrived San Francisco 10 April. On the 21st, the busy ship again sailed for the Western Pacific; and, after steaming via Pearl Harbor to the Admiralty Islands, the Philippines, and the Marshalls, she returned 2,302 passengers to San Francisco, arriving 11 June.

25|$|It is {{said that}} in Myra the relics of Saint Nicholas each year exuded a clear watery liquid which smells like rose water, called manna (or myrrh), which is {{believed}} by the faithful to possess miraculous powers. After the relics were brought to Bari, they continued to do <b>so,</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> joy of the new owners. Vials of myrrh from his relics have been taken {{all over the world}} for centuries, and can still be obtained from his church in Bari. Even up to the present day, a flask of manna is extracted from the tomb of Saint Nicholas every year on 6 December (the Saint's feast day) by the clergy of the basilica. The myrrh is collected from a sarcophagus which is located in the basilica vault and could be obtained in the shop nearby. The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbour, and the tomb is below sea level, there have been several natural explanations proposed for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action.|$|E
500|$|... "King Worm" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Steve Wolfhard, Somvilay Xayaphone, and Bert Youn. This {{marked the first}} time that Wolfhard was {{credited}} as a storyboard artist. This {{is due to the fact}} that he was largely responsible for storyboarding the episodes third act. At this time in the show's production, Wolfhard was only a storyboard revisionist, and as such, he originally was supposed to have only revised the act. However, he added <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> section that he was credited as the episode's third storyboard artist. Initially, series creator Pendleton Ward felt that Wolfhard's scenes were not effective; he wanted Finn's nightmares to be composed largely of [...] "scary, dream imagery". Upon further consideration, however, he changed his mind, applauding how the section focuses on Finn's personal fears. The episode's story itself was developed by Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. It was directed by Larry Leichliter.|$|E

It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do <b>so,</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E

According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones.

At the forefront of this movement were Los Ratones Paranoicos, whom for years before were perfecting a musical formula that would be emulated by countless neighborhood bands in years to come. They were joined in the Rolinga scene by Viejas Locas in the mid 1990s.|$|E
