40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{assess the}} dental {{needs of a}} group of {{children}} with intellectual disability (ID) attending six <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> <b>facilities</b> in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS. This was a cross-sectional study based on a convenience sampling method. One hundred and fifty-seven children with ID attending six <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> <b>facilities</b> in Cape Town were included in the survey. Five schools were exclusively funded by the State and one school received additional private financial support. The oral examinations complied with guidelines drafted by Special Olympics Special Smiles programme and the Centers for Disease Control, USA. RESULTS. The most common dental disorders requiring management were gingival disease (69 %) and untreated dental caries (68 %). Almost 50 % of the children had missing teeth. Twenty-nine percent needed orthodontic correction of malocclusion and 7 % had structural abnormalities of their teeth that required either aesthetic or functional intervention. Fillings were evident in only 8 % of the children. Females required more dental treatment than males. The dental needs of children with ID increased with age. There {{were no significant differences in}} the dental needs of children attending State-funded schools and those attending the single school that received additional financial assistance. CONCLUSION. The frequency of unmet dental needs of children with ID attending <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> <b>facilities</b> in Cape Town was high and the dental care available to them was minimal. The study highlights the need for improved dental services to ensure that optimal oral health is accessible to children with ID attending <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> <b>facilities</b> in Cape Town.

40|$|A {{survey of}} 1. 3 million {{schoolchildren}} in Zimbabwe identified {{a total of}} 278 pupils with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), giving a prevalence of 1 in 4728. Pupils with OCA were identified in every province of the country, but the distribution was not even.

Although most of the pupils with albinism belonged to the majority Shona ethnic group, people with OCA were also found among the minority population groups in the country. There were almost twice as many pupils with albinism in rural compared with urban schools (248 v 129). However, the prevalence of OCA was significantly higher in urban than rural areas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this lecture is {{to shed light on}} a potential, and invite those who are {{interested}} to join in and make use of this potential. Here is the background: Starting with the Isaac Project in 1993, Certec has developed a technological/educational concept based on pictures as language for people with limited spoken language or none at all. There are a number of case studies (our own and others) of the interaction between people with different types of cognitive disabilities and a multiplicity of personal digital photographs (over 1, 000, often well over 10, 000). There is also a growing and increasingly widespread use of digital photos in <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> <b>facilities,</b> care-giving services for disabled people, and in the fields of autism and psychiatry. Added to this are the experiences gained from a picture web board in which people involved in using pictures as language have been able to share their experiences with one another. We can provide examples of what has been done and document the effects. But still, 8 years later, we are unable to carry out sufficiently qualified and relevant analyses and assessments because {{we have not been able}} to find applicable explanatory models for the effects; neither have we found relevant fundamental theories supporting what we have observed. This is profoundly unsatisfactory and that is why we are now appealing for help. If we, together, can identify relevant existing theoretical foundations, or come up with new useworthy ones, the effects can be at least twofold: On the one hand, we will better be able to understand and make use of the results achieved so far. On the other, with good theories as a basis, excellent prerequisites should exist for inspiration to an even more effective implementation than what we have hitherto accomplished. The article contains a comprehensive description and references to Certec-related work in this area for the past 8 years, as well as a literature review that shows how difficult it has been to find a basis in established scientific research...|$|E
30|$|The term <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> {{need was}} {{introduced}} {{in the beginning of the}} 21 st century. The desire at that time was to move away from the use of older terminologies such as ‘handicapped children’ to find a generic description that would more suitably embrace the increasingly diverse group of children with problems in learning (Westwood 2011). According to Farrel (2003), a child has <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> needs if he or she has learning difficulties than the majority of children of the same age. This calls for <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> provisions to be made for such category of learners. The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) (2009) explains that children have a learning difficulty if they (a) have significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of the children of the same age; or (b) have a disability which prevents or hinders them from making use of <b>educational</b> <b>facilities</b> of a kind generally provided for children of the same age in schools within the area of the local education authority; or (c) are under compulsory school age and fall within the definition in (a) or (b) above, or would so do if <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> provision were not made for them.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a special education teacher?s role in inclusive education of children (pupils, students) with special eduacational needs in the ordinary school. The aim of this thesis was {{to focus on the}} role of a special education teacher in inclusive education. It explains and emphasize the importance of this profession. The theoretical framework defines the concept of integration and inclusion. It describes the history of integration and its existence in documents. The process of inclusive education is analyzed with respect to different <b>special</b> needs. <b>Educational</b> consultancy <b>facilities</b> and consulting services for individuals with disabilities are also mentioned. The practical part investigates teacher?s activities and responsibilities in inclusive education. The method of participant observation and structured interviews with teachers and parents of integrated children (pupils) were used. Special Education Centre and Pedagogical-Psychological Counselling were contacted. Two nursery schools and an elementary school were visited by the author of this thesis (along with special teachers). Children with different dissabilities were observed. Finally, the thesis presents the research results: A great importance of a special teacher?s role in inclusive education is blatantly obvious. Positive relationships among a special teacher, a child, a teacher and child?s parents are essential. A comprehensive approach to an integrated child is apparent: a special teacher is a kind of mediator during an integration. He informs and presents the process and procedure of all activities to teachers and teaching assistants. Therefore, his profession is extremely important and almost indispensable. The thesis can contribute to all the students who are interested in this issue. It can also help the schools with inclusive education. Last, but not least, parents of children with <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> needs (SEN) find many answers for their questions here...|$|R

40|$|The article {{considers}} the perceived prevalence of <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> needs in English primary schools {{and changes in}} this prevalence over two decades and relates these to issues in education policy, teacher practice {{and the concept of}} <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> needs. The studies considered are two major surveys of schools and teachers, the first conducted in 1981 and the second conducted in the same schools in 1998. Important features of both studies were their scale and the exceptionally high response rates achieved. Two central findings were the perception of teachers that <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> needs were widespread and of an increase in <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> needs over time: perceived levels of <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> needs were one in five children in 1981, which had risen to one in four children in 1998. Learning difficulties were by far the most common aspects of <b>special</b> <b>educational</b> needs but many children had multiple difficulties, and behavioural difficulties were seen by teachers as the main barriers to inclusion.
