5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|Charles III {{also made}} serious {{attempts}} to find the various works of art and furniture looted, sold and dispersed during the revolution. Together with new purchases, a fine art collection once again adorned the palace which included not only family portraits <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Lucien I by de Predis; Honoré II by Philippe de Champaigne; the head of Antoine I by Hyacinthe Rigaud, and van Loo's portrait of Louise-Hyppolyte (Illustration 11) but also such masterpieces as The Music Lesson by Titian.|$|E

However, in regions where the sylvatic habitat and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly deforested areas, piassava palm culture areas, and some parts of the Amazon region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.|$|E
5|$|During the {{creation}} and recording of Manos Arriba, Chana worked closely with producer Marthin Chan. She was introduced to him by mutual friends {{of her husband and}} Univision producer Andres Baez. At the time, Chan was auditioning singers for the group Popvert. Chan said that he was first interested in collaborating with Chana due to her pitch; Chana reported that they initially bonded over their shared interest in 1980s music, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Depeche Mode, The Cure, and Velocity Girl.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economists have}} also {{highlighted}} power and inequality issues within families and households. For example, Randy Albelda shows that responsibility for care work influences the time poverty experienced by single {{mothers in the}} United States. Similarly, Sarah Gammage examines the effects of unpaid care work performed by women in Guatemala. The work of the Equality Studies Department at University College Dublin <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Sara Cantillon has focused on inequalities of domestic arrangements within even affluent households.|$|E
50|$|Between Conroys Gap and Coolac, most of {{the earlier}} {{alignment}} was replaced in 1983 and 1996 by realignment associated with dual carriageway construction, although sections <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> south <b>of</b> Connors Creek were rebuilt in 1979 with the earthworks being done for a second carriageway, which was subsequently built in 1994.|$|R

5|$|From {{the time}} of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania and {{throughout}} the Reconquista, marriage between Spanish and Umayyad royals was not uncommon. Early marriages, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa and Egilona {{at the turn of the}} 8th century, was thought to help establish the legitimacy of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. Later instances of intermarriage were often made to seal trade treaties between Christian kings and Muslim caliphs.|$|E
5|$|In Rome the portico of the Palazzo dei Conservatori {{sheltered}} {{offices of}} various guilds. Here disputes arising in the transaction of business were adjudicated, {{unless they were}} of sufficient importance to go before a communal tribunal, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the conservatori. It was a natural place for such activity. Until the 1470s the main market {{of the city was}} held on and around the campidoglio, while cattle continued to be taxed and sold in the ancient forum located just to the south.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEndothelial {{cells are}} {{constantly}} exposed to fluid shear stresses that regulate vascular morphogenesis, homeostasis, and disease. The mechanical responses of endothelial cells to relatively high shear flow <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> characteristic <b>of</b> arterial circulation {{has been extensively}} studied. Much less {{is known about the}} responses of endothelial cells to slow shear flow <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> characteristic <b>of</b> venous circulation, early angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, intracranial aneurysm, or interstitial flow. Here we used a novel, to our knowledge, microfluidic technique to measure traction forces exerted by confluent vascular endothelial cell monolayers under slow shear flow. We found that cells respond to flow with rapid and pronounced increases in traction forces and cell-cell stresses. These responses are reversible in time and do not involve reorientation of the cell body. Traction maps reveal that local cell responses to slow shear flow are highly heterogeneous in magnitude and sign. Our findings unveil a low-flow regime in which endothelial cell mechanics is acutely responsive to shear stress...|$|R

5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam. He {{explained}} that their faith says {{that there can be}} only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E
5|$|Relationships {{change as}} {{partners}} {{take on new}} roles, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> caregiver, which may conflict {{with the role of}} partner and require substantial sacrifice of time and self-care. These changes in responsibilities may mean a reverse in societally determined gender roles within relationships; inability to fulfil these roles affects sexuality in general.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Tech {{campus is}} located in Midtown, an area north of {{downtown}} Atlanta. Although a number of skyscrapers—most visibly the headquarters of AT, The Coca-Cola Company, and Bank of America—are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and {{has a great deal}} of greenery. This gives it a distinctly suburban atmosphere quite different from other Atlanta campuses <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Georgia State University.|$|E

5|$|Actor Ryo Ishibashi {{wanted to}} work with Miike and agreed to the role. He commented that despite not being a great fan of horror films, he enjoyed scripts, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Audition, that showcased human nature. Model Eihi Shiina was cast in the film as Asami. Shiina's career was {{primarily}} as a model and she only began acting after being offered a film role while she was on holidays. Shiina first learned about Miike through his film Blues Harp, which made her interested in meeting the director. When Shiina first met Miike, they began talking about her opinions on love and relationships. On their second meeting, Miike asked Shiina to play the part of Asami. Shiina thought that the opinions and feelings she expressed to Miike were the reason she was cast in the role, and she tried to play the role as naturally as she could without going over the top.|$|E

5|$|As in prokaryotes, {{there is}} a very high {{proportion}} of coding DNA and an absence of repeats. Mitochondrial genes are transcribed as multigenic transcripts, which are cleaved and polyadenylated to yield mature mRNAs. Not all proteins necessary for mitochondrial function are encoded by the mitochondrial genome; most are coded by genes in the cell nucleus and the corresponding proteins are imported into the mitochondrion. The exact number of genes encoded by the nucleus and the mitochondrial genome differs between species. Most mitochondrial genomes are circular, although exceptions have been reported. In general, mitochondrial DNA lacks introns, {{as is the case in}} the human mitochondrial genome; however, introns have been observed in some eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> yeast and protists, including Dictyostelium discoideum. Between protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present. During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. Mitochondrial tRNA genes have different sequences from the nuclear tRNAs but lookalikes of mitochondrial tRNAs have been found in the nuclear chromosomes with high sequence similarity.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees of the {{subgenus}} Psithyrus (known as 'cuckoo bumblebees', and formerly {{considered a}} separate genus) are brood parasites, sometimes called kleptoparasites, {{in the colonies}} of other bumblebees, and have {{lost the ability to}} collect pollen. Before finding and invading a host colony, a Psithyrus female, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Psithyrus species of B. sylvestris, feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. Usually, cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen-intolerant inquilines, since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring, though some species, such as B. bohemicus, actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive.|$|E
5|$|Cairano's career covers {{just over}} two decades (circa 1490–1510), a {{relatively}} short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed {{mainly because of the}} greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
25|$|A study {{into the}} {{long-term}} {{effect of the}} oil spill on bird numbers found that certain species, in particular the American coot, had shown a significant decline.
