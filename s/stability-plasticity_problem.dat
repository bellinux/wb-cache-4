40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{architecture}} for incremental online learning in high-dimensional feature spaces {{and apply it}} on a mobile robot. The model is based on learning vector quantization, approaching the <b>stability-plasticity</b> <b>problem</b> of incremental learn-ing by adaptive insertions of representative vectors. We employ a cost-function-based learning vector quantization approach and introduce a new insertion strategy optimizing a cost-function based on a subset of samples. We demonstrate this model within a real-time application for a mobile robot scenario, where we perform interactive real-time learning of visual categories. I...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{learning}} {{solves the}} <b>stability-plasticity</b> <b>problem</b> (Fusi et al., 2000 a) but raises new {{issues related to}} the generation of the proper noise driving the synaptic dynamics. Here we show that a simple, fully deterministic, spike-driven synaptic device can make use of the network generated vari- ability in the neuronal activity to drive the required stochastic mechanism. Randomness emerges naturally from the interaction of deterministic neu- rons, and no extra source of noise is needed. Learning and forgetting rates of the network can be easily controlled by changing the statistics of the spike trains without changing any inherent parameter of the synaptic dynamics. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Fundamental to {{the problem}} of lifelong machine {{learning}} is how to consolidate the knowledge of a learned task within a long-term memory structure (domain knowledge) without the loss of prior knowledge. We investigate the effect of curriculum, ie. the order in which tasks are learned, on the consolidation of task knowledge. Relevant background material on knowledge transfer and consolidation using multiple task learning (MTL) neural networks is reviewed. A large MTL network is used as the long-term memory structure and task rehearsal overcomes the <b>stability-plasticity</b> <b>problem</b> and the loss of prior knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that curriculum has an important effect on the accuracy of consolidated knowledge particularly for the first few tasks that are learned. The results also suggest that, for given set of tasks and training examples, the mean accuracy of consolidated domain knowledge converges to the same level regardless of the curriculum. I...|$|E
40|$|Electronic neuromorphic devices with on-chip, on-line {{learning}} {{should be able}} to modify quickly the synaptic couplings to acquire information about new patterns to be stored (synaptic plasticity) and, at the same time, preserve this information on very long time scales (synaptic stability). Here, we illustrate the electronic implementation of a simple solution to this <b>stability-plasticity</b> <b>problem,</b> recently proposed and studied in various contexts. It is based on the observation that reducing the analog depth of the synapses to the extreme (bistable synapses) does not necessarily disrupt the performance of the device as an associative memory, provided that 1) the number of neurons is large enough; 2) the transitions between stable synaptic states are stochastic; and 3) learning is slow. The drastic reduction of the analog depth of the synaptic variable also makes this solution appealing {{from the point of view}} of electronic implementation and offers a simple methodological alternative to the technological solution based on floating gates. We describe the full custom analog very large-scale integration (VLSI) realization of a small network of integrate-and-fire neurons connected by bistable deterministic plastic synapses which can implement the idea of stochastic learning. In the absence of stimuli, the memory is preserved indefinitely. During the stimulation the synapse undergoes quick temporary changes through the activities of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons; those changes stochastically result in a long-term modification of the synaptic efficacy. The intentionally disordered pattern of connectivity allows the system to generate a randomness suited to drive the stochastic selection mechanism. We check by a suitable stimulation protocol that the stochastic synaptic pla [...] ...|$|E
