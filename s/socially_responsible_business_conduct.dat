This paper focuses {{on the relationship between}} the religious belief of corporate decision-makers and <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>conduct.</b> Based on in-depth interviews with twenty Dutch executives from different religious backgrounds, we find much inductive evidence of a relationship between their conception of God, norms and values and business conduct. We also find that executives with a monotheistic conception of God display a stronger orientation toward <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> than executives with a pantheistic conception of God. ...|$|E

A distinction can be made between “hard” and “soft” transaction costs. Soft transaction costs are difficult to quantify but become more important in strategic business decisions now that formal trade barriers gradually disappear and transport costs are reduced.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{demonstrate}} the unique circumstances that China poses {{for the development of}} <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> in China. <b>Socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> is a concept that has emerged in Western nations in recent years, due to the growing environmental and social consciousness of consumers and their increasing demands for companies to meet higher standards in this regard. <b>Socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> refers to those corporate entities that use the market to stimulate change in peoples’ awareness of and attitudes toward a certain social issue and, ultimately, consumer behavior and habits. China’s irresponsible corporate environment has resulted in harmful and threatening consequences, and the development of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> is needed to reverse this unsustainable trend. This thesis identifies the key drivers of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business,</b> surveys the state of those drivers in China, and draws conclusions about the likely evolution of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> in China in the coming years. The conclusions demonstrate the important roles that different actors must take for this evolution to take place. The Chinese Communist Party recognizes the need for change within the corporate world, yet its rhetoric and regulations regarding corporate social responsibility are vague and do not have the institutional support for implementation and enforcement. Civil society, a medium through which <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> has developed in other nations, is growing with the environmental and social awareness of citizens, yet still remains closely monitored and restricted by the government. Ultimately, Chinese consumers will be the key to reversing the irresponsible business environment, just as they have been in other nations. We are already beginning to see the roots of this movement with consumers expressing that they are no longer willing to accept the status quo; however, they must channel these demand into their purchasing decisions in order to truly incentivize the Chinese business community to become more <b>socially</b> <b>responsible...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) is closely intertwined with increased engagement with stakeholders and integration of their concerns into core business processes. In this respect, stakeholders’ viewpoint of CSR is deemed to be essential in shaping pertinent policies, plans and programs. However, current literature indicates {{an emphasis on the}} managerialist perspective whereas insights of non-business social constituents are considerably underrepresented. This is where this paper seeks to contribute by attempting to examine the non-governmental organizations’ perceptions of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>conduct.</b> Findings suggest that NGOs perceptions reflect two dominant views, a progressive viewpoint where socially responsible behavior offers win-win opportunities and a narrow perspective where wider responsibility is an unfruitful business practice. Nevertheless, different types of NGOs attributed similar importance on a number of socially responsible practices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the Islamic religion and the level of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>conduct</b> (SRBC) of Islamic entrepreneurs. We find that the common idea of SRBC corresponds with the view of business in the Islam, although there are also some notable differences. We also find that Muslim entrepreneurs attach a higher weight to specific elements of SRBC than non- Muslims. But, on the other hand, we find that Muslims are less involved with applying SRBC in practice than non-Muslim managers. Furthermore, values and norms derived from the Islamic religion motivate entrepreneurs to contribute more to SRBC and lead to a higher commitment to specific aspects of SRBC compared to individually developed values and norms. Finally, the view of human nature of the Islam, preaching the natural goodness of man as a social being, leads to a positive view of SRBC. ...|$|E

Transaction management purports to minimise the transaction costs associated with this fragmentation {{of production}}.

Islam et al. (2016) emphasised that implementation of anti-corruption and decent labour practices is essential to improve sustainability performance of financial institutions. Khan et al.
