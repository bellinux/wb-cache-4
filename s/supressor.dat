Among other functions, a prominent role for the CPE has been identified in oogenesis, spermatogenesis, mitosis, {{and the growth of}} new synapses The role of the CPE was first characterized in Xenopus oocytes and embryos but recent research has identified roles for the CPE in somatic cells. Some proto-oncogene mRNAs have been shown to contain CPEs. One such gene is Myc. The level of production of the different CPEB proteins determines whether the expression of Myc leads to tumor formation. The tumor <b>supressor</b> gene TP53 has also been shown to be regulated by a CPE. Cell lines that do not produce CPEB show lower levels of the protein p53 and become immortal instead of showing senescence.|$|E
50|$|SMO plays a {{key role}} in {{transcriptional}} repression and activation by the zinc-finger transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci; known as Gli in vertebrates). When the hedgehog pathway is inactive, a complex of Fused (Fu), <b>Supressor</b> of Fused (Sufu), and the kinesin motor protein Costal-2 (Cos2) tether Ci to microtubules. In this complex, Cos2 promotes proteolytic cleavage of Ci by activating hyperphosphorylation of Ci and subsequent recruitment of ubiquitin ligase; the cleaved Ci goes on to act as a repressor of hedgehog-activated transcription. However, when hedgehog signaling is active, Ci remains intact and acts as a transcriptional activator of the same genes that its cleaved form suppresses. SMO has been shown to bind Costal-2 and play a role in the localization of the Ci complex and prevention of Ci cleavage. Additionally, it is known that vertebrate SMO contributes to the activation of Gli as a transcription factor via association with ciliary structures such as Evc2, but these mechanisms are not fully understood.|$|E

Lately, several other forms of senescence independent of the proliferative history and telomere shortening were described. This is called premature senescence, and can be elicited by exposure of cells to aberrant mitogenic or oncogenic signals, to oxidative stress or to variety of chemically and functionally unrelated DNA damaging agents. Senescent cells alter their morphology and expression pattern. This complex phenotype is characterized by enlarged cytoplasm, activation of cell cycle inhibitors, expression of tumor <b>supressors</b> and profound changes in cell secretory phenotype.

There are macrophages in infiltrates (to 30 %). Activity of eNOS in endothelium of vessels is increased. The CD 105 synthesis was observed in dermal dendrocytes, immune cells of infiltrates and in single macrophages. The latters give the most number of CD 105 + among immune cells.

In an attempt to identify genes whose products may interact with that of Notch, we designed a genetic screen aimed at identifying <b>supressors</b> of certain Notch mutations which are known to affect the extracellular epidermal growth factor homologous domain of Notch. Mutations in two neurogenic loci were identified as suppressors: Delta, whose product was recently shown to interact with Notch and mastermind. In addition, a third, X-linked gene was shown capable of acting as a suppressor. We show that this gene is the deltex locus, characterize the phenotype of deltex mutations, and demonstrate both a maternal and zygotic action of the locus. All deltex alleles behave as recessive viables affecting wing, ocellar and eye morphology. There are allele specific interactions between deltex and various Notch alleles; for example, deltex mutants with a reduced dosage of wild-type Notch die as pupae. deltex also interacts with Delta and mastermind in a fashion that is formally analogous to its interaction with Notch.

40|$|Motivation: The {{detection}} of genomic regions unusually rich {{in a given}} pattern is an important undertaking {{in the analysis of}} next generation sequencing data. Recent studies of chromosomal trans-locations in activated B lymphocytes have identified regions that are frequently translocated to c-myc oncogene. A quantitative method for the identification of translocation hotspots was crucial to this study. Here we improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots. A key feature of our method is that it provides a global chromosome-wide nominal control level to clustering, as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria. Whilst being motivated by a specific application, the dete-ction of unusual clusters is a widespread problem in bioinformatics. We expect our method to be useful in the analysis of data from other experimental approaches such as of ChIP-seq and 4 C-seq. Results: The analysis of translocations from B lymphocytes with the method described here reveals the presence of longer hotspots when compared to those defined previously. Further, we show that the hot-spot size changes quite substantially in the absence of DNA repair protein 53 BP 1. When 53 BP 1 deficiency is combined with overexpres-sion of activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) the hotspot length increases even further. These changes are not detected by previous methods that use local significance criteria for clustering.

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} response to acute cutaneous injury is a multi-step, coordinated process involving resident {{cells of the}} integument as well as cellular mediators of immunity recruited from the circulation. Once in place, these cells are able to orchestrate the tissue repair and remodeling process by elaborating a host of polypeptide cytokines, that have potent stimulatory and inhibitory effects on various extracellular matrix (ECM) genes. The production and degradation of type I collagen is a critical aspect of this ECM remodeling in human skin during both wound repair and normal physiologic states. Type I collagen synthesis is strongly affected by inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interferon-γ (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Specifically, TGF-β is a potent inducer of type I collagen synthesis while both IFN-γ and TNF-α are strong <b>supressors</b> of type I collagen gene transcription and subsequent protein production. ^ Earlier studies documented that TNF-α inhibits type I collagen gene transcription in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHF), and we have previously shown that {{the region of the}} human α 2 (I) collagen promoter between - 271 and - 235, contains an essential TGF-β response element which allows antagonistic activity by TNF-α. The inhibitory response to TNF-α in vitro has now been localized to a specific region that contains non-canonical AP- 1 and NF-κB binding sites. TNF-α-mediated inhibition of CAT activity was eliminated by mutation of the NF-κB binding element. Gel mobility shift assays of human fibroblast nuclear extracts demonstrated enhanced binding of a specific factor that gel-supershift assays identified as the NF-κB(p 50 /p 65) heterodimer. These data suggest that in fibroblasts TNF-α activates the transcription factor NF-κB (p 50 /p 65) which binds the COL 1 A 2 promoter and is responsible for the observed inhibition of α 2 (I) collagen gene transcription. ^ In a similar approach, we also examined the effect that IFN-γ had on the activity of the COL 1 A 2 promoter in vitro. Using transient transfection analyses of proximal promoter/CAT plasmids, we identified a previously uncharacterized region between - 161 and - 125 of the proximal promoter that mediated transcriptional repression by IFN-γ. Furthermore, we identified an unknown, multisubunit complex that specifically bound this element which was affected by the same mutations responsible for abrogating the IFN-γ response in vitro. ^ The activation of the TNF-α receptor complex initiates an expansive signaling cascade responsible for NF-κB activation, activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, and the induction of apoptosis. To date, two main TNF receptor 1 (TNFR 1) dependent pathways have been well described: TNF-a receptor-associated molecules and ceramide signaling. The TNF receptor associated death domain (TRADD) and associated factors (TRAFs) are responsible for induction of apoptosis and NF-κB activation. Herein, we have demonstrated that acidic sphingomyelinase, TRADD and TRAF 2 inhibit the COL 1 A 2 promoter and the TRADD/TRAF 2 -mediated inhibition of COL 1 A 2 transcription is independent of NF-κB. These results contribute to the general understanding of transcriptional control of COL 1 A 2 by TNF-α and IFN-α and the signaling mechanisms utilized by TNF-α in repressing COL 1 A 2 gene expression. ...|$|R

The most effective treatment (pegylated interferon and ribavirin) has variable response rates, between 45 e 80 %, and major side effects. Treatment duration depends on viral genotype and virological response after the first 12 weeks on therapy. Genotype and viral load are independent factors of response. However, the question is why hosts infected with same genotype and similar viral loads have different treatment response rates. Genotype 1, high viral load, higher quasispecies diversity, NS 5 A interferon determining sensitivity domain variations was associated with lower responses. Others identified host factors for therapy response such as race, gene expression, HLA-DRB and class I alleles and cytokine gene polymorphisms as interferon-, TNF-, interferon response genes. Gene expression analysis by microarrays found 8 genes as response discriminants. Pre-treatment cytokine and <b>supressors</b> of cytokine levels may also correlate with treatment response. Our aim was to analyse if host genetic polymorphisms related to Th 1 immune response polarization, hepatic lesion mechanisms and signaling after TCR activation or IFN signaling - OPN, TNF-, ACP 1 respectivelly could explain different treatment responses. We also analysed healthy individuals and correlated OPN plasma levels and OPN genotypes. Patients with HCV genotype 1 and 4 were included. Matherial: 95 patients treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin were selected. Control group included healthy blood donors. HC group was classified according to treatment response type: non responders (NR); end of treatment response and relapse (RR); Sustained response (SR). Absence of SR (NSR) = NR+RR. Methods: Blood was collected for DNA and plasma extraction. Genetic polymorphisms were performed by PCR-RFLP: 8090 OPN (C/T), - 308 TNF- (A/G), ACP 1 (A/B/C). Plasma OPN concentrations measured by ELISA commercial Kit. Statistical analysis: SPSS vs 13. Results: OPN and ACP 1 genotype distribution was signifficantly different in subjects with HC in comparison with those of control group. OPN TT genotype, TNF- GG, ACP 1 AA and AB are more frequent in HC group. OR for HC was : 2, 22 if OPN TT genotype, 1, 57 if TNF- AA or AG, and 9, 99 if ACP 1 with lower phosphatasic activity. 87 CHC patients were infected by genotype 1 virus and 8 by genotype 4. According to treatment response HC subgroups are: 43 NR, 16 RR, 36 SR and 59 NSR. No significant differences were observed between those groups concerning age, sex, viral load, histological activity and fibrosis stages. OPN TT allele carriers predominate in NSR and CC predominate in SR. OR for SR versus NSR is 3, 32 if one T allele is present and 0, 29 if one C allele is present. TNF- and ACP 1 genotypes were not significantly different is those treatment response subgroups. NSR has lower median plasma OPN levels. Also TT genotypes had lower levels. RR patients had the lowest levels plasma OPN levels. Conclusions: our results suggest that both OPN and ACP 1 genotypes are related to HC susceptibility. OPN genotype is a host factor related to treatment response and that there is a trend toward higher median plasma OPN levels in responders...|$|R
40|$|An SGA {{approach}} to discover cdc 13 - 1 ts <b>supressors.</b> Telomeres, the DNA-protein complexes {{at the end}} of eukaryotic chromosomes, are essential for chromosomal stability. In yeast, the telomeric single-strand binding protein Cdc 13 p has multiple important roles related to telomere maintenance: (1) telomeric"capping" [...] protection of telomeres by forming complexes with yKu 70 / 80 and with Stn 1 p/Ten 1 p; (2) positive regulation of telomere replication via interaction with Est 1 p, which is a part of telomerase; (3) negative regulation of telomerase by the recruitment of telomere elongation suppressors Stn 1 p and Ten 1 p. In an attempt to identify genes that are involved in the deleterious outcome of an absence of Cdc 13 p, we screened the yeast gene knock-out library for genes that could suppress the growth defect of cdc 13 - 1 cells at 33 ê C. For this purpose, we performed an SGA array experiment. We scored for the ability of double mutant haploids to grow at 33 ê C. Eventually, we hoped to find the elusive genes involved in telomere 5 '-end processing (exonucleases). Based on the comparative analysis of growth properties of the strains (23 ê C vs 33 ê C), the initial screen identified up to 111 genes that displayed an apparent growth at 33 ê C. In order to verify these results, diploids were regenerated, sporulated, microdissected, and haploid double mutants cdc 13 - 1 yfg[deletion] were isolated from 38 potential cdc 13 - 1 suppressors. Unfortunately, this verification failed to reproduce a suppression of the growth defect by any of the selected genes at any temperature. While disappointing, the results reemphasize that careful re-examination of large scale SGA approaches are indispensable before going on to more involved experimentation. Similarities and differences between adaptation to DNA double-strand break and to telomere uncapping in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was previously shown that a certain proportion of telomerase negative survivor cells (both type I and type II cells) is able to survive {{in the absence of the}} telomere capping protein Cdc 13 p. These strains (named [deletion] 13 s) were characterized in great detail and one of their discovered features was a striking ability to continuously inactivate DNA-damage checkpoints. Based on structural similarities between DNA double strand breaks (DSB) and unprotected telomeres, we attempted to verify if the molecular mechanisms regulating adaptation to a single irreparable DSB also regulate adaptation to a loss of Cdc 13 p. For this purpose we created three tlc 1 [deletion] cdc 13 [deletion] strains also harboring DSB adaptation related mutations tid 1 [deletion], ptc 2 [deletion] and rfa 1 -t 11. After deprotection of their telomeres, mutant survivor cells showed similar cell cycle progression patterns as compared to the cells where a single irreparable DSB was introduced. Adaptation defective mutants tid 1 [deletion] and ptc 2 [deletion] demonstrated an inability to adapt to telomere uncapping and to resume cell cycle. Interestingly, cells harboring the rfa 1 -t 11 allele, which was reported to suppress adaptation defects of other mutations, did not show any distinguishable phenotype in terms of initial adaptation to telomere deprotection; i. e. rfa 1 -t 11 mutant survivors do escape the G 2 /M arrest and re-enter the cell cycle. However, all three mutant survivor strains failed to produce viable [deletion] 13 capping independent cells, which is consistent with the hypothesis that adaptation to loss of Cdc 13 p depends on the same pathway as the previously reported adaptation phenomenon. Finally, we report the surprising finding that if cells had once experienced an adapted [deletion] 13 state, they will re-produce capping negative survivors much more readily. Thus, while a culture of type II survivor cells generates [deletion] 13 s at a rate of about 1 × 10 - 5 events per division, cells that had been [deletion] 13 s and re-transformed with a Cdc 13 p carrying plasmid will produce capping independent cells at about 1 × 10 - 2 events per division. We are currently examining why these cells re-generate [deletion] 13 cell lines more readily and suspect structural differences in telomere terminal sequence arrangements...|$|R

Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} new prognostic factors, by using a prognostic model, that could help to identify the patient group with the greatest probability of death. Patients and Methods: First, the clinicopathological variables were analyzed. Second, microvessels were immunohistochemically (IHC) stained with factor VIII-related antibody and then counted in the most intense vascularization area or hotspot, using an automatic image analyzer. In addition, biological angiogenesis-related factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression (iNOS) were also studied. Finally, we evaluated the IHC expression of p 53 and p 21 WAF 1 tumor <b>supressor</b> proteins. Results: The significant independent predictors were: tumor size (p= 0. 0063), angiogenesis (p= 0. 0271) and p 21 WAF 1 (p= 0. 0478). Thus, th...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease caused by genetic and {{epigenetic}} changes. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes are key landmarks in tumor progression. However, the list of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes is far from complete, even {{in the case of}} the tumor types that are best characterized, such as colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death in the Western world and is a serious health issue for the European Union. Patients having stage III or IV cancer undergo surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, the clinical management of these patients is far from optimal, and only about 30 % of the patients show an objective response to even the best chemotherapeutic agents available. In this study genome-wide high throughput assays were used to better characterize important aspects of the oncogenic progression such as deregulation of proliferation and aberrant expression caused by epigenetic mechanisms. Because rapid tumor proliferation is associated with poor patient prognosis, here we characterized the transcriptional signature of rapidly proliferating colorectal cancer cells in an attempt to identify genes important to sustain tumor growth and that could be used as novel therapeutic targets. The proliferation rate of 52 colorectal cancer cell lines was determined and genome-wide expression profiling of a subset of these lines was assessed by microarray analysis. The expression of 1, 290 genes was significantly correlated with the growth rates of colorectal cancer cells. These included genes involved in cell cycle, RNA processing/splicing and protein transport. Glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPDX) were shown to have higher expression in faster growing cancer cells. Importantly, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of GAPDH or PPDX reduced the growth of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the profound transcriptional reprogramming observed in cancer cells, we investigated the association between the levels of DNA methylation in the promoters of > 14, 000 genes and the levels of expression of these genes in a panel of 45 colorectal cancer cell lines. A group of cell lines with significantly higher methylation levels was observed, supporting the notion that there is a group of colorectal tumors with a CpG methylator phenotype (CIMP+). A significant negative regulation between methylation and expression levels was observed for 1, 409 genes, suggesting that these genes are silenced during the tumorigenic process through this epigenetic mechanism. A significant number of these genes were zinc finger proteins, suggesting an important role of these DNA-binding proteins on the tumorigenic process. Strikingly, approximately one fourth of these genes are not associated with CpG islands, indicating that DNA methylation outside these CpG rich regions is an important mechanism regulating gene expression and significantly contribute to tumor progression. In addition, we postulate that at least some of those genes have tumor suppressor activity. As a proof-of-concept, we show that restoration of the expression of ZNF 238, a gene showing a significant methylation/expression correlation, resulted in reduced growth of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, in this study we shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the uncontrolled proliferation of colon cancer cells and the expression reprograming imposed in these cells through CpG methylation. The results of this study may contribute to the identification of novel chemotherapeutic targets for patients with colorectal cancer, and the characterization of novel genes/pathways with tumor suppressor activity, that are epigenetically silenced. El càncer colorectal és una malaltia causada per canvis genètics i epigenètics. La inactivació de gens <b>supressors</b> de tumors i l'activació d'oncogens són fites clau en la progressió tumoral. Els pacients amb càncer en estadi III o IV són sotmesos a cirurgia seguida de quimioteràpia. No obstant això, només el 30 % dels pacients mostren una resposta objectiva fins i tot als millors agents quimioterapèutics disponibles. En aquest estudi es van utilitzar assajos d'alt rendiment de tot el genoma per caracteritzar millor els aspectes importants de la progressió oncogènica, com la desregulació de la proliferació i l'expressió aberrant causada per mecanismes epigenètics.

40|$|The role of {{oncogene}} or tumor <b>supressor</b> gene in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated malignant lymphomas (MLs) {{is poorly}} understood. We examined 36 MLs (21 EBV positive and 15 EBV negative) and 6 reactive hyperplasias {{for the presence}} of myc gene amplification. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology was used to examine the state of amplification of the proto-oncogene c-myc in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Variable degrees of myc gene amplification were detected in reactive hyperplasias and MLs. However, significant increase of c-myc copy numbers above 3 times were only found in 12 out of 31 non-Hodgkin's MLs (38. 7 %), in which 6 cases were EBV positive and 6 cases were EBV negative. In conclusion, myc gene amplification appears to play a part in MLs but no correlation was found between EBV infection and myc gene amplification...|$|E
40|$|The {{human skin}} {{acts as a}} {{physical}} and immunological barrier to outside toxicants, microorganisms and harmful irradiations. Utraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun might potentially {{play an active role}} in regulating several biological events. It has become clear that UV exposure (especially 280 - 320 nm) can also affect spesific and nonspesific immun responses. Langerhans cells, regulatory T cells, active B cells, mast cells, NKT cells and some mediators, including cisurocanic acid, serotonin, platelet activating factor (PAF), and nitric oxide (NO) seem to {{play a crucial role in}} the induction of UVB-induced immunsupression. IL- 10 from keratinocytes, mast cells and <b>supressor</b> B cells is noteworthy as a most important cytokine in the development of immunsupression. UV-induced immunsupression may block antigenic stimulus on the skin, and allow of a balanced apoptosis and DNA repair. ...|$|E

40|$|The tumour <b>supressor</b> protein p 53 plays a {{key role}} in the cell's {{decision}} to arrest the cell cycle or undergo apoptosis following a genotoxic insult. p 53 is stabilized and activated after DNA damage, however the cascade of events signalling from DNA lesions to p 53 stabilization and activation is still controversial. Poly (ADPribosylation) of di€erent nuclear acceptors by PARP- 1 is an early event when a single strand DNA lesion is produced. We present here evidences that interplay between PARP- 1 and p 53 is dependent on the type of damage induced to DNA. Primary mouse embryonic ®broblasts derived from parp- 17 / 7 mice exhibited decreased p 53 accumulation and activation following g-irradiation compared to parp- 1 pro®cient cells.

40|$|<b>Supressor</b> {{cells in}} the spleens of overtly {{autoimmune}} NZB X NZW (B/W) mice, but not age matched normal strain mice, were shown to release a small, less than 20, 000 Dalton factor which inhibited early events in the anti-SRBC PFC response and the mitogenic response. This splenic inhibitory factor (SIF) was (i) stable on heating (56 degrees, 30 min) and freezine (- 70 degrees); (ii) non-specific for antigen; (iii) absorbed and/or inactivated by target cells in young B/W spleen cell cultures and (iv) released gradually into the culture medium by metabolically active cells. SIF also blocked the T-cell replacing effect of allogeneic factor (TRF) in the anti-SRBC response. These observations suggest that SIF {{may lead to the}} immunodepressed state in overtly autoimmune B/W mice by preventing the activation or differentiation of lymphocytes responding to exogenous antigen...|$|E

A methodology was ceveloped to assay specific antigens {{and to determine}} optimal doses for sensitization and elicitation of DTH in mice. CL strain is predominantly myotropic strain which does not produce important parasitism of mononuclear phagocyte cells; these cells appear to control infection when activated in vivo. Maximum protection was seen in this study when BCG and cyclophosphamide were associated, but protection was observed also when cyclophosphamide, that prevents <b>supressor</b> T cells, was applied 2 days before flagellar fraction sensitization in normal mice. These experiments suggested that the macrophage may {{have an important role}} in the early phases of infection particularly when nonspecific stimulation is associated with specific sensitization.

40|$|SummaryThe {{quiescent}} center (QC) {{maintains the}} activity of the surrounding stem cells within the root stem cell niche, yet specific molecular players sustaining the low rate of QC cell division remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factor, BRAVO (BRASSINOSTEROIDS AT VASCULAR AND ORGANIZING CENTER), acting as a cell-specific repressor of QC divisions in the primary root of Arabidopsis. Ectopic BRAVO expression restricts overall root growth and ceases root regeneration upon damage of the stem cells, demonstrating the role of BRAVO in counteracting Brassinosteroid (BR) -mediated cell division in the QC cells. Interestingly, BR-regulated transcription factor BES 1 (BRI 1 -EMS <b>SUPRESSOR</b> 1) directly represses and physically interacts with BRAVO in vivo, creating a switch that modulates QC divisions at the root stem cell niche. Together, our results define a mechanism for BR-mediated regulation of stem cell quiescence in plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of responder and nonresponder strains of mice to generate suppressor cells and factors to two antigens under MHC linked Ir gene control was investigated. Eight different H- 2 types (H- 2 b,d,f,k,p,q,r,s) {{as well as}} seven independently derived strains (B 10, BALB/c, CBA/Ca, A/St, DBA/ 2, P/J, SJL) were tested, and all yielded suppressor factor (SF) to (T,G) -A [...] L and GAT. This indicated that the genetic control of SF production was {{different from that of}} helper cell induction. Unlike previous reports of GAT suppressor extracts that GAT-specific <b>supressor</b> factors acted equally on both responder and nonresponder strains.
