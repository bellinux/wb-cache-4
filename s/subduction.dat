5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a <b>subduction</b> zone. A <b>subduction</b> zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from <b>subduction,</b> and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subduction,</b> having ceased at the {{existing}} zone, eventually reinitiated {{further to the}} west as the current Cascadia <b>subduction</b> zone. Volcanism from the new <b>subduction</b> zone (such as the Grays River Volcanics and Northcraft Volcanics) reached the surface about 42 Ma, thereby initiating {{the rise of the}} ancestral Cascade Range.|$|E
5|$|The {{still largely}} unexplained tectonic {{causes of the}} {{volcanism}} that has produced the Silverthrone Caldera are a matter of ongoing research. Silverthrone is not above a hotspot as are Nazko or Hawaii. However, {{it may be a}} product of the Cascadia <b>subduction</b> zone because andesite, basaltic andesite, dacite and rhyolite {{can be found at the}} volcano and elsewhere along the <b>subduction</b> zone. At issue are the current plate configuration and rate of <b>subduction</b> but Silverthrone's chemistry indicates that Silverthrone is <b>subduction</b> related.|$|E
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} <b>subduction</b> zone, halting <b>subduction</b> of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the outcome}} of the {{continental}} migration, the continued <b>subduction</b> process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the <b>subduction</b> and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subduction</b> of {{the eastern}} part of Nazca plate beneath the western margin of the South America Plate occurs {{at a rate of about}} , a process which is {{responsible}} for events such as the 1960 Valdivia earthquake and the 2010 Chile earthquake. This <b>subduction</b> process is responsible for the growth of the Chilean Andes and the volcanic and geothermal manifestations therein.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the <b>subduction</b> interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average <b>subduction</b> zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical <b>subduction</b> zone earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by shallower <b>subduction</b> zones, with no present-day volcanism. These shallower zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting plate creates a flat <b>subduction</b> zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The <b>subduction</b> of spreading ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder <b>subduction,</b> reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E
5|$|The Gangdese {{batholith}} {{was formed}} as this <b>subduction</b> continued {{along the southern}} margin of the Lhasa terrane.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the Andes {{occurs in}} four {{distinct}} regions: the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone, and the Austral Volcanic Zone. All {{but the last}} are geographically associated with the <b>subduction</b> of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate; the Austral Volcanic Zone involves the <b>subduction</b> of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South American Plate.|$|E
5|$|Monte Burney is {{a volcano}} in {{southern}} Chile, {{part of its}} Austral Volcanic Zone which consists of six volcanoes with activity during the Quaternary. This volcanism {{is linked to the}} <b>subduction</b> of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate and the Scotia Plate.|$|E
5|$|Other strong quakes {{occurred}} on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly {{and one more}} by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes {{just south of the}} city center, neither it nor the Cascadia <b>subduction</b> zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia <b>subduction</b> zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.|$|E
5|$|South {{of where}} the Chile Rise intersects the Peru-Chile Trench, the trench disappears as it is {{increasingly}} buried by sediments. However, <b>subduction</b> is still active {{as evidenced by the}} converging motion of the Antarctic Plate and the South America Plate and the volcanic activity. Only around 52° does the convergence change into strike-slip faulting at the Shackleton Fracture Zone. <b>Subduction</b> in that area commenced 17 million years ago, and the Antarctic slab has not sunk deep into the mantle. At shallow depth, magma generation is dominated by anatexis of the slab. The mantle ahead of the edge of the subducting slab may be dominated by a large slab window.|$|E
5|$|Taftan {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} arc in Iran, together with Bazman, also in Iran, and Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan. This volcanic arc has formed on Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary layers and has resulted from the <b>subduction</b> of the oceanic Arabian plate beneath Iran at the Makran trench.|$|E
5|$|The Altiplano {{started to}} form during the Eocene, when <b>subduction</b> of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate caused {{compression}} along the plate margin. Strong volcanism and tectonic uplift occurred between 15and 20million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Cascadia <b>subduction</b> zone rarely {{influences}} the western portion of Washington state, but the November 1873 M7.3 shock near the California–Oregon border {{may have been}} associated with it. Although activity in the Pacific Northwest (especially west of the Cascades in Washington) has occasionally been located near the <b>subduction</b> zone, earthquakes there (1949 Olympia, 1965 Puget Sound, 2001 Nisqually) have mostly been intraslab events. A large M7 earthquake on the Seattle Fault in 900 C.E. may have generated a tsunami in Puget Sound. The 1872 event east of the Cascades is not understood well {{due to the lack of}} instrumental records and reliable felt intensity reports.|$|E
5|$|The La Reforma {{volcanic}} rocks feature an anomalous chemistry {{resembling the}} calc-alkaline magma series, even though La Reforma {{is not a}} <b>subduction</b> zone volcano. This {{is consistent with the}} geochemistry of nearby Tres Virgenes, although one pyroclastic flow at La Reforma was considered peralkaline.|$|E
5|$|The lithosphere, which rides {{atop the}} asthenosphere, {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as <b>subduction.</b> Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of <b>subduction.</b> The <b>subduction</b> process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Fueguino {{is part of}} the Austral Volcanic Zone, which is formed by the <b>subduction</b> of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate. The subducting plate has not reached a depth sufficient for proper volcanic arc volcanism, however.|$|E
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia <b>subduction</b> zone.|$|E
5|$|Any {{model of}} the origin of Siletzia must account for {{interactions}} with plate boundaries that were being subducted under North America through the Eocene. Early studies were plagued by indeterminate locations for these boundaries, particularly of the Kula-Farallon (K-F) spreading ridge: basalts {{at the head of the}} Gulf of Alaska (along the Alaska panhandle) have ages and compositions corresponding to the Siletz volcanics, suggesting that the K-F ridge was offshore of the Yukon at the same time it was offshore of Washington. This can be resolved by assuming that by about 56 Ma the eastern part of the Kula plate had broken away to form the Resurrection plate, with the new Kula-Resurrection (K-R) spreading ridge running up the Gulf of Alaska towards Kodiak Island, and the former K-F (now R-F) ridge reaching Washington. <b>Subduction</b> of this plate under western Canada was rapid, and it disappeared entirely with <b>subduction</b> of the K-R ridge about 50 Ma.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is losing}} mass {{at a rate}} of 200kg/second. If mass loss at this rate {{continued}} for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite would have lost approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that tectonics in the south polar region is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated <b>subduction</b> caused by the process of mass loss.|$|E
5|$|Lastarria is {{a volcano}} that {{lies on the}} border between Chile and Argentina. It is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the four {{segments}} of the volcanic arc of the Andes. Several volcanoes are located in this chain of volcanoes, which is formed by <b>subduction</b> of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate.|$|E
5|$|Magnesium-poor adakites {{have been}} found at Monte Burney. Fueguino {{volcanic}} rocks also include adakites but these are richer in magnesium. These adakitic magmas reflect the <b>subduction</b> of a relatively hot and young Antarctic Plate. In the case of Monte Burney, these magmas then underwent some fractionation during ascent, as it was retarded by the tectonic regimen, which is somewhat compressive.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} {{territory}} of Chile is subject to earthquakes, arising from strains in the subducting Nazca and South American Plates or shallow strike-slip faults. The <b>subduction</b> zone along the Chilean coast produced the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Some earthquakes which occurred near the epicentre of the 11 March 2010 event are the 1985 Algarrobo and Rapel Lake earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{volcanism}} in Chile {{is relative}} to <b>subduction</b> of the Nazca Plate; the Chile Ridge exhibits submarine volcanism, and volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone is {{triggered by the}} Antarctic Plate subducting beneath the South American Plate. One hundred ninety-eight South American volcanoes are on the Global Volcanism Program's Holocene volcano list.|$|E
5|$|Siletzia is {{the massive}} {{formation}} of early to middle Eocene epoch marine basalts and interbedded sediments in the forearc of the Cascadia <b>subduction</b> zone; this forms the basement rock under western Oregon and Washington {{and the southern}} tip of Vancouver Island. It is now fragmented into the Siletz and Crescent terranes.|$|E
5|$|Situated on {{the western}} fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines {{experiences}} frequent seismic and volcanic activity. The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic <b>subduction.</b> Around 20 earthquakes are registered daily, though most are too weak to be felt. The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subduction</b> of the Guadalupe Plate/Farallon Plate beneath Baja California was {{prevalent}} in the region until 12,5–11 million years ago; volcanic activity since then is due to tectonic changes associated {{with the development of}} the Gulf of California. Earlier subduction-related volcanism during the Miocene formed the volcanic deposits of the Comondú Group.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subduction</b> of the Nazca Plate {{beneath the}} South America plate is {{responsible}} for most of the volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone. After activity in the western Maricunga Belt volcanic arc ceased six million years ago, volcanism started up in the Incapillo region, forming the high volcanoes Monte Pissis, Cerro Bonete Chico and Sierra de Veladero. Later, a number of lava domes formed between these volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|The Algoman orogeny {{occurred}} 2800 to , and {{it marks}} {{the end of}} the crust-building Archean Eon. There were several episodes of continental collision, compression and <b>subduction</b> which resulted in mountain building during this time. Orogenic events are characterized by extensive metaphorism, granitic extrusions and unconformities. The Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ).|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} Japan {{are located in}} a {{volcanic}} zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over {{hundreds of millions of}} years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene {{as a result of the}} <b>subduction</b> of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and <b>subduction</b> of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. The Boso Triple Junction off the coast of Japan is a triple junction where the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate meets. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} land-based subductive {{waste disposal}} method would dispose of nuclear waste in a <b>subduction</b> zone accessed from land, and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method {{has been described}} as a viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as a state-of-the-art nuclear waste disposal technology.|$|E
5|$|Thielsen was {{produced}} by <b>subduction</b> of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate. Volcanism near the Cascades dates back to 55million years ago (mya), and extends from British Columbia to California. Thielsen {{is part of the}} High Cascades, a branch of the main Cascades range that includes Oregonian volcanoes less than 3.5million years old; it {{is also a member of}} a group of extinct volcanoes distinguished by their sharp peaks.|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the <b>subduction</b> zone {{during the}} Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an {{increase}} in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that the}} pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia <b>subduction</b> zone are very infrequent.|$|E
