5|$|Oil tankers {{are only}} one source of oil <b>spills.</b> According to the United States Coast Guard, 35.7% {{of the volume of}} oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from {{facilities}} and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery <b>spills.</b> Only 5% of the actual <b>spills</b> came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels. The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for somewhat less than 5% of the number of total <b>spills</b> but more than 60% of the volume. Tanker <b>spills</b> are much more rare and much more serious than <b>spills</b> from non-tank vessels.|$|E

40|$|Many {{optimizing}} compilers perform global register allocation using a Chaitin-style graph coloring algorithm. Live ranges that {{cannot be}} allocated to registers are <b>spilled</b> to memory. The amount of code required to <b>spill</b> the live range {{depends on the}} <b>spilling</b> heuristic used. Chaitin's <b>spilling</b> heuristic offers some guidance in {{reducing the amount of}} <b>spill</b> code produced. However, this heuristic does not allow the partial <b>spilling</b> of live ranges and the reduction in <b>spill</b> code is limited to a local level. In this paper, we present a global technique called interference region <b>spilling</b> that improves the <b>spilling</b> granularity of any local <b>spilling</b> heuristic. Our technique works above the local <b>spilling</b> heuristic, limiting the normal insertion of <b>spill</b> code to a portion of each <b>spilled</b> live range. By partially <b>spilling</b> live ranges, we can achieve large reductions in dynamically executed <b>spill</b> code; up to 75 % in some cases and an average of 33. 6 % across the benchmarks tested. 1 Introduction Gl [...] ...|$|R

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil <b>spills,</b> both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil <b>spills</b> in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E

For example, the average cost of cleanup (per ton) after an oil <b>spill</b> is drastically different for a <b>spill</b> in the Gulf of Mexico than it would be in South American waters, where there is a difference of almost $70,000.
