His family continued to grow, and after his third child was born, he decided to move his family back to Lake Geneva.

5|$|Renewed for {{a second}} season, Prison Break resumed filming on June 15, 2006, in Dallas, Texas due to the close {{proximity}} of rural and urban settings. Locations within a 30-minute radius of Dallas were chosen which included Little Elm, Decatur, Mineral Wells and McKinney. Many of these locations were used to represent various American towns. The show was expected to <b>spend</b> <b>in</b> excess of $50 million in Texas {{over the course of}} the second season. For the final three episodes of the second season, filming took place in Pensacola, Florida to represent Panama. Each episode took eight days to film and approximately $1.4 million went to the local economy per episode.|$|E
5|$|Dalyngrigge's licence from Richard II {{permitted}} him to refortify his existing manor house, {{but instead}} he chose a fresh site to build a castle on. Construction was completed in one phase, {{and most of the}} castle is in the same architectural style. Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, probably because of the threat from the French. Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds. Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for {{the first years of the}} castle's construction. It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor. It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to <b>spend</b> <b>in</b> the completed castle, as he was dead by 1395.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Cuba, Castro {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in {{protests against the}} government’s attempts to raise bus fares, a mode of transport used mostly by students and workers. That year, Castro married Mirta Díaz Balart, a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite. The relationship was a love match, disapproved of by both families. Mirta’s father gave them {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to <b>spend</b> <b>in</b> a three-month honeymoon in New York City, and the couple also received a U.S. $1,000 wedding gift from the military general and former president Fulgencio Batista, a friend of Mirta’s family. That same year, Grau decided not to stand for re-election, which was instead won by his Partido Auténticos new candidate, Carlos Prío Socarrás. Prío faced widespread protests when members of the MSR, now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a self-educated black Cuban who was a prominent UIR member and friend of Castro's. In response, Prío agreed to quell the gangs, but found them too powerful to control.|$|E
5|$|The sale of star midfielder Joey Beauchamp to West Ham for a club record £1million allowed Smith {{money to}} <b>spend</b> <b>in</b> the {{transfer}} market, {{and he spent}} £100,000 each on Norwich City midfielder David Smith and Sunderland striker David Rush. Oxford formed a strong promotion push in 1994–95, but were knocked out of the FA Cup {{in the first round}} by non-League Marlow. In February 1995, he spent £60,000 on Hartlepool United's Phil Gilchrist, who would form a highly effective centre-back partnership with Elliott. Oxford finished the season in seventh place, six points outside the play-offs. In November 1995, Smith re-signed Beauchamp for £300,000, who continued his excellent form after returning to his native Oxfordshire. The next month he brought in striker Martin Aldridge on a free transfer. The club were 14th in January 1996, but lost only once in their last 17 matches of 1995–96 in a tremendous {{second half of the season}} that saw them climb 12 places to win promotion as runners-up. At the end of the season, Smith became a director of the club.|$|E

After the French scored their second try, giving them 8 pointsthe most any team had scored against the All Blacksthe New Zealanders responded with six unanswered tries to win 38–8. They then returned to London, where they learned that New Zealand's Prime Minister, Richard Seddon, had arranged for them to return home via North America. Not all of the players were keen on the idea, and four {{did not make the}} trip, but the new plans did give the team over two weeks to <b>spend</b> <b>in</b> England before their departure.|$|E
40|$|After {{nearly a}} decade of {{explosive}} growth, federal <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> Alaska has turned flat, except for [...] the temporary boost from the stimulus package—the American Recovery and Reinvestment [...] Act—that pumped more than 2. 2 billion into the state economy in 2009 and 2010. (Shown in [...] black in the figure below.) Total federal <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> Alaska was 11. 2 billion in 2009 and 10. 9 [...] billion in 2010, compared with about 9. 4 billion in 2008. But without the stimulus funds, [...] federal <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> 2009 and 2010 {{would have been no}} higher than in the previous four years. [...] Alaska was first among the states in per capita stimulus funds, with more than 3, 000 per capita, [...] or nearly four times the national average. [...] Spending is no longer growing for either defense or grants—the largest categories of federal [...] dollars coming into the state. Still, the special characteristics that have historically kept Alaska [...] {{near the top of the}} state rankings for federal funds per capita will continue to guarantee a strong [...] role for federal dollars in the economy. [...] Here we discuss the composition of federal <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> Alaska, comparing it with <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> [...] other states, and also review stimulus spending and provide examples of the importance of [...] federal funds to particular sectors of the state economy.

5|$|The player builds their {{character}} by spending acquired points {{to increase their}} ratings in the three areas. The points spent on Attributes and Abilities combine to determine a player's success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms, brawling, and lock-picking; for example, determining how accurate or how far the player can shoot, or if they can hack a computer. Attributes are represented by physical (strength, dexterity, and stamina), social (charisma, manipulation, and appearance), and mental (perception, intelligence, and wits). Abilities are talents (such as brawling and dodging), skills (such as firearms and melee) and knowledges (such as computers and investigation). The player is initially assigned points to <b>spend</b> <b>in</b> the three areas, with the amount they can spend determined by clan; for example, the Brujah can spend the most points on physical and skill attributes. During character creation, each upgrade costs one point. The upgrade cost increases as the game progresses. Each ability can be raised from zero to five, and {{it is impossible to}} accrue enough experience points to complete every skill (allowing the player to specialize or balance {{their character}}). Experience points are gained by completing quests, finding items or unlocking secret paths, rather than killing enemies, and are used to increase or unlock the character's statistics and abilities. The game features a main story, and optional side quests that can be completed at any time; the player is able to move between the available areas at will to revisit locations, characters, or merchants.|$|E
