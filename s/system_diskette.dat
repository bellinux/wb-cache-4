50|$|WPS-8 {{normally}} {{runs from}} a single floppy diskette and user data can be stored on the <b>system</b> <b>diskette</b> or additional data-only diskettes. Up to four diskette drives are supported in a single system.|$|E
50|$|TRSDOS {{supported}} {{up to four}} floppy (mini-diskette) drives {{which used}} 5¼-inch diskettes with a capacity of 89KB each (later 160KB). The drives were numbered 0 through 3 and the <b>system</b> <b>diskettes</b> (which contained the TRSDOS code and utilities) {{had to be in}} drive 0.|$|R
50|$|Hard-sectored floppy disks. Nearly all CP/M <b>systems</b> used soft-sectored <b>diskettes,</b> {{so it was}} {{difficult}} to transport information between CP/M and Poly systems.|$|R
40|$|A brief {{discussion}} is presented {{on a new}} measuring system based on an APPLE microcomputer. Aspects of both hardware and software are considered, with emphasis on the software that provides operator interaction. The <b>system</b> uses <b>diskettes</b> for data storage and completely eliminates both paper tape and key punch cards from the measuring process...|$|R
50|$|Its FORTH {{was adapted}} to the disk-less tape-using home {{computer}} hardware being able to save/load user compiled vocabularies {{instead of the usual}} numbered programming blocks used by <b>diskette</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bank {{switching}} is {{a technique}} used in computer design {{to increase the amount}} of usable memory beyond the amount directly addressable by the processor. It can be used to configure a system differently at different times; for example, a ROM required to start a <b>system</b> from <b>diskette</b> could be switched out when no longer needed. In video game systems, bank switching allowed larger games to be developed for play on existing consoles.|$|R
50|$|TI BASIC {{was built}} into the 99/4 and 99/4A, and was remarkably easy to learn. Users could access {{functions}} through this simple language that on other computers would only be available to those versed in the machines' assembly language code. Text, full screen graphics, logic operations, and recording to tape (or any other file <b>system</b> - <b>diskettes,</b> RS-232 interface, RAM disks) could all be accomplished using TI BASIC. TI also produced an Extended BASIC cartridge that greatly enhanced the functionality accessible to BASIC users.|$|R
40|$|Oregon Geology is {{designed}} to reach {{a wide spectrum of}} readers interested in the geology and mineral industry of Oregon. Manuscript contributions are invited on both technical and general-interest subjects relating to Oregon geology. Two copies of the manuscript should be submitted. If manuscript was prepared on common word-processing equipment, a file copy on diskette should be submitted in place of one paper copy (from Macintosh <b>systems,</b> high-density <b>diskette</b> only). Graphic illustrations should be camera ready; photographs should be black-and-white glossies. All figures should be clearly marked; figure captions should be together {{at the end of the}} text...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{popularity}} of the World Wide Web and widespread Internet access, Shareware was often the only economical way for independent software authors to get their product onto users' desktops. Those with Internet or BBS access could download software and distribute it amongst their friends or user groups, who would then be encouraged to send the registration fee to the author, usually via postal mail. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, shareware software was widely distributed over online services, bulletin board <b>systems</b> and on <b>diskettes.</b> Contrary to commercial developers who spent millions of dollars urging users [...] "Don't Copy that Floppy", shareware developers encouraged users to upload the software and share it on disks.|$|R
5000|$|... 8.3 filenames {{are limited}} to at most eight {{characters}} (after any directory specifier), followed optionally by a filename extension consisting of a period [...] and at most three further characters. For systems that only support 8.3 filenames, excess characters are ignored and if a file name has no extension, the , if present, has no significance (that is, [...] and [...] are equivalent). Furthermore, in these systems file and directory names are uppercase, although systems that use the 8.3 standard are usually case-insensitive (hence [...] will be equivalent to the name [...] ). However, on non-8.3 Operating Systems (such as almost any modern operating systems) accessing 8.3 File <b>Systems</b> (including DOS-formatted <b>diskettes,</b> but also including some modern memory cards and networked file systems) the underlying system may alter filenames internally to preserve case and avoid truncating letters in the names, for example {{in the case of}} VFAT.|$|R
40|$|For submissions, please {{refer to}} the {{guidelines}} available on the DrJes home page. Submit articles or editorials with a self-addressed stamped envelope to the address below, along with an electronic copy of your work on a 3. 5 ” diskette. Please indicate the format and operating <b>system</b> on the <b>diskette</b> label. About the Cover What could more appropriately grace the cover of our second issue than the mineral dawsonite? Sir William Dawson {{was responsible for the}} development of McGill University into the worldrenowned educational institution it is today. He was a world-famous geologist. Our College was named after Sir William Dawson for his contribution to education, and the mineral dawsonite recognizes his contribution to geology. Dawsonite was first described in 1875 by B. J. Harrington, the first specimen having been collected on University Street from the McGill University campus. The dawsonite on the cover of this issue comes from the Francon quarry in St. Michel on Montreal Island and was collected by Dr. Donald V. Doell in 1978. Dawsonite is found in the Monteregian hills, particularly Mont Royal, Mont St-Bruno and Mont St...|$|R
