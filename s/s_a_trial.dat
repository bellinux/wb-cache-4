40|$|Perceptual {{filling-in}} {{refers to}} the fading of stabilized retinal patterns and their replacement by non-stabilized surrounding patterns. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to investigate neuronal correlates of perceptual filling-in induced by a dynamic random dot pattern. The stimulus consisted of a moving random dot pattern on dark background surrounding a region devoid of dots (artificial scotoma). The subjects fixated at an eccentrically located spot, and they reported the time of onset of filling-in by button press. We controlled for attention by dimming the fixation spot at random points in time, which the subjects reported via a separate button press. Catch trials in which the stimulus physically filled the artificial scotoma were interspersed with filling-in trials to gauge the subjects performance. General linear model techniques with appropriate predictors were used to define areas of interest for analysis. Filling-in trials for each subject were divided in two groups of 30 trial s each, based on whether filling in occurred earlier (lt; 8 s) or later (8 - 24 <b>s)</b> in <b>a</b> <b>trial.</b> The stimulus was identical for all trials.

Global and regional left ventricular ejection fractions were determined by radionuclide ventriculography in a subset of 120 patients 3 days, 4 weeks, 7 months, 18 months and 3 years after acute myocardial infarction. In patients with anterior myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction was higher in the Streptokinase than {{in the placebo group}} 3 days after acute infarction (49 ± 14 % vs. 40 ± 11 %, p = 0. 02). This difference of about 10 % units in ejection fraction persisted during the 3 year follow-up period. Among streptokinase-treated patients, regional left ventricular ejection fraction was higher within the infarct zone as well as in remote myocardium throughout the follow-up period. Among patients with inferior infarction, {{no significant differences between the}} treatment and control groups were demonstrable with respect to global and regional left ventricular ejection fraction. Thus, intravenous administration of streptokinase within 6 h after the onset of symptorrs of acute myocardial infarction preserves left ventricular function over a period of ⩾ 3 years in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction. It improves regional myocardial function within the infarct zone as well as in remote areas.

What the reader will gain: In the 1980 s and 1990 <b>s,</b> <b>a</b> number of <b>trials</b> were performed and proved that active treatment of hypertension in individuals above the age of 60 - 65 years, compared with placebo or no treatment, {{reduces the risk of}} complications. In the 1990 s, the same was proven in patients specifically affected with isolated systolic hypertension, the predominant form of hypertension in the elderly. The subsequent years witnessed the publication of trials that showed that most antihypertensive drugs are capable of substantially reducing risk. Finally, treatment of hypertension in the very elderly was proven to be beneficial. Take home message: In spite of these advances, we still lack evidence in elderly patients with mild isolated systolic hypertension and are therefore in need of a properly designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. status: publishe...|$|R

The rules define the maximum and minimum values of loop occupancy and time gap respectively for each detector, which when exceeded for a given duration, trigger a report of a potential traffic flow ‘abnormality’ for that time of day at that particular location on the network.

40|$|Examined {{the effect}} of {{response}} readiness on the stopping of motor responses. 13 subjects (Ss; undergraduates) performed a primary task requiring a speeded choice reaction on go trials and response inhibition on no go trials. An occasional cue informed <b>Ss</b> that <b>a</b> no-go <b>trial</b> was imminent but left them uncertain {{about the number of}} go trials separating the cue and the upcoming no-go trial. This setup was meant to create test episodes of reduced response readiness (i. e., trial sequences initiated by the cue and terminated by the no-go signal) and control episodes, in which Ss were ready to execute a speeded choice reaction (i. e., trial sequences consisting only of go trials). During both episodes, a visual stop signal could occasionally and unpredictably follow go signal onset, instructing Ss to withhold their response to the go signal. Choice reactions on go trials were delayed during test episodes relative to control episodes. Most importantly, stop reactions were delayed, not facilitated, during test episodes compared to control episodes. Findings were taken to suggest that reduced readiness gives rise to more forceful responses that are then more difficult to inhibit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: During a {{retrospective}} {{evaluation of a}} painful event, the initial somatic experience is dynamically reconstructed and susceptible to various distortions. Since elevated but unfounded symptom reporting is strongly associated with trait negative affectivity (NA), we investigated memory distortion in high and low habitual symptom reporters (scoring high and low for NA). We hypothesized that high symptom reporters (HSR) would show more distorted memory for pain than low symptom reporters (LSR). Methods: Healthy female students (N = 31; 13 HSR/ 18 LSR) participated in a cold pressor task. In <b>a</b> short <b>trial,</b> they submerged one hand in water at 12 Â°C for 60 <b>s.</b> In <b>a</b> long <b>trial,</b> they held their other hand in water at 12 Â°C for 60 s, with additional 60 s in water at 14 Â°C. The order of the two trials was counterbalanced across participants and groups. Pain ratings were collected at four times: (1) continuously during pain induction, (2) after each trial, (3) after the experiment, (4) after 2 weeks. Results: Continuous pain ratings during hand immersion were not different for both groups. However, significantly higher retrospective pain assessments were given by HSR compared to LSR, starting already at the first retrospective evaluation, i. e. right after the trial. Conclusions: These findings suggest that retrospective pain ratings are importantly biased, especially in HSR. Pain overestimation occurs directly after completion of the trial, showing that distortions in symptom memory may operate promptly. status: publishe...|$|R

The percentage of <b>trials</b> with <b>a</b> response was consistently high when the timeout-postponement contingency was in effect and decreased to low levels when it was discontinued under extinction conditions. In Experiment 2, the response-timeout interval was also 45 s but postponement responses increased the duration of the timeout, which varied from 60 s to 105 s across conditions. Postponement responding was maintained, generally at high levels, at all timeout durations, despite sometimes large decreases in the overall frequency of food reinforcement. In Experiment 3, timeout duration was held constant at 60 s while the response-timeout interval was varied systematically across conditions from 0 s to 45 s. Postponement responding was maintained under all conditions in which the response-timeout interval exceeded 0 s (the timeout interval {{in the absence of a}} response). In some conditions of Experiment 3, which were designed to control for the immediacy of food reinforcement and food-correlated (time-in) stimuli, responding postponed timeout but the timeout was delayed whether a response occurred or not. Responding was maintained for 2 of 3 subjects, suggesting that behavior was negatively reinforced by timeout postponement rather than positively reinforced by the more immediate presentation of food or food-correlated (time-in) stimuli...|$|R

These different actions on haemodynamics of MARS and Prometheus have no obvious explanation. As described above, MARS and Prometheus may influence cytokine and inflammatory molecules concentrations, thus inducing haemodynamic changes, but the final balance for both is unknown. Several studies have demonstrated a reduction in NO levels with MARS [4, 81], which is probably removed in its main circulating complexed form, S-nitroso-serum albumin [83], but the use of Prometheus probably also influences NO levels [84].
