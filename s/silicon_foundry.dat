40|$|We {{introduce}} a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dot structure that achieves dot-reservoir tunnel coupling control without a dedicated barrier gate. The elementary structure {{consists of two}} accumulation gates separated spatially by a gap, one gate accumulating a reservoir {{and the other a}} quantum dot. Control of the tunnel rate between the dot and the reservoir is demonstrated in the single electron occupation regime by varying the reservoir accumulation gate voltage while compensating with the dot accumulation gate voltage. The method is then applied to a quantum dot connected in series to source and drain reservoirs, enabling transport down to the single electron regime and tuning of the valley splitting with the dot accumulation gate voltage. We find that the split accumulation gate structure creates silicon quantum dots of similar characteristics to other realizations but with less electrodes, in a single gate stack subtractive fabrication process that is fully compatible with <b>silicon</b> <b>foundry</b> manufacturing.

30|$|This {{paper will}} {{home in on}} a spatial {{understanding}} of today’s rapidly changing ICT technology platforms in convergent ICT in the smartphones, tablets, netbooks and flat screen products businesses in key innovative growth and transitioning regions of northern Europe, California and Asia Pacific, notably China, Taiwan and South Korea. The paper is set at something of a trisection among economic geography, international business and development studies (on aspects of this, see Beugelsdijk, McCann & Mudambi, 2010). In regard to the first, the paper examines the process of transition in global system architecture. In brief, this means exploring change processes in complex adaptive systems, seen as ‘systems that have large numbers of components, often called agents, that interact and adapt or learn’ (Holland, 2006; see also Kauffman, 2008; Cooke, 2012). In this instance, the focus is upon the inheritance of the global ICT industry from a hierarchical, linear, multinational corporation (MNC) orchestrated ‘global value chain’(GVC) evolved into a still-linear, hierarchical ‘global production network’ (GPN) different for two reasons. First, because states, through their national innovation systems (NIS), both guaranteed foreign (often US) direct investment (FDI) agreements and potentialities (e.g. regarding research, skills and hardware investments in support of FDI). Second, NISs also arrange the elaboration of subsidiary GPNs such as those elaborated by Singapore in hard disk drives among Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and India or Taiwan in components regarding its <b>silicon</b> <b>foundry,</b> FDI acquisitions and cross-straits relations with China’s ‘world factory’.|$|E
30|$|The GIN seems fairly straightforwardly to be {{replacing}} the GVC and GPN for ICT with new firm entries emerging endogenously from key TIS locations in that evolution (Chen 2004). While Chen & Wen (2011) {{make this point}} forcefully, drawing attention to {{the manner in which}} Taiwan’s components flagships out-innovated Western incumbents in ‘chipstack’ innovation, more telling is the transformation in the chip content of the early Apple iPhone 3 G and most recent iPhone 4 S. The authors show that of the seventeen key components in the iPhone 3 G of 2007 none was Taiwanese in origin. However, by 2011, one core power/memory filter chip was produced by Taiwanese firm TXC, while firms such as Largan Precision supplied the camera, Wintek and TKD the touchpanel, Hon Hai various EMS (electronic manufacturing services; see Figs. 1 and 4) and its China subsidiary FoxConn flexible circuits, connectors and casings. As noted earlier, South Korea, notably Samsung, supplied the iPhone 4 Sapplication processor, DDR DRAM memory integrated circuit and, with its joint venture partner Toshiba, the flash memory chip for the iPhone 4 S. Casualties of this transition to GIN for the iPhone 4 S included National Semiconductor, ST Microelectronics, Broadcom, SST and Wolfson – all from Europe or the US. The Taiwanese and South Korean TIS arrangements are distinctive but successful. Taiwan is well-known for its endogenous SME ecosystem that has been well-served, as described above, by ITRI, the investment in its <b>silicon</b> <b>foundry</b> that brought learning opportunities from all chipmakers in the world who had to use it, and acquisition of corporate divestments, like IBM’s PC assembly plants which were sold to Sanmina-SCI. South Korea’s TIS is hierarchical rather than heterarchical, as in Taiwan. The state’s agencies reveal a track record of working closely with domestic ICT flagships like Samsung and LG, even enforcing reorganizations of their product lines if necessary and facilitating partnerships with foreign MNCs for in new innovation platforms (e.g. flat panel displays and touchscreens) as we shall see below.|$|E

40|$|A new {{application}} of heat pipes is introduced. The present research {{deals with the}} development of a heat pipe for the on-line quality control of liquid aluminum <b>silicon</b> <b>foundry</b> alloys. Thermal analysis is a technique whereby a small quantity of a melt is allowed to solidify while its cooling curve is recorded. Analysis of the cooling curve with standard mathematical algorithms allows one to determine a number of useful parameters that characterize the liquid and solid states of the material. In aluminum-silicon casting alloys thermal analysis is often used to assess the grain size and degree of eutectic modification of the alloy before pouring. A novel probe has been developed for conducting thermal analysis of aluminum alloy melts. The probe, which resides in the melt, need not be withdrawn as it solidifies a small sample (i. e. button) at a predetermined cooling rate. Once the cooling curve results have been acquired, the probe can be instructed to remelt the frozen button and await instructions for analyzing a fresh sample. The operating principle of this novel device is based on heat pipe technology. In simple terms, a heat pipe consists of a condenser and an evaporator which contain a relatively small quantity of working substance fluid. As heat is absorbed by the evaporator, the liquid phase of the working substance is vaporized and subsequently condensed on the condenser walls from which heat is extracted. It has been shown that the designed probe, which is classified as a gas loaded annular thermosyphon, is completely workable in the range of conditions typically encountered in the thermal analysis of aluminum alloys. The thermal analysis results obtained with this new technique are in a good agreement with those of conventional thermal analysis. In addition, the new method is applicable to a wider range of operating conditions and is easier to use. Based on the semi-continuous nature of the new method, it does not need pre-preparation (materials, labour, pre-heating, thermocouple installation for each test, isolation of the sampling cup, etc.) to start thermal analysis. Also, from a cooling rate point of view, the system is well controllable. Moreover, it is shown that the probe is simple in construction, easy to use, and intelligent enough to provide semi-continuous thermal analysis. There are no consumable materials and moving parts. Thermal analysis results are reported for pure aluminum, hypoeutectic aluminum silicon (356) and eutectic aluminum silicon (413) casting alloys. Agreement in the results between the new and conventional systems is shown to be excellent. Finally, a heat transfer/solidification model of the heat pipe thermal analysis probe is derived and validated...|$|E
40|$|The CMOS foundry {{infrastructure}} enables {{integration of}} high density, high performance optical transceivers. We developed integrated devices that assemble resonators, waveguide, tapered couplers, pn junction and electrodes. Not only the volume standard manufacture in <b>silicon</b> <b>foundry</b> is promising to low-lost optical components operating at IR and mid-IR range, {{it also provides}} a robust platform for revealing new physical phenomenon. The thesis starts from comparison between photonic crystal and micro-ring resonators based on chip routers, showing photonic crystal switches have small footprint, consume low operation power, but its higher linear loss may require extra energy for signal amplification. Different designs are employed in their implementation in optical signal routing on chip. The second part of chapter 2 reviews the graphene based optoelectronic devices, such as modulators, lasers, switches and detectors, potential for group IV optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC). In chapter 3, the highly efficient thermal optic control could act as on-chip switches and (transmittance) tunable filters. Local temperature tuning compensates the wavelength differences between two resonances, and separate electrode is used for fine tuning of optical pathways between two resonators. In frequency domain, the two cavity system also serves as an optical analogue of Autler-Towns splitting, where the cavity-cavity resonance detuning {{is controlled by the}} length of pathway (phase) between them. The high thermal sensitivity of cavity resonance also effectively reflects the heat distribution around the nanoheaters, and thus derives the thermal conductivity in the planar porous suspended silicon membrane. Chapter 4 and 5 analyze graphene-silicon photonic crystal cavities with high Q and small mode volume. With negligible nonlinear response to the milliwatt laser excitation, the monolithic silicon PhC turns into highly nonlinear after transferring the single layer graphene with microwatt excitation, reflected by giant two photon absorption induced optical bistability, low power dynamic switching and regenerative oscillation, and coherent four-wave-mixing from high Kerr coefficient. The single layer graphene lowers the operational power 20 times without enhancing the linear propagation loss. Chapter 6 moves onto high Q ring resonator made of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition grown silicon nitride (PECVD SiN). PECVD SiN grown at low temperature is compatible with CMOS processing. The resonator enhanced light-matter interaction leads to molecular absorption induced quality factor enhancement and thermal bistability, near the critical coupling region. In chapter 7, carrier transport and recombination in InAs quantum dots based GaAs solar cells are characterized by current-voltage curve. The parameters include voltage dependent ideality factor, series and shunt resistance. The device variance across the wafer is analyzed and compared. Quantum dots offers extra photocurrent by extending the absorption edge further into IR range, but the higher recombination rate increases the dark current as well. Different dots sized enabled by growth techniques are employed for comparison...|$|E
