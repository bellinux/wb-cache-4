In response to the pulse, consumers showed marked diet segregation. Bass consumed significantly more cyprinodontoids, bowfin consumed significantly more invertebrates, and snook almost exclusively targeted sunfishes. The diversity of the resource pulse subsidizes multiple consumers, routing pulsed production through various trophic pathways and across ecosystem boundaries.

5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, however, {{changes to the}} system were {{obviously}} needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture. Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labor and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the [...] "thaw" [...] years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of intensive growth. In industry the [...] "New System of Management" [...] was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of textiles and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. Wages, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% {{of which could be}} retained. Outside investment funds were to come primarily from bank credit rather than the state budget. In 1965 state <b>subsidies</b> still <b>accounted</b> for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits. By 1970 budget <b>subsidies</b> <b>accounted</b> for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.

40|$|In 2013, around 121 billion US-Dollar were spend {{worldwide}} {{to promote}} the investment into renewable energy sources.

We study the incidence of wind turbine subsidies, due to a feed-in tariff in Germany, into land prices to shed light on who benefits from the subsidies. In order to identify the incidence share we exploit quasi-experimental variation in wind strength across 270 non-urban counties combined with an institutional reform and use an Instrumental Variable estimator based on administrative transactionprices. We find that between 15 and 20 % of expected wind turbine profits are capitalized into land prices.

This paper explores whether differences in policies that affect the opportunity cost of edu-cation, namely child-labor restrictions and education <b>subsidies,</b> can <b>account</b> for these differences. A model is developed which delivers an endogenous transition from Malthusian stagnation to growth. A calibrated version of the model shows that ed-ucational policies have large effects on the fertility transition.

The burning of domestically produced nonrenewable peat provides 4. 9 percent of Ireland’s total primary energy supply while renewable biomass crops currently account for only 1 percent of the domestically produced energy supply.

This would be equivalent to approximately 0. 6 million tonnes of biomass crops or approximately 45, 000 hectares of biomass.

40|$|Agricultural {{protection}} and <b>subsidies</b> <b>account</b> for {{about two-thirds of}} thetrade distortion caused by government policies. And most of the distor-tion traceable to agricultural policies is generated by import barriers. For that reason, negotiating wider market access in agriculture {{is critical to the}} success of the Doha Round. 1 The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agriculture Framework Agreement of July 2004 calls for significant tariff cuts using a tiered formula that imposes larger percentage cuts in higher tariffs. (See table 1 for a summary of all of the provisions.) This proposed approach is a vast improvement over the average-cut formula applied in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, which allows countries to meet their commitments through large proportional reductions in tariffs that were already low and small reductions in high tariffs. The new formula still will require substantial cuts in tariffs before meaningful trade liberalization is realized. This is because of the prevalence in agriculture of tariff peaks (a small number of tariff lines protect the bulk of domestic production), binding “overhang ” (bound tariffs are above applied tariffs), “water ” in the tariff (tariff reductions initially have no impact), and tariff escalation (higher tariffs o...|$|R

Agricultural <b>subsidies</b> <b>accounted</b> {{for almost half}} of the EU's total budget (US$ 40 billion on agriculture in 2000) although agriculture represented 1. 7 percent of the EU's GDP and employs 4. 3 % of the EU's population. Domestic policies for citrus and tomatoes include export refunds, product withdraws from the market, intervention thresholds, and direct producer aid. Domestic policies for dairy include export refunds, intervention thresholds, aid for private storage, disposal aid, and milk quotas. The EU's intentions are to enhance agricultural competitiveness by setting product intervention as "a real safety net measure, allowing EU producers to respond to market signals while protecting them from extreme price fluctuations," and promoting market oriented, sustainable agriculture by finishing the transition from product support to producer support, by introducing a "decoupled system of payments per farm" which are not connected to production. The EU wishes to allow flexibility in production, but also guarantee income stability to producers. Within the last 10 years, the EU has reduced price supports and increased direct payments to tomato, dairy, and citrus farmers to compensate them for the reductions.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis that began in 2007, policy makers have focused again on the largest financial firms to consider the association of their size with systemic risk. An equally important question examines whether their size benefits the economy. In particular, is the size of our largest financial institutions the result of technological cost advantages that improve the efficiency of their capital allocation and liquidity and enhance their international competitiveness? Or is it the result, not of technological cost advantages, but of safety-net subsidies that confer too-big-to-fail cost advantages and foster moral hazard in investment decisions. This paper reviews the evidence of large scale economies that increase with size and considers the credibility of this evidence by examining details of how scale economies are measured and why evidence of scale economies eludes many investigations. A method of estimating scale economies developed by Hughes, Lang, Mester, and Moon (1996) distinguishes the underlying scale effects on cost from the effects on costs of size-related changes in risk-taking, which can obscure technological cost advantages, such as those due to better diversification. It reviews evidence that technology, not too-big-to-fail <b>subsidies,</b> <b>accounts</b> for the cost advantage of the largest financial institutions. Finally, it considers the implications of scale economies for scaling back the operations of the largest financial institutions and for the global competitiveness of smaller institutions...|$|R
