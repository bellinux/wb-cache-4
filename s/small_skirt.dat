5000|$|Columbus {{thought the}} Lucayans resembled the Guanche of the Canary Islands (in {{part because they}} were {{intermediate}} in skin color between Europeans and Africans). The Lucayans were described as handsome, graceful, well-proportioned, gentle, generous and peaceful, and customarily going almost completely naked. Peter Martyr d'Anghiera said that the Lucayan women were so beautiful that men from [...] "other countries" [...] moved to the islands to be near them. Women past puberty wore a <b>small</b> <b>skirt</b> of cotton, and the men might wear a loincloth made of plaited leaves or cotton. Some people wore head bands, waist bands, feathers, bones and ear and nose jewelry on occasion. They were often tattooed and usually applied paint to their bodies and/or faces. They also practiced head flattening. Their hair was black and straight, and they kept it cut short {{except for a few}} hairs in back which were never cut. Columbus reported seeing scars on the bodies of some of the men, which were explained to him as resulting from attempts by men from other islands to capture them.|$|E

50|$|The {{uniform of}} Yokosuka 1st, 2nd, (for paratrooper {{training}} and fighting on land) and 3rd Rikusentais in Menado and West Timor battles in 1942 was the standard SNLF dark green with dark black or dark brown belts and harness. This uniform {{was based on}} the German model. It was later replaced by two types of green uniforms made from rip stop parachute silk with built in bandoliers and cargo pockets, being better designed than other paratrooper models of the time. This two-piece uniform was made of 50% cotton/50% silk. The hip length jacket had two differing pocket layouts, one had an angled pistol holster on the right chest, a two-grenade pocket on the left chest, and three smaller pockets for ammunition or grenades on each skirt side. The second version jacket had two pleated chest pockets and a <b>smaller</b> pleated <b>skirt</b> pockets. The trousers featured several variations of hip and cargo pockets. Headgear was similar to the IJA fieldcap but with a chinstrap and integral side and neck piece. Personnel also wore laced high brown leather boots as well as brown leather gloves.|$|R
50|$|Where the RC30 {{had used}} roller {{bearings}} on the camshafts, the RC45 used more conventional plain bearings. The RC30 {{had used a}} piston with one compression ring and oil control ring to reduce friction. This was very effective for racing but resulted in increased oil consumption in the road-going bikes. The RC45 changed to the more conventional two compression ring system, also with an oil control ring. It used low friction rings and a molybdenum disulphide coating on <b>smaller</b> piston <b>skirts</b> to reduce friction. One huge change in engine architecture was the change from centre gear drive mechanism to crank/camshaft drive, which was located {{on the end of}} the crankshaft (another NR750 follow on). This reduced the number of engine crankshaft bearings by one and camshaft bearings by four with an associated reduction in friction. This overall reduction in friction also allowed the engine to see the higher engine revolutions Honda desired without losing horsepower. The RC45 also followed the RC30 in using titanium connecting rods in a revised format, made lighter and stronger, to help cope with the extra rpm the moving parts of a race engine were expected to see.|$|R

40|$|Concentric eyewall {{formation}} can be idealized as {{the interaction}} of a tropical cyclone core with nearby weaker vorticity of various spatial scales. This paper considers barotropic aspects of concentric eyewall formation from modified Rankine vortices. In this framework, the following parameters {{are found to be}} important in concentric eyewall formation: vorticity strength ratio, separation distance, companion vortex size, and core vortex skirt parameter. A vorticity skirt on the core vortex affects the filamentation dynamics in two important ways. First, the vorticity skirt lengthens the filamentation time, and therefore slows moat formation in the region just outside the radius of maximum wind. Second, at large radii, a skirted core vortex induces higher strain rates than a corresponding Rankine vortex and is thus more capable of straining out the vorticity field far from the core. Calculations suggest that concentric structures result from binary interactions when the small vortex is at least 4 – 6 times as strong as the larger companion vortex. An additional requirement is that the separation distance between the edges of the two vortices be less than 6 – 7 times the smaller vortex radius. Broad moats form when the initial companion vortex is <b>small,</b> the vorticity <b>skirt</b> outside the radius of maximum wind is small, and the strength ratio is large. In concentric cases, an outer vorticity ring develops when the initial companion vortex is large, the vorticity skirt outside the radiu...|$|R
