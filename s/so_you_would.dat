500|$|As films {{featuring}} prurient elements {{performed well}} at the box office, after the crackdown on crime films, Hollywood increased its production of pictures featuring the seven deadly sins. In 1932, Warner Bros formed an official policy decreeing that [...] "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by [...] "adding something {{having to do with}} ginger." [...] Filmmakers (including the shrewd Mae West) began putting in overly suggestive material they knew would never reach theaters in hopes that lesser offenses would survive the cutting-room floor. MGM screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart said [...] " [...] wouldn't want to take out too much, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> give them five things to take out to satisfy the Hays Office—and you would get away with murder with what they left in." ...|$|E

500|$|Phipps {{had little}} {{tolerance}} for foolishness and retained a professional soldier's dislike of civilian interference in military affairs, and ineffective administration, whether from civilians or government. In 1887, {{shortly after his}} retirement, {{he wrote a letter}} to the editor of The Times addressing some of the highly publicized problems of desertions from the ranks. [...] "War Office civilians," [...] he wrote, [...] "like the plan of indiscriminate enlist, as it swells their list of recruits. [...] Then, when the list of deserters grows, they put on long faces, and say, 'it must be those wicked officers.' [...] The officers would stop this plan in a day if they were allowed." [...] The problem with recruiters, Phipps maintained, lay in the need for quantity, not quality. [...] "What fools you civilians are to pay for these blackguards," [...] he wrote. [...] "If you would let the officers select their men, for the first year or <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have fewer men on paper, fewer men in prison, and just as many men for service....I will then give you another hint for saving money...why not do away with the Inspector-General of Recruiting, and spend his pay in horse artillery, who would be very ornamental and very serviceable? What use is the Inspector General?" [...] He had retired from active service in 1883, and Phipps fully retired in 1887, after attaining the rank of colonel.|$|E

But when I considered, I saw that the Pakeha had {{in the first instance}} been very much to blame; and I determined to come down and inquire into all the circumstances and see who was really in the wrong." ...|$|E

Dennis DeYoung has denied the accusation as well, joking on the In the Studio with Redbeard program [...] "we had enough trouble to make the music sound right forward." [...] Also, James Young quotes, [...] "If {{we were going to}} put something Satanic in our songs, we would have put it so it was in the song forward.

2500|$|During the pre-code period, {{after the}} {{crack down on}} crime films, {{production}} of films featuring prurient elements increased.

[...] In 1932 Warner Brothers' policy was that [...] "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by [...] "adding something having to do with ginger." [...] Films such as Laughing Sinners, Safe in Hell, The Devil Is Driving, Free Love, Merrily We Go to Hell, Laughter in Hell and The Road to Ruin were provocative in their mere titles. Studios marketed their films, sometimes dishonestly, by coming up with suggestive tag lines and lurid titles, even {{going so far as to}} come up with in house contests for thinking up provocative titles for screenplays. Commonly labeled [...] "sex films" [...] by the censors, these pictures offended taste in more categories than just sexuality. According to a Variety analysis of 440 pictures produced in 1932–33, 352 had [...] "some sex slant", with 145 possessing [...] "questionable sequences", and 44 being [...] "critically sexual"." [...] The trade paper summarized that [...] "over 80% of the world's chief picture output was...flavored with bedroom essence."
