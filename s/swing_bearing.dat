5000|$|Since 1913, the GIBC has renovated and {{expanded}} the Toll Bridge. It also performed major repairs {{to the bridge}} after freighters struck a large section of the span in 1965 and again in 1992. The GIBC replaced the bridge deck in 1986, built a new central <b>swing</b> <b>bearing</b> in 1994, and opened a toll plaza in Riverview in 2004. Funding for the improvements and normal maintenance of the bridge is generated from the user fee toll charged by the GIBC. The one-way toll for crossing the bridge is $2.50 (if cash is used), or $2.00 (if a [...] "Bridge Pass" [...] is used). The GIBC has received numerous awards praising its maintenance projects for the Toll Bridge from Michigan-based and national infrastructure and engineering {{organizations such as the}} American Society of Civil Engineers, American Consulting Engineers Council, and Consulting Engineers Council of Michigan.|$|E
40|$|Porch <b>swing</b> <b>bearing</b> for {{the linear}} {{motion of the}} mirror in Michelson {{interferometer}} for mid-infrared low resolution Fourier transform spectrometer was studied experimentally using the modulation depth of the collimated laser beam. The mirror tilting {{was measured to be}} lower than 5 μrad over 3 [*]mm mirror travel using two different bearings assemblies. Additionally, the manufacturing tolerances of the bearing type were proved to be loose enough not to limit the interferometer application. These demonstrate that the porch swing without any adjustment mechanisms provides the sufficient motion linearity...|$|E

He formed the band in 1946 and disbanded in 1949. The band recorded for Black & White Records — a label so named by its founder, Les Schreiber, to reflect the races of its recording artists.|$|R
50|$|Christian {{church bells}} have {{the form of}} a {{cup-shaped}} cast metal resonator with a flared thickened rim, and a pivoted clapper hanging from its centre inside. It is usually mounted high in a bell tower on top of the church, so it can be heard by the surrounding community. The bell is suspended from a headstock which can <b>swing</b> on <b>bearings.</b> A rope is tied to a wheel or lever on the headstock, and hangs down to the bell ringer. To ring the bell, the ringer pulls on the rope, swinging the bell. The motion causes the clapper to strike the inside of the bell rim as it swings, thereby sounding the bell. Some bells have full-circle wheels, which is used to swing the bell through a larger arc, such as in the United Kingdom where full- circle ringing is practised.|$|R
50|$|Swibco, a toy {{company based}} in Lisle, Illinois, {{introduced}} the Puffkins line on May 24, 1997. Thirteen different Puffkins designs were released on that day. Like Beanie Babies, every Puffkin wore a heart-shaped <b>swing</b> tag <b>bearing</b> a name, poem and birth date, and various designs were retired and introduced periodically. Certain designs of the toys were also considered more valuable, usually because of a low production number or a rarely seen color variation. The most valuable was a white tiger named Snowball; the first Puffkin to be retired, its original design sold for as high as $150. Puffkins are designed in a spherical form without arms, and measure about 6 in in diameter, with a smaller keyring variation measuring 4 in. Swibco retired the Puffkins line in 2002, but restarted the toy line in 2007 under the name Puffkins 2, which feature largely the same design but are made of a softer material.|$|R
40|$|The {{interferometer}} for {{low resolution}} portable Fourier Transform middle infrared spectrometer {{was developed and}} studied experimentally. The final aim was a concept for a commercial prototype. Because of the portability, the interferometer should be compact sized and insensitive to the external temperature variations and mechanical vibrations. To minimise the size and manufacturing costs, Michelson interferometer based on plane mirrors and porch <b>swing</b> <b>bearing</b> was selected and no dynamic alignment system was applied. The driving motor was a linear voice coil actuator to avoid mechanical contact of the moving parts. The driving capability for low mirror driving velocities required by the photoacoustic detectors was studied. In total, four versions of such an interferometer were built and experimentally studied. The thermal stability during the external temperature variations and the alignment stability over the mirror travel were measured using the modulation depth of the wide diameter laser beam. Method for estimating the mirror tilt angle from the modulation depth was developed to take account the effect from the non-uniform intensity distribution of the laser beam. The spectrometer stability was finally studied also using the infrared radiation. The latest interferometer was assembled for the middle infrared spectrometer with spectral range from 750 cm− 1 to 4500 cm− 1. The interferometer size was (197 × 95 × 79) mm 3 with the beam diameter of 25 mm. The alignment stability as the change of the tilt angle over the mirror travel of 3 mm was 5 μrad, which decreases the modulation depth only about 0. 7 percent in infrared at 3000 cm− 1. During the temperature raise, the modulation depth at 3000 cm− 1 changed about 1... 2 percentage units per Celsius over short term and even less than 0. 2 percentage units per Celsius over the total temperature raise of 30 °C. The unapodised spectral resolution was 4 cm− 1 limited by the aperture size. The best achieved {{signal to noise ratio}} was about 38 000 : 1 with commercially available DLaTGS detector. Although the vibration sensitivity requires still improving, the interferometer performed, as a whole, very well and could be further developed to conform all the requirements of the portable and stable spectrometer...|$|E

He’s proceeding at the pace of a 74-year-old legend with nothing to prove, yet he’s not resting on his laurels, he’s just doing what he’s always done: singing songs so expertly his virtuosity almost goes unnoticed."

60|$|Abchurch Lane {{is not a}} grand {{site for}} the offices of a {{merchant}} prince. Here, at a small corner house, {{there was a small}} brass plate on a <b>swing</b> door, <b>bearing</b> the words 'Melmotte & Co.' Of whom the Co was composed no one knew. In one sense Mr Melmotte might be said to be in company with all the commercial world, for there was no business to which he would refuse his co-operation on certain terms. But he had never burdened himself with a partner in the usual sense of the term. Here Fisker found three or four clerks seated at desks, and was desired to walk upstairs. The steps were narrow and crooked, and the rooms were small and irregular. Here he stayed for a while in a small dark apartment in which 'The Daily Telegraph' was left for the amusement of its occupant till Miles Grendall announced to him that Mr Melmotte would see him. The millionaire looked {{at him for a moment}} or two, just condescending to touch with his fingers the hand which Fisker had projected.|$|R

40|$|Increasingly {{there has}} been a {{recognized}} need for flexibility in long term airport planning. Past rigid reliance on forecasts has resulted in costly mistakes. These errors have taken two forms: construction of facilities that remain underutilized for years and/or inadequate preparations for rapidly changing trends. Either can be expensive, as limited capital funds are tied up in unused facilities; operations costs are accrued on empty buildings; or, conversely, the airport operates in crisis mode, rushing construction projects to catch up with changing markets. Airport planners must accept that they cannot adequately predict the future. One answer is dynamic strategic planning – a form of planning that accepts a wide range of possible future outcomes. This approach has two dimensions: more flexible use of forecasts and construction of facilities that give the airport operator options to handle uncertainties. Despite the increased call for dynamic strategic planning, it is not always clear how to use it in practice. The airport at Pease International Tradeport serves as a case study to demonstrate several aspects of this approach. These include a shift from traditional forecasts to planning thresholds; modifications to industry design standards to take into account unique local circumstances; and the incorporation of real options in the passenger terminal design, including an international/domestic <b>swing</b> gate, non-load <b>bearing</b> walls for easy expansion, {{and the use of the}} aircraft apron for overflow parking. The case study also discusses areas where improvement is needed, such as the lack of decision analysis to justify major capital expenses. Karlsson...|$|R
