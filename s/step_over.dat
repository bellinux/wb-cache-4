5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead <b>step</b> <b>over</b> him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E

40|$|International audience— Humanoid robots {{are getting}} {{increasingly}} {{attention in the}} robotics community, {{not only for the}} scientific challenge of the complex multibody system issues and mechatronic designs, but also due to their high mobility and versatility. Humanoid robots have the potential to navigate through complex environ-ments such as the standard living surrounding of humans. This is mainly due to the bipedal legged nature of the robotic system, which allows higher mobility than its wheeled counterpart. One of the advantages is that it can negotiate obstacles by <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> them, which is the topic of the work presented in this paper. The main focus of this research is to investigate <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> large obstacles. Previous work has reported on algorithms using quasi-static balancing, which resulted in somehow unnatural slow motions. This work however is focussing on <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> larger obstacles in a fluent dynamic motion, using stability criteria on zero moment point instead of center of gravity. All the work is formulated in function of the elaborate HRP- 2 humanoid research platform. In this paper a preliminary 2 D study on <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> leg trajectories and their dynamic implications on the overall stability are investigated. The paper discusses the implementation of the <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> procedure in the overall dynamic motion generator, the implications on the kinematics and dynamics and finally the actual <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> foot trajectory planner...|$|R

In his prime, Ronaldo was an extremely fast player with great acceleration, which made him a threat for opposing defences when he undertook individual dribbling runs during counter-attacks.|$|E

A common prohibition throughout Bara communities forbids serving food or drink to someone with the utensils, plates or cups that were used to serve another.

25|$|Although the Boeing design {{had been}} the first to enter series production, the 247 proved to have some serious design deficiencies. Air {{carriers}} considered its limited capacity a drawback since it carried only ten passengers, in five rows with a seat {{on each side of the}} aisle, as well as a flight attendant. Compared to the more spacious DC-2 and later DC-3, the passenger count was too few to make it a commercially viable airliner. Another feature influencing passenger comfort was that the 247's main wing spar ran through the cabin, so persons moving through the cabin had to <b>step</b> <b>over</b> it. The Lockheed Model 10 Electra had a similar configuration and while it was a more compact design, the Electra managed to carry the same number of passengers at a slightly better overall performance, and more importantly, at a lower cost-per-mile.|$|E
25|$|The {{debugger}} allows setting breakpoints (which allow execution to {{be stopped}} temporarily at a certain position) and watches (which monitor the values of variables as the execution progresses). Breakpoints can be conditional, meaning they get triggered when the condition is met. Code can be stepped over, i.e., run one line (of source code) at a time. It can either step into functions to debug inside it, or <b>step</b> <b>over</b> it, i.e., {{the execution of the}} function body isn't available for manual inspection. The debugger supports Edit and Continue, i.e., it allows code to be edited as it is being debugged. When debugging, if the mouse pointer hovers over any variable, its current value is displayed in a tooltip ("data tooltips"), where it can also be modified if desired. During coding, the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window. The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window.|$|E
25|$|The {{most memorable}} match in Ronaldinho's World Cup career {{took place in}} the quarter-final against England on 21 June. With Brazil {{trailing}} after Michael Owen's 23-minute strike, Ronaldinho turned the game around. Having received the ball inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran at the England defence and wrong footed star defender Ashley Cole with a trademark <b>step</b> <b>over</b> before passing the ball to Rivaldo {{on the edge of the}} penalty area to score the equalising goal just before half-time. Then, in the 50th minute, Ronaldinho took a free-kick from 40 yards out which curled into the top left corner of the net, completely surprising England's goalkeeper David Seaman, giving Brazil a 2–1 lead. Seven minutes later, however, he was controversially sent-off for a foul on England's defender Danny Mills. Ronaldinho was suspended for the semi-final, but returned to Brazil's starting lineup for the 2–0 victory over Germany in the final as Brazil won its record fifth World Cup title.|$|E

25|$|The {{hull of the}} Fahd is of {{all-welded}} steel armor construction giving complete {{protection against}} attack by 7.62 mm caliber AP rounds and shell splinters. The vehicle is equipped with air conditioning. The driver sits {{at the front of}} the vehicle on the left side with the commander to the right. Both have forward observation via large bulletproof windows, which can be rapidly covered by an armored shutter hinged at the top, and a side door that opens to the front, featuring a window in its upper part that can also be covered by a shutter as well. Above the commander's position is a single-piece, rear-opening hatch cover. The driver has a forward-facing, roof-mounted day periscope, which can be replaced by a passive periscope for night driving. The troop compartment is at the rear of the hull with the infantry entering via a door in the rear, the upper part of which folds upwards and the lower part downwards to form a <b>step.</b> <b>Over</b> the top of the troop compartment are two rectangular roof hatches hinged in the center that can be locked vertically. The infantry sits on individual bucket seats down the center of the vehicle facing outwards. In either side of the troop compartment are four firing ports with a vision block above so that the troops can fire their weapons from within the vehicle. Either side of the rear door has a firing port with a vision block above. Optional equipment may be fitted on the vehicle, such as an NBC protection system and passive IR among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{processes}} and interprets proprioception {{in a manner}} similar to how our visual system processes information. When we view a painting, the brain interprets the total visual field, as opposed to processing each individual pixel of information independently, and then derives an image. At any instant the spinal cord receives an ensemble of information from all receptors throughout the body that signals a proprioceptive “image” that represents time and space, and it computes which neurons to excite next based on the most recently perceived “images.” The importance of the CPG is not simply its ability to generate repetitive cycles, but also to receive, interpret, and predict the appropriate sequences of actions during any part of the step cycle, i.e., state dependence. The peripheral input then provides important information from which the probabilities of a given set of neurons being active at any given time can be finely tuned to a given situation during a specific phase of a step cycle. An excellent example of this is when a mechanical stimulus is applied to the dorsum of the paw of a cat. When the stimulus is applied during the swing phase, the flexor muscles of that limb are excited, and the result is enhanced flexion in order to <b>step</b> <b>over</b> the obstacle that created the stimulus. However, when the same stimulus is applied during stance, the extensors are excited. Thus, the functional connectivity between mechanoreceptors and specific interneuronal populations within the spinal cord varies according to the physiological state. Even the efficacy of the monosynaptic input from muscle spindles to the motor neuron changes readily from one part of the step cycle to another, according to whether a subject is running or walking.|$|E

[...] Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and became involved with his colleague Joseph Byrne.|$|E
