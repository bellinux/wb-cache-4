25|$|SCOA-P pattern {{wheels are}} {{a type of}} steam {{locomotive}} wheel. Rather than having traditional solid spokes, the SCOA-P spoke is hollow, with a 'U' shaped cross section.

50|$|With the {{exception}} of the Class 9E, all previous South African electric locomotives ran on <b>spoked</b> <b>wheels</b> and used spur gears. The Swiss-built Class 14E ran on solid wheels and used double helical or herringbone gears, while the locally built Class 14E1 was delivered with the traditional <b>spoked</b> <b>wheels</b> but with helical gears.|$|R
25|$|The {{critical}} invention {{that allowed}} the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel.</b> The earliest spoke-wheeled chariots date to ca. 2000BC. The use of chariots peaked around 1300BC (see Battle of Kadesh). Chariots had lost their military importance by the 1st centuryAD, but chariot races continued to be popular in Constantinople until the 6th century.|$|E
2500|$|The ATS company {{created some}} revolutionary new {{lightweight}} wheels for Porsche and VW automobiles. ATS manufactured a light aluminum alloy 5 spoked [...] wheel for AMG, the high performance tuner for Mercedes-Benz automobiles, in the 1970s and 1980s. This 5 <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{popularly known as}} the AMG [...] "Penta" [...] wheel. The AMG [...] "Penta" [...] <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel</b> by ATS, designed by Hans-Werner Aufrecht in 1979, was the first aluminum alloy rim marketed by AMG {{when it was still}} an independent tuning company.|$|E
2500|$|In {{video or}} cinematography, {{temporal}} aliasing {{results from the}} limited frame rate, and causes the wagon-wheel effect, whereby a <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel</b> appears to rotate too slowly or even backwards. Aliasing has changed its apparent frequency of rotation. A reversal of direction {{can be described as}} a negative frequency. [...] Temporal aliasing frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the camera, but the relative intensity of the aliased frequencies is determined by the shutter timing (exposure time) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction filter during filming.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{in detail the}} dermoscopic and histopathological findings {{in a case of}} a superficial type of multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). These multiple lesions (occurring in the chest, neck, and back) showed three different findings, respectively. Dermoscopy of the erythematous and brown-colored patch on the anterior chest showed <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> areas, and the histopathological cross-section revealed vertical <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> structures. In the black- and brown-colored patch at the neck, the dermatoscopy showed a maple leaf-like structure, which was in accordance with the strengthening of the histological lateral connection of the lesion. The brown-colored patch of the lateral back histologically showed irregularly enlarged spoke wheel-like areas with peripheral increased melanin pigments, which correlated with the dark black color of dermoscopic maple leaf-like areas. The vertical <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> areas by dermatoscopy revealed a horizontal <b>spoke</b> <b>wheel</b> structure by histopathology...|$|R

2500|$|In 1956, the BTC {{was granted}} a heraldic {{achievement}} by the College of Arms and the Lord Lyon, and then BTC chairman Brian Robertson wanted a grander logo for the railways. BR's second corporate logo (1956–1965), designed in consultation with Charles Franklyn, adapted the original, depicting a rampant lion emerging from a heraldic crown and holding a <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel,</b> all enclosed in a roundel with the [...] "British Railways" [...] name displayed across a bar on either side. This emblem soon acquired the nickname of the [...] "Ferret and Dartboard". A variant of the logo with the name in a circle was also used on locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|Two logos (or crests) {{were used}} during the period. The first logo (1948–1956) was the [...] "Lion and Wheel" [...] (sometimes nicknamed the [...] "Cycling Lion"), showing a lion {{standing}} over a <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel</b> upon which the words [...] "British Railways" [...] were displayed. The second logo (1956–1965) featured a lion holding a wheel (which {{gave rise to the}} nickname [...] "ferret and dartboard"), sitting in a crown, with the words [...] "British" [...] and [...] "Railways" [...] to left and right. (Passenger stock and certain diesel locomotives used a roundel variant, where the words [...] "British Railways" [...] were in a ring surrounding the crest.) From 1965, the BR Corporate Image and [...] "Double Arrow" [...] logo was adopted, but this logo was not applied to steam locomotives (except on the Vale of Rheidol line).|$|E

2500|$|Development of a {{corporate}} identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the British Transport Commission and the Railway Executive. The Executive attempted to introduce a modern, curved logo which could also serve as the standard for station signage totems. Due to its similarity to a hot dog, it {{became known as the}} [...] "flying sausage". BR eventually adopted the common branding of the BTC as its first corporate logo, an Art Deco-style motif of a lion astride a <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel,</b> designed for the BTC by Cecil Thomas; on the bar overlaid across the wheel, the BTC's name was replaced with the words [...] "British Railways". This logo, nicknamed the [...] "Cycling Lion", was applied from 1948–1956 to the sides of locomotives, while the sausage logo was adopted for station signs across Great Britain, each coloured according to the appropriate BR region.|$|E
2500|$|SCOA-P wheels were {{developed}} in the late 1940s by the Steel Company of Australia Ltd (the P in the acronym standing for F. C. Paynter, who patented the design) in response to Victorian Railways experiencing fatigue problems with conventional spoked wheels. Stronger Boxpok type 'B' wheels had been installed {{on a number of}} VR locomotive classes in the late 1940s, but they had the disadvantage of being relatively heavy and also restricted maintenance access to axleboxes, underslung springs, and in some cases boiler washout plugs. Boxpok wheels were proposed for the forthcoming Victorian Railways R class 4-6-4, which had a relatively heavy [...] axle load, but it had been discovered that the use of a Boxpok wheel would make coupling rod pin removal difficult. The SCOA-P wheel was developed to allow the strength of the Boxpok design but also provide the maintenance access of a conventional <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{reaction}} to a radial load of a well-tensioned wire <b>spoked</b> <b>wheel,</b> such as by a rider sitting on a bicycle, is that the wheel flattens slightly near the ground contact area. The rest of the wheel remains approximately circular. The tension of all the spokes does not increase significantly. Instead, only the spokes directly under the hub decrease their tension. The issue of how best to describe this situation is debated. Some authors conclude from this that the hub [...] "stands" [...] on those spokes immediately below it that experience a reduction in tension, even though the spokes below the hub exert no upward force on the hub and can be replaced by chains without much changing the physics of the wheel. Other authors conclude that the hub [...] "hangs" [...] from those spokes above it that exert an upward force on the hub, and that have higher tension than the spokes below the hub, which pull down on the hub.|$|E
