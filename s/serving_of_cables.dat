40|$|The {{internal}} defects <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints always {{accelerate the}} deterioration of insulation, until finally accidents can arise due to {{the explosion of the}} joints. The formation process of this damage often involves changes in the electromagnetic, temperature and stress distribution <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> joint, therefore, it is necessary to analyze the electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical distribution <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints. Aiming at solving this problem, the paper sets up a 3 -D electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical coupling model <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints under crimping process defects. Based on the model, the electromagnetic losses distribution, temperature distribution and stress distribution <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> joint and body are calculated. Then, the coupling fields characteristics in different contact coefficient k, ambient temperature Tamb and load current I were analyzed, and according to the thermal-mechanical characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> joint under internal defects, the temperature difference ΔTf and stress difference Δσf <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> surface are applied to evaluate the internal cable joint defects. Finally, a simplified model <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> joint is set up to verify the accuracy of the coupling field model proposed in this paper, which indicates that the model can be used to analyze the coupling fields characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints and the method can be applied to evaluate crimping process defects <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints...|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the suitability <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> 6 – 110 kV with XLPE insulation in comparison with <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> the same voltage but possessing paper-oil insulation has been fulfilled {{on the basis of}} the criterion of reduced costs. Thus, the comparison was undertaken between <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> various design and material of insulation: three-core paper insulated ones vs. three-core XLPE insulated ones; three-core paper-insulated ones vs. solid wires with XLPE insulation; single-core oil-filled <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> 110 kV with paper insulation vs. solid wires of 110 kV with XLPE insulation. The increase in long-term permissible current loads for cables with XLPE insulation because of the larger permissible temperature of heating in comparison with cables with paper-oil insulation complies with as would increase in the cross-sectional area <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> cores (equal to 0. 61 from the original) and therefore reduces the cost <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> by reducing the cost of manufacture of conductors. The reduced costs of the construction and operation <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines with XLPE insulation (accounting the increase in the cost <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> 1. 2 and 2 times as compared with the cost <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> with three-core insulation), despite the decline in the cost of manufacture of conductors and the reduced annual operating costs (9 % and 17 % respectively <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines <b>of</b> voltage of up to 35 kV and 110 kV), occurred to be more than the reduced costs of the construction and operation <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines with paper insulation.

As an indicator of the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> line the maximum mean time to failure (the value inversely proportional to the parameter of succession of failures), which is an order more for cable lines with XLPE insulation than for cable lines with paper insulation, is adopted. A comprehensive {{assessment of}} the convenience <b>of</b> installation <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines revealed that the installation <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> with XLPE insulation features a 1. 2 – 1. 6 times easier installation as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and 1. 4 times easier installation as compared to single-core oil-filled <b>cables</b> (voltage <b>of</b> 110 kW). The efficacy <b>of</b> the <b>cables</b> 6 – 110 kW with XLPE insulation is proved on the basis on the method of multi-objective optimization, that took into account as the costs for the construction and operation <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines and the reliability of its operation, ease of its installation and other quality indicators. If the goals taken into account are considered as equally important, the polyethylene-insulated cables for a voltage of 10 – 110 kW is more efficient as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and solid (110 kW) cables with paper insulation. Herewith, the cost <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> with XLPE insulation may exceed the cost <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> with paper insulation up to two times.

5000|$|Cable driven robots (called as cable-suspended robots and wire-driven robots as well) are {{a type of}} {{parallel}} manipulators in which flexible cables are used as actuators. One end <b>of</b> each <b>cable</b> is reeled around a rotor twisted by a motor, and the other end {{is connected to the}} end-effector. One famous example <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> robots is SKYCAM which is used to move a suspended camera in stadiums. Cables are much lighter than rigid linkages of a serial or parallel robot, and very long cables can be used without making the mechanism massive. As a result, the end-effector <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> robot can achieve high accelerations and velocities and work in a very large workspace (e.g. a stadium). Numerous engineering articles have studied the kinematics and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> robots (e.g. see [...] In The International Journal of Robotics Research 27.9 (2008): 1007-1026. for an enhanced of the concept). Dynamic analysis <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> robots {{is not the same as}} that of other parallel robots because cables can only pull an object but they cannot push. Therefore, the manipulator is able to perform a task only if the force in all cables are non-negative. Accordingly, the workspace <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> robots is defined as a region in space where the end-effector is able to exert the required wrench (force and moment vectors) to the surroundings while all cables are in tension (non-negative forces). Many research works have focused on workspace analysis and optimization <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> robots. Workspace and controllability <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> robots can be enhanced by adding <b>cables</b> to structure <b>of</b> the robot. Consequently, redundancy plays a key role in design <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> robots.|$|R
