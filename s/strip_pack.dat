50|$|Blister packs are {{commonly}} used as unit-dose packaging for pharmaceutical tablets, capsules or lozenges. Blister packs can provide barrier protection for shelf life requirements, and a degree of tamper resistance. In the US, blister packs are mainly used for packing physician samples of drug products or for over-the-counter (OTC) products in the pharmacy. In {{other parts of the}} world, blister packs are the main packaging type since pharmacy dispensing and re-packaging are not common. A series of blister cavities is sometimes called a blister card or blister strip as well as blister pack. The difference between a <b>strip</b> <b>pack</b> and blister pack is that a <b>strip</b> <b>pack</b> does not have thermo-formed or cold formed cavities; the <b>strip</b> <b>pack</b> is formed around the tablet {{at a time when it}} is dropped to the sealing area between sealing moulds. In some parts of the world the pharmaceutical blister pack is known as a push-through pack (PTP), an accurate description of two key properties (i) the lidding foil is brittle, making it possible to press the product out while breaking the lidding foil and (ii) a semi-rigid formed cavity being sufficiently collapsible to be able to dispense the tablet or capsule by means of pressing it out with the thumb. Breaking the lidding foil with a fingernail for the appropriate tablet will make the pressing out easier.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} the two-dimensional bin packing problem and the <b>strip</b> <b>packing</b> problem, which are popular geometric generalizations of the classical bin packing problem. In both problems, a list of rectangles has to be packed into a designated area such that no two rectangles overlap and all rectangles are packed axis-parallel. For the <b>strip</b> <b>packing</b> problem, the given items have to be <b>packed</b> into a <b>strip</b> of unit width and minimal height, whereas in the two-dimensional bin packing problem a packing has to be found into a minimal number of unit-sized bins. We investigate approximation algorithms and online algorithms for these problems and consider variants where rotations of the rectangles are forbidden and where rotations by 90 degrees are allowed. In particular, we present two approximation algorithms for <b>strip</b> <b>packing</b> with approximation ratios 1. 9396 and arbitrarily close to 5 / 3,respectively. These results are the first improvements upon the approximation ratio of 2 that was established 16 years ago. Moreover, we show an improved lower bound of 2. 589 on the competitive ratio of online <b>strip</b> <b>packing</b> along with an upper bound of 2. 618 for restricted input instances. For two-dimensional bin packing we derive best-possible approximation algorithms for the variants with and without rotations.

Two of these algorithms guarantee a packing that may be disentangled by guillotine cuts. These are combined with a two-stage heuristic designed {{to find a solution}} to the variable-sized bin packing problem, where the aim is to pack all items into bins so as to minimise the packing area. This heuristic packs the levels of a solution to the <b>strip</b> <b>packing</b> problem into large bins and then attempts to repack the items in those bins into smaller bins in order to reduce wasted space. The results of the algorithms are compared to those of seven level-packing heuristics from the literature by means {{of a large number of}} strip-packing benchmark instances.

40|$|<b>Strip</b> <b>packing</b> is a {{classical}} packing problem, where {{the goal is}} to pack a set of rectangular objects into a strip of a given width, while minimizing the total height of the packing. The problem has multiple applications, e. g. in scheduling and stock-cutting, and has been studied extensively. When the dimensions of objects are allowed to be exponential in the total input size, it is known that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor better than 3 / 2, unless P=NP. However, there was no corresponding lower bound for polynomially bounded input data. In fact, Nadiradze and Wiese [SODA 2016] have recently proposed a (1. 4 + ϵ) approximation algorithm for this variant, thus showing that <b>strip</b> <b>packing</b> with polynomially bounded data can be approximated better than when exponentially large values in the input data are allowed. Their result has subsequently been improved to a (4 / 3 + ϵ) approximation by two independent research groups [FSTTCS 2016, arXiv: 1610. 04430]. This raises a question whether <b>strip</b> <b>packing</b> with polynomially bounded input data admits a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme, as is the case for related two-dimensional packing problems like maximum independent set of rectangles or two-dimensional knapsack.

The stacking constraint forbids solutions in which a vertical line intersects two slices of the same rectangle.
