40|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (PET) bottles {{which are}} intended for filling with beverages or other foods {{have to be in}} compliance with the food regulatory requirements as laid down in the EU Plastics Directive 2002 / 72 /EC. It has to be assured that the overall <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> and the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> of the monomers mono- and diethylene glycol as well as of terephthalic acid and the catalyst antimony are not exceeded. Conventionally this is carried out by experimental migration testing. In this study a survey of overall and <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> from 34 PET bottle types from German PET bottle manufactures and German beverage industry was performed and compared to rapid extraction tests as well as mathematical migration modelling. In all cases overall and <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> was close to or below the detection limits of the analytical methods. It gets evident that due to the physical properties of the PET bottle material, the overall and the relevant <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> cannot be exceeded.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} if {{overall migration}} test procedures {{could also be}} used to test for the <b>migration</b> of <b>specific</b> substances from plastics. The overall migration test procedure used was the evaporative gravimetric method used with volatile food simulants. Thirty food-contact substances (additives and monomers) were tested for their chemical stability and volatile loss during the heated evaporation stage of the overall migration procedure. Eighteen of the 30 were determined in an acceptable yield. It is concluded that in the list of approximately 620 European Union substances that have <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> of 5 mg kg - 1 or higher, and based on considerations of stability and volatility, more than half could be amenable to control using overall migration methodology. This is particularly the case for inert plastics with low intrinsic overall migration values of oligomers. This means that based on the overall migration test result found, testing laboratories could decide on a case-by-case basis if known additives and starting substances are covered by the overall migration result and no separate testing would be required for <b>specific</b> <b>migration,</b> with time and resource cost savings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we studied the {{migration}} amount of formaldehyde in products of tripolycyanamide for food packaging. In order {{to review the}} rule of products of tripolycyanamide for food packaging, with different stimulant solutions, simulated temperatures and soaking time, the migration quantities of formaldehyde in products of tripolycyanamide for food packaging into deionized water, 3 % acetic acid and 15 % ethanol were measured by phenylhydrazine hydrochloride spectrophotometry. The amounts of formaldehyde migrated to 3 % acetic acid was {{higher than those of}} 15 % ethanol. Espousing in higher temperature, amount of formaldehyde of the products of tripolycyanamide were migrated more. And the total migrations of formaldehyde in three exposures was beyond the EU <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> for formaldehyde (15 mg/L). With the higher temperature exposure was done, the amount of formaldehyde migration reaches maximum in lower number of repeated exposures. We also discussed the formaldehyde migration rule for different surface roughness of food packaging materials...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{additives}} in plastics {{is essential}} for the processing and performance of plastic products since the additives enhance the desired characteristics of the polymers. Nevertheless, there are restrictions established by the Brazilian Agency of Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA) for plastic packages intended to be in contact with foodstuffs which must be submitted to analyses at a proper laboratory in order to check the compliance with the requirements established. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} develop a method for determining the migration of n-octadecyl 3 -(3, 5 -ditert-butyl- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) propionate, antioxidant known commercially as Irganox 1076, CAS 2082 - 79 - 3, from plastic packages intended to be in contact with foodstuffs employing high performance liquid chromatography. This study also aims to ensure that commercial plastic package samples are in agreement with the requirement established by ANVISA relative to the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> for this additive. The results have shown that the methodology used for aqueous, acid and fatty simulants is satisfactory for determining the migration of Irganox 1076 since all parameters needed for the validation of the method were achieved.

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the substance phosphorous acid, mixed 2, 4 -bis(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl and 4 -(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl triesters. The substance was evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2011 and 2, 4 -di-tert-amylphenol, an impurity and hydrolysis product was re-evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2015. In this application, the applicant requested an increase of the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of the substance, currently established at 5 mg/kg food, to 10 mg/kg food, and provided new toxicological studies. Findings from three new in vitro mutagenicity assays on the oxidation products support the conclusion from 2011 that the substance and its oxidation products are not genotoxic. A new toxicokinetic study on the substance supports the consideration from the evaluation in 2011 that the substance does not raise concern for accumulation. The outcome of a new delayed neurotoxicity study on a structurally related substance, phosphorous acid, tris (2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) ester, which was considered not to cause neurotoxicity in hens, strengthens {{the conclusion of the}} Panel in 2011 that the substance does not represent a concern for neurotoxicity. From a new two-generation reproduction toxicity study and a prenatal developmental toxicity study on the substance, a new subchronic toxicity study on its oxidation products that completes the one submitted in 2011 on the substance itself, and a 2 -year oral toxicity study on the structurally related substance, the lowest NOAEL was 58 - 147 mg/kg bw per day (from the 2 -year oral toxicity study). Compared to the requested increase of the migration limit, this gives an acceptable margin of safety of 348. Therefore, the CEF Panel concluded that an increase of the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of the substance from 5 to 10 mg/kg food is not a safety concern for the consumer...|$|E

The samples were a bowl, a jug, a mug, a ladle and different cups and plates. No violation of the EU <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> for melamine (30 mg/kg) and formaldehyde (15 mg/kg) was seen after three successive exposures to the food stimulant 3 % acetic acid, two hours at 70 oC. To investigate the effects of long-term use, migration tests were performed with two types of cups from a day nursery. Furthermore, medium-term use was studied by 10 successive exposures of a plate to 3 % acetic acid, 30 min at 95 oC. The results indicate that continuous migration of formaldehyde and melamine takes place during the lifetime of the articles. The molar ratio of released formaldehyde to melamine was seen to decrease from 12 to about 5. This indicates that first the migration of residual monomers is most important {{but in the long}} term breakdown of the polymer dominates. Two CEN-methods were used to determine the concentration of monomers; a spectrophotometric method for formaldehyde and a UV-HPLC method for melamine...|$|R
40|$|For {{measuring}} {{the migration from}} polymers a rapid solvent extraction method {{based on the principle}} of swelling the polymeric matrix has been developed. The method uses a solvent (ethanol or isooctane) of the same polarity as the polymer that is to be extracted. The applicability of this "rapid solvent extraction method" which has already been proven suitable for overall migration from polyolefins - using isooctane as a swelling agent in this case - was further evaluated for polyamide plastics. Migration kinetics with isooctane and ethanol were measured. Kinetic results showed that ethanol is swelling polyamide and leads to maximum total migration values after a few hours at 40 °C. Kinetics with isooctane showed that even after 10 days at 40 °C, migration values far below the ethanol values. This indicates that the determination of the migrant concentration in the polyamide polymer using rapid ethanol-extraction can be used as an alternative quick approach for otherwise time-consuming (<b>specific)</b> <b>migration</b> testing. The obtained results show that the "rapid solvent extraction method" is also working with the polyamide polymer. Examples will be given for overall migration values and also for <b>migration</b> of <b>specific</b> compounds from polyamide materials. The data also support the application of the so called "QM/SML-Concept" which reduces the amount of actual testing which is necessary to ensure the conformity of polymeric food packaging materials with <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> (SML) laid down by legislation. The principle of this concept is to measure the quantity of a specific migrant in the polymer (QM) by an appropriate extraction method and to calculate its <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> value using a scientifically acknowledged mathematical model...|$|R
40|$|To assure {{consumer}} protection, {{the transfer}} of constituents from plastic food contact materials to the food {{is limited by the}} Plastic Directive 2002 / 72 /EC. To show the conformity of materials with this directive, the overall and <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> of certain monomers and additives has to be tested. The performance of laboratories during migration testing can be the source of large errors and can only be checked by the the use of reference materials with known migration values. The availability of Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> testing would help ensuring consistent, uniform and reliable measurements. Also, they would have an important value for the validation of alternative, cost saving and rapid migration methods, both by experimentation and by predictive mathematical modelling.

40|$|Also aged bottles {{are safer}} to use than new bottles because their {{chemical}} leaching {{was found to}} be lower than that of new bottles. This study recommends the reassessment of the absence of international guidelines for acetaldehyde in water and foods. The study also recommends that the amount of acetaldehyde that can be added to soft drinks as flavouring agent should be below the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> (SML) for migration of acetaldehyde from PET bottle into bottle contents. This is essential since the SML was designed to ensure that exposure to acetaldehyde, as a result of intake of bottled water and soft drinks in PET bottles, is below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for acetaldehyde. As antimony was reported to go beyond the safe limits in some Nigerian bottled water and soft drinks after 11 months of storage this study discourages the use of bottle contents stored for a very long time.

40|$|International audienceTesting the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> of all {{substances}} intentionally {{added to}} polymer material according to European Union (EU) regulation is a tedious and expensive task. Although mathematical modeling offers an interesting alternative, it overestimates significantly the migration in situations, which are strongly conservative due to significant uncertainty in transport properties. In addition, its application {{is of little}} use for end-users or enforcement laboratories, which {{do not have access}} to the formulation. This paper revises the paradigm of migration modeling by combining modeling with deformulation experiments and iterative modeling in the framework of decision theory. The complete approach is illustrated on polyolefins in contact with 50 % ethanol for eight typical migrants, including hindered phenolic antioxidants and low molecular weight surrogates. Results of the national RA 05. 22 ACTIA project on the identification of formulation fingerprints and on the prediction of partition coefficients with alcoholic and aqueous simulants were in particular considered. When the true migration was close but still lower than the limit of concern, the proposed compact decision tree, including up to four sources of uncertainty, showed that the chance of demonstrating compliance was about 3 : 4 in presence of one source of uncertainty, whereas it fell below 2 : 4 and 1 : 4 with two and three sources of uncertainty respectively. The recommendations for further sanitary surveys and future developments are discussed in the last section...|$|R
40|$|A {{functional}} barrier (FB) can be generally {{defined as a}} package construction that limits the amount of migration compounds from the package to an acceptable degree. Most commonly the package is a multilayer structure and the migrating compounds originate from the package interior encapsulated by plastics barrier layers. The degree of "acceptability" which {{is controlled by the}} toxocological evaluation or the organoleptical impact of the respective compound is either defined by law through individual <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> or a general threshold of regulation or by the quality assurance requirements to a certain product. The FB efficienca - understood as a migration related term - depends on the numerous parameters which are connected with the type of polymer and foodstuff as well as the food packaging application. Since one of the more important parameters is the plastic's diffusivity, materials such as PET have an advantage over low diffusivity plastics such as polyolefines which le ads to the current market developments with respect to PET recycling. In the presented study, the {{functional barrier}} behaviour of three-layered coextruded PET films with a contaminated center layer was investigated in dependency of the FB thickness, time and temperature of storage conditions, nature of the PET contact matrix as well as chemical structure and molecular weight of the contaminant. From the result, a number of conclusions can be drawn dealing with minimum requirements to FB thickness and the workability conditions for the FB concept as well as FB efficiency testing...|$|R
40|$|Phthalates are organic {{lipophilic}} compounds {{which are}} mainly used as plasticizer. Human exposure occurs mainly via food ingestion {{and can cause}} negative health effects. Phthalates are not only present in food because of environmental contamination, {{but also as a}} result of migration from contact materials used during production, transport and storage. <b>Specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> for several phthalates have been formulated by the European Commission regarding their use in plastic food contact materials (Directive 2002 / 72 /EC). However, up till now, there is no European regulation regarding residue values of phthalates in food products. In this study, a model will be developed to predict the human dietary exposure to eight phthalates. The model will include - among others - the environmental transfer into primary foods and the migration of phthalates from contact materials into foods. Therefore, input data (concentration data of phthalates in environmental media, contact materials and food products, physicochemical parameters of phthalates, transfer factors, processing factors, etc.) will be linked via formulae or relationships from literature or own measurements. By linking this model to national food consumption survey data, a dietary exposure assessment can be made. The human risks related to the dietary exposure to phthalates can be evaluated by comparing the estimated intakes with tolerable daily intake values for phthalates. Eventually, these risk assessments can be used by the government to draw up specific regulations for residue values of phthalates in certain food products...|$|R

The both types of raw meat were analyzed for the content of DBP and DEHP and packed into chosen packages. The samples of meat products were thermally processed (70 ℃, 10 min in the core), stored until the expiration date at 4 °C and gradually analyzed after 1 st, 7 th, 14 th, 21 st and 28 th day of storage. Determination of phthalates {{was carried out by}} high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the Zorbax Eclipse C 8 column and by UV detection at a wavelength of 224  mm.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present a {{comprehensive}} picture of phthalates: their properties, uses, occurrence, modes of possible exposure, their impact on human health, legislation on phthalates, phthalate occurrence in {{fruits and vegetables and}} their impact. Phthalates are esters of 1, 2 -Benzenedicarboxylic acid (phthalic acid). They are most commonly used as plasticizers, but also in adhesives, sealants, creams, oils, varnishes, perfumes, and in medical devices. They are also part of many packages used in the food industry. Due to the fact that phthalates are not chemically bonded in these products they are being continuously released into the air and dissolved in liquids and food, leading to exposure through food and drinks consumption, transmission through the skin or by inhaling. In the Slovak legislation currently are no limits restricting the presence of phthalates in food and beverages. Limits were set by the decree of Ministry of Agriculture of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Republic Ministry of Health of 15 March 2004 No. 608 / 3 / 2004 - 100, which issued the chapter of Codex of the Slovak Republic regulating contaminants in food.

Representative materials covering a range of uses (primary and secondary packaging and article for take away foods) were obtained from distributors. A screening approach was applied by means of solvent extraction with subsequent analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A large number of analytes were detected, and a chemometric approach was used to explore the data.

In the corrugated and printed packaging, it is worth emphasizing the presence of residual solvents, probably coming from printing inks, as well as hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds, mainly toluene and plasticizers linked also to the recycled pulp content such as diisobutyl phthalate or diisopropylnaphthalenes, whereas in the plastic-laminated samples, triacetin was identified as the prevailing compound. A literature search for safety data or legislative restrictions of the identified substances was performed. Additionally, the semi-quantification of the compounds in the packaging allowed a worst case estimation of food contamination by means of the infinite total migration model; occasionally, migration estimations overcame the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits.</b> The chosen analytical methods coupled with a chemometric approach proved to be an effective way to describe the data; it may be concluded that only the simultaneous consideration of several chemicals with a multivariate approach allowed the investigated packaging materials to be distinguished...|$|R

Data suggest that brushing of the bottle did not raise the release of BPA. Claims that used bottles release more BPA than new bottles and that mineral composition of the aqueous food simulant affect release could not be substantiated.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to manufacture, using a laboratory-scale film {{production}} pilot plant, nanocomposite polylactic acid (PLA) films added with Cloisite 30 B clay-derived nanofiller having one nanometric dimension, and to characterize and to assess the migration of the obtained systems, in view of food packaging applications. The study demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to obtain nanocomposite PLA films with intercalated/exfoliated morphology of the dispersed layered nanofiller using conventional film production technologies. With increasing the silicate content in the film, the developed systems show a marked improvement of the mechanical performance, with a rise in the modulus and in the elongation at break with respect to the unfilled PLA, a significant lowering in the oxygen permeability and a slight increase in the surface wettability, without given significant alteration of film transparency and chromatic perception. Compared with the unfilled PLA, no significant changes can be observed about the migration behaviour of the nanocomposite PLA systems. In fact, both the overall migration and the specific migration, measured as lactic acid, remain always well below the applicable generic <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of 60 mg/kg food (10 mg/dm 2) of the Regulation EU 10 / 2011...|$|E
40|$|The {{opinion is}} a review {{examines}} {{the health risks}} {{associated with the use}} of melamine-formaldehyde plastics for the manufacture of products intended for contact with foodstuffs – table ware and kitchen utensils. As a result of incomplete course of polycondensation processes in the production of polymer, as well scratches the surfaces during the technology of the products, the use of these utensils is often accompanied by increased migration of melamine and formaldehyde in food. The review traces the influence of various factors (temperature, time, pH of the medium, unproper use, surface roughness, wear, etc) on possible migration of both monomers in food products stored or contact with such ware. Information is provided about existing health risk when using poor quality melamine products or use them in unsuitable conditions. Chemical and toxicological characteristics of two monomers are also discussed. The opinion reports the results of the first survey of the Bulgarian market on the migration of formaldehyde and melamine from Chinese melamine-ware. For 3 years samples have been tested to see whether the <b>Specific</b> <b>Migration</b> <b>Limits</b> (SML) for formaldehyde and melamine are being observed. The food simulant 3 % aqueous acetic acid was used as this is the most aggressive simulant towards melamine plastics. The test conditions used depended on the labeling but mainly were repeated exposure to the simulant for 2 hours at 70 °C. Migration of formaldehyde was detected in 2011 in 53 % from the samples and the levels were clearly above the legal maximum at 2 - 10 times the SML...|$|R
40|$|The {{migration}} of chemicals from packaging materials into foods {{is an important}} issue in food safety and quality. European legislation sets <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> which compliance must be assessed, surveyed and controlled by industry and authorities. Recently, the new Regulation UE 10 / 2011 included a new simulant - the Modified Polyphenylene Oxide (Tenax) for solid dry foods. The objective of this work was to compare the migration kinetics of two antioxidants into Tenax as compared to rice at 3 temperatures: 23, 40 and 70 C. The application of two different solutions of the 2 nd Fick’s law to describe and simulate the {{migration of}} the migrants to the present systems was studied. Diffusion coefficients ranged between 4. 80 E- 13 and 2. 84 E- 11 cm 2 /s for the migration into Tenax and between 6. 90 E- 18 and 4. 33 E- 17 cm 2 /s for the migration into rice. The partition coefficients ranged between 6 and 29 for Tenax and were over 1000 for rice. The activation energy for the migration into rice was half of that for Tenax. The models described relatively well the experimental data (ε < 12 % and < 30 % for rice and Tenax, respectively). Results indicate that the food simulant tends to overestimate migration values and thus can be safely used to assess materials compliance when materials are intended to contact with rice. However, results also indicate that Tenax is a much more severe simulant in representing rice...|$|R
40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids {{deals with the}} safety evaluation of an iron based oxygen absorber, comprising polyethyleneglycol, disodium pyrophosphate, monosodium phosphate and sodium chloride. This mixture is incorporated in polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) articles intended to be in contact with foodstuffs for hot fill/pasteurisation and/or long term storage at room temperature. For dried and fatty foods, {{direct contact with the}} materials is envisaged whereas other food types will be separated from the active material by a layer that does not contain the active components. All the substances constituting the oxygen absorber system have been evaluated and authorised for use as plastic food contact materials, as food additives or as food supplements. Based on <b>migration</b> results, the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> for iron, polyethyleneglycol, pyrophosphoric acid salts, phosphoric acid salts and sodium chloride, and the tolerable intake of phosphorus (phosphate) are not expected to be exceeded when the oxygen absorber system is used under the intended conditions of use, notably behind a layer not containing the active substance for contact with aqueous or acidic foods. Therefore, the CEF Panel concluded that the use of the substances, iron, polyethyleneglycol, disodium pyrophosphate, monosodium phosphate and sodium chloride do not raise a safety concern when used as oxygen absorbers incorporated in polyethylene and in polypropylene articles used for long time storage and/or hot fill up to 95 °C for several minutes in i) direct contact with dry and fatty foods and ii) indirect contact with aqueous or acidic foods, separated from the active material by a layer of at least 10 µm polyethylene or polypropylene that does not contain the oxygen absorber formulation...|$|R

Analysed packages containing higher concentrations of phthalates (5 samples) were subsequently used for monitoring the phthalate migration into the product due to thermal treatment. The determination of phthalates was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection at a wavelength of 224 nm. The DBP concentration ​​ranged from 0. 19 to 23. 95 µg. dm− 2 of the sample surface and that of DEHP was between 0. 01 and 103. 33 µg. dm− 2 of sample surface.

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{man-made}} compound, mainly {{used as a}} monomer to produce polycarbonate (PC), epoxy resins, non-polymer additives to other plastics, which have many food related applications, such as food storage containers, tableware and internal coating of cans, as well as non-food applications such as electronic equipment, construction materials and medical devices. BPA exposure can occur when the residual monomer migrates into packaged food and beverages. Moreover, due to the ubiquitous presence of this compound, the general population can be exposed to environmental sources such as water, air and soil. Many studies have investigated the potential health hazards associated with BPA, which can elicit toxic and cancerogenic effects on humans. According to the European Food Safety Authority opinion, diet {{is considered to be}} the main source of exposure, especially canned food; moreover, among non-canned food, meat and fish products have the highest levels of BPA contamination. This review focuses on BPA contamination in seafood, analysing worldwide literature (from January 2010 to October 2015) on BPA contamination of edible parts. The authors try to identify differences between canned and non-canned seafood in literature, and gaps in the state of art. The data evaluated underline that all concentrations for both canned and non-canned seafood were below the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> set by the European Community Directive for BPA in food.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} migration database {{was established}} for bisphenol A from polycarbonate baby bottles into water during exposure to microwave heating. Eighteen different brands of polycarbonate baby bottles sold in Europe were collected. Initial residual content of bisphenol A and migration after microwave heating were determined. Residual content of bisphenol A in the polycarbonate baby bottles ranged from 1. 4 to 35. 3 mg kg- 1. Migration of bisphenol A {{was determined by}} placing a polycarbonate bottle filled with water in a microwave oven and heating to 100 °C; the level of bisphenol A in the water was analysed by GC-MS. The procedure of microwave heating and analysis was repeated twice for the same bottle and, thus, three migration extracts were prepared for each test specimen. Migration of bisphenol A into water ranged from < 0. 1 to 0. 7 μg l- 1. There was no correlation {{between the amount of}} residual content of bisphenol A in the bottles and the migration of bisphenol A into water. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the amounts of bisphenol A in consecutive migration extracts. Data show that during three microwave-heating cycles of a baby bottle made from polycarbonate, microwave radiation had no effect on the migration of bisphenol A into water from polycarbonate. All levels found were well below the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of 0. 6 mg kg- 1 specified for bisphenol A in Commission Directive 2004 / 19 /EC...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePoly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles {{are widely}} used for beverages. Knowledge about the {{migration}} of organic compounds from the PET bottle wall into contact media is of interest especially when post-consumer recyclates are introduced into new PET bottles. Using migration theory the migration of a compound can be calculated if the concentration in the bottle wall is known. On the other hand, for any given <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> or maximum target concentration for organic chemical compounds in the bottled foodstuff, the maximum allowable concentrations in the polymer CP, 0 can be calculated. Since a food simulant cannot exactly simulate the real migration into the foodstuff or beverages, a worse case simulation behaviour is the intention. However, if the migration calculation should not be too over-estimative, the polymer specific kinetic parameter for migration modelling, the so-called AP value, should be established appropriately. One objective {{of the study was}} the kinetic determination of the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> behaviour of low molecular weight compounds such as solvents with relatively high diffusion rates and therefore with high migration potential from the PET bottle wall into food simulants in comparison with real beverages. For this purpose model contaminants were introduced into the bottle wall during preform production. The volatile compounds toluene and chlorobenzene were established at concentrations from about 20 to 30 ppm up to 300 to 350 ppm. Phenyl cyclohexane was present at concentrations of 35 ppm, 262 ppm and 782 ppm, respectively. The low volatile compounds benzophenone and methyl stearate have bottle wall concentrations of about 100 ppm in the low spiking level up to about 1000 ppm in the highly spiked test bottle. From these experimental data the polymer specific parameters (AP values) from mathematical migration modelling were derived. The experimental determined diffusing coefficients were determined, calculated and compared with literature data and an AP' value of 1 was derived thereof for non-swelling food simulants like 3 % acetic acid, 10 % ethanol or iso-octane. For more swelling condition e. g. 95 % ethanol as food simulant an AP' value of 3. 1 seems to be suitable for migration calculation. In relation to PET recycling safety aspects, maximum concentrations in the bottle wall were established for migrants / contaminants with different molecular weights, which correspond with a <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of 10 ppb. From the experimental data obtained using food simulants and in comparison with beverages, the most appropriate food simulant for PET packed foods with a sufficient but not too over-estimative worse case character was found to be 50 % ethanol. In addition, it can be shown that mass transport from PET is generally controlled by the very low diffusion in the polymer and, as a consequence, partitioning coefficients (KP/F values) of migrants between the polymer material and the foodstuff do not influence the migration levels significantly. An important consequence is that migration levels from PET food contact materials are largely independent from the nature of the packed food which on the other hand simplifies exposure estimations from PET...|$|R
