500|$|Common {{forms of}} {{preventive}} medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites. Both {{external and internal}} parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks. Worms {{are the most common}} internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites. [...] External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep keds, nose bots, sheep itch mites, and maggots. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, crutching (<b>shearing</b> <b>wool</b> from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb. [...] Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.|$|E
50|$|Adequate {{lighting}} and ventilation is provided for all shearers and shedhands {{who work in}} the shed. Good light is essential for quality <b>shearing,</b> <b>wool</b> classing and grinding etc., and is a very significant factor affecting sheep flow in the penning area. In the southern hemisphere southern walls can have translucent sheeting installed there as a source of natural lighting because direct sunlight is never a problem.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the twentieth}} century, women in Mongolia played vital roles in family and {{economic}} life. Some more elite women had more opportunities {{than those who}} had less, yet the demanding lifestyle required all women to work. Each household member had responsibilities, yet those of women tended to be much greater loads. In many cultures, women were expected to run the domestic duties in a household, yet women in Mongolia also managed out of the home work such as taking care of animals, manufacturing dairy products, <b>shearing</b> <b>wool,</b> and tanning hides. Through their household work, women in elite ranks of society were able to further their roles in order to gain substantial amounts of power. Those less fortunate, were unable to benefit from their domestic work. When the Mongol empire collapsed, poor women in society were unable to get any sort of proper health care or any opportunity for education and leisure.|$|E

The woolshed and jetty were built by Eyre Peninsula pastoral pioneer Price Maurice to <b>shear</b> <b>wool</b> from his pastoral leases and transport it to markets; the jetty, the latter of the two, dates from 1881.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} some physical and qualitative characteristics of Naeini sheep wool for using in textile industry, herds from 6 {{different regions of}} Isfahan province were chosen. Staple length from 3 different body parts (shoulder, side and britch) was measured prior to <b>shearing.</b> <b>Wool</b> samples were taken from a 100 cm 2 surface on the mid-side of the Animals. Then the samples were transferred to the Laboratory of Animal Sciences for evaluations of some quality characteristics and to the Fiber Physics Laboratory for measuring tenacity, breaking strength and elongation at break of fibers. The {{means and standard deviations}} of staple length were estimated (10. 8 ± 2. 36), (9. 71 ± 3. 14) and (10. 99 ± 2. 49) cm for shoulder, side and britch parts, respectively. The total average staple length of Naeini sheep (10. 5 cm) is suitable for using in textile industry. Wool fibers of Naeini sheep have desirable tenacity and breaking strength (1. 22 cN/dtex and 13. 76 centi-Newton) to resist against mechanical tensions of the spinning step. However, Naeini sheep wool fibers have an adequate, but not a desirable %elongation at break (28. 6 %). Based on the fiber diameter mean of Naeini sheep and its variation (28. 51 ± 4. 33 μm) the fleece grade of Naeini sheep was predicted 54 `s, which is an intermediate grade. However, by conducting breeding programs toward enhancing fleece grade, Naeini sheep wool will be simply applicable in textile industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine sheep growth performance, fleece weights and wool quality characteristics in the sweet and sourveld communal rangelands of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Data were obtained in 80 ewes aged two to three years, selected in four ecologically different communities. Two communities (Roxeni and Tyabane) were in a sweetveld area and the other two communities (Luzi I and Luzi II) were in a sourveld area. The ewes from Tyabane were nondescript, whereas ewes from Roxeni, Luzi I and Luzi II were crossbred between Merinos and non-descript sheep. Selected ewes were monitored for live weight, body condition scoring and fleece weight during <b>shearing.</b> <b>Wool</b> samples were collected from each ewe and were analysed for fibre diameter, comfort factor, clean yield, wool crimps, staple length, staple strength and the Position of break. Sheep from Roxeni were heavier (P < 0. 05) (39. 9 ± 1. 1 kg) than sheep from Tyabane (29. 8 ± 1. 1 kg). Sheep from Tyabane had the lightest (P < 0. 05) fleece weight (1. 0 ± 1. 1 kg) and sheep from Roxeni had the heaviest (3. 1 ± 1. 1 kg). There were no significant differences (P ≥ 0. 05) between body condition scores of sheep in Roxeni and the Luzi communities. The live weights of the two-year old ewes were similar (P ≥ 0. 05) to the three-year old ewes’ live weight. However, the three year old ewes had higher (P < 0. 05) body condition scores than the two year old ewes. Two year old ewes also had lower (P < 0. 05) fleece weight than the three years old ewes. Wool from Roxeni, Luzi I and Luzi II had lower fibre diameter (P < 0. 05) than wool from Tyabane. Roxeni sheep had the highest clean yield (P < 0. 05) of wool, followed by Luzi I and Luzi II; Tyabane had lowest clean yield percentage of wool. Wool from sheep grazing on sweetveld had a higher (P < 0. 05) clean yield percentage (74. 3 ± 0. 7 %) than those grazing on sourveld (71. 7 ± 0. 7 %). There were higher staple mid-breaks (69. 5 ± 5. 2) and lower base-breaks (30. 5 ± 5. 2) in sweetveld (P < 0. 05) than in sourveld, 7. 5 ± 5. 2 and 92. 5 ± 5. 2 for mid-breaks and lower base-breaks, respectively. It was concluded that sheep raised in the sweetveld and bred with purebred Merino rams had higher performance than the ones reared in the sourveld. The young upgraded ewes had a higher wool quality than the older ewes raised on communal rangelands...|$|E

The letter led to an investigation by Mongolian Prime Minister Khorloogiin Choibalsan and nationalist supporters as Choibalsan had recently fallen out with Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. The later Mongolian Prime Minister Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal did however support Tömör-Ochir during the investigation. In 1953 Tömör-Ochir earned his Master in Philosophy from Moscow State University. In his own country in 1957 he received the title of professor.|$|R
