When the votes were counted Red had an increase of 1% from the 2005 election, but it was not enough to secure Folkvord a seat in parliament. When all the votes were counted the party had gained 1.3% of the national vote, an increase of 0.1%.|$|E

No correlation was observed between <b>setting</b> <b>pressure</b> and leg loading rates. The shield loading profiles were consistent with a model of the roof consisting of two zones, a thin immediate roof loading the shields well below the typical setting force, and a main roof zone essentially supported by the coal and gob and loading shields through its convergence. This model was used to develop an equation for estimating loading rates at the site. The only variable of the equation is time and the equation consists of an exponential term to account for the immediate roof loading and a linear term to account for main roof loading. The equation gave good correlation with average loading rates, but the variation in loading from cycle to cycle was too great for the equation to give good predictions of individual cycle loading rates.

40|$|In {{mechanically}} ventilated {{adults with}} {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS), peak airway pressures (Paw(peak)) above 35 cm H(2) O may {{increase the risk of}} barotrauma or volutrauma. Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI), an adjunctive ventilatory technique, may facilitate a reduction in <b>set</b> inspiratory <b>pressure</b> in these patients, and thereby in the tidal volume (VT) and Paw(peak) used in their ventilation, without a consequent increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO(2)). The {{purpose of this study was}} to: (1) assess the limits of efficacy of continuous TGI at two levels of decreased mechanical ventilatory support; and (2) determine an appropriate time interval after initiation of TGI at which to evaluate response. We prospectively studied eight adults with ARDS and increased airway pressures (40. 2 +/- 2. 7 cm H(2) O) who were managed with pressure-control ventilation (PCV). After obtaining baseline ventilatory and hemodynamic measures, we initiated TGI at 10 L/min, adjusting ventilator positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain baseline VT, and decreased the <b>set</b> inspiratory <b>pressure</b> by 5 cm H(2) O. Data were obtained after 30 and 60 min. <b>Set</b> inspiratory <b>pressure</b> was then decreased by an additional 5 cm H(2) O (total: 10 cm H(2) O), and data were again obtained after 30 min. Baseline (zero TGI) measures were then again recorded. Thirty minutes after decreasing the <b>set</b> inspiratory <b>pressure</b> by 5 cm H(2) O with TGI at 10 L/min, there was a 15 % decrease in Paw(peak) and a 16 % decrease in VT as compared with their baseline values. However, Pa(CO(2)) remained constant (59 +/- 10 mm Hg versus 57 +/- 6 mm Hg) (p = NS). There was no change in Pa(O(2)) or in hemodynamic variables, and no differences between variables, at 30 min versus 60 min in seven subjects. The remaining subject did not tolerate the reduction in <b>set</b> inspiratory <b>pressure</b> for 60 min. Thirty minutes after the <b>set</b> inspiratory <b>pressure</b> was decreased by 10 cm H(2) O with TGI at 10 L/min, there was a 26 % decrease in Paw(peak) and a 26 % decrease in VT. However, Pa(CO(2)) increased by 19 % and Pa(O(2)) decreased by 13 %. Six subjects completed this phase of the protocol for 30 min, and one subject completed it for 60 min. TGI can be used to rapidly facilitate a 5 cm H(2) O reduction in <b>set</b> inspiratory <b>pressure</b> without an increase in Pa(CO(2)).

40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines study evaluates {{factors that}} {{influence}} longwall support and strata interaction. The longwall system is composed of an immediate and main roof structure and three supporting foundations: longwall panel, powered roof supports, and gob waste. The main roof forms a structure that is generally supported by all three foundations, while the immediate roof acts as a beam that cantilevers from the coal face to the powered support. In most cases, shield loading involves a complex interaction of both main roof and immediate roof behavior and {{is a combination of}} loads produced from convergence of the main roof and displacements of the immediate roof caused by deformations of the cantilevered roof beam. Since the shield stiffness remains constant for all leg pressures and main roof convergence is irresistible in terms of shield capacity, the shield must be able to control the behavior of the immediate roof or floor structure for shield loading to be sensitive to <b>setting</b> <b>pressures.</b> If the goal is to minimize total shield loading, any active setting force must be offset by reduced passive shield loading to justify the active setting loads.

5000|$|A {{relief valve}} or {{pressure}} relief valve (PRV) {{is a type of}} safety valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system; pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined <b>set</b> <b>pressure</b> to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the <b>set</b> <b>pressure</b> is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the [...] "path of least resistance" [...] as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid-gas mixture) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central, elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere. As the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising. Once it reaches the valve's reseating pressure, the valve will close. The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of <b>set</b> <b>pressure</b> and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats. The blowdown can vary from roughly 2-20%, and some valves have adjustable blowdowns.|$|E

5000|$|In {{high-pressure}} gas systems, it {{is recommended}} that the outlet of the relief valve is in the open air.

This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the openings area of the valve. If the valve is opened the pressure has to decrease enormously before the valve closes and also the outlet pressure of the valve can easily keep the valve open. Another consideration is that if other relief valves are connected to the outlet pipe system, they may open as the pressure in exhaust pipe system increases. This may cause undesired operation.|$|E

These are some questions still worthy of investigation that are addressed in this paper. The first major change in gateroad support was the use of cable bolts to replace conventional wood cribbing particularly in Western mines. Standing support changed very little until the mid- 1990 s, when Strata Products 1 introduced the Hercules and Propsetter supports in Eastern mines and Burrell Mining Products introduced the Can support in Western mines. Since then, there has been a dramatic increase in new roof support technologies for longwall gateroad support. Historically, standing support, including shield supports, have been designed based on a simplistic model requiring the support to have sufficient capacity to support the gravity loading of a perceived detached rock mass. This approach ignores the stiffness of the support and the resulting ground deformation that is known to be critical to roof stability. Recently, a new approach based on the ground reaction concept has been promoted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to account for the interaction of the support with the rock mass behavior in achieving ground stability. In addition to gateroad support design, this concept has ramifications for shield capacities, <b>setting</b> <b>pressures,</b> and recovery room support design that challenge current practices in these areas. Although longwall mining has matured into the safest and most productive underground mining method used today, traditional concepts of roof support design and practice should still be evaluated and challenged. Ultimately, advancements in the science of ground control are made by recognizing deficiencies in current theories and thinking outside the box...|$|R
