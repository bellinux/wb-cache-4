[...] Marx viewed labour as a chance for us to externalize facets of our personality. Marxists argue that specialization makes it very difficult for any worker to feel they may be contributing to the real needs of humanity. The repetitive nature of specialized tasks causes, they say, a feeling of disconnection between what a worker does all day, who they really are, and what they would ideally be able to contribute to society. Marx also argued that <b>specialised</b> <b>jobs</b> are insecure, since the worker is expendable as soon as costs rise and technology can replace more expensive human labour.|$|R

Since the knowledge-intensive and often <b>specialised</b> <b>jobs</b> these people qualify for are only available in a small number of larger metropolitan areas, they also tend to be more mobile (both within and across countries) than others and this makes it even more important to keep/make the urban area attractive for them. Human capital is a fundamental factor for every major urban agglomeration in modern-day society and economy. Urban amenities facilitate face-to-face contact both for pleasure and for productivity. Hence, the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the relationship between these amenities and the presence of highly-educated knowledge workers: do the amenities respond, through time, to the presence of knowledge workers or lack thereof, and to what extent? Increased insight in the relationship between amenities and knowledge workers can offer local policy makers better tools for planning strategies to attract more highly-educated people with high incomes to the urban area. We aim to do this analysis on a highly-detailed spatial scale-level (e. g. four-digit zip code areas or neighbourhoods) by linking lifestyle-data on level of education, income, et cetera about inhabitants (with a special focus on highly-educated knowledge workers) to detailed data about different types of urban and cultural amenities in the vicinity using distance-decay functions.

40|$|History of the {{construction}} industry has witnessed that delays in construction projects are a common occurrence. These delays make the contractual parties involved in a particular project to vulnerable conditions and adversarial relationships complaining of other party's faults as the causes for delays. Those delays are an indication of lack of professionalism, which leads to bad reputation and less work for local contractors as client's tend to select more and more foreign contractors for their work. Therefore, {{it has become a}} timely need to study the factors affecting delays in {{the construction}} industry and suggest possible solutions in order to minimise these delays. The objectives of the research covered three main areas, namely identification of factors affecting delays in building construction industry during the construction stage, study the importance of the identified delay factors and delay groups, and make recommendations in order to minimise delays in the building construction industry during construction. Research methodology consists of (a) a detailed literature survey, (b) collection of data based on a structured survey, and (c) data analysis and development of recommendations so as to minimize delays. Similar research undertaken in Sri Lanka was found to be very limited. However, the limited research compiled in Sri Lanka and research conducted in {{the other part of the}} world, were quite helpful in developing the investigation programme and to get a broader knowledge in the research area. A well structured questionnaire was prepared using the information gathered from the literature survey. It was further refined based on the pilot survey, which was undertaken on 5 building sites and the views obtained from the experts involved in the building construction industry. Subsequently, data collection was carried out by an interview survey comprising 30 case studies in the Sri Lankan building construction industry. Totally, 60 completed questionnaires were collected from sites by interviewing the contractor and either the consultant or the client. Engineers, architects and quantity surveyors who were attached to sites were interviewed for collection of data. A commonly used statistical technique of Importance Index method was used for the analysis of data in this research. The delay factors were then ranked using these importance index values. In addition to ranking of delay factors, importance index values were further used to analyse the delay factors with respect to their relationship with delay causes such as client's status, contract sum etc. Based on these findings, recommendations were determined to minimise delays in the Sri Lankan building construction industry during the construction period. Both the consultant and the contractor have selected "Rainy weather" as the most important delay factor with the important index values of 78. 86 and 68. 9 respectively. Contractors have selected "changes by the owner and the consultant" as the second most important delay factor while consultants selected the "manpower shortage" as the second most important delay factor. Both the contractor and the consultant have collectively ranked "rainy weather", "manpower skills" and "material shortage" as the top ranking causes for construction delays. This indicates the need for proper planning of all types of resources and improve the skills of the different labour trades required for the construction industry. Among the several types of delay groups, manpower, financing and changes have been ranked as top order delay groups. Environment and resources especially materials and equipment were also identified as important delay groups. Application of proper planning methods from pre-construction stage onwards, allocation of adequate funds for the project, identification of the needs and introduction of vocational training facilities for <b>specialised</b> <b>jobs,</b> review and evaluation of project alternatives in the pre-construction stage, frequent site meetings and joint site inspections are among the recommendations suggested to minimise construction delays. 1...|$|R

40|$|Immigration solicitors {{working within}} the field of asylum law are {{required}} to deal directly with asylum applicants in their everyday work. They are, therefore, expected to perform emotional labour as part of their job. This small empirical study focuses on pre-substantive meetings of solicitors with clients, analysing the form and extent of the emotional labour produced, its origins, and the potential negative and positive consequences resulting from that performance. Following a brief overview of emotional labour, the research methods will be outlined. The findings, which result from the analysis of interviews, show that this is a highly <b>specialised</b> <b>job</b> involving the performance of diverging emotional displays. Intense emotional displays of empathy are expected to gain the trust of clients. However, these emotions have to be managed to maintain the perceived professional integrity of the solicitor. This is achieved by concentrating on the legal aspects of the case to present a form of ‘detached concern’. This enables the task to be completed efficiently, as well as fulfilling the emotional demands of the job. However, balancing these different emotional displays can be hard work, and can lead to less experienced solicitors admitting reliance on surface acting to present expected emotional displays. This often results in emotional dissonance producing negative consequences such as decreased task efficiency, stress and depression. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings and proposals for future research. The importance of performing emotional labour is highlighted. Focus is also placed on the professional socialisation of immigration solicitors, and specifically the training undertaken. It is suggested that more explicit training in emotion management skills might ameliorate the potentially negative consequences of performing emotional labour. Following this will be a brief discussion of future research to be undertaken...|$|E

40|$|Large {{metropolitan}} regions with pollution, congestion and high rents remain the supernatural economic places. The mystery of what exactly raises productivity {{in large cities}} continues. Going back to the famous pin factory of Adam Smith, the answer might be that city workers are able to specialise more and that this extensive division of labour increases productivity. Duranton and Jayet (2011) indeed find that the division of occupations {{is limited by the}} extent of the market. But what happens within occupations? This research documents and interprets the division of job tasks of workers across German cities. We question to what extent city size limits the division of tasks in Germany. Furthermore, we analyse whether the division of labour explains (part) of the urban wage premium. To guide our empirical analyses, we first set up a simple model of the local division of labour. Each occupation consists of a bundle of job tasks. Workers who specialise in a few job tasks are more productive. Specialisation is however bounded by both coordination costs as in Becker and Murphy (1992) and by local demand as in Baumgardner (1988). Density lowers coordination costs. Thus, workers in large cities with low coordination costs and high local demand specialise more than workers in small cities. Second, we document the division of labour across German cities using the BIBB/IAB Surveys of the Working Population of 2006. The database includes information on the performance of 38 job tasks. Workers in large cities tend to achieve less job tasks than workers in small cities. Workers in the central area of the city are more <b>specialised</b> in certain <b>job</b> tasks than workers in the peripheral area of the same city. Controlling for education, occupation and industry does not affect these stylized facts. A high educated worker in the central area of one of the largest German cities (more than half a million inhabitants) performs 3 out of 38 job tasks less than a low educated worker in the same occupation in a rural German town (less than 5000 inhabitants). Third, urban wage premia in Germany are (partly) explained with the level of specialisation of workers. Wage regressions indicate that workers in the largest German cities earn, ceteris paribus, 16 % of a standard deviation more wage than workers in German villages. The inclusion of the specialisation level of a worker and an interaction of specialisation and city size lowers the urban wage premium to 12 % of a standard deviation...|$|R

Opskrbljivao ga je akvedukt kapaciteta 1500 1 /sec. = 129. 600 m 3 na dan. Problem obilnog ispiranja riješen je odgovarajucim kanalizacijskim sistemom koji je postojao samo duž ulica sjevernog dijela Palače u kojem su se nalazili pogoni carskih tkaonica. Tehnologija je (uz sustav bazena arheološki uočenih u prizemlju Papalićeve palače) ukljucivala sumporavanje, za što su bili na raspolaganju brojni izvori sumporne vode uz samu Palaču. Čitava građevina savršeno se uklapa u dugački niz tetrarhijskih javnih radova. Bila bi to izvorna, osnovna funkcija građevine u koju se Dioklecijan povukao nakon što je 305. g. bio prisiljen na abdikaciju. In {{scholarly}} literature, {{the term}} "city" was first mentioned by Lj. Karaman, talking of {{the beginnings of}} medieval Split in Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s Palace, and then by Andre Grabar in his Martyrium (I: 232 - 233). 2 Noel Duval, {{in a series of}} studies he wrote, asks whether Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s residence should be classified as palatium, villa, castrum, urban settlement or some special type of architecture, considering that in comparison with genuine imperial palaces like those in Constantinople, Antioch, Philippopolis and Ravenna, it was wanting a number of "attributes": proposed the term "chateau". 3 - 5 The term was thoroughly investigated by Slobodan Čurčić, discussing late antique palatine architecture, showing convincingly that the urban character of these residences was undoubted (of Antioch, Nicomedia, Salona, Constantinople, Split) - although the miniature municipal quarters in them had an only slightly more than symbolic significance. 6 Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s building in Split really does not have the external look of a Roman imperial villa. In Split, in particular with respect to the two architectural masses {{in the northern part of}} the building, we note, its innate anti-landscape character, both the internal and the external disposition of the architectural elements, which is almost inorganically formalised. Not even in the narrow residential area, within which the halls are interconnected only via the "cryptoportico" having no direct contacts with the surrounding landscape, we do not find any of the characteristics that in the nature of things we would expect in a residence in which, it was always considered, the emperor intended to while away his final years. The Split edifice is really primarily an example of fortification. But here too we can be surprised. The sentry patrol corridor should be on the top of the walls and should be protected with a parapet, while here it is on the first floor, perforated with hardly defensible apertures (3 x 2 m). The building was clearly primarily motivated by the desire to impress the surroundings, with its emphatic delineation of military presence and power. The Golden and Silver Gates and the great apertures of the sentry corridor on the three sides of the walls onto the mainland must have been walled up before the Byzantine-Gothic wars of the 530 s. 7 But it would seem that we can understand its form - so very particular that it evades the usual, in some sense fossilized, terminology – only through some new reading of the original meaning and purpose of the building itself. In author 2 ̆ 7 s opinion, this is proffered by a very simple question. The aqueduct that brought water into the palace from the source of the river Jadro was, in the design and execution of the imperial architects, undoubtedly related to the construction of his final dwelling place. Although it is a rare specimen of a Roman monument of this kind that is still being used today (reconstructed in 1878), in the literature and in research it has been almost entirely neglected, and has certainly never been interpreted in the original context. The aqueduct provided 1500 l/ sec. (129. 600 m 3 a day), which in terms of our standards would be enough for a population of 173, 000. 8, 9 The sheer amount of water inevitably leads to the question of what it was meant for, because it far exceeded the needs of the relatively modest bath complexes in the Palace. The answer might be hidden in an almost neglected item of information from Notitia Dignitatum OC XI 48 (ed. 0. Seeck, 150) where there is a mention of the Procurator genaecii Iovensis Dalmatiae - Aspalato- warden of the imperial weaving shop for the production of woollen clothing for the army that worked in Split, under the title of Jupiter. So far it has always been thought, on the rare occasions when this fact has been mentioned at all (and then only by-the-bye) that this gynaeceum was only after Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s death "inscribed" into the Palace, which was for the whole of the 5 th century a kind of pensiopolis of dethroned emperors or pretenders to the throne. It has been considered that the northern part of the Palace was reserved for the Imperial Guard, for stables and the like. 10, 11 Notitia Dignitatum, a long list of all the senior offices in the Empire, civilian and military, is certainly of a composite character. The basic text was created probably in about 408 (in partibus Occidentis changes were recorded up to 420), but it conceals a lot of information about the periods before the revision of the basic copy, mirroring the order that Diocletian had brought into the state, which certainly relates to the Split gynaeceum, which alone of the 14 such complexes located in the most important cities of the empire bears the characteristic predicate Iovense: it must in itself constitute a terminus post quem non to do with the origin of the factory of military uniforms of wool in the building in Split. 12, 13, 15 Although the gynaecea were never mentioned in the context of Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s reforms, it is generally accepted that they were created at the time of the first Tetrarchy. The concentration of the labour force, the range of <b>specialised</b> <b>jobs,</b> the degree of organisation and their connection with urban centres makes them, in the judgement of historians, the closest to the modern industrial factory. State factories (fabricae) were set up in the late Empire to eliminate or at least to alleviate the difficulties concerning the supply of the state and the army with certain products. It was necessary to clothe the approximately half a million soldiers that Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s army reforms had raised, as well as no small number of clerks. Archaeology, however, has never made any direct contribution to the understanding of their internal organisation, except in the case of the otherwise well documented gynaeceum in Carthage, which lay in the heart of the city, on the edge of the celebrated Circular Harbour. 16, 17 The state operated, through the comes sacrarum largitionum, a number of weaving mills, both for woolen and linen fabrics, and dyeworks 18 The Split gynaeceum should have probably been in some kind of complementary relationship with the gynaeceum moved to Salona, perhaps for security reasons, from Bassiana (Donji Petrovci, Pannonia Inferior) also noted by Notitia Dignitatum, XI, 46 (Procurator gynaecii Bassanensis Pannoniae Secundae translati Salonis). In Salona, thus, there was a large cloth dyeworks (In Not. dign. the Procurator bafii Salonitani Dalmatiae was also mentioned) and weaving mill. At Five Bridges in Salona artisan workshops were actually found, probably a dyer 2 ̆ 7 s workshop, and fulling mills for cloth and the dyeing of cloth. Also to be seen is the reservoir from which the water to drive the mills ran, and a building for the habitation of the workers. 19 In one inscription in Salona, a magister conquilarius is mentioned (CIL III 2115 + 8572), clearly the head of the state workshops in which purple was extracted from shellfish, perhaps for the gynaeceum in Aspalathos. 22 Another inscription found in Salona mentions a certain Hilarus, who was the purpurarius, dyer of red garments or, perhaps, negotiator artis purpurae. 23 That the Salona baffeum and the Split gynaeceum were mentioned only in the Notitia Dignitatum, says that their production was a strictly channelled state monopoly, and that the products from them did not make their way to the general market as other goods did. The army was supplied directly, without the agency of merchants. Although not all the technological details of the gynaeceum, the fullonica and the baffeum have been revealed, we can conjure up in the northern half of the Palace an image of the whole system of pools in which the fabrics were washed, softened and finished by being trampled on with bare feet in a solution of potash, fuller 2 ̆ 7 s earth, human and animal urine. Here then there was a very large demand for water. 28 Garments were rubbed with chalk, and fumigated with sulphur. It is particularly important to remember that the technology included, among other things, sulphur treatment (sulfure sulfire), for which there were the many springs of sulphurous water alongside the Palace itself, which were used for the washing and bleaching of cloth right up to the first half of the 20 th century, by St Francis church on the Shore. 29 The problem of copious rinsing was solved by the extraordinarily handled sewage system that existed only along the the cardo and decumanus and the perimeter streets of the northern part of the Palace, in which the mentioned plant was located. Among other things, the extreme western part of the sewer under the decumanus, at the exit from the Palace, has been explored. It passed under the western gate (Porta ferrea), and moved in a gentle arc towards the south-west, finishing some forty metres further in a stone portal (below the kitchen of today 2 ̆ 7 s Hotel Central). Thence in an open channel all this water flowed into the bay of the sea, in the immediate vicinity of the|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2005. Companies seeking {{competitive}} {{advantage in the}} highly competitive fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry can no longer differentiate themselves from competitors on products and pricing alone. Customer service and the perceived value that customers gain from suppliers is key in staying ahead. The FMCG industry in South Africa (SA) does not place much emphasis on evaluating customer service. This study is {{an evaluation of the}} outbound logistics customer service of Unilever Home and Personal Care (UHPC), a multinational FMCG company in SA. The study focuses on attributes of customer service that major retail customers with distribution centres {DC's) consider important and evaluates logistics customer service against key competitors. A survey of three major retail customers' of UHPC was conducted in the major regions of SA. Thirty self-administered questionnaires were sent out to staff at Shoprite, Clicks and Spar DC's across SA. Staff targeted were those associated with inbound logistics and included people as senior as DC Managers to Receiving Controllers. As these are <b>specialised</b> <b>job</b> functions, the sample size comprised of only 30 respondents. A total of 24 responses were analysed to determine the attributes of customer service which UHPC customers consider important and also to determine the perceived performance of UHPC against other competitors. The results revealed that DC customer consider order accuracy, timeliness of delivery, order quality, product availability, order fulfilment, personnel contact, cooperation of supplier, alerts on transportation delays, relationship with supplier and service level agreements to be the ten most important attributes of logistics customer service. The different customer groups did not rank the attributes in the same way. Shoprite and Clicks perceive UHPC's logistics customer service to perform from good to excellent on all 32 attributes whilst Spar felt that UHPC under-performed on 8 attributes. UHPC was highly rated amongst key competitors in the local FMCG industry and outperformed competitors on 28 attributes of logistics customer service. The following areas of improvement were identified for UHPC: order discrepancy handling after delivery, quality/durability of packaging, personal contact knowledge and ability and helpfulness in solving problems and supplier innovation in improving delivery. Recommendations for improvement in UHPC's logistics customer service were made based on the results and the literature review which included repeating the survey at least quarterly on attributes needing improvement so as not having to wait for at least 3 years for another competitor benchmarking survey...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MA (Industrial Psychology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. The {{survival}} of an organisation {{in a global}} competitive business environment depends on its survival skills (e. g. adaptability, flexibility and innovativeness), which is situated within its human resources. Hence, the recruitment function’s role is critical, since it {{is responsible for the}} procurement of key intellectual capital that could equip the organisation with a competitive advantage. However, against the accelerated growth of the Internet combined with global competition, traditional recruitment methods are increasingly failing to rise to the challenge of securing key intellectual capital, due to being too time consuming and expensive. Consequently, organisations are progressively turning to online recruitment (which does not refer to one specific technique, but rather several different Internet tools that can be employed as a recruitment method, such as organisational websites, <b>specialised</b> <b>job</b> sites, media websites or newsgroups). However, the presence of an organisational website that advertises vacancies is not sufficient to guarantee its success as a recruitment method. Hence, it is vital to gain an understanding of website recruitment, as well as how to maximise the website’s effectiveness and ability to facilitate successful online applicant behaviour (SOAB), in order to harness its full potential as a recruitment method, able to secure key intellectual capital. For the purpose of this study, SOAB refers to potential applicants (i. e. job seekers entering an organisational website in search of employment opportunities) being able to browse the website without any difficulty and obtain relevant and sufficient information concerning the organisation and its listed vacancies. In addition to enabling potential applicants to assess whether he/she will be able to fit, perform and accelerate in the work climate and culture of the organisation (i. e. decide whether he/she would like to work for the organisation), a website that facilitates SOAB, should also enable potential applicants to contact the organisation to address additional information needs. In essence, this study comprises of three phases and centres on the identification of website content- and usability design benchmarks that should contribute to a website’s ability to facilitate SOAB. By means of a comprehensive literature review, it is argued that the content- and usability design are vital contributing factors to a website’s ability to facilitate SOAB. It is also proposed that the effectiveness of the website as a recruitment method is, to a certain degree, linked to the effectiveness of the alignment of an organisation’s online recruitment strategy with the five stages of potential applicants’ job decision-making process (i. e. the recognition of an employment need, search for career related information, evaluation of career alternatives, identification and acceptance of employment and post-choice evaluation). Phase one, entails the identification of website content- and usability design benchmarks and culminates with the development of the Website Benchmarks Checklist. Phase two, which constitutes the overall purpose of this study, entails an audit of the sample of the ‘best’ SA employers’ (drawn from a survey conducted by the Corporate Research Foundation, 2005) websites. The primary aim is {{to determine the extent to}} which the sample’s website design incorporates the identified benchmarks. However, the quality of potential applicants’ interaction with a website (i. e. informative content being communicated in an effective, efficient and satisfactory manner), greatly influences their perception of the organisation’s image, its attractiveness as an employer, as well as their intention to pursue employment within the organisation. Hence, the third phase of the study entails the subjective evaluation of three websites (selected from the audited sample), by a sample of potential applicants. Throughout the study, the empirical tests conducted were descriptive in nature and utilised survey research methods to acquire the required data, related to the specified goals and objectives that encapsulate the aim and purpose of this study. The results obtained provided valuable insight into website design benchmarks that should assist potential applicants in their job decision-making process, increase a website’s ability to facilitate SOAB and maximise its effectiveness as a recruitment method responsible for securing key intellectual capital. In addition to revealing that the majority of the sample employs its website as a recruitment method, the audit results also indicated that although a high level of adherence existed concerning the sample’s incorporation of the usability design benchmarks. However, a notable difference that ranged from very little to relatively high existed with regards to the extent to which the sample’s website design adhered to the content design benchmarks. The subjective evaluation of the three websites by potential applicants revealed that in addition to being critical contributors to the quality of their interaction with a website, the content- and usability design also had a profound impact on their assessment of the websites. Finally, the results also showed that a similarity existed between potential applicants’ subjective evaluation and the extent to which the design of the three websites adhered to the recommended benchmarks (audit results) ...|$|E
