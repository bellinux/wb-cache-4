The process can be divided into two parts. Firstly, a diagnosis method for <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> vibration based on field experiments and a finite element method (FEM) is presented. It is found that the resonance between the Kármán vortex and the <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> is the main cause for the undesired vibration. Then, we focus on establishing an intelligent optimization model of the stay vane’s trailing edge profile. To this end, an approach combining factorial experiments, extreme learning machine (ELM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is implemented. Three kinds of improved profiles of the <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> are proposed and compared. Finally, the profile with a Donaldson trailing edge is adopted as the best solution for the <b>stay</b> <b>vane,</b> and verifications such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, structural analysis and fatigue analysis are performed to validate the optimized geometry...|$|E

In the first report, the flow characteristics in a fixed channel from a spiral casing to guide vane channels are determined theoretically and experimentally using the configurations of a decelerated flow type of spiral casing. The results show that the flow pattern in a spiral casing is a free vortex rV_θ = C, in which only the value of C changes according to each sectional aerea, and that the flow characteristics in a fixed channel are well predicted by a two-dimensional theory if a suitable flow model is introduced. They also show that the flow characteristics at the middle of a guide vane channel become almost axisymmetric in spite of strong non-axisymmetrisity of the inlet flow into the <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> channel, while the total pressure decreases largely in the range π/ 2 ≤ θ ≤ 3 / 2 due to a mixing loss of the distorted flow and a shock loss at the <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> inlet...|$|E

To increase the hydraulic efficiency, a pump casing and stay ring with no <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> is designed. Through CFD simulation and test, hydraulic efficiency of water turbine with that spiral casing and stay ring is improved to 5 %, hydraulic loss of casing and stay ring reduces from 13. 7 % to 3. 41 %, hydraulic loss of runner increases from 7. 93 % to 11. 57 %, and simulation result coincides with test.

40|$|In Francis turbine, a small {{clearance}} {{gap between the}} guide vanes and the cover plates is usually required to pivot guide vanes {{as a part of}} governing system. Deflection of cover plates and erosion of mating surfaces causes this gap to increase from its design value. The clearance gap induces the secondary flow in the distributor system. This effects the main flow at the runner inlet, which causes losses in efficiency and instability. A guide vane cascade of a low specific speed Francis turbine has been developed for experimental investigations. The test setup is able to produce similar velocity distributions at the runner inlet as that of a reference prototype turbine. The setup is designed for particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements from the position of <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> outlet to the position of runner inlet. In this study, velocity and pressure measurements are conducted with 2 mm clearance gap on one side of guide vane. Leakage flow is observed and measured together with pressure measurements. It is concluded that the leakage flow behaves as a jet and mixes with the main flow in cross-wise direction and forms a vortex filament.

40|$|This Master Thesis {{is about}} the sand erosion {{challenges}} with the Francis turbines. The background for studying this subject {{is the fact that}} the sand erosion problem is a very negative factor for the development of new hydro electric power plants in many developing countries. The target with this Master Thesis has been to develop a new design, a revised version of the Francis turbine, reducing the sand erosion by 30 - 50 per cent compared with today´s version of turbines. The present version of Francis turbines is consisting of three different <b>vane</b> cascades, The <b>stay,</b> guide and runner cascade. The sand erosion is in proportion with the relative speed between the sand particles and the steel cubed. This challenge has thus been analyzed and solved by reducing this speed through the turbine. Regarding the <b>stay</b> <b>vanes,</b> a new design has been proposed where the <b>stay</b> <b>vanes</b> are pressing the spiral casing from outside and not from the inside. This will result in the fact that the whole sand erosion problem has been removed. It has been proposed to remove the the guide vane cascade. This will consequently remove the sand erosion problem here as well. A favourable solution is to increase the reaction degree. For the runner a study of four different parameters has been carried out. These parameters were the number of pole pair in the generator, outlet angle, reaction degree and UCu distribution. The analysis shows that a reduction of sand erosion at the runner outlet was possible by selecting a higher number of pole pair along with a higher outlet angle than what is standard practice today. This result is of high significant importance since the sand erosion is biggest at the runner outlet. A change in the reaction degree may enable the erosion at the inlet of the runner, whereas a change in the UcU will change the erosion between the inlet and outlet. By selecting favourable parameter values, a substantial reduction of sand erosion in a Francis turbine will be possible. The turbines in this Master thesis have been designed in the computer program Matlab. A proposal for new design based upon the results of the parameter study has been analyzed in a CDF analysis. This analysis has been made in Ansys CFX. </p...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is the modeling, simulation and characterization of a complex threedimensional unsteady flow inside a Francis turbine draft tube for two specific off-design conditions: A) Part load (0. 88 Q), frequently characterized by the occurrence of an unsteady rotating vortex rope linked to strong pressure fluctuations and, B) High load (1. 21 Q), where softer pressure surges taking place because the cavity volume at this condition has an axisymmetric shape.

The computational domain consists of the draft tube alone.

40|$|Both {{previous}} {{experiments and}} CFD simulations show that bends {{have a significant}} influence on the downstream flow field, especially by causing so-called ?skewed velocity profiles?. Based on the simulations carried out in OpenFOAM during this thesis, the axial velocity profiles downstream of bends of a few selected geometries have been plotted and {{described in more detail}} than what the author has managed to find in previous work. The findings were divided into characteristics of velocity profiles in ?Plane AA? and ?Plane BB?, which are defined in Figure 2. 1, while the bend simulations were carried out on four different bend geometries of two different angles and two different relative radiuses, which are listed in Table 4. 1. In general, it was found that a sharper bend angle and a smaller relative radius lead to more skewness in the velocity profiles. Bends with small relative radiuses also tend to have sharper convective velocity gradients, i. e. sharper change in velocity over change in position, especially shortly after the outlet of the bend. In the case of the 45 degree bend (relatively small bend angle), the influence of using various relative radiuses (e. g. R/r= 2 vs. R/r= 8) seemed to make less impact on the velocity field skewness than that of the 90 degree bend. A number of simulations were carried out on a mesh of the NTNU Tokke spiral casing model, using ANSYS for meshing and CFX for simulation and post-processing. Radial velocity profiles at the outlet of the stay vanes were plotted against the angular position at the outlet. As expected due to the effect of the 14 stay vanes on the velocity distribution, the velocity field appeared divided into 14 velocity profile ?peaks?(see Figure 5. 4. 3. 2 a and b), each corresponding to one of the 14 <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> channels that the water passes through on its way towards the guide vanes, and eventually into the runner. Based on the plots of the radial velocity components, it appears that the general shape of each velocity profile looks like a single, skewed and ?fang-shaped? peak. The fang-shape of each profile iscaused by a skewness leaning towards the inner curveof the channel curvature, where the gradient of the radial velocity over angular location (&# 120597;&# 119906;/&# 120597;&# 120579;) is larger at the inner part of the channel than at the outer part. This phenomenon is very similar to the skewed velocity profile in Plane AA that occurs shortly after a flow field enters the inlet of a bend, before it switches and starts skewing towards the side corresponding to the outer curve of the bend curvature. Although the spiral casing and <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> design of the Tokke spiral casing model successfully achieves similar radial velocity profile shapes from each channel, the magnitude of the velocities, and thus the volumetric flow, going through each channel, varies more than what should be optimal. E. g., the peak velocities going through the first and the last channel. which are the channels with the lowest and highest peak velocity, respectively, have an absolute velocity difference of about 25 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a reduced scale {{model of a}} {{low-pressure}} stage of a two-stage pump turbine was investigated when it operates in pump mode, which is as a centrifugal pump with vaned diffuser. An instability region was found in its Q-H curve. This instability region, centered into the flow rate interval between 0. 45 to 0. 7 QDes, restricts the stable operating range of the test pump. The object {{of this study was}} to analyze the origins and development of the unsteadiness inner pump during this saddle instability region, and to find the causes of this saddle, which could guide the design, and optimization of the test pump. Experimental and numerical approaches have been adopted to contribute the understanding on the highly complex flow interactions inside the test pump. The analyses pointed out that the instability of Q-H curve during this flow rate interval was mainly affected by the flow field unsteadiness into the diffuser. Severe flow separation occurred into the diffuser, affecting and/or affected by the unsteadiness from the impeller and return channel remarkably. Both at full and part load, due to the U shape stay vanes in the return system, a 3 -dimentional complex flow was found on the suction side of <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> near the U turn corner. This flow caused a periodic unforced pressure disturbance with frequency St= 0. 6625 in the diffuser. A rotating stall with 5 cells into the diffuser was also highlighted by the experimental analyses and the numerical results validated that this disturbance was mainly due to the unsteady flow patterns in the return channel. With the reduction of flow rate, the location of this unsteadiness in return channel move closer to the outlet of diffuser, and the unsteadiness made the flow separation near the <b>stay</b> <b>vane</b> leading edge on the suction side more severe and it impacted the flow in diffuser flow field in a more severe way. At the same time, two types of unsteadiness were detected in the impeller in the saddle instability region. They were the flow separation with the frequency St= 0. 6625 at the impeller blade suction side and the wake-jet near the trailing edge of impeller blade with the frequency St= 0. 335, respectively. The wake-jet caused a periodic disturbance with a frequency of St= 0. 335 in diffuser as well. The experimental results indicated that it propagate circumferentially with 2 cells. At the beginning of this saddle instability, in diffuser, the intensity of the fluctuations at St= 0. 335 and St= 0. 6625 both increase with the falling flow rate. With the development of these unsteady patterns, they mixed and caused a blockage in the gap between impeller and diffuser. This blockage caused the increase of the amplitude at BPF, which has been detected both by experimental and numerical results. At the same time, the further development of the blockage weakened the intensity of the two disturbances with frequency of St= 0. 335 and St= 0. 6625 in the blockage region. The blockage fully developed near the critical flow rate of 0. 6 QDes. At this condition, the intensity of rotor and stator interaction increased and energy loss also increased which caused the drop of head and mean pressure at the exit of impeller. Furthermore, the disturbance in diffuser which caused by wake-jet of impeller lost the periodic character with frequency of St= 0. 335 at this condition. This is the reason why the non-linear component St= 0. 335 disappeared in diffuser around 0. 6 QDes...|$|E

The {{primary goal of}} the engineering study described here {{was to provide a}} commercially competitive turbine design that would yield fish passage survival rates comparable to or better than the survival rates of bypassing or spilling flow. Although the turbine design was performed for site conditions corresponding to 92 ft (28 m) net head and a discharge of 1500 cfs (42. 5 cms), the design can be modified for additional sites with differing operating conditions. During the turbine development, design modifications were identified for the spiral case, distributor (<b>stay</b> <b>vanes</b> and wicket gates), runner, and draft tube to improve turbine performance while maintaining features for high fish passage survival. Computational results for pressure change rates and shear within the runner passage were similar in the original and final turbine geometries, while predicted minimum pressures were higher for the final turbine. The final turbine geometry and resulting flow environments are expected to further enhance the fish passage characteristics of the turbine. Computational results for the final design were shown to improve turbine efficiencies by over 6 % at the selected operating condition when compared to the original concept. Prior to the release of the hydraulic components for model fabrication, finite element analysis calculations were conducted for the <b>stay</b> <b>vanes,</b> wicket gates, and runner to verify that structural design criteria for stress and deflections were met. A physical model of the turbine was manufactured and tested with data collected for power and efficiency, cavitation limits, runaway speed, axial and radial thrust, pressure pulsations, and wicket gate torque. All parameters were observed to fall within ranges expected for conventional radial flow machines. Based on these measurements, the expected efficiency peak for prototype application is 93. 64 %. These data were used in the final sizing of the supporting mechanical and balance of plant equipment. The preliminary equipment cost for the design specification is $ 1450 /kW with a total supply schedule of 28 months. This equipment supply includes turbine, generator, unit controls, limited balance of plant equipment, field installation, and commissioning. Based on the selected head and flow design conditions, fish passage survival through the final turbine is estimated to be approximately 98 % for 7. 9 -inch (200 -mm) fish, and the predicted survival reaches 100 % for fish 3. 9 inches (100 mm) and less in length. Note that fish up to 7. 9 - inches (200 mm) in length make up more than 90 % of fish entrained at hydro projects in the United States.

Favorable government support has in many countries lead to a dramatic increase of wind power development. This has in turn raised demand for hydro pumped storage plants to guarantee the stability of the power grids. To allow for increased reliability and operating range, manufacturers focus on learning more about the dynamic behavior of pump turbines. The Hydrodyna research project is a collaboration project between turbine manufacturers and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland, which aims to improve the understanding of high head pump turbine dynamics. It is not unusual that modern pump turbines operate at heads around 500 - 700 m. For such high heads, rotor stator interaction is known to be of greater significance due to higher water velocities and thicker geometries in <b>stay</b> and guide <b>vanes.</b> The Hydrodyna research project aims to break through a technology gap in the understanding of pressure fluctuations due to rotor stator interaction. This work describes the results from simulations of the turbine operating at full load and its comparison to laboratory measurements. The commercial software Ansys CFX 5 has been used to perform transient simulations with second order backward Euler transient scheme and the k-epsilon turbulence model on structured, high density meshes. The simulations have been run on a twelve CPU cluster with 0. 2 degree runner rotation in each time step. The dynamic behavior of rotor stator interaction is visualized and examined at key frequencies on the pressure and suction side of a runner blade.

Limiting acceptable values for the flow induced mechanisms concerning pressure and shear have been established and were used in designing the Alden turbine. To determine how well these criteria have been met {{in various parts of}} the turbine, computational fluid dynamics (CFD was used to predict the locations and volumes which meet or exceed these limiting values. To gain confidence in the predictions, verification of the CFD simulations was performed by comparing the efficiency hill chart derived from CFD simulations with that resulting from physical scale model tests of the Alden turbine. Efficiency is an indicator of flow conditions in the runner. Thereafter, the CFD simulations were used to predict flow parameters related to the allowed limits for shear, pressure change rates, and minimum absolute pressures. In addition, EPRI has been supporting studies to assess hydro-turbine leading edge blade design parameters that affect fish mortality. Initial testing was conducted with three fish species and several blade thicknesses, strike velocities, and fish lengths. The primary focus of these initial studies was to determine how the ratio of fish length to blade thickness (L/t ratio) influenced strike mortality and to provide data that could be used to improve the fish-friendliness of hydro turbines. However, comparing predicted fish survival to the measured survival of the pilot-scale Alden turbine revealed that the mortality predicted from the blade strike data was higher by about 40 % on average. One factor that could account for this difference is that fish were oriented perpendicular to the blade in the strike tests, whereas they were likely oriented about 45 degrees to the blade when passing through the Alden turbine. Therefore, additional tests were conducted to examine the effects fish orientation so that more reliable predictions can be made for a wide range of turbine designs. We will present the results of these tests and discus the effect of strike speed and leading edge blade thickness on strike mortality. These parameters are factored into theoretical models for predicting turbine passage survival and the design of fish-friendlier turbines...|$|R
40|$|The Hölleforsen {{hydropower}} plant is {{situated on the}} river Indalsälven in Sweden and consists of three Kaplan turbines units with a total installed capacity of 50 MW at the operational head of 27 m. The main task of the current research work is to simulate the flow through the penstock, spiral casing and distributor (guide <b>vanes</b> and <b>stay</b> <b>vanes)</b> of the Hölleforsen model, well known as the Turbine- 99 test case. Numerical simulations are performed on the model with 1 : 11 scale of the prototype turbine, a runner diameter of 500 mm, a runner speed of 595 rpm and a volume flow rate of 0. 522 m 3 /s {{at the head of}} 4. 5 m. Flow in the penstock and spiral casings are very complex with several flow phenomena appearing simultaneously: such as separation, turbulence and unsteadiness. This is due to the viscosity, boundary conditions and complexity in the geometry. To gain some information on the flow characteristics, numerical simulation of the complex three-dimensional turbulent viscous flow through the penstock, spiral casing and distributor of the turbine is performed. Conservation mass and momentum equations of the flow are analysed using finite volume method with the software ANSYS CFX 10. 0. The objectives are to study the effects of the inlet boundary conditions and also to achieve the boundary conditions for subsequent simulations including the runner and ultimately the entire system. The flow in {{hydropower plant}} is turbulent and highly unsteady. Therefore analysing the effect of the upstream geometry and different turbulence model are of great interest to analyse how the boundary conditions affect the runner and draft tube flow. Two types of turbulence models, standard k- ε and SST k-ω Based turbulence model are applied to study the flow characteristics. Comparisons are made between the numerical simulations with and without the penstock and the available experimental results in the spiral casing. The numerical results are found to have better agreement with the experimental results when the penstock is included in the simulation, as expected. Therefore, detailed inlet boundary conditions are necessary to simulate accurately the spiral casing flows if the penstock is not included in the simulation. On top of that the numerical simulation seems to show little sensitivity to the turbulence model. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} focuses on flow properties of the elbow draft tube. This element has a major function in low head turbines, since {{up to half of}} the losses may arise there at part load. The use of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) to redisign a draft tube necessitates detailed knowledged of the boundary conditions. They are generally not available and qualified guesses must be made. This applies in particular to the radial velocity at the inlet. A method to estimate this component in swirling flow from experimental values of the axial and tangential velocities is derived. The method uses a two dimensional non- viscous description of the flow, the Squire-Long formulation. It is tested against swirling flow in a diffuser and applied to the Turbine- 99 draft tube flow. As several other boundary conditions are difficult to estimate and many input parameters are available to perform a simulation, the use of factorial design is proposed as an alternative to design simulations in a systematic, objective and quantitative way. The method allows the deternmination of the main and joint effects of input parameters on the numerical simulation. The input parameters may be experimental uncertainty on boundary conditions, unknown boundary conditions, grid and turbulence models. The method is applied to the Turbine- 99 test case, where the radial velocity, the surface roughness, the turbulence length scale and the grid were the factors investigated. The inlet radial velocity is found to have a major effect on the pressure recovery. The flow in water turbines is highly unsteady due to the runner blade rotation, guide <b>vanes</b> and <b>stay</b> <b>vanes.</b> Unsteady pressure measurements on a Kaplan prototype point out unsteadiness in the high and low pressure regions of the turbine. Since model and prototype are not running in dynamically similar conditions, the influence of unsteadiness on the losses is of interest. The derivation of the variation of the mechanical energy for the mean, oscillating and turbulent fields point out the contribution of unsteadiness to the losses and the turbulent production. Application to turbulent channel flow reveals that the contribution {{is a function of the}} amplitude of the oscillation, the frequency and the friction velocity. Turbulent pulsating flow in a generic model of the rectangular diffuser found at the end of elbow draft tube is studied in detail with laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). Three frequencies, corresponding to the quasi-steady, relaxation and quasi-laminar regimes with an amplitude of about 10 % are investigated. The results indicate no alteration of the mean flow by the excitation of a single frequency. Furthermore. the existence of the different regimes, as found in turbulent pulsating turbulent pipe and channel flows, is confirmed. Godkänd; 2003; 20061108 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{results from}} OpenFOAM simulations conducted on a swirl generator {{designed to give}} similar flow conditions to those of a Francis turbine operating at partial load. Francis turbines {{are one of the}} most commonly used water turbines. In these turbines, there is however a frequent problem occuring at part load. Due to a swirling flow in the draft tube, a transient helical vortex rope builds up and creates severe pressure fluctuations in the system that increase the risk for fatique. To predict and control such flow features is therefore critical. A test rig was thus developed at the "Politehnica" University of Timisoara, Romania, to provide a detailed experimental database of such flow features. This test rig has four parts: leaning strout <b>vanes,</b> <b>stay</b> <b>vanes,</b> a rotating runner which is designed to have zero torque, and a convergent divergent draft tube. In this work, numerical results are compared and validated against measurements realized on the swirling flow test rig at the Polytechnica University of Timisoara in Romania. The computational mesh is created with ICEM-Hexa and the parts have been meshed separately and then merged together, using General Grid Interfaces (GGI) to couple them numerically. The finite volume method is used to solve both the unsteady and steady state Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations and the standard k-epsilon model is used to close the turbulence equations. Steady-state simulations is a preliminary method, which is less time-consuming and predicts the general behavior of the flow field. It also provides good initial conditions for the unsteady simulations. For the unsteady simulations, the mesh of the rotating part of the domain is rotating and the coupling between the stationary and rotating parts is handled by a sliding GGI interface. The simulation results shows a developing vortex rope in the draft tube which gives rise to oscillations of flow properties in the whole system. The size and shape of this vortex rope, as well as the frequency of the flow property oscillations it gives rise to, is highly dependent on the rotational speed of the free runner. The results show that a rotational speed of 920 rpm on the runner, corresponds best with the measurements out of the three rotational speeds 870 rpm, 890 rpm and 920 rpm. The rotational speed of 870 rpm gives a positive moment on the runner, an rpm of 890 of almost zero moment, and a speed of 920 rpm gives a positive moment on the runner. This leads to the conclusion that the tourque in the test rig was not zero when measurements were carried out. The rotational speed of 920 rpm is however not the most corresponding rotational speed, for the results can probably give a better velocity profile if the rotational speed would be increased to maybe 930 rpm, and if LES or DES would be used for resolving the turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Sediment erosion {{is a large}} {{problem for}} {{turbines}} operated in sand laden water, especially in the Himalayas and the Andes Mountains, where the contents of hard minerals in the rivers are high. A program called RenewableNepal supports {{the development of a}} new design philosophy for hydraulic turbines. NTNU and Kathmandu University cooperate within this program, and this master thesis is part of that cooperation. The objective of this thesis is to carry out the hydraulic design of a Francis turbine with reduced velocities. As part of that, a design software has been developed, using Matlab as programming tool. This software has been used to generate a reference design with the same physical dimensions as for the existing runners at Jhimruk Hydrorelectric Centre in Nepal. CFD analysis has been performed to verify the design software output, showing good results. Analysis of erosion from CFD were not successful as mesh independency for the analysis could not be established. Hence results for erosion prediction from CFD studies has not been presented in this thesis. A parametric study has been carried out, varying either the outlet diameter, the number of pole pairs, the inlet velocity, the acceleration of the flow through the runner, the height of the shroud or the blade angle distribution. An erosion model was implemented in the design software, and used as a control variable for the parametric study. CFD analyses using Ansys CFX were performed for selected designs with lower erosion than the reference design. The largest reduction of erosion was obtained when increasing the number of pole pairs, which implies that the rotational speed of the turbine is decreased. This does however increase the size of both the turbine and the generator, which cause increased investment costs as well. CFD analysis shows that the hydraulic efficiency for this design is higher than for the reference design. It was also discovered that by changing the blade angle distribution, and consequently also the energy distribution, a substantial reduction of erosion was possible without changing the physical dimensions or the rotational speed of the turbine. The efficiency for this design is also higher than for the reference design. The most promising design was found as a combination of these two effects, giving a reduction of the erosion of 50 percent compared to the reference design. CFD analysis for this design show a good efficiency and acceptable flow conditions in the runner. This and other designs with the modified blade angle distribution will have an unconventional energy conversion through the runner, leading to larger hydraulic forces on the trailing edge of the blades. Strength analyses of the blade would be beneficial, but have not been performed. The main focus in this thesis has been on developing the design software and developing runner designs for reducing sediment erosion. There have been no attempts for optimizing the designs of the guide <b>vanes</b> and <b>stay</b> <b>vanes</b> due to time constraints. </p...|$|R
40|$|Low head {{machines}} of type Kaplan {{are composed}} of several elements to ensure a large efficiency. The flow enters a spiral casing and is distributed to an axial runner through <b>stay</b> and guide <b>vanes.</b> Downstream the runner, a draft tube is essential to ensure high efficiency by increasing the cross-section. Modern draft tubes {{are mainly composed of}} a conical diffuser followed by an elbow and a straight diffuser. The runner cone, attached to the runner, is included in the conical diffuser. By a gradual area increase it allows strong pressure recovery, so flow separation may occur. Furthermore, the runner cone rotates and thus counteracts the function of the draft tube. An ongoing work focuses on the flow around the runner cone by means of CFD and experiments with special interest on the boundary layer. The objectives are to quantify the effects of the runner cone on the draft tube large scale flow. Special attention will be given to runner cone angular velocity and swirl intensity. Preliminary, calculations on a Kaplan model test case at different operating points will give an overview over boundary layer thicknesses and separations points. Different meshes will be combined for the time dependent calculations, which include the runner and the draft tube. Godkänd; 2011; 20111010 (ysko...|$|R
50|$|Crookes {{incorrectly}} {{suggested that}} the force {{was due to the}} pressure of light. This theory was originally supported by James Clerk Maxwell, who had predicted this force. This explanation is still often seen in leaflets packaged with the device. The first experiment to test this theory was done by Arthur Schuster in 1876, who observed that there was a force on the glass bulb of the Crookes radiometer that was in the opposite direction to the rotation of the vanes. This showed that the force turning the vanes was generated inside the radiometer. If light pressure were the cause of the rotation, then the better the vacuum in the bulb, the less air resistance to movement, and the faster the vanes should spin. In 1901, with a better vacuum pump, Pyotr Lebedev showed that in fact, the radiometer only works when there is low pressure gas in the bulb, and the <b>vanes</b> <b>stay</b> motionless in a hard vacuum. Finally, if light pressure were the motive force, the radiometer would spin in the opposite direction, as the photons on the shiny side being reflected would deposit more momentum than on the black side where the photons are absorbed. The actual pressure exerted by light is far too small to move these vanes, but can be measured with devices such as the Nichols radiometer.|$|R
40|$|Sediment erosion {{is caused}} by the dynamic action of {{sediment}} flowing along with water impacting against a solid surface. Hydraulic turbine components operating in sediment-laden water are subject to abrasive and erosive wear. This wear not only reduces the efficiency and the life of the turbine but also causes problems in operation and maintenance, which ultimately leads to economic losses. This is a global operation and maintenance problem of hydropower plants. The high sediment concentration combined with high percentage of quartz content in water causes severe damage to hydraulic turbine components. Withdrawal of clean water from the river for power production is expensive due to design, construction and operation of sediment settling basins. Even with the settling basins, 100 % removal of fine sediments is impossible and uneconomical. A number of factors can influence the process of sediment erosion damage in hydro turbine components. The erosion intensity depends on the sediment type and its characteristics (shape, size, hardness, concentration etc.), hydraulic design and operating conditions of turbine (flow rate, head, rotational speed, velocity, acceleration, turbulence, impingement angle etc.), and material used for the turbine components. All these factors are needed to be considered for predicting the erosion. Therefore, dealing with sediment erosion problems requires a multidisciplinary approach. More research and development is needed to investigate the relationship between the particle movement and erosion inside a turbine and to establish the operating strategy for the turbine operating in sediment-laden water. In order to achieve the main objective of this PhD study, the overall research methodology adopted for this work ‘sediment erosion in hydro turbines’ include; experimental studies, numerical simulation, and field studies. This research work is based on result from laboratory experiment, and numerical simulation. A previously made test rig (Thapa, 2004), was reviewed and modified to create a strong swirl flow in curved path. This flow was found similar to the flow between the guide vane outlet and the runner inlet of a Francis turbine. The flow in the guide vane cascade was simulated in order to verify the particle separation process and to investigate the relation of the velocity and the drag coefficient with different shape and size of the particle. There was a provision to introduce particles, with sizes ranging from 1 to 10 mm, and to observe the motion of the particles from Plexiglas windows located {{on the cover of the}} tank using a high-speed digital camera. When a particle is flowing in swirl flow, drag force and centrifugal force are two major forces influencing the particle equilibrium. The equilibrium of these two forces provides a critical diameter of the particle. While, a particle larger than the critical diameter move away from the centre and hit the wall, a particle smaller than the critical diameter flows along with the water, and ultimately sinks. For critical diameter, the particle continues to rotate in the turbine. Different shapes and sizes of particles were tested with the same operating conditions and found that triangularly shaped particles were more likely to hit the suction side of the guide vane cascade. Furthermore, this study supports the concept of separation of particles from streamlines inside the test rig, which led to the development of an operating strategy for a Francis turbine processing sediment-laden water. This study also permitted experimental verification of the size and the shape of a particle as it orbits in the turbine, until either the velocity components are changed or the particle became smaller. The steady state numerical simulations were carried out on the Cahua power plant Francis turbine design, mainly at two operating conditions with varying particle size, shape, and concentration using ANSYS CFX. The predictions of erosion, based on the Lagrangian calculation of particle paths in a viscous flow, are described for <b>stay</b> <b>vanes,</b> guide vanes, and runner vanes of a Francis turbine, for which the results of the field tests have been available for verification. The flow simulation was obtained through use of a commercially available computational fluids dynamics (CFD) code, namely ANSYS CFX.   The code utilizes a finite-volume, multi-block approach to solve the governing equations of fluid motion numerically on a user-defined computational grid. The flow solution procedure first generates the computational grid. A pre-processor is available in the software to perform this task. Second, the solution option such as inlet and boundary conditions, turbulence model, and discretization scheme, are specified. The final step is running the flow solver to generate the actual flow field simulation. Sediment erosion analysis of a Francis turbine gives an indication of relative erosion intensity and critical zones of erosion damage of the turbine components. The most realistic numerical prediction of erosion is found on a turbine blade. The highest velocities and accelerations occurred at outlet of the runner blade and more erosion was predicted especially at the pressure side of the blade outlet and at the lower cover. Furthermore, unexpected sediment erosion was found at the suction side of the guide vane where concept of critical diameter can be utilized. It has been concluded that if the particle size in the water is more than critical particle sizes, the turbine should not be operated at low guide vane opening. The numerically obtained erosion pattern and the field test observation and inspection at Cahua Francis turbine components are in good qualitative agreement. The encouraging agreement shows that, for this application, numerical simulation really can be used in a predictive manner. This information may serve as an input in an early stage of turbine design process to identify the regions where special surface treatment is necessary in order to increase the lifetime of the components for new hydropower projects involving risks of sediment erosion. The size of a particle is inversely proportional to the velocity of the particle, and it was determined that spherically shaped particles had higher settling velocities than particles with other shapes. However, non-spherical shape of the particles will tend to have lower settling velocities because both decreases in spheroid and increases in angularity tend to decrease velocities. Moreover, larger cross-sectional areas tend to be directed perpendicular to the transport path.   As a result, higher coefficient of drag, higher rotational motion and more separation of flow are likely to occur and hence more erosion rate was predicted.   The roles played by the shape of the particle significantly affect erosion rate prediction inside the Francis turbine components. Furthermore, it has been found that the erosion process is strongly dependent on the particle size, shape, concentration, and operating conditions of the turbine. The reduction of the erosion is not only linked to the reduction of particle velocity but also is linked to the reduction of separation of flow, which further depends on shape, size, and concentration of the particle. The significant reduction of erosion rate can be achieved by operating turbine at best efficiency point. The full load operation reduced efficiency, increased turbulence, and increased relative velocity of flow at outlet of the blades. The present knowledge and findings, although may not be enough to deal with this problem completely, can be utilised to achieve one major step forward in sediment erosion prediction and prevention.         PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|R
