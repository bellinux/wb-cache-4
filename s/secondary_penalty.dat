40|$|An Offset Spine Fin Spine (segmented) fin coils {{have been}} used in certain {{applications}} {{as a result of their}} effective use of coil material. One can improve coil heat transfer performance by adding more fins per inch (FPI). This comes at the expense of air side pressure drop, which requires more fan energy to achieve the same air flow. When this type of fin is used in an evaporator, there is a <b>secondary</b> <b>penalty</b> associated with the fan heat that must be removed by the refrigeration system. Also, the tighter fin spacing is less tolerant to frost growth that can block air flow over time. The current research focuses on a new configuration that nearly doubles the surface area of the fins, yet has similar fin spacing. Performance is evaluated using one inch sections of the tube and fins. The air side pressure drop is measured and thermal performance is evaluated using a transient thermal imaging technique. The pressure drop and thermal performance results are used to simulate performance in a household refrigerator and show that there is a 2 - 3 % improvement in the overall system energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence for the}} fact that early life environment in human beings are associated with future development of various metabolic diseases. Fetal programming and perinatal events appear to exert effects on later life that are independent of environmental risk factors in adults. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms are limited and remains unclear. However several animal models and epidemiological studies have shown this association, and it is assumed <b>secondary</b> to the <b>penalties</b> of developmental plasticity. In this review, we amalgamate facts from several disciplines to support this hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{views the}} problem of {{sovereign}} risk as one of insufficient penalties. Foreign creditors can only be repaid if the government enforces foreign debts. And this will only happen if foreign creditors can effectively use the threat of imposing penalties to the country. Guided by this assessment of the problem, policy prescriptions to reduce sovereign risk have focused on providing incentives for governments to enforce foreign debts. For instance, countries might want to favor increased trade ties {{and other forms of}} foreign dependence that make them vulnerable to foreign retaliation thereby increasing the costs of default <b>penalties.</b> Sovereign risk, <b>secondary</b> markets, default <b>penalties,</b> commitment, international risk sharing, international borrowing...|$|R

In this work, by using six {{physical and}} chemical properties we explore the machine learning models and the properties are total empirical energy, <b>secondary</b> structure <b>penalty,</b> total surface area, pair number, residue length and Euclidean distance to predict the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of a protein structure in the absence of its true native state. There are total 1056 modelled decoys structure having 3078 native structures. The Real Coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) is used to determine feature importance and robustness is measured by the K-fold validation of the best predictive model. The experiments results shows that the random forest model outperforms the other machine learning approaches in RMSD prediction. This work achieved the prediction of RMSD faster and inexpensive. Keywords—Protein structure prediction, Machine learning, Random forest, RCGA. Results: The performance result shows that in the prediction of RMSD, the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is 0. 48; correlation is 0. 90; R 2 is 0. 82; and accuracy is 97. 02 % (with ± 2 error) respectively on the testing data. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{same-sex}} legalization and same-sex relationship recognition on labor outcomes such as wages and specialization for lesbian women. Using 1990 U. S. Census data and 2013 American Community Survey (ACS), I exploit the temporal and spatial variation of legalizing same-sex marriage using a triple difference-in-differences-in-differences estimator, and employing an Oaxaca-Blinder wage and specialization decomposition. Results demonstrate that unmarried lesbians who are primary partners experience a wage premium of 15. 2 % and unmarried lesbians who are secondary partners experience a more modest wage premium of 3. 7 %. Married lesbians who are secondary partners experience a wage penalty of 10. 7 %. For primary partners, wage premiums are 19. 3 % under domestic partnerships, and 15. 9 % under civil unions. No such effects are detected under same-sex marriage for the general lesbian population, suggesting that the primary partner marriage premium is being offset by the <b>secondary</b> partner wage <b>penalty.</b> Marriage, {{more than any other}} legal institution, signals greater commitment and in turn facilitates specialization. There is little evidence of marriage market selection and employer discrimination related mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|In spring {{practices}} in 1989, Forbes had performed well, {{and he was}} expected by most {{to compete for the}} starting job in the fall, but he was then dismissed from school for academic reasons in May and was only able to play in the fall after a successful appeal. He came into the summer practices still expected by some to start, but didn't get his chance {{until the end of the}} season; and then, only because of injuries to starting quarterback Peter Gardere. Late in the season against TCU, Gardere suffered a shoulder injury in the 2nd quarter and backup Mark Murdock was ineffective, giving Forbes his chance. He rallied the Longhorns from a 17-10 deficit, completing 8 of 9 passes for 117 yards including a 36-yard touchdown pass to Kerry Cash to win 31-17 and was then named the Associated Press Southwest Conference offensive player of the week. [...] A minor quarterback controversy arose as a result, but despite Forbes' play the week before, Gardere got the start against Baylor the next week. Texas got off to a bad start and Gardere was pulled in the first half for Forbes who wasn't able to do much better as Texas lost 50-7. In the last game of the season and the final game of his career, Forbes finally got his one chance to start when Peter Gardere was ailing. Texas took an early lead in that game, and was up 10-7 at halftime, but could not overcome several miscues from every aspect including two missed field goals, a wide open A&M receiver in the UT <b>secondary,</b> a <b>penalty</b> for too many people on the field that turned a botched A&M punt into another TD for A&M, and three interceptions and a fourth down pass incompletion by Forbes.|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the current civil engine design {{practice}} of increasing overall pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and bypass ratio, and on the technologies {{required in order to}} sustain it. In this context, this thesis contributes towards clarifying the following gray aspects of future civil engine development: the connection between an aircraft application, the engine thermodynamic cycle and the advanced technologies of variable area fan nozzle and fan drive gearbox. the connection between the engine thermodynamic cycle and the fuel consumption penalties of extracting bleed or power in order to satisfy the aircraft needs. the scaling of propeller maps in order to enable extensive open-rotor studies similar to the ones carried out for turbofan engines. The rst two objectives are tackled by implementing a preliminary design framework, which comprises models that calculate the engine uninstalled performance, dimensions, weight, drag and installed performance. The framework produces designs that are in good agreement with current and near future civil engines. The need for a variable area fan nozzle is related to the fan surge margin at take-o, while the transition to a geared architecture is identi ed by tracking the variation of the low pressure turbine number of stages. The results show that the above enabling technologies will be prioritised for long range engines, due to their higher overall pressure ratio, higher bypass ratio and lower speci c thrust. The analysis also shows that future lower speci c thrust engines will su er from higher <b>secondary</b> power extraction <b>penalties.</b> A propeller modelling and optimisation method is created in order to accomplish the open-rotor aspect of this work. The propeller model follows the lifting-line approach and is found to perform well against experimental data available for the SR 3 prop-fan. The model is used in order to predict the performance of propellers with the same distribution of airfoils and sweep, but with di erent design point power coe cient and advance ratio. The results demonstrate that all the investigated propellers can be modelled by a common map, which separately determines the ideal and viscous losses...|$|R
