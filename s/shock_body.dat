5000|$|A coilover is an {{automobile}} suspension device. [...] "Coilover" [...] {{is short for}} [...] "coil spring over shock". It consists of a shock absorber with a coil spring encircling it. The shock absorber and spring are assembled as a unit prior to installation, and are replaced as a unit when the shock absorber has leaked. This provides damping without torsional loads. Some coilovers allow adjustment of ride height and preload, using a simple threaded spring perch similar to a nut. More advanced adjustable coilover systems use a threaded <b>shock</b> <b>body,</b> along with an adjustable lower mount for ride height adjustment, while an adjustment knob is used to adjust damping. Stiffness is changed by switching the spring for one with a different spring rate.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Multiple {{studies have}} focused on the {{relationship}} of body anthropometric measures with clinical events in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, highlighting the 'obesity paradox'. However, the relative prognostic importance of these measures over other baseline variables is less known. Method and results We performed a retrospective analysis of 94 108 STEMI patients from seven clinical trials evaluating various reperfusion strategies to study the relationship and prognostic importance of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and body surface area (BSA) with 30 -day death and in-hospital cardiogenic shock, major bleeding, and stroke. Main outcome measures of interest included 30 -day death and in-hospital cardiogenic shock, major bleeding, and stroke. Weight, BMI, and BSA were inversely and independently related to all clinical events. Despite being statistically significant (P < 0. 0001), the prognostic information contributed by weight beyond that conferred by baseline clinical factors was minimal (< 1 % of total prognostic information) making it of limited clinical relevance for predicting 30 -day death and cardiogenic shock. In contrast, weight accounted for 8. 4 % and 4. 3 % of the prognostic information in the logistic regression models for major bleeding and for stroke. BMI or BSA added little incremental value over simple measure of weight. CONCLUSION: Although statistically significantly related to most outcomes in patients with STEMI including death and <b>shock,</b> <b>body</b> weight provided clinically relevant prognostic information only for the risk of major bleeding and of stroke. Furthermore, BMI or BSA contributed little incremental prognostic information beyond that provided by weight alone. Thus, the existing large body of information concerning the strong prognostic importance of anthropometric measures with outcomes after STEMI should be interpreted in the context of other more important risk factors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Teleseismic long-period {{body and}} surface waves {{radiated}} by the May 6, 1976 Friuli, Italy earthquake and its principal aftershock of September 15, 1976 (09 h 21 m) are studied to determine source characteristics. Focal mechanisms along with geological evidence suggest that both events represent the underthrusting of the Friuli Plain beneath the southern Alps. The depths of both earthquakes, estimated by matching synthetic body-wave seismograms to observations, {{are found to}} lie between 6 and 10 km. It {{is not possible to}} discern any evidence of source directivity in the observed main <b>shock</b> <b>body</b> waves. Synthetic seismogram calculations which include rupture effects suggest that the fault length of the main shock could not be much larger than 16 km for a unilaterally propagating fault or about 24 km for a symmetrical rupture assuming a rupture velocity of 3. 0 km/sec. Observations of 100 -sec Rayleigh waves confirm the focal mechanism deduced from body waves, but suggest that the seismic moment of the main shock is 5 × 10 ^(25) dyne-cm compared to 2. 9 × 10 ^(25) dyne-cm estimated from body waves. The P-wave moment of the aftershock is 1 × 10 ^(25) dyne-cm. The aftershock studied in this paper is one of four large events which occurred in the epicentral area of the main shock more than 4 months after the main shock. These aftershocks had a combined seismic moment over twice that of the main shock. It is suggested that these earthquakes represent deformation in {{a different part of the}} seismic zone than the main shock. Large earthquakes with series of severe aftershocks are well known in the historical record of the Friuli region. The average displacement and stress drop are estimated to be 33 cm and 12 bars for the main shock and 33 cm 24 bars for the aftershock...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores Valeska Gert’s {{contributions}} to dance {{against the backdrop}} of Weimar Germany. The first section considers the themes of her choreographies. Eschewing both idealism and abstraction, her work presented a gritty account of the realities of contemporary quotidian life, often featuring outcasts from bourgeois society. It also reflected a growing German interest in aspects of American culture, including sport and multi-ethnicity. Whereas many expressive dancers offered bucolic images of nature, Gert fully embraced modernity, including the process of urbanisation and technological developments. The paper’s second section turns to stylistic features of Gert’s dance, using an analysis of Alfred Meyer’s poem about the dancer as a springboard for discussion. Consideration is given to the montage-like structure of many of Gert’s works, her invocation of elements of ‘lower’ culture such as the street ballad, and her association with the carnival and grotesque. Her frequently <b>shocking</b> <b>body</b> images are viewed as subverting social conventions, in particular by presenting a radical take on femininity...|$|R

It provided them with new ways of probing the nature of reality and understanding themselves. Luigi Galvani?s discovery of ?animal electricity? {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century opened up a whole new world of possibilities, in which electricity could cure sickness, restore sexual potency and even raise the dead. In <b>Shocking</b> <b>Bodies,</b> Iwan Rhys Morus explores how the Victorians thought about electricity, and how they tried to use its intimate and corporeal force to answer fundamental questions about life and death. Some even believed that electricity was life, which brought into question the existence of the soul, and of God, and provided arguments in favour of political radicalism. This is the story of how electricity emerged as a powerful new tool for making sense of our bodies and the world around us...|$|R
