5|$|The HP-35 used five chips, {{and had a}} been {{developed}} by twenty engineers {{at a cost of}} a million dollars, leading the Texas Instruments engineers to think that Sinclair's aim to build a <b>scientific</b> <b>calculator</b> around the TMS0805 chip, which could barely handle four-function arithmetic, was impossible. However, by sacrificing some speed and accuracy, Sinclair used clever algorithms to run scientific operations on a chip with room for just 320 instructions. Constants, rather than being stored in the calculator, were printed under the screen.|$|E

2500|$|Squire {{initially}} {{considered a}} return to accountancy. But he had difficulty in this regard because he had not updated his skills since leaving the profession in 1979. For example, he was initially unable to use a computer spreadsheet or a <b>scientific</b> <b>calculator</b> – essential tools for an accountant by 1997. He applied for the post of {{general manager of the}} Dolphin Square residential complex in Pimlico, London at a salary of £30,000 but was turned down, albeit as the runner-up for the post. He applied for the position of bursar at several independent schools but was rejected by all of them.

2500|$|In 1976, Wozniak {{developed}} the computer that eventually made him famous. He alone designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating {{system for the}} Apple I. Wozniak originally offered the design to HP while working there, but was denied by the company on five different occasions. Jobs instead had the idea to sell the Apple I with Wozniak as a fully assembled printed circuit board. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs {{that even if they}} were not successful they could at least say to their grandkids they had had their own company. Together they sold some of their possessions (such as Wozniak's HP <b>scientific</b> <b>calculator</b> and Jobs' Volkswagen van), raised $1,300, and assembled the first boards in Jobs' bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in Jobs' garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and some computer games Wozniak had developed. The Apple I sold for $666.66. (Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and [...] "I came up with [...] because I like repeating digits.") Jobs and Wozniak sold their first 50 system boards to Paul Terrell, who was starting a new computer shop, called the Byte Shop, in Mountain View, California.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a steady {{increase}} in the levels of use of calculators in both primary and secondary schools over the 1980 s and 1990 s, despite initial scepticism and caution. Today, the use of <b>scientific</b> <b>calculators</b> has become commonplace in lower secondary school mathematics classrooms in Australia. Although some schools began using <b>scientific</b> <b>calculators</b> through the purchase of class sets for upper secondary school students, these days most {{students are expected to}} own and learn to use their own personal calculator and begin to do so from the lower secondary level.

40|$|<b>Scientific</b> <b>calculators</b> {{have emerged}} as useful tools for {{mathematical}} procedures and manipulations. From the year 2002, the ministry of education approved the use <b>scientific</b> <b>calculators</b> in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination and in the classroom, {{as a tool to}} aid in computations. This was intended to avoid wastage of time in solving mathematical problems and improve students ‟ performance. This has raised questions as to the potential contribution of <b>scientific</b> <b>calculators</b> to the teaching and learning of mathematics (benefits) in secondary schools. It is also not clear what challenges may be faced by teachers and learners when using <b>scientific</b> <b>calculators</b> in mathematics. The purpose of this study therefore was to establish challenges presented to the learners in the use of <b>scientific</b> <b>calculators</b> in learning of mathematics in public secondary schools in Emuhaya District, Kenya. The study was based on descriptive survey design. The study population consisted of 44 mathematics teachers, two Quality Assurance and Standards Officers in the district, 24 Head teachers and 1680 form 4 students in all 24 secondary schools in the district. The study was carried out in Emuhaya district because the district is well staffed in terms of teaching force with a teacher- learner ratio of 1 : 38. 1 as compared to the government recommended ratio of 1 : 40, yet the performance in mathematics remains low. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, i. e., frequency counts, percentages and means. Qualitative data was received in verbatim form, transcribed and reported according to emergent themes. Data analyzed was presented using tables and graphs...|$|R
