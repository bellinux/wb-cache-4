We found that the de facto quality-metric for task-free fMRI, temporal {{signal to noise ratio}} (tSNR), correlated inversely with dynamic fidelity; thus, studies optimized for tSNR actually produced time-series that showed the greatest distortion of signal dynamics. Instead, the phantom showed that dynamic fidelity is reasonably approximated by a measure that, unlike tSNR, dissociates <b>signal</b> dynamics from <b>scanner</b> artifact.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this project is the design and the {{fabrication}} of a laboratory prototype of a Chirp-Laser-Radar for range scanning at a distance up to 100 m. One of the primary objectives is the use and the performance assessment of various optoelectronic components for the scan signal modulation and for the subsequent demodulation of the burst <b>signal.</b> The <b>scanner</b> employs a highly linear chirp pulse that is generated by a VCO driven by a direct digital synthesizer. The wide band modulation of the laser beam intensity is accomplished by means of direct current modulation of the laser diode or through an external beam modulation employing acousto-optical elements. The latter permits the modulation of several incoherently overlapped laser beams operating at different wavelengths (total bandwidth of 80 nm) without significant degradation of the scanner beam quality. This facilitates the attainment of high beam power that {{is necessary for the}} scanning of non-cooperative targets. Two different principles of signal demodulation were pursued during this project: a) optical and b) electronic signal analysis. An entirely optical signal processing uses an acousto-optical signal processor comprising several Bragg-cells. This processor exhibits two output channels. The burst resulting from the superposition of the reference and target signals is analyzed in the first channel as a time domain signal. The second output provides a stationary diffraction field that is analyzed by a CCD-camera. The chirp pulse length is 11 #mu#sec and the attained resolution is in the order of 5 x 10 "-" 4. The fully electronic signal processor analyzes the burst signal in the frequency domain and in the time domain. The chirp length here is 1 msec and the achieved resolution is 10 "-" 5. The range finder could be used in factory automation and in the construction industry. (orig.)

Modern <b>scanners</b> are equipped with spherical harmonics (SH) shim coils, generally up to 2 nd or 3 rd order, but the latter allow mitigating the magnetic field offsets only to a certain degree. A new method based on a multicoil approach has been proposed recently and was shown {{to be more effective}} than SH shimming [1 â 4]. Subjects and Methods: For the simulations, a set of coils was mounted on a cylinder (Ã¸ 360 mm), which would be large enough to accommodate inside additional RF transmit and receive arrays. Different coil arrangements and shapes were evaluated by trying to homogenize B 0 distributions typically encountered in case of human brain imaging at 9. 4 T. The comparison of the different configurations was based on the standard deviation of the resulting magnetic field distributions. Figure 1 shows some of the examined structures. Results: Among all investigated configurations, the best results were obtained for the given B 0 field distribution with the 12 channel design (Figs. 1 a, 2). Discussion/Conclusion: The simulations of the different configurations demonstrated that the homogeneity of the B 0 field can be increased by the use of multiple small shimming coils.

Deterministic or probabilistic tractography was performed to assess link weight based on the number of fibers connecting gray matter regions of interest (ROI). Link weight and graph theory network measures were calculated and reproducibility was assessed through intra-class correlation coefficients, assuming each scanning session as a rater. Connectome reproducibility was higher with data from the same scanner. The probabilistic approach yielded larger reproducibility, while the individual variation in the number of tracked fibers from deterministic tractography was negatively associated with reproducibility. Links connecting larger and anatomically closer ROIs demonstrated higher reproducibility. In general, graph theory measures demonstrated high reproducibility across scanning sessions. Anatomical factors and tractography approaches can influence the reproducibility of the structural connectome and should be factored in the interpretation of future studies.

However, {{the use of}} reinforcers such as juice and airpuffs can create challenges for fMRI. Reinforcer delivery can cause head movement, which creates artifacts in the fMRI signal. Reinforcement {{can also lead to}} changes in heart rate and respiration that are mediated by autonomic pathways. Changes in heart rate and respiration can directly affect the fMRI (BOLD) signal in the brain and can be confounded with signal changes that are due to neural activity. In this presentation, we demonstrate methods for administering reinforcers in a controlled manner, for stabilizing the head, and for measuring pulse and respiration. Protocol Equipment Setup The first step in running and fMRI experiment is setting up and checking the equipment. These steps can be done in any order. <b>Signal</b> conditioning- The <b>scanner</b> is located in an electrically and magnetically shielded room. All electrical signals going from the control room to the scanner room pass through a filter panel to remove any frequencies that could create an artifact in the MR image. Airpuff â The airpuff device delivers a controlled puff of fixed pressure and duration. When directed toward the eye, this is aversive but non-traumatic. The pressure regulator (WPI Pneumatic PicoPump) to a source of compressed air, which could be an air tank but we use house air. The pressure is adjusted to 30 psi. The timing is adjusted to deliver a 50 msec puff. The solenoid valve is controlled by a computer signal...|$|R
40|$|Background: Accurate {{evaluation}} of the tricuspid regurgitant (TR) spectral Doppler signal is important during transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) evaluation for pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Contrast enhancement improves Doppler backscatter. However, its incremental benefit with contemporary scanners is less well established. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether the TR spectral Doppler <b>signal</b> using contemporary <b>scanners</b> was improved using a second generation contrast agent, DefinityÂ® (CE), compared to unenhanced TTE (UE). Methods: Analysis of patients who underwent UE then CE TR interrogation was performed. TR signal was evaluated by an experienced reader and graded 1 (clear-high level of confidence of interpretation and complete spectral Doppler envelope), 2 (suboptimal with medium-low level of confidence of interpretation and incomplete envelope), 3 (poor-absent and no measurable spectral Doppler signal). Maximal TR velocity (TRV) was defined as peak velocity that could be clearly identified. An inexperienced sonographer read 30 randomly selected studies. Results: 176 TTE were performed in 173 patients (mean age 57 Â Â±Â  14. 8 Â years). Wilcoxon signed rank test demonstrated significant improvement (pÂ <Â  0. 0001) in TR spectral Doppler signal quality with CE TTE. Mean score CE TTE vs. TTEÂ =Â  2. 32 Â Â±Â  0. 85 vs. 2. 56 Â Â±Â  0. 75 respectively (pÂ <Â  0. 0001). Mean maximal TRV CE TTE vs. UE TTEÂ =Â  2. 61 Â Â±Â  0. 44 Â m/s vs. 2. 54 Â Â±Â  0. 49 Â m/s respectively (pÂ <Â  0. 0001). The inexperienced reader had a greater improvement in scoring CE TTE signals vs. UE TTE (pÂ <Â  0. 0001). Conclusion: In the era of contemporary scanners, CE improved the ability to detect and measure TRV, except in those with clear unenhanced TR spectral Doppler signals or greater than mild tricuspid regurgitation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{formulate}} a systematic method {{to establish an}} optimized MRI pulse sequence using an experimental MRI scanner as an example for polymer gel dosimetry (PGD). Methods and Materials: 3 D dosimetry for clinical applications needs 2 x 2 x 2 mm 3 spatial resolution with dose uncertainty lower than 3 %. Fundamentals of MRI physics lead to optimized imaging parameters for R 2 measurements. We chose a multiple spin-echo technique of CMPG with variable crusher pulses. The 2 D imaging technique was supplemented with interleaved slice acquisition for higher efficiency. The optimized parameters were implemented in a 1. 5 T MR system (Magnex Scientific, Oxfordshire, UK) using the Apollo pulse programming/data acquisition system (Tecmag Inc., Houston, TX). Measurements were carried out for a phantom containing varying R 2 values. Results and Discussion: The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of baseline <b>signals</b> of our <b>scanner</b> was low; thereby, acquisitions had to be repeated for 25 times to raise SNR to a value greater than 50. The spin echo time {{was determined to be}} 22 ms based on the available gradient field strength. Since TR should be longer than 3 times of the longest T 1, TR was set to 3 sec. The number of spin echoes (NSE) has to be sufficiently large since the uncertainty of the estimated R 2 value decreases with increasing NSE. The number is limited because the signal noise departs from Gaussian as the signal decays. For SNR= 50, NSE should be between 15 and 20 for R 2 ranging from 2 to 10 s- 1. For these imaging parameters the total scan takes 21. 3 hours to obtain 48 2 -mm slices. We showed that increasing SNR broadens the measurable range of the R 2 value and reduces NSE. Conclusion: A key requirement of high resolution and high precision MRI for PGD is to achieve SNR larger tha...|$|R
