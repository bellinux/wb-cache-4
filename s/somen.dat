25|$|Next up was {{the first}} of two clashes against Premier League outfits on 6 August, as Parma met Norwich City at Carrow Road. The Canaries took a first-half lead through a close-range Grant Holt effort and led by that single goal at half-time. Andrew Surman then scored a second-half brace and Norwich ran out {{comfortable}} 3–0 winners. I Ducali then made the trip west to face West Bromwich Albion to round up the tour the following day and had more success. Nicola Sansone gave Parma the lead just before half-time, but a <b>Somen</b> Tchoyi goal deep into injury time in the second half secured the hosts a draw.|$|E
25|$|Spam is used {{in local}} dishes {{in a variety of}} ways, most {{commonly}} fried and served with rice. For breakfast, fried eggs are often served with spam. Spam can also be wrapped in ti and roasted, skewered and deep fried, or stir-fried with cabbage. It is added to saimin and fried rice, mashed with tofu, or served with cold <b>sōmen</b> or baked macaroni and cheese. It is also used in chutney for pupus, in sandwiches with mayonnaise, or baked with guava jelly. Spam musubi, a slice of fried Spam upon a bed of rice wrapped with a strip of nori, is a popular snack in Hawaii which found its way onto island sushi menus in the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009 there were rumours that 1860 Munich was {{interested}} in signing him. Finally Ngwat-Mahop stayed with Red Bull Salzburg and he featured in the whole match, in what was [...] Red Bull Salzburg's first match of the season, an 1–1 home draw against Irish outfit Bohemians for the second Qualifying round of the 2009–2010 UEFA Champions League. He was, once again, a starter at Red Bull Salzburg' opening match of the 2009–10 Bundesliga season, but he was substituted in the 40th minute by his fellow countryman <b>Somen</b> Tchoyi. Later it was known that Ngwat-Mahop suffered a tear of the left anterior thigh muscle, an injury that would {{keep him out of}} action for months. He managed to fully heal from his injury and play again for Red Bull Salzburg almost nine months later, in a 4–2 home win against SC Magna Wiener Neustadt, as he came in as a late substitute for <b>Somen</b> Tchoyi. At the meantime Ngwat-Mahop played in five games for Red Bull Salzburg Juniors managing to score four goals, two of them in a single match, a 3–0 home win against SC Austria Lustenau. At {{the end of the season}} he had only managed to play in two league games and one European game for Red Bull Salzburg and did not score any goals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soman</b> {{can also}} bind to other esterases, e.g., AChE, cholinesterase (ChE) and carboxylesterases (CarbE). In this binding, <b>soman</b> loses its fluoride. After binding to AChE or ChE <b>soman</b> also loses its {{phosphoryl}} group, {{leading to the}} formation of methylphosphonic acid (MPA). Binding to CarbE reduce the total concentration of <b>soman</b> in the blood, thus resulting in a lower toxicity. Furthermore, CarbE are involved in the detoxication by hydrolysing <b>soman</b> to PMPA. So CarbE account for the detoxication of <b>soman</b> in two ways.|$|R

50|$|The {{manufacture}} of <b>soman</b> {{is very similar}} to the {{manufacture of}} sarin. The difference is that the isopropanol from the sarin processes is replaced with pinacolyl alcohol:Soman is synthesized by reacting pinacolyl alcohol with methylphosphonyl difluoride. The result of this reaction is the forming of <b>soman</b> (3,3-dimethylbutan-2-yl methylphosphonofluoridate) which is described as “colorless liquid with a somewhat fruity odor.” The low vapor pressure of <b>soman</b> will also produce the volatile gas form of <b>soman.</b> Also, the acid hydrogen fluoride will form due to the elimination of fluoride and a proton. This acid is indirectly dangerous to humans. Skin contact with hydrogen fluoride will cause an immediate reaction with water which produces hydrofluoric acid.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) {{activities}} in different brain parts were determined quantitatively in rats treated with huperzine A, <b>soman,</b> and huperzine A followed by <b>soman,</b> using histochemical and biochemical methods.

The most sensitive area was the frontal cortex and the most relatively resistant was ncl. ruber. Huperzine A treatment only caused a change in AChE activity varying from 70 to 100 % of control values.
