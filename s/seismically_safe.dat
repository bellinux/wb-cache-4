50|$|As a consequence, {{force majeure}} in areas prone to natural {{disaster}} requires {{a definition of}} the magnitude of the event for which force majeure could be considered as such in a contract. As an example, in a highly seismic area a technical definition of the amplitude of motion at the site could be established on the contract, based for example on probability of occurrence studies. This parameter or parameters can later be monitored at the construction site (with a commonly agreed procedure). An earthquake could be a small shaking or damaging event. The occurrence of an earthquake does not imply the occurrence of damage or disruption. For small and moderate events it is reasonable to establish requirements for the contract processes; for large events it is not always feasible or economical to do so. Concepts such as 'damaging earthquake' in force majeure clauses does not help to clarify disruption, especially in areas where there are no other reference structures or most structures are not <b>seismically</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, Koo {{returned}} to China {{for the first}} time and made contact with a former principal at her alma mater, then known as Shanghai Public High School No. 3. Koo committed that overseas investors would be found if the principal could convince the government to return the school to an all-girls facility. By 1984, the school had been restored to a girls school and an overseas alumni association was providing funding for new science laboratories. She soon joined her efforts with financing programs offered by The 1990 Institute and pledged to help 1,000 girls finish primary school. In 2000, Koo toured western China visiting the provinces of Gansu, Shanxi and Shaanxi. Upon her return, she and Institute partners began a Dragon Fund to help educate girls in western China. The initial three projects were a Women’s and Children’s Training Center in Gansu, a greenhouse in Zhang Xian, and the [...] "Spring Bud" [...] scholarship program to provide funds for elementary school of girls in Shaanxi Province. Koo returned each year to measure the girls' progress and soon extended the scholarship funds to secondary schooling. In 2008, after the earthquake in Sichuan Province, Koo extended her commitment to including girls in Sichuan Province as well. Since their school buildings had been destroyed, Koo partnered with Jennifer Devlin of EHDD in San Francisco, to build a <b>seismically</b> <b>safe</b> school to replace three which had been damaged by the quake. Working with local partners they built the school and provided input for new Chinese construction and seismic codes to ensure safety. As of 2012, with Koo's annual visit, she had assisted over 1000 girls in the Shaanxi province and 168 of them had gone on to university studies.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of seismic performance of existing buildings {{has received a}} great attention in the last decade. A common engineering practice in Sudan is not to consider earthquake effects {{in the design of}} all buildings. Therefore, all types of buildings in the Sudan are not earthquake-resistant. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the seismic performance of existing residual buildings in the Sudan. One case study has been chosen for this purpose. The evaluation has proved that the columns of four-story residual buildings are not <b>seismically</b> <b>safe.</b> A comparative study has been conducted to choose a suitable strengthening method. An effective method has been proposed by adding RC shear walls. Three cases of same positions for the shear walls with thicknesses of 20 cm, 15 cm and 10 cm have been examined. It has been proved that RC wall with 15 cm thickness is suitable strategy for this case to reduce the seismic vulnerability of exiting (RC) buildings in the Sudan...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of {{structures}} according to conventional seismic design procedure {{has been based}} on trading off strength and ductility (or displacement) to provide sufficient energy dissipation capacity to structures. Consequently, structures in regions of high seismicity are designed to undergo large displacements whilst maintaining their lateral strengths in an earthquake. Energy demand from a small to medium earthquake could subside with increasing effective natural periods. Significantly, the amount of drift imposed on the structures could be restrained to an upper limit irrespective of the degradation in strength or stiffness of the lateral load resisting elements. Based on the displacement-controlled behaviour, structures can be deemed <b>seismically</b> <b>safe</b> despite having undergone significant degradation in strength and stiffness, provided that the structures can sustain the maximum drift demand from an earthquake without collapsing. This paper proposes a simple procedure for the assessment {{of structures}} in regions of low to moderate seismicity. The proposed procedure will result in significant savings in time and costs particularly when a large number of structures are to be assessed for their potential vulnerability in an earthquake...|$|E
40|$|The {{recent history}} of {{earthquakes}} have indicated that if the structures are not properly designed and constructed with required quality may cause great damage to structures. This fact has resulted in to ensure safety against earthquake forces of tall structures hence, there is need to determine seismic responses of such building for designing earthquake resistant structures by carrying seismic analysis of structure. In the present work dynamic analysis of G+ 12 RC multi-storied framed building considering for Koyna and Bhuj earthquake is carried out by response spectrum analysis and time history analysis and responses of such building are comparatively studied {{with the help of}} SAP 2000 software. Two time histories (i. e. koyna and Bhuj) have been used to develop different acceptable criteria (base shear, storey displacement, storey drift). From the results it is recommended that time history analysis should be performed as it predicts the structural response more accurately than the response spectrum analysis. Pushover Analysis is also performed for the same building and from results it is found that building is <b>seismically</b> <b>safe...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Mississippi River Valley, {{is hardly}} {{known as an}} {{earthquake}} zone, but {{may in fact be}} a natural disaster just waiting to happen. Historical records and paleoseismic investigations have shown that large magnitude earthquakes have occurred in the area and there are constantly microquakes all along the New Madrid Fault System. The inhabitants of the Midwest are living in a death trap so long society doesn’t preoperly prepare for earthquakes. The study presented here aims to prove that, as predicting earthquakes is difficult to the point of impossible, the only serious alternative is to reinforce existing buildings and infrastructure and make sure all new developments are <b>seismically</b> <b>safe.</b> The conclusion reached is, that although expensive, building earthquake safe and retrofitting existing buildings, is for the high risk areas by far cheaper than doing nothing when, not if, a new large magnitude earthquake occurs. For a city in the high risk area, the cost of retrofitting the current structures was 13 billion dollar to be compared with the 100 billion dollars in lost lives and properties of a worst case scenario...|$|E

40|$|Bridges {{affected}} by the Northridge earthquake were examined to evaluate the performance of Caltrans bridges, retrofit and peer review programs, and technical procedures. All structures {{in the region of}} strong shaking that had been retrofitted since 1989 performed adequately; if the seven bridges that collapsed had been retrofitted, they would be expected to have survived with little damage. The bridges subjected to strong shaking that had been constructed or retrofitted to current Caltrans criteria had, at most, minor damage; all remained in service. The Seismic Advisory Board concluded that the Caltrans seismic design procedures for new bridges and its retrofit procedures for existing hazardous bridges are technically sound. The Board found that the retrofit program is proceeding fairly well, but that the screening methods used to identify hazardous bridges could be improved as could the pace of retrofitting, particularly toll bridges. There were no construction projects underway in the Spring of 1994 for toll bridges, nor had preparation of retrofit designs begun. Twenty-one findings and seventeen recommendations are presented. Although much has been accomplished, much remains to be done. With some improvements, the Caltrans program should be continued with dispatch and determination. The major foreseeable impediments to a successful program are inadequate or fluctuating funding. The Seismic Advisory Board has confidence that the California highway system is progressing in an orderly fashion to one that is significantly more <b>seismically</b> <b>safe...</b>|$|E
40|$|A Board of Inquiry was {{appointed}} by the Governor of California to investigate the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. The formation of the Board was prompted by earthquake damage to bridges and freeway structures {{and the desire to}} know not only what happened, but how to prevent such destruction in future earthquakes. The Board made fifty-two specific findings and eight recommendations. They identified three essential challenges that must be addressed by the citizens of California, if they expect a future adequately safe from earthquakes: 1) ensure that earthquake risks posed by new construction are acceptable; 2) identify and correct unacceptable seismic safety conditions in existing structures, and; 3) develop and implement actions that foster the rapid, effective, and economic response to and recovery from damaging earthquakes The Loma Prieta earthquake should be considered a clear and powerful warning to the people of California. Although progress has been made {{during the past two decades}} in reducing earthquake risks, much more could have been done, and awaits doing. More aggressive efforts to mitigate the consequences of future, certain earthquakes are needed if their disastrous potential is to be minimized and one of the most fundamental of responsibilities of government is to be fulfilled—to provide for the public safety. The Governor signed an Executive Order implementing the principal recommendations of the Board that may prove to be the most significant step to improve seismic safety within the State taken in the last several decades. It establishes the policy that all state owned and operated structures are to be <b>seismically</b> <b>safe</b> and that important structures are to maintain their function after earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|Confined masonry is a popular, non-engineered {{building}} technique {{used throughout the}} world. It is especially prevalent in Latin America and Asia and is a <b>seismically</b> <b>safe</b> alternative to unreinforced masonry and masonry infilled frames. Despite its wide use relatively {{little research has been}} conducted on these systems especially on large deformation behavior. When available, experimental studies are usually terminated at 80 % post-peak strength. Numerical and analytical efforts either are unable to predict ultimate damage states or they predefine failure modes. Quantification of the ultimate capacity of confined masonry could significantly improve the relevance and applicability of catastrophe models for pre-disaster planning and post-disaster response efforts. Nonetheless, a large research gap exists of how structural features of confined masonry contribute to its seismic performance. Advancements in this area could improve and clarify current design recommendations. In an effort to close the knowledge gap, a detailed numerical model is developed of a traditionally built confined masonry shearwall. A micro modeling approach is taken using the discrete element method, which computes the motion and interactions {{of a large number of}} discrete individual bodies. This approach allows for realistic and detailed joint behavior as well as large deformations. The model successfully captured the initial stiffness, peak strength, and stiffness degradation of an experimentally tested confined masonry wall. Validation of this numerical approach was performed against micro material tests, as well as the in-plane pushover testing of an unreinforced masonry shearwall. Accuracy of the model, however, is limited by the availability of enumerated joint behavior in the shear and normal directions. The confined masonry shearwall model was then adapted to perform a parametric numerical investigation of geometric and material aspects on seismic performance. Preliminary results suggest that the relative stiffness of the masonry panel to the reinforced concrete frame is of primary importance to lateral capacit...|$|E
40|$|Soil-based radon {{investigations}} are {{of value in}} correlating radon production and its transportation into buildings through the processes of convection and diffusion. Such studies can help in identifying land areas that pose special concerns. We present preliminary results of soil radon gas measurements at 60 different locations {{in an attempt to}} map out the geohazard zone of the city of Muzaffarabad. The seismic geohazard microzonation for the area includes five microzones based on different hazard parameters: a very high hazard zone, a high hazard zone, a moderate hazard zone, a low hazard zone, and a safe zone. Measurements were taken with an active radon monitoring system at the depths of 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm below the ground surface. The results obtained were explained by the lithology of the area. Average soil radon gas concentrations were correlated with the depth from the ground surface and indoor radon values for the study area. No significant correlation was found between soil radon gas and meteorological parameters, however soil radon gas increases as the depth {{from the surface of the}} ground grows. The results showed a linear relation between soil radon concentrations with depth from ground surface (R 2 = 0. 9577). The minimum soil radon concentration (68. 5 Bq/m 3) was found at a depth of 30 cm in the very high hazard zone, the maximum value (53. 300 Bq/m 3) at a depth of 60 cm in the <b>seismically</b> <b>safe</b> zone. Measured soil gas radon concentrations at depths of 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm were mapped for high, moderate, and low radon concentrations. Elevated soil radon gas concentrations were found in the safe zone, otherwise considered to be suitable for any type of construction...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} three decades, the Laboratory has been {{proactive}} in providing a <b>seismically</b> <b>safe</b> working environment for its employees and the general public. Completed seismic upgrades during this period have exceeded $ 30 M with over 24 buildings structurally upgraded. Nevertheless, seismic questions still frequently arise regarding the safety of existing buildings. To address these issues, a comprehensive study was undertaken to develop an improved understanding of the seismic integrity of the Laboratory's entire building inventory at the Livermore Main Site and Site 300. The completed study of February 2005 extended {{the results from the}} 1998 seismic safety study per Presidential Executive Order 12941, which required each federal agency to develop an inventory of its buildings and to estimate the cost of mitigating unacceptable seismic risks. Degenkolb Engineers, who performed the first study, was recontracted to perform structural evaluations, rank order the buildings based on their level of seismic deficiencies, and to develop conceptual rehabilitation schemes for the most seriously deficient buildings. Their evaluation is based on screening procedures and guidelines as established by the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC). Currently, there is an inventory of 635 buildings in the Laboratory's Facility Information Management System's (FIMS's) database, out of which 58 buildings were identified by Degenkolb Engineers that require seismic rehabilitation. The remaining 577 buildings were judged to be adequate from a seismic safety viewpoint. The basis for these evaluations followed the seismic safety performance objectives of DOE standard (DOE STD 1020) Performance Category 1 (PC 1). The 58 buildings were ranked according to three risk-based priority classifications (A, B, and C) as shown in Figure 1 - 1 (all 58 buildings have structural deficiencies). Table 1 - 1 provides a brief description of their expected performance and damage state following a major earthquake, rating the seismic vulnerability (1 - 10) where the number 10 represents the highest and worst. Buildings in classifications A and B were judged to require the Laboratory's highest attention towards rehabilitation, classification C buildings could defer rehabilitation until a major remodel is undertaken. Strengthening schemes were developed by Degenkolb Engineers for the most seriously deficient A and B classifications (15 total), which the Laboratory's Plant Engineering Department used as its basis for rehabilitation construction cost estimates. A detailed evaluation of Building 2580, a strengthening scheme, and a construction cost estimate are pending. Specific details of the total estimated rehabilitation costs, a proposed 10 -year seismic rehabilitation plan, exemption categories by building, DOE performance guidelines, cost comparisons for rehabilitation, and LLNL reports by Degenkolb Engineers are provided in Appendix A. Based on the results of Degenkolb Engineers evaluations, along with the prevailing practice for the disposition of seismically deficient buildings and risk-based evaluations, it is concluded that {{there is no need to}} evacuate occupants from these 58 buildings prior to their rehabilitation...|$|E
