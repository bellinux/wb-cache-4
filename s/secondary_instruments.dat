50|$|Radar {{operators}} in light anti-aircraft batteries {{close to the}} front line found {{they were able to}} track mortar bombs. This was likely helped by the fins of the bomb producing a partial corner cube that strongly reflected the signal. These accidental intercepts led to their dedicated use in this role, with special <b>secondary</b> <b>instruments</b> if necessary, and development of radars designed for mortar locating. Dedicated mortar-locating radars were common starting in the 1960s and were used until around 2000.|$|E

His first formal study on clarinet and sax was with Joe Allard, a prominent New York teacher. Later Levinsky attended the Music Conservatory at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pennsylvania where he majored in clarinet. He was an 'A' student and the college woodwind instructor, Frank Stachow, once said to him: [...] "You're the most talented musician that ever came to this school."

50|$|The Blenheim {{typically}} {{carried a}} crew of three - pilot, navigator/bombardier and wireless (radio) operator/air gunner. The pilot's quarters {{on the left side}} of the nose were so cramped that the control yoke obscured all flight instruments while engine instruments eliminated the forward view on landings. Most <b>secondary</b> <b>instruments</b> were arranged along the left side of the cockpit, essential items such as the propeller pitch control were actually placed behind the pilot where they had to be operated by feel alone. The navigator/bombardier was seated alongside the pilot, and made use of a sliding/folding seat whilst performing the bomb aiming role. Dual flight controls could be installed. The wireless operator/air gunner was housed aft of the wing alongside the aircraft's dorsal gun turret.|$|E
5000|$|The PTO {{performed}} {{primarily on}} toy pianos and reed organs, although they also played their own <b>secondary</b> <b>instruments</b> (White on tuba and trombone, Hobbs on bassoon and percussion, Hill on clarinet and Shrapnel on oboe). The members met each weekend to rehearse, bringing new pieces {{with them to}} rehearse. The music mostly reflected the composers' interests in early British experimental repetitive compositional methods, {{which led to the}} strict numerical processes called systems music. White had developed music of random processes known as 'Machines'; Hill specialised in music based on English change-ringing systems. Hobbs {{is best known for his}} readymades, either of found material or of found systems. Shrapnel's music displays an interest in Victorian salon music models and well as numerical processes.|$|E

On a tour of Norway with the Scratch Orchestra in 1973, however, political divisions between members Hill and Shrapnel, who wanted a more political content in PTO music (the Scratch Orchestra at this time had a strong Maoist philosophy among many of its core members), and Hobbs and White, who wanted to maintain the group as it had been. Hobbs and White began the Hobbs-White Duo that year, playing duo piano works, strict percussion systems, and music for their <b>secondary</b> <b>instruments.</b> Shrapnel became a central member in People's Liberation Music, a popular-music ensemble that included Laurie Baker and Cornelius Cardew. The PTO reformed {{for a day of}} concerts at the Conway Hall, London, in 2001, in remembrance of the twentieth anniversary of Cardew's death. They played Cardew's early experimental work Octet '61 for Jasper Johns. This piece has one event 'where something happens' notated with an arrow. The PTO chose to charge their glasses with red wine and toast 'to Cornelius'.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{blending}} variable amounts of a secondary tone with a primary tone {{by means of}} interpolating between their corresponding harmonic amplitudes was investigated. Original tones(bassoon,clarinet,flute,horn,oboe,altosaxophone,trumpet, and violin) were normalized with respect to fundamental frequency, duration, attack and decay times, and loudness; also, harmonic frequencies were flattened. However, the basic time variations of the tones' harmonic amplitudes were preserved. Interpolation was accomplished in the frequency domain using interpolation levels between 5 and 50 %. While the effect of perturbation is highly dependent on the primary/secondary instrument pair, {{results show that the}} effect of a secondary instrument is heard most easily for primary instruments horn and bassoon and least easily for primary instruments trumpet and saxophone. On the other hand, clarinet and trumpet are heard most easily as <b>secondary</b> <b>instruments,</b> whereas bassoon and violin are slow to be heard. Discrimination scores were correlated with different spectrotemporal measures of the tone spectra: spectral incoherence, normalized spectral centroid deviation, and spectral irregularity. The only significant effect found was that primary instruments with high spectral incoherence tend to mitigate against perturbation by <b>secondary</b> <b>instruments.</b> [Work supported by Research Grants Council Grants 613806 and 613508. ...|$|E

These modifications involve: improving the zeroing circuit to achieve an acceptable range of auto-zeroing and enhance the debugging efficiency; altering the true and false load method to achieve a differential calculation in a real sense; and changing the instrument structure to realize the integrated design and solve the problem of common-mode interference in the transmission of original signals. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{central bank}} will usually be {{primarily}} concerned about three aspects of stability. These are the maintenance of:- (1) domestic price stability, (2) external {{stability of the}} value of the currency, and (3) overall systemic stability in the financial system. These three objectives are not, of course, independent. For example, failure to achieve (1) or (3) will adversely affect the other two objectives. Again domestic price stability (1) may, under certain regimes, be a desired by-product of pegging, linking, or fixing the currency to another currency, or basket of currencies. With only one main instrument, the short-term interest rate, a central bank can focus primarily either on the domestic, or the external, stability of the currency, but not on both simultaneously. We shall discuss later whether there may be other, <b>secondary,</b> <b>instruments</b> that a central bank can also deploy. Nevertheless we shall consider these three functions of central banks in turn and separately. We shall report the remarkable degree of consensus about the way in which a central bank can and should pursue domestic price stability; the greater degree of uncertainty about whether, and how, external stability of exchange rates can also be attained; and finally the many differences of view about the appropriate ambit for a central bank to achieve systemic financial stability. ���...|$|E
