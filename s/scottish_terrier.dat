5|$|The <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> {{typically}} has a hard, wiry outer {{coat with}} a soft, dense undercoat. The coat should be trimmed and blended into the furnishings {{to give a}} distinct <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.|$|E
5|$|The Scottie is also {{renowned for}} being {{featured}} in the popular board game, Monopoly, as a player token. When the game was first created in the 1930s, Scotties {{were one of the}} most popular pets in the United States, and it is also {{one of the most popular}} Monopoly game tokens, according to Matt Collins, vice president of marketing for Hasbro. In Disney's 1955 film Lady and the Tramp, a <b>Scottish</b> <b>terrier</b> named Jock is the friend of Lady, the American Cocker Spaniel. A <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> named Dulcinea is a scene-stealer in the 1998 Latin American novel Yo-Yo Boing! by Giannina Braschi.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} {{a cross between}} a Beagle and a <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{origin of}} a breed {{as old as}} the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> is obscure and undocumented. The first written records about a dog of similar {{description}} to the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> dates from 1436, when Don Leslie described them in his book The History of Scotland 1436–1561. Two hundred years later, Sir Joshua Reynolds painted a portrait of a young girl caressing a dog similar in appearance to the modern-day Scottie. King James VI of Scotland was an important historical figure featuring in the Scottish Terrier's history. In the 17th century, when King James VI became James I of England, he sent six terriers—thought to be forerunners of the Scottish terrier—to a French monarch as a gift. His love and adoration for the breed increased their popularity throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Type I is more {{widespread}} in Doberman Pinscher, but is as {{common in the}} Shetland Sheepdog as the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier.</b> The condition appears in most breeds to some extent, but other breeds with an increased risk include the Golden Retriever, German Shepherd Dog, Basset Hound and Manchester Terrier.|$|E
5|$|Other {{famous people}} who {{are known to have}} owned Scotties include: Queen Victoria, Eva Braun, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Ed Whitfield, Rudyard Kipling and President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski.

5|$|Other related breeds {{included}} George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers. This {{breed of}} small white <b>Scottish</b> <b>terriers</b> was given its modern {{name for the}} first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time.|$|R
50|$|The breed's origin is not known. It is {{believed}} to have descended from the black and tan terrier-type dogs of Britain and Ireland, just like the Kerry Blue and Irish Soft-haired Wheaten Terriers in Ireland or the Welsh, Lakeland and <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terriers</b> in Great Britain. There is also conjecture that the breed may share bloodlines with the Irish Wolfhound.|$|R
5|$|Braun {{was very}} fond of Negus and Stasi, her two <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> dogs, and they appear in her home movies. She usually kept them away from Hitler's German Shepherd, Blondi. Blondi was killed {{by one of the}} entourage on 29 April 1945 when Hitler ordered that one of the cyanide {{capsules}} obtained for Braun and Hitler's suicide the next day be tested on the dog. Braun's dogs and Blondi's puppies were shot on 30 April by Hitler's dog handler, Fritz Tornow.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E
5|$|Scottish white terriers were {{recorded}} {{as early as}} {{during the reign of}} James VI of Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen terriers be procured from Argyll to be presented to the Kingdom of France as a gift. Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak. At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> and the Cairn Terrier breeds.|$|E

5|$|Von Willebrand's {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} bleeding disorder found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by a}} lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition with Type I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I von Willebrand's disease is relatively common in the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Scottie and the German Shepherd are {{the only}} breeds of dog that {{have lived in the}} White House more than three times. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was renowned for owning a Scottie named Fala, a gift from his distant cousin, Margaret Suckley. The President loved Fala so much that he rarely went {{anywhere}} without him. Roosevelt had several Scotties before Fala, including one named Duffy and another named Mr. Duffy. Eleanor Roosevelt had a <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terrier</b> named Meggie when the family entered the White House in 1933. More recently, President George W. Bush has owned two black Scottish Terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley. Barney starred in nine films produced by the White House.|$|E

5000|$|A histiocytoma {{in the dog}} is {{a benign}} tumor. It is an {{abnormal}} growth in the skin of histiocytes (histiocytosis), a cell {{that is part of}} the immune system. A similar disease in humans, Hashimoto-Pritzker disease, is also a Langerhans cell histiocytosis. [...] Dog breeds that may be more at risk for this tumor include Bulldogs, American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire <b>Terriers,</b> <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terriers,</b> Greyhounds, Boxers, and Boston Terriers. They also rarely occur in goats and cattle.|$|R
5|$|<b>Scottish</b> <b>Terriers</b> have {{a greater}} chance of {{developing}} some cancers than other purebreds.

500|$|Scotties are territorial, alert, quick {{moving and}} feisty, {{perhaps even more}} so than other terrier breeds. The breed is known to be {{independent}} and self-assured, playful, intelligent and has been nicknamed the 'Diehard' because of its rugged nature and endless determination. The [...] "Diehard" [...] nickname was originally given to it in the 19th century by George, the fourth Earl of Dumbarton. The Earl had a famous pack of <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terriers,</b> so brave that they were named “Diehards”. They were supposed to have inspired the name of his Regiment, The Royal Scots, [...] "Dumbarton’s Diehards".|$|R
500|$|Research has {{suggested}} that <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terriers</b> are 20 {{times more likely to}} get bladder cancer than other breeds and the most common kind of bladder cancer is transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCC). Dr. Deborah Knapp of Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine has commented [...] "TCC usually occurs in older dogs (average age 11 years) and is more common in females (2:1 ratio of females to males)." [...] Symptoms of TCC are blood in the urine, straining to urinate, and frequent urination—although owners noticing any of these symptoms should also be aware that the same symptoms may also be indicative of a urinary tract infection.|$|R
5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and <b>Scottish</b> <b>Terriers</b> failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|R
