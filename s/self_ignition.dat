In this study, the modified concept of Equivalent Oxidation Exposure-time (EOE-Moisture time) has been presented for row-rank coals. The equations for the EOE-Moisture time have been formulated by considering moisture content and oxidation capacity in low temperature range to predict the heat generating rate as functions of coal moisture saturation and oxygen concentration in the pile. Numerical simulations were carried out by applying the EOE-Moisture time on self-heating of low rank coal by changing the coal stockpile size. It has been shown based on the numerical simulations that the temperature rising rate of the pile is increased with lower initial moisture saturation of low rank coal.

At given values of the signals and their estimates it is also possible to determine values of residues which may indicate a type of failure. Available tool programs aimed at analysis of experimental data commonly make use of multiple regression model which allows to investigate effects and interaction between model input quantities and one output variable. Application of multi-equation models provides great freedom during analysis of measurement data as it makes it possible to simultaneously analyze effects and interaction of many output variables. It may be also implemented as a tool for preparation of experimental material for other advanced diagnostic tools such as neural networks which, in contrast to multi-equation models, make it possible to recognize a state at multistate classification and - in consequence - to do diagnostic inference.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{analysis of}} possible use of alcohols for the feeding of <b>self</b> - <b>ignition</b> and spark-ignition engines {{operating in a}} dual- fuel mode, i. e. simultaneously combusting alcohol and diesel oil or alcohol and petrol. Issues associated with the requirements for application of bio-fuels were presented with taking into account National Index Targets, bio-ethanol production methods and dynamics of its production worldwide and in Poland. Te considerations are illustrated by results of the tests on spark- ignition and self- ignition engines fed with two fuels: petrol and methanol or diesel oil and methanol, respectively. Te tests were carried out on a 1100 MPI Fiat four- cylinder engine with multi-point injection and a prototype collector fitted with additional injectors in each cylinder. Te other tested engine was a SW 680 six- cylinder direct- injection diesel engine. Influence of a methanol addition on basic operational parameters of the engines and exhaust gas toxicity were analyzed. Te tests showed a favourable influence of methanol on combustion process of traditional fuels and on some operational parameters of engines. An addition of methanol resulted in a distinct rise of total efficiency of both types of engines at maintained output parameters (maximum power and torque). In {{the same time a}} radical drop in content of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides in exhaust gas was observed at high shares of methanol in feeding dose of ZI (petrol) engine, and 2 - 3 fold lower smokiness in case of ZS (diesel) engine. Among unfavourable phenomena, a rather insignificant rise of CO and NOx content for ZI engine, and THC and NOx - for ZS engine, should be numbered. It requires to carry out further research on optimum control parameters of the engines.

50|$|The {{tendency}} for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early {{is limited by}} the chemical composition of the fuel. There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines. The fuel is altered to change its <b>self</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature. There are several ways to do this. As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre-ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition. The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline, which increases the efficiency of the compression engine. Higher Compression ratios also mean that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater (which is called the Expansion ratio).|$|E

50|$|Laser {{ignition}} is {{an alternative}} method for igniting mixtures of fuel and oxidiser. The phase of the mixture can be gaseous or liquid. The method {{is based on a}} laser ignition devices that produce short but powerful flashes regardless of the pressure in the combustion chamber. Usually, high voltage spark plugs are good enough for automotive use, as the typical compression ratio of an otto cycle internal combustion engine is around 10:1 and in some rare cases reach 14:1. However, fuels such as natural gas or methanol can withstand high compression without <b>self</b> <b>ignition.</b> This allows higher compression ratios, because it is economically reasonable, as the fuel efficiency of such engines is high. Using high compression ratio and high pressure requires special spark plugs that are expensive and their electrodes still wear out. Thus, even expensive laser ignition systems could be economical, because they would last longer.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work a novel method {{of a global}} {{analysis}} of detailed and skeletal chemical kinetics mechanisms is discussed. The method {{is applied to the}} analysis and reduction of detailed model of the <b>self</b> <b>ignition</b> phenomena. It is well known, that most methods (sensitivity analysis, CSP, ILDM etc.) of the chemical kinetic model analysis although they are widely used and produce quite good results have a local character, i. e. most of the existing methods are based on the analysis of the system Jacobian. Therefore, they are limited in the applications and interpretation of results to a neighbourhood of a particular system state. Questions of how the system dynamics can be decomposed and what is a global hierarchy of the system are still open. In the current work, the gap between a local and global analysis is narrowed by considering the so-called global linearization procedure that allows describing explicitly the decomposition into fast and slow motions that present in the combustion system. The introduced method addresses issues of global analysis and is implemented within a code for the standard ILDMs method.

Four different contents (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % w/w) of NaHCO 3 have been tested on Pinus brutia, Laurus nobilis and Nerium oleander; forest species commonly dispersed in the Mediterranean region. Pyrolysis experiments have been conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) employing nitrogen (N- 2) flow of 50 ml/min, under a heating rate of 10 degrees C/min. Experiments for flaming combustion have been conducted in a specially designed furnace, isothermally controlled. under an air flow supply of 1. 51 min(- 1); key parameters including time to <b>self</b> <b>ignition</b> and duration of flame Combustion were measured.

The influence of individual properties of fuels on the combustion needs to be comprehensively approached, taking into account mutual relationships between individual characteristics of diesel oil.

The research is based on various tests aimed at verifying relevant operative characteristics of the fuel: spray analyses, engine tests, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), single-drop reactor tests and corrosion tests. The spray analyses show that the achievement of a satisfactory atomisation with flash-pyrolysis oil is problematic. The engine experimentation shows that flash-pyrolysis oil needs to be modified or mixed (e. g. with alcohol) to make <b>self</b> <b>ignition</b> possible. Besides, unacceptable build-up of carbonaceous deposits, injection system clamping and engine seizure occur. Very large char generation is the main finding of the tests in the TGA apparatus and in the single-drop atmospheric reactor (“drop-tube”).

40|$|Propellants {{based on}} {{cross-linked}} Hydroxy Terminated PolyEther (HTPE) binders {{are being used}} as alternatives to Hydroxy Terminated PolyButadiene (HTPB) compositions. HTPE propellants have similar mechanical properties to HTPB propellants but they give a less severe response in ‘slow cook-off’ tests for IM compliance. A literature review is presented on the development and properties of HTPE propellants {{in an attempt to}} place them in relation to recent trends in Insensitive Munitions. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the behaviour of HTPE propellants an HTPE pre-polymer and a range of binder network samples with different NCO/OH equivalence ratios, with and without plasticizer, have been synthesised and characterised by a range of techniques. The thermal decomposition of the HTPE binder network and propellant samples were also studied. Desmodur N- 3200 was used as a curing agent and n-BuNENA as an energetic plasticizer. Similar analyses were performed on analogous HTPB pre-polymer and binder network samples and the results were compared with those obtained for the corresponding HTPE samples. Two kinds of HTPE propellant were manufactured containing HTPE pre-polymer, n-BuNENA, 2 NDPA and either AP or AP+PSAN as oxidiser. Also HTPB propellant was prepared. Small cook-off test vehicles (SCTV) were filled with HTPE and HTPB propellants and slow cook-off tests were performed. In contrast to HTPB binders, which become harder during slow heating, it was found that the HTPE binders soften under the same conditions. This behaviour is possibly due to chain scission of the soft and hard segments of the HTPE polymer matrix. Thermooxidative processes and reactions of the energetic plasticizer decomposition products are believed to be the responsible for the scission of the polymeric matrix. From the binder characterisation and slow cook-off results it is concluded that there is a relation between the degree of polymeric matrix scission during slow heating and the violence of the response at the point of <b>self</b> <b>ignition.</b> This underlies the main difference between HTPB and HTPE propellants in slow cook-off.

The exhaust emission characteristics show the low NOx performance and high combustion stability in case of a suitable fuel injection position， but, when fuel injected from an inadequate position, unburned fuel and carbon monoxide are emitted in the exhaust combustion gas. Measurements on the air velocity near the upstream end of the combustor at a cold state indicates that a high speed and turbulent shear flow region exists near the liner wall and the fuel injected into the shear air flow is expected to be rapidly mixed with air.

The tests were performed using a new method, based on a specifically designed apparatus for monitoring the forest species temperature, under precisely controlled temperature and static air atmosphere conditions. The relative ignition and smoldering combustion properties determined were: the relative <b>self</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature, the combustion duration, and the heat content of forest samples. The key elements for the effectiveness of fire retardants were the delay of ignition and the reduction of heat and combustion rate. Both retardants {{were found to be}} efficient on different flammability properties during the smoldering combustion of the forest species examined. © 2006 IEEE...|$|E
