5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial <b>Society</b> <b>and</b> <b>Its</b> Future, Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber. David was at first dismissive, but began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to that found in Industrial <b>Society</b> <b>and</b> <b>Its</b> Future.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Vladimir Lenin in January 1924, {{there was a brief}} power {{struggle}} in the Soviet Union, from which Joseph Stalin rose to take the reins of power. Armenian <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> economy were changed by Stalin and his fellow Moscow policymakers. In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved under Stalin's orders and the socialist republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead. For the Armenian people, conditions grew worse under Stalin's rule. In a period of twenty-five years, Armenia was industrialized and educated under strictly prescribed conditions, and nationalism was harshly suppressed.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd centuryBC, Roman {{territory}} saw {{an overall}} decline in population, partially {{due to the}} huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the proletarii. As a result, both the Roman <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of}} the state, since many of the soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished proletarii in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.|$|E

5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an unkempt state. A search of his cabin {{revealed}} a cache of bomb components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of the Unabomber crimes and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found {{what appeared to be}} the original typed manuscript of Industrial <b>Society</b> <b>and</b> <b>Its</b> Future. By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history.|$|E
5|$|In 1908 Prus serialized, in the Warsaw Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly), {{his novel}} Dzieci (Children), {{depicting}} the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists {{of the day}} — an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, Przemiany (Changes), was to have been, like The Doll, a panorama of <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> vital concerns. However, in 1911-12 the novel had barely begun serialization in the Illustrated Weekly when its composition was cut short by Prus' death.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intense single character focus of his first novel, ¡Ecue-Yamba-O!

There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds to the key blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Little Annie Fanny is a comics {{series by}} Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder. It {{appeared}} in 107 two- to seven-page episodes in Playboy magazine from October 1962 to September 1988. Little Annie Fanny is a humorous satire of contemporary American <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> sexual mores. Annie Fanny, the title character, is a statuesque, buxom young blonde woman who innocently finds herself nude in every episode. The series is notable for its painted, luminous color artwork and {{for being the}} first full-scale, multi-page comics feature in a major American publication.|$|E
5|$|The 13th century brought {{fundamental}} {{changes to the}} structure of Polish <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> political system. Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western Farther Pomerania broke its political ties with Poland {{in the second half of}} the 12th century and from 1231 became a fief of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the Sławno and Słupsk areas. Pomerelia or Gdańsk Pomerania became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, Bolesław II the Bald granted Lubusz Land to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the Neumark and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, Leszek the White was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the Halych area of Rus', a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.|$|E
5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} of {{remarkable}} creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement {{of the nature of}} human <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E

5|$|The Philaletheis Society (often {{shortened}} to Philaletheis or just Phil {{and founded}} as The Philalethean Society) {{is a student}} theatre group at Vassar College {{in the town of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, and the school's oldest student organization. Founded in December 1865, Phil began as a college literary <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> first leader was college president John Howard Raymond. Control of the organization was swiftly handed to the students and the group split into three chapters, each with a distinct focus. The group maintained its literary focus until the 1890s, by which point dramatic productions had taken over in popularity. The tradition of producing four and later three plays per year continued into the mid-twentieth century, but in 1958, the organization disbanded due to lack of interest. It was revived in 1975, first as an arm of student government and then as an independent student organization.|$|E
25|$|In {{its most}} general {{context of the}} study of morality, ethics, {{religion}} and philosophy, the good often refers to and denotes that conduct which is to be preferred and prescribed by <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> social constituents as beneficial and useful to the social needs of <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> preferred conventions. The specific meaning and etiology of the meaning and use of the 'good' and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages has varied substantially in its inflected meaning depending of circumstances of place, history, religious context and philosophical context.|$|E
