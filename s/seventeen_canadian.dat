40|$|Objective: To {{perform an}} {{environmental}} scan of health informatics teaching practices in Canadian med-ical schools {{as part of}} a quality improvement initiative at Dalhousie University’s Faculty of Medicine. Methodology: We contacted undergraduate medical education staff at all <b>seventeen</b> <b>Canadian</b> medical schools and, via e-mail, asked open-ended questions about informatics content in the curriculum, timing of content delivery, teaching methodologies and informatics faculty. Results: Sixteen of seven-teen medical schools answered our queries. Each school identified curricular content on information literacy and evaluation of evidence but identified no formal core curriculum in health informatics. Conclusions: As of 2009, health informatics had not yet penetrated formal undergraduate medical curricula in Canada. Efforts to introduce health informatics initiatives should take into account the lack of understanding of the discipline of health informatics by educators and the densely packed nature of medical curricula. A new Canadian project, involving the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada and Canada Health Infoway, offers promise for building new health informatics curricula within undergraduate medical education...|$|E
40|$|Four {{hundred and}} <b>seventeen</b> <b>Canadian</b> veterinarians were {{surveyed}} {{to determine their}} postoperative use of analgesics in dogs and cats following 6 surgical procedures, and to determine their opinions toward pain perception and perceived complications associated with the postoperative use of potent opioid analgesics. Three hundred and seventeen (76 %) returned the questionnaire. The percentage of animals receiving analgesics postoperatively ranged from 84 % of dogs and 70 % of cats following orthopedic surgery to 10 % of dogs and 9 % of cats following castration. In general, {{with the exception of}} orthopedic surgery, roughly equal percentages of dogs and cats received postoperative analgesics. Opioids were used almost exclusively to provide postoperative analgesia, with butorphanol the most commonly administered drug to both dogs and cats. Analgesics were usually administered either once or twice postoperatively. With regard to the administration of potent opioid agonists, the 3 major concerns included respiratory depression, bradycardia, and sedation in dogs, and excitement, respiratory depression, and bradycardia in cats. Seventy-seven percent of veterinarians considered their knowledge of issues related to the recognition and control of postoperative pain to be inadequate. Experience in practice is currently the major source of knowledge, with undergraduate veterinary school and research articles in journals ranked as the least important sources. Lectures or seminars delivered at the regional level were the preferred format for continuing education.

40|$|Four {{hundred and}} <b>seventeen</b> <b>Canadian</b> veterinarians were {{surveyed}} {{to determine their}} postoperative use of analgesics in dogs and cats following 6 categories of surgeries, and their opinion toward pain perception and perceived complications associated with the postoperative use of potent opioid analgesics. Three hundred and seventeen (76 %) returned the questionnaire. An analgesic user {{was defined as a}} veterinarian who administers analgesics to at least 50 % of dogs or 50 % of cats following abdominal surgery, excluding ovariohysterectomy. The veterinarians responding exhibited a bimodal distribution of analgesic use, with 49. 5 % being defined as analgesic users. These veterinarians tended to use analgesics in 100 % of animals following abdominal surgery. Veterinarians defined as analgesic nonusers rarely used postoperative analgesics following any abdominal surgery. Pain perception was defined as the average of pain rankings (on a scale of 1 to 10) following abdominal surgery, or the value for dogs or cats if the veterinarian worked with only 1 of the 2 species. Maximum concern about the risks associated with the postoperative use of potent opioid agonists was defined as the highest ranking assigned to any of the 7 risks evaluated in either dogs or cats. Logistic regression analysis identified the pain perception score and the maximum concern regarding the use of potent opioid agonists in the postoperative period as the 2 factors that distinguished analgesic users from analgesic nonusers. This model correctly classified 68 % of veterinarians as analgesic users or nonusers. Linear regression analysis identified gender and the presence of an animal health technologist in the practice as the 2 factors that influenced pain perception by veterinarians. Linear regression analysis identified working with an animal health technologist, graduation within the past 10 years, and attendance at continuing education as factors that influenced maximum concern about the postoperative use of opioid agonists.
