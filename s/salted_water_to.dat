25|$|Bazin is {{a common}} Libyan food made with wheat flour and a little plain flour, which is boiled in <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> make a hard dough, and then formed into a rounded, smooth dome placed {{in the middle of}} the dish. The sauce around the dough is made by frying chopped onions with lamb meat, turmeric, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, fenugreek, sweet paprika, and tomato paste. Potatoes can also be added. Finally, eggs are boiled and {{arranged}} around the dome. The dish is then served with lemon and fresh or pickled chili peppers, known as amsyar. Batata mubattana (filled potato) is another popular dish that consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.|$|E

50|$|The raw flesh can {{be served}} in fruit salads, or with wine, sugar or cream, {{especially}} in Jamaica. In the Bahamas, the flesh is first put in <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> remove its bitterness, before cooking it with much sugar to make a sort of jam. The flesh can also be consumed stewed.|$|E

50|$|Pink Lake {{is named}} after a family of Irish {{settlers}} who in 1826 cleared a farm in the area. It used <b>to</b> be a <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> lake {{as a part of}} the oceans. It took over 3000 years for the lake <b>to</b> turn from <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> fresh <b>water</b> (generally a lake of this size shouldn't take over a few decades) and as a result some of the <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> fishes adapted <b>to</b> fresh <b>water.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Alteration {{of water}} flow. Drainage canals and {{especially}} the deepening of the Hackensack River for navigation have allowed <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> enter the original fresh water and brackish water areas, altering the ecology and destroying the estuarine environment.|$|R
25|$|Milk {{was usually}} {{reserved}} for pregnant women or the sick. Almond milk was often used as a substitute. Labneh or sour milk was sometimes purchased from Arab peasants. Sephardim kept soft cheese in tins of <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> preserve it.|$|R
25|$|Most {{sturgeon}} spawn {{in fresh}} <b>water</b> and migrate <b>to</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> mature. The Chinese sturgeon {{can be considered}} a large freshwater fish, although it spends part of its lifecycle in seawater, like the salmon, except Chinese sturgeon spawn multiple times throughout their lives.|$|R
50|$|During both World Wars {{the marsh}} {{was used as}} allotments, however with {{increasing}} prosperity these fell idle and in the 1950s the area was used as pasture. The water control systems were also neglected, allowing <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> flow back into the system.|$|R
50|$|The name Breakwater {{originated}} from a rock ford constructed across the Barwon River by Geelong's first Police magistrate, Captain Foster Fyans, in 1837.

5000|$|... 1) Eggs require pure <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> mature. 2) Larvae hatch {{from the}} eggs in {{brackish}} waters. 3) The larvae gradually move from brackish <b>water</b> <b>to</b> fresh <b>water.</b> 4) The {{final stage of}} the larvae is the megalopa, which is 3-4mm in length. 5) The megalopa then develop into small mitten crabs in the freshwater.|$|R
50|$|Migrations {{involves}} the fish {{moving from one}} part of a <b>water</b> body <b>to</b> another on a regular basis. Some particular types of migration are anadromous, in which adult fish live in the sea and migrate into fresh <b>water</b> <b>to</b> spawn, and catadromous, in which adult fish live in fresh water and migrate into <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> spawn.|$|R
50|$|Building {{started in}} 1957 and was {{finished}} in 1971. Instead of damming the estuary {{it was decided}} to build sluices {{in order to be able}} <b>to</b> let in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> prevent freezing of the rivers Meuse and Rhine and to drain these rivers in case of flood.|$|R
50|$|Health {{professionals}} often {{recommend that}} persons with AD bathe regularly in lukewarm baths, especially in <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> <b>to</b> moisten their skin. Avoiding woollen clothing is usually good {{for those with}} AD. Likewise silk, silver-coated clothing may help. Dilute bleach baths have also been reported effective at managing AD.|$|R
30|$|To measure biomass concentration, 40  mL of sampled cell {{suspension}} was centrifuged at 10, 000  rpm for 15  min. The cell pellets were then washed twice with 1 % (w/v) <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> <b>to</b> avoid osmotic pressure change caused by fresh water. After that, this <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> was added <b>to</b> the cell pellets {{to make a}} final volume of 5  mL, {{and placed in a}} petri dish for drying at 105  °C for 4  h. Then, dry cell weight was calculated by subtracting salt weight from the total dry weight (Chi et al. 2014).|$|R
50|$|The attic floor {{contained}} more staff quarters, general storage areas, and {{the innovative}} cisterns. One smaller cistern supplied hydraulic pressure for the 1895 Otis lift, still functioning {{in the house}} even though the house was wired for electricity in 1933. Two larger cisterns supplied fresh and <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> the many bathrooms in the house.|$|R
50|$|It {{became evident}} that, {{following}} {{the establishment of}} a hydro-electric power industry on the Gordon River, the flows of fresh water into the lake were disturbed and the anoxic salt layer was declining in depth. Previously, low river flows at certain times of the year allowed <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> migrate upriver and occasionally spill into Lake Fidler through a narrow channel joining it to the river, thus recharging the <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> layer.|$|R
50|$|Should the {{sea levels}} rise by 60 m, Walsh is not located close enough <b>to</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> be {{affected}} directly by flooding. However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts {{due to the}} displacement of available fresh water resources {{and would have to}} rely on desalinated <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> already pipe in their water from fresh water sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located {{in the middle of a}} desert.|$|R

50|$|White {{sturgeon}} {{can live}} to be over 100 years old. The rate of growth is dependent on water temperature. Typically, they reach six feet long around 25 years of age, showing that these fish do not grow as quickly as many other fish. They are anadromous, meaning they spawn in fresh <b>water</b> and migrate <b>to</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> mature. Sturgeon may migrate {{in and out of}} <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> many times in their lives. However, since the building of many dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers, the populations above the dams have become landlocked.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} systematic {{exposition of}} {{the different kinds of}} salts, its uses, and the methods of its extraction was published in China around 2700 BCE.

2500|$|Around 6am, {{people on}} the wharf noticed flames {{breaking}} through the ship's upper deck near the engine.

50|$|This elusive fish is {{catadromous}} in nature; it migrates to {{the ocean}} to breed. It swims <b>to</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> spawn from October to December and returns to upstream ponds after. It undergoes upstream migration during December, January, and February, and this coincides with the “ipon-run phenomenon’ wherein different species of fish fry also undergo upstream migration. After the ludong had undergone downstream migration, it can be caught in Cagayan River and tributaries.|$|R
