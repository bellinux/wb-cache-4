40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to revise Document HNF-SD-ENV-EE- 003, ''Permitting Plan for the Immobilized Low-Activity Waste Project, which was submitted on September 4, 1997. That plan accounted for the interim storage and disposal of Immobilized-Low Activity Waste at the existing Grout Treatment Facility Vaults (Project W- 465) and within a newly constructed facility (Project W- 520). Project W- 520 was to have contained a combination of concrete vaults and trenches. This document supersedes that plan because of two subsequent items: (1) A disposal authorization that was received on October 25, 1999, in a U. S. Department of Energy-Headquarters, memorandum, ''Disposal Authorization Statement for the Department of Energy Hanford site Low-Level Waste Disposal facilities'' and (2) ''Breakthrough Initiative Immobilized Low-Activity Waste (ILAW) Disposal Alternative,'' August 1999, from Lucas Incorporated, Richland, Washington. The direction within the U. S. Department of Energy-Headquarters memorandum was given as follows: ''The DOE Radioactive Waste Management Order requires that a Disposal authorization statement be obtained prior to construction of new low-level waste disposal facility. Field elements with the existing low-level waste disposal facilities shall obtain a disposal authorization statement {{in accordance with the}} schedule in the complex-wide Low-Level Waste Management Program Plan. The disposal authorization statement shall be issued based on a review of the facility's performance assessment and composite analysis or appropriate CERCLA documentation. The disposal authorization shall specify the limits and conditions on construction, design, operations, and closure of the low-level waste facility based on these reviews. A disposal authorization statement {{is a part of the}} required radioactive waste management basis for a disposal facility. Failure to obtain a disposal authorization <b>statement</b> <b>or</b> <b>record</b> of decision shall result in shutdown of an operational disposal facility or disapproval to initiate construction of a new facility.

Recalling how his agency's clinics were filled in 1985 with girls wearing clothes that were an imitation of Madonna's style, Moran said that the song's message is [...] "that getting pregnant is cool and having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and don't listen to your parents, the school, anybody who tells you otherwise—don't preach to me, Papa. The reality is that what Madonna is suggesting to teenagers is a path to permanent poverty." ...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} {{physician}} assistant, nurse practitioner, and certified nurse midwifery programs was undertaken {{to identify and}} assess the effectiveness of recruitment, educational, and deployment strategies that programs use to prepare practitioners for medically underserved areas.

A total of 170 {{interviews were conducted with}} faculty, students, graduates, and employers from 9 programs visited on-site and 42 programs surveyed by telephone. All programs had some recruitment and training activities in underserved sites. Only about half of the programs were able to submit data on their graduates' practice settings and specialties. These data suggest that older students who have backgrounds in underserved areas and clearly identified practice goals are more likely to practice in underserved areas. Programs that actively promote service to the underserved do so through publicly stated missions and recruitment and educational strategies that complement these missions. Such programs also are more likely to evaluate and document their success than programs that lack strategies...|$|R

In this case, integrity includes not only the authentication of origin {{and the lack of}} unauthorized changes to a document, but also the acceptance of all parties that the document is complete, signed by all parties, and cannot be modified further. This is especially critical when the document is recorded, so that it is legally the agreement <b>or</b> <b>statement</b> of <b>record,</b> and any copies of the document have no legal force.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pension program design and management do not adequately ensure that only veterans with financial need receive pension benefits. While the pension program is means tested, there is no prohibition on transferring assets prior to applying for benefits. Other means-tested programs, such as Medicaid, conduct a look-back review to determine if an individual has transferred assets at less than fair market value, and if so, may deny benefits {{for a period of}} time, known as the penalty period. This control helps ensure that only those in financial need receive benefits. In contrast, VA pension claimants can transfer assets for less than fair market value immediately prior to applying and be approved for benefits. For example, GAO identified a case where a claimant transferred over a million dollars less than 3 months prior to applying and was granted benefits. Also, VAs process for assessing initial eligibility is inadequate in several key respects. The application form does not ask for some sources of income and assets such as private retirement income, annuities, and trusts. As a result, VA lacks complete information on a claimants financial situation. Also, the form does not ask about asset transfersinformation VA needs to determine whether these assets should be included when assessing eligibility. In addition, VA does not verify all the information it does request on the form. For example, VA does not routinely request supporting documents, such as bank <b>statements</b> <b>or</b> tax <b>records,</b> unless questions are raised. VAs fiduciary program, which appoints individuals to manage the financial affairs of beneficiaries who are unable to do so themselves, collects financial information that may affect some pension recipients eligibility, but VA pension claims processors {{do not have access to}} all this information. Further, guidance on when assets should be included as part of a claimants net worth is unclear; and VA claims processors must use their own discretion when assessing eligibility for benefits, which can lead to inconsistent decisions. ...|$|R
