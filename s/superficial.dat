5|$|Kristen Schaal as Shannon, Jillian's <b>superficial</b> friend.|$|E
5|$|N3 {{contains}} the <b>superficial</b> veins {{also known as}} the saphenous compartment.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic {{dermatitis}} is a chronic, <b>superficial,</b> {{inflammatory disease}} characterized by scaling on an erythematous base.|$|E
5|$|<b>Superficial</b> or surface anatomy is {{important}} as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body. It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. <b>Superficial</b> is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively {{close to the surface}} of the body.|$|E
5|$|Bacterium-related {{cutaneous}} conditions {{often have}} distinct morphologic characteristics {{that may be}} an indication of a generalized systemic process or simply an isolated <b>superficial</b> infection.|$|E
5|$|Being {{protected}} {{between two}} fasciae, the <b>superficial</b> veins belonging to compartment N3 very rarely become sinuous. So {{that when a}} sinuous vein is detected, the sonographer will suspect {{that it is a}} tributary.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{on the way}} to the Quarantine Station in New York, Havana rammed the {{anchored}} Munson Line freighter Cubana {{which was}} hidden from sight behind , also at anchor. Cubana had no damage below the waterline and Havana, laden with inbound New York passengers, suffered only <b>superficial</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as other}} hip hop fashions have been criticized, grills have been denounced by some {{commentators}} as expensive, ostentatious, and <b>superficial</b> displays that strain the finances of poor youth.|$|E
5|$|Mycosis-related {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} caused by fungi or yeasts, and may present as either a <b>superficial</b> or deep infection of the skin, hair, or nails.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from <b>superficial</b> to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to <b>superficial</b> veins.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Fleet Air Arm {{casualties}} during Operation Goodwood were 40 airmen {{killed and}} 17 aircraft destroyed. Nabob was also {{judged to be}} beyond economical repair, and was withdrawn from service. On the German side, Tirpitz suffered only <b>superficial</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|Proportionally, {{the skull}} is much shorter and {{smaller than that}} of Edmontosaurus (formerly Trachodon), Kritosaurus, or Saurolophus, but when {{including}} its crest, its <b>superficial</b> area is almost as large.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{technical}} advancements in transmission tomography {{made possible}} the very good specificity and sensitivity capability of this technique, enabling the possibility of properly seeing the <b>superficial</b> tissues.|$|E
5|$|Subcision {{is useful}} for {{treatment}} of <b>superficial</b> atrophic acne scars and {{involves the use of}} a small needle to loosen the fibrotic adhesions that result in the depressed appearance of the scar.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Polish film Sekret Enigmy (The Enigma Secret) is a {{generally}} fair, if <b>superficial,</b> {{account of the}} Cipher Bureau's story. Twenty-two years later, the 2001 Hollywood film Enigma was criticized for its many historical inaccuracies, including omission of Poland's fundamental work in Enigma decryption.|$|E
5|$|The generic name, Postelsia honors Alexander Philipov Postels, an Estonian-born {{geologist}} {{and artist}} {{who worked with}} Ruprecht, while the specific name, palmaeformis, describes the alga's <b>superficial</b> similarity in appearance to true palms.|$|E
5|$|Trousseau's syndrome, {{in which}} blood clots form spontaneously in the portal blood vessels, the deep veins of the extremities, or the <b>superficial</b> veins {{anywhere}} on the body, {{may be associated with}} pancreatic cancer, and is found in about 10% of cases.|$|E
5|$|An {{inquiry into}} the affair by a senior judge, Lord Denning, {{indicated}} {{that there had been}} no breaches of security arising from the Ivanov connection, although Denning's report was later condemned as <b>superficial</b> and unsatisfactory. Profumo subsequently sought private atonement as a volunteer worker at Toynbee Hall, an East London charitable trust. By 1975 he had been officially rehabilitated, although he did not return to public life. He died in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Australian robins are a {{group of}} small insectivorous birds, whose exact {{position}} in the bird family tree is unclear. Named after a <b>superficial</b> resemblance to the European robin, the males of many species sport bright red or pink on their plumage. Four species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic.|$|E
5|$|Bound {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} film critics who praised the humor {{and style of}} the directors {{as well as the}} realistic portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film found its plot <b>superficial</b> and criticized the violence as excessive. The film won several festival awards.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the <b>superficial</b> skin layers {{are known as}} <b>superficial</b> or first-degree burns. They appear red without {{blisters}} and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of <b>superficial</b> acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30â€“40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white <b>superficial</b> cysts known as milia.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged <b>superficial</b> veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of <b>superficial</b> atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>superficial</b> {{similarities}} in appearance, the cattle egret is {{more closely related}} to the genus Ardea, which comprises the great or typical herons and the great egret (A. alba), than to the majority of species termed egrets in the genus Egretta. Rare cases of hybridization with little blue herons Egretta caerulea, little egrets Egretta garzetta and snowy egrets Egretta thula have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very <b>superficial</b> {{oversight}} and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of <b>superficial</b> and deep reflexes, paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E
5|$|Flexing {{the toes}} and feet and {{extending}} on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux from the deep to the <b>superficial</b> through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E
5|$|HCV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion {{is less than}} one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by <b>superficial</b> contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public {{walks around the}} castle, dug into the surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls and towers were given <b>superficial</b> repairs and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and {{the interior of the}} inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.|$|E
5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for <b>superficial</b> ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.|$|E
5|$|Hoover {{directed}} the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC {{as it was}} established (it {{did not have a}} full-time executive director until 1960). The investigations were largely <b>superficial</b> until 1962, when the FBI learned that one of King's most trusted advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison.|$|E
5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be <b>superficial</b> or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most <b>superficial</b> layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these <b>superficial</b> cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, <b>superficial</b> similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates {{that they were more}} likely to feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{particle}} accelerators generate electron beams {{for treatment of}} <b>superficial</b> tumors in radiation therapy. Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5cm for electron energies in the range 5â€“20MeV. An electron beam {{can be used to}} supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X-rays.|$|E
