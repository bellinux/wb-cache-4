40|$|Evaluation of {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of a fenestration system during the cooling season is based on heat gains by temperature difference and solar radiation, characterised by thermal transmittance (U-value) and <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain coefficient, respectively. While U-value testing and calculation methods have been long established, <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain coefficient has been evaluated only by calculation under {{the lack of any}} established testing method. However, calculation alone cannot yield exact <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain coefficient values for various types of fenestration. To address this problem, this study aims to develop a <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain coefficient apparatus for measuring the energy performance of fenestration in terms of U-value and <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain coefficient, and to evaluate that system. The proposed measurement system can be used in measuring U-values and <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain coefficient values for fenestration with complicated shapes, such as an awning device.

These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s.

The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} the large potential, the market {{development}} of <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> for industrial or commercial applications is rather slow so far. An important barrier for the market development is the large effort {{to carry out a}} feasibility assessment including the pre-dimensioning of a suitable <b>solar</b> process <b>heat</b> system. Especially to facilitate the identification of suitable integration points for <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> in Industry, tools and guidelines are required. To reduce the effort for identification of a suitable integration point within Industry, comprehensive research on the food and beverages sector was performed to highlight the possibilities for integrating <b>solar</b> <b>heat.</b> The analysis shows that the utilized process installations and especially the current equipment for heating are of particular importance for the integration of <b>solar</b> <b>heat.</b> Based on the results of the analysis of several sectors of the food and beverage industry and conventional process heating technologies, a classification for the integration of <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> in industrial processes and heat supply systems was developed. This classification is sector independent and contains concepts for the hydraulic integration of <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> for the majority of all industrial processes and operations. Finally, an approach is presented to simplify the choice of a suitable integration point for <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> in industry. This approach includes the identification and assessment of possible integration points as well as the utilization of the developed classification and other important steps within the feasibility assessment...|$|R

40|$|Physical theory {{predicts that}} animals with fur or feather coats can adjust <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain {{independently}} of surface coloration or environmental factors by altering coat structure or hair optical properties. This hypothesis is tested by examining seasonal {{changes in the}} <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> load transferred to the skin by the pelage of a desert-dwelling mammal, the rock squirrel {Spermophilus variegatus). Although coat colour remains constant, <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain at low wind speeds is about 20 % greater in winter coats than in summer coats. This change is in an apparently adaptive direction and is predicted {{to have a major}} effect on the animal's heat balance in nature. The determinants of these alterations in <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain are explored using an empirically validated biophysical model and are found to result from changes in hair optics and coat structure. These results suggest the existence of a previously unknown mode of long-term thermoregulation that allows adjustment of <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain without affecting the animal's external appearance...|$|R

5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred {{over the course of}} billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E

In July 2005, the Deep Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1. Renamed EPOXI, it made a flyby of Comet Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010.|$|E

40|$|The global {{challenge}} {{of climate change}} is urging for renewable energy sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One of the applications of renewable energy is the <b>solar</b> district <b>heating</b> plant, which uses <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> for space heating on a community scale. Seasonal storage of <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> is crucial in <b>solar</b> district <b>heating</b> plants {{as a solution to}} the mismatch between the energy supply and demand. This is especially important in countries located in high latitudes with high levels of solar insolation and low heating demand in the summer, and low sun insolation and high heating demand in the winter time. This study investigates the selection of the most feasible method for seasonal storage of <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> at high latitudes. The aim is to identify the key aspects of method selection and design of underground <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> storage. Practices of underground thermal energy storage in Finland and other countries with similar ground conditions are reviewed. Five heat storage methods are evaluated based on their efficiency, cost, construction method, and suitability for typical ground conditions in Finland. The available methods of seasonal heat storage are compared, and the most promising method for <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> storage in Finland is proposed. In addition, the potential provided by a combination of two or more methods is examined. The borehole storage method is proposed for storing <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> in Finland. The combined method with a rock pit used for short-term heat storage and boreholes for long term storage is also an attractive and technically feasible option for Finnish ground conditions.

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or <b>solar</b> <b>heating.</b> Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{surfaces}} of cometary nuclei {{have a very}} low albedo, making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0% of the light that falls on it; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent. The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds. <b>Solar</b> <b>heating</b> drives off lighter volatile compounds, leaving behind larger organic compounds that {{tend to be very}} dark, like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces causes them to absorb the heat that drives their outgassing processes.|$|E
5|$|All winds on Venus are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide Hadley cell on Venus is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the Hadley cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar collars exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling. Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and low latitudes. A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist on Venus between 55–60° latitude.|$|E

Speedy results under variable solar angles and degree of irradiance would be welcomed by most. Furthermore, a newly proposed program should utilise the outputs of existing glazing tools and their standard information, {{such as the use}} of U-values and <b>Solar</b> <b>Heat</b> Gain Coefficients (SHGC’s) as generated for numerous glazing configurations by the well-known program WINDOW 6. 0 (LBNL, 2001). The results of this tool provide interior glass surface temperature and transmitted solar radiation which link into comfort analysis inputs required by the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool –V 2 (ASHRAE, 2011). This tool is a simple-to-use calculator providing the total <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain of a glazing system exposed to various angles of solar incidence. Given basic climate (solar) data, as well as the orientation of the glazing under consideration the <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain can be calculated. The calculation incorporates the <b>Solar</b> <b>Heat</b> Gain Coefficient function produced for the glazing system under various angles of solar incidence WINDOW 6. 0 (LBNL, 2001). The significance of this work rests in providing an orientation-based heat transfer calculator through an easy-to-use tool (using Microsoft EXCEL) for user inputs of climate and <b>Solar</b> <b>Heat</b> Gain Coefficient (WINDOW- 6) data. We address the factors to be considered such as solar position and the incident angles to the horizontal and the window surface, and the fact that the <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain coefficient is a function of the angle of incidence. We also discuss the effect of the diffuse components of radiation from the sky and those from ground surface reflection, which require refinement of the calculation methods.
