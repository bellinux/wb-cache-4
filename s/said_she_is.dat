500|$|Rolling Stone {{describes}} Swift as [...] "a songwriting savant with {{an intuitive}} gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".

In The Guardians words, [...] "she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot". Slant Magazine adds, [...] "to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs {{over the course of}} [...] album". Although reviews of Swift's work are [...] "almost uniformly positive", The New Yorker has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> generally portrayed [...] "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".|$|E

Cooper has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> proud of Jacqui's wardrobe {{because it is not}} glam. She brands her as the complete opposite of the [...] "honey image" [...] the serial sometimes becomes associated with.

500|$|Before Diana {{made her}} first appearance, {{she was being}} {{described}} as being a [...] "mega bitch", an [...] "Erinsborough villainess" [...] and a [...] "manipulative businesswoman." [...] Diana is a dangerous femme fatale, who is [...] "beautiful, sexy and strong". TV Soap <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a woman on a mission. Badler described her character's background saying she had a dysfunctional upbringing, which made her strong and a fighter. Diana has had to fight for everything in her life, so she works hard in order to survive. Badler added {{in an interview with}} Network Ten that Diana is highly ambitious and very driven, which makes her kind of like a man. Diana is one of the chiefs of Lassiter's International, but she knows that she will not get {{to the top of the}} company because Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) is the heir to the Robinson fortune.|$|E

500|$|Speaking to the BBC, Finch said Ruth [...] "is strong willed, {{determined}} and pretty direct in her {{approach to life}} and people in general." [...] Finch explained having breast cancer mellowed Ruth and instead of fighting her corner, she is quite likely to negotiate instead. Finch added her character appreciates life day to day. Robert Hanks writing for The Independent described Ruth as The Archers [...] "matriarch-in-waiting" [...] and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a family lynchpin – loyal wife, loving mother, and handy in the milking-shed when called on." [...] Simon Frith and Chris Arnot, authors of The Archers Archives, opined Ruth is not a stereotypical farmer's wife. They said [...] "Ruth {{is more likely to}} have her hand in a rubber glove rather than an oven glove – thrust up the back end of a Friesian rather than delving into an Aga and emerging with something wholesome for supper." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{theme is}} that {{characters}} {{can be a}} mix of good and evil. Holmes has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> fascinated by these [...] "shades of gray" [...] in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over. Another example she gave of {{this is how the}} antagonist Tigerstar, even with all of his faults, is still courageous and fiercely loyal. Similarly, Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil. A third major theme, often referred to as nature versus nurture, explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be, or if other things shape that. For example, Brambleclaw's father is the evil Tigerstar, but he eventually demonstrates that despite this, he is not evil himself, despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father's legacy. This theme ties into the [...] "shades of gray" [...] theme.|$|E
500|$|Lewis {{released}} her third studio album Glassheart on 12 October 2012, {{almost a year}} after the original release date of November 2011. The album had been conceptualised in July 2010, following Lewis' completion of her first tour, The Labyrinth. The album title Glassheart was inspired from a conversation that Lewis had with Ryan Tedder. During the conversation, Tedder asked Lewis about her past experiences with love and life in general. Lewis' response led him to the word [...] "Glassheart." [...] During an interview with Clyde 1 radio, Lewis said [...] "Glassheart represents protecting your heart, yourself and protecting your emotions, its very poignant". On 8 October 2012, a week before the album's UK release, Lewis announced her supporting tour of the same name. The tour is named after the album, and although Lewis <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not American hip hop artist and music producer Kanye West's [...] "biggest fan", she was inspired by his tour performances where he appeared on stage alone and just [...] "did his thing".|$|E

500|$|Naz {{is one of}} {{four main}} {{characters}} from series two of EastEnders: E20, created by its team of thirteen writers, along with Asher, Sol and Stevie. Newcomer Emaa Hussen was cast in the role, and said: [...] "It's a really exciting place to start my career. I'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders, {{which is one of the}} reasons I wanted to do the show." [...] Hussen said she was offered the part as the producers saw something [...] "authentic and real" [...] in her and that she could play the character how they wanted, and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> similar to the character in some ways, adding that she enjoyed playing a strong character and felt like Naz as soon as she got into cotume. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|Linder {{affirms that}} {{it creates a}} {{dichotomy}} between [...] "success (whiteness) versus failure (blackness)." [...] Pimentel and Sawyer, as well as Linder, identify Larabee {{as the one who}} makes this separation clear when he manifests his disregard of African American Vernacular English. The co-authors wrote that Larabee implies that [...] "legitimate forms of intelligence can only be achieved through a Eurocentric perspective, thus advancing the message that Akeelah must be rescued from her African-American ways of knowing, in order to be considered intellectual." [...] Another contraposition commented by scholars was [...] "between the supportive Dr. Larabee and Akeelah's skeptical mother." [...] Pimental and Sawyer <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> portrayed as [...] "an African-American obstructionist", while scholar Gloria Ladson‐Billings asserted she represents the stereotype of [...] "ignorant Black woman". Although Fuchs said the film was able to avoid the [...] "white authority figure saves the underclass child" [...] plotline by introducing Larabee, Ladson‐Billings, Linder, and Pimentel and Sawyer opined that it did not. After all, Larabee, as Linder described, is [...] "a non-threatening black man who has assimilated to white culture and who can be depended on to help assimilate others".|$|E
500|$|The band spent a {{month in}} Seattle, Washington, in early 2008, {{recording}} tracks for their debut album, produced by John Goodmanson. The album, titled Fight Like Apes and the Mystery of the Golden Medallion, was released on 26 September 2008 on Model Citizen Records, selling continually well in Ireland and the UK. It was preceded by {{the release of the}} single [...] "Something Global" [...] on 11 July 2008. They played a sold-out launch show at Whelan's in Dublin, which was broadcast live on Phantom FM on the day of release. The Irish Times described the album as an [...] "astonishing debut that encompasses melancholy and [...] (both lyrically and musically)". The Irish Independent, on the other hand, [...] "strongly urge all not to waste their money" [...] on [...] "the woeful debut" [...] of a band with [...] "lots of blogger and media friends, all aurally challenged". RTÉ also gave the album a lukewarm response. MayKay has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> unbothered by any criticism as long as the album is simply being reviewed. Fight Like Apes and the Mystery of the Golden Medallion reached the top five of the Irish Albums Chart, meaning the band became the first alternative act from Ireland to achieve this for several years, and [...] "Jake Summers" [...] and [...] "Lend Me Your Face" [...] became regularly played at indie clubs throughout Ireland.|$|E
