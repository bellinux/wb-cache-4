5|$|The Model 1200 was {{the first}} <b>shotgun</b> to utilize a rotary bolt with four locking lugs secured within the barrel extension. The 1200 was Winchester's first <b>shotgun</b> to {{incorporate}} the company's patented Winchoke system, a quick change tube to allow the easy replacement of chokes.|$|E
5|$|Virgil Earp {{picked up}} the <b>shotgun</b> he had {{retrieved}} from the Wells Fargo office earlier. He gave the <b>shotgun</b> to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday's walking-stick in return.|$|E
5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of <b>shotgun</b> sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome <b>shotgun</b> or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. <b>Shotgun</b> sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. <b>Shotgun</b> metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of <b>shotgun</b> sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E
50|$|Combat <b>shotguns</b> {{typically}} have much shorter barrels than <b>shotguns</b> used for hunting and usually, though not always, have magazines of modified design to hold {{more than the}} 3 to 5 shots normal with sporting or hunting <b>shotguns.</b> Most combat <b>shotguns</b> have tubular magazines to hold the cartridges, mounted underneath the barrel, identical to those of hunting <b>shotguns</b> except for being longer to hold more ammunition, though some recent designs have detachable box magazines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shotguns</b> for {{use against}} larger, slower targets {{generally}} have even shorter barrels. Small game <b>shotguns,</b> for hunting game like rabbits and squirrels, or <b>shotguns</b> {{for use with}} buckshot for deer, are often 56 to 61 cm.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shotguns</b> {{are common}} weapons in {{military}} use, particularly for special purposes. <b>Shotguns</b> are found aboard naval vessels for shipboard security, because the weapon is very effective {{at close range}} {{as a way of}} repelling enemy boarding parties. In a naval setting, stainless steel <b>shotguns</b> are often used, because regular steel is more prone to corrosion in the marine environment. <b>Shotguns</b> are also used by military police units. U.S. Marines have used <b>shotguns</b> since their inception at the squad level, often in the hands of NCOs, while the U.S. Army often issued them to a squad's point man. <b>Shotguns</b> were modified for and used in the trench warfare of WWI, in the jungle combat of WWII and the Vietnam. <b>Shotguns</b> were also used in the Iraq, being popular with soldiers in urban combat environments. Some U.S. units in Iraq used <b>shotguns</b> with special frangible breaching rounds to blow the locks off doors when making a surprise entry into a dwelling.|$|R
5|$|As MalcolmX and his bodyguards {{tried to}} quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off <b>shotgun</b> and two other men charged the stage firing {{semi-automatic}} handguns. MalcolmX was pronounced dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial <b>shotgun</b> blast.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a <b>shotgun.</b> (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the <b>shotgun</b> to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|More {{weapons were}} added to the game, including: the 9mm Pistol, the Single <b>Shotgun,</b> Powder Charges, Dynamite, Trail Carbine, and Grenade Launcher.|$|E
50|$|Scattergun Technologies: 870 <b>Shotguns</b> in 12 gauge and 20 gauge., 11-87 <b>Shotguns</b> in 12 gauge only.|$|R
50|$|Early pump-action <b>shotguns,</b> {{like the}} lever-action rifles that preceded them, had exposed hammers. Most famous {{of these is}} {{probably}} the Winchester Model 1897. Like the double-barrelled <b>shotguns,</b> soon the early pump <b>shotguns</b> were replaced by models that enclosed the hammer completely in the action. Modern pump <b>shotguns,</b> {{with the exception of}} replicas of older exposed-hammer designs required in Cowboy action shooting, are all hammerless.|$|R
50|$|The {{decline in}} {{military}} use of <b>shotguns</b> reversed in World War I. American forces under General Pershing employed 12-gauge pump action <b>shotguns</b> {{when they were}} deployed to the Western front in 1917. These <b>shotguns</b> were fitted with bayonets and a heat shield so the barrel could be gripped while the bayonet was deployed. <b>Shotguns</b> fitted in this fashion became known as trench guns by the United States Army. Those without such modifications were known as riot guns. After World War I, the United States military began referring to all <b>shotguns</b> as riot guns.|$|R
5|$|Virgil Earp was {{not expecting}} a fight. Once Behan said that he'd {{disarmed}} the Cowboys, Virgil traded the short, double-barreled <b>shotgun</b> {{he was carrying}} for Holliday's cane. Virgil carried the cane {{in his right hand}} and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side to his left. Holliday concealed the short <b>shotgun</b> under his long jacket. Wyatt too was not expecting a fight and put his pistol in his overcoat pocket.|$|E
5|$|A {{grand jury}} indicted Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart on November 5, 2008, on federal charges of {{threatening}} {{to kill and}} inflict bodily harm upon a major presidential candidate, conspiracy, interstate unlawful transportation of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation of a firearm {{with the intent to}} commit a felony, transporting a short-barreled <b>shotgun</b> across state lines without a license and unlawful possession of a short-barreled <b>shotgun.</b> Cowart was also charged with damaging religious property and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. On November 6, Schlesselman and Cowart pleaded not guilty before a federal magistrate in Memphis, Tennessee. The two were placed into federal custody without bail. The charges carry a maximum punishment of 50 years in prison and $540,000 in fines.|$|E
5|$|A movable {{cartridge}} {{guide was}} placed {{on the right side of}} the carrier block to prevent the escape of the shell when the <b>shotgun</b> was turned sideways in the act of loading.|$|E
5000|$|Handguns above [...]32 calibre are conditional-use; fully {{automatic}} handguns are prohibited to civilians. Bolt-action rifles above [...]22 long and semi-automatic rifles above [...]22 long with a non-detachable magazine are conditional-use; {{fully automatic}} rifles and semi-automatic rifles above [...]22 long with detachable magazines are prohibited. Semi-automatic <b>shotguns</b> and <b>shotguns</b> with barrels between 380 and 600 mm long are conditional use; fully automatic <b>shotguns</b> and <b>shotguns</b> with barrels under 380 mm are prohibited.|$|R
50|$|Today Mossberg {{produces}} a complete line of bolt-action, lever-action and autoloading rifles {{as well as}} pump-action and autoloading <b>shotguns,</b> all made in the USA. The company also markets an imported line of over/under <b>shotguns,</b> automatic <b>shotguns,</b> and rimfire rifles and pistols bearing the Mossberg name.|$|R
50|$|In some countries, {{gun laws}} {{restrict}} ownership of pump <b>shotguns</b> but are more permissive of ownership of lever-action <b>shotguns.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 25 people were shot, six of whom died (including the perpetrator, who shot himself before police arrived). One witness {{reported}} that the gunman shot at least 30 rounds; police later collected 48 shell casings and 6 <b>shotgun</b> shells.|$|E

5|$|Doom was {{featured}} in multiple lists by critics and media outlets {{as one of the}} best games of 2016, being featured in game of the year lists and articles including GameSpot, GamesRadar, The Escapist, The A.V. Club, Rock, Paper, <b>Shotgun,</b> Jim Sterling, VG247, Daily Mirror, and Shacknews.|$|E
50|$|Automatics {{typically}} have much shorter barrels than pump-action <b>shotguns</b> (especially hunting <b>shotguns).</b> Barrel length contributes to tighter shot spread, so automatics have relatively wide spread. Short-barreled automatic <b>shotguns</b> {{have a very}} high chance of hitting close range targets, and can even hit multiple targets in one area, which is ideal for combat situations. Long-barreled pump action <b>shotguns</b> are more accurate and have increased range, which is ideal for hunting and sporting purposes.|$|R
50|$|Most single {{barrel and}} double barrel <b>shotguns</b> readily break down into {{separate}} buttstock, barrel and forestock {{and are often}} transported cased as takedown guns. Among repeating <b>shotguns,</b> the Winchester Model 97 and Model 12 <b>shotguns</b> were factory made as takedown guns. Savage also makes a series of takedown over/under rifle/shotgun combination guns.|$|R
50|$|In Austria, {{firearms}} {{are registered}} by licensed dealers or gunsmiths within 6 weeks of purchase by a citizen aged 18 or over, after completing a background check. Break-action and repeating rifles and break-action <b>shotguns</b> {{can be purchased}} without restriction. Semi-automatic rifles and <b>shotguns</b> (non-pump action) require a firearm license or a concealed-carry permit, and must be stored securely. Fully automatic weapons, some military-style semi-automatic rifles, pump-action <b>shotguns,</b> and <b>shotguns</b> with barrels shorter than 45 cm or 90 cm overall are restricted, with licenses rarely issued.|$|R
5|$|During {{the scene}} at the town hall, several {{citizens}} are seen stroking guns: Smithers has a revolver, an unidentified woman also has a revolver, Moe has a <b>shotgun,</b> Skinner has a semi-automatic handgun with a suppressor attached, and Barney has a derringer.|$|E
5|$|Players can buy {{a season}} pass, which gives them all 4 DLCs at a {{discounted}} price. It also contains a limited edition, in-game automatic <b>shotgun</b> called the Abzats, and a light machine gun that was previously only available via pre-order from select retailers, the RPK.|$|E
5|$|Some {{screenings}} of Grindhouse (mainly in Canada) {{also featured}} a fake trailer {{for a film}} titled Hobo with a <b>Shotgun.</b> The trailer, created by Dartmouth, Nova Scotia filmmakers Jason Eisener, John Davies, and Rob Cotterill, won Robert Rodriguez's South by Southwest Grindhouse trailers contest. In the trailer, David Brunt plays a vagabond with a 20-gauge <b>shotgun</b> (changed to a 12-gauge for the actual movie) who becomes a vigilante. In the trailer, he is shown killing numerous persons, ranging from armed robbers to corrupt cops to a pedophilic Santa Claus. The trailer was available in certain selected movie theaters in the United States and Canada.|$|E
50|$|Rifles and <b>shotguns</b> are {{commonly}} used for hunting and often to defend a home or place of business. Usually, large game are hunted with rifles (although <b>shotguns</b> can be used, particularly with slugs), while birds are hunted with <b>shotguns.</b> <b>Shotguns</b> are sometimes preferred for defending a home or business due to their wide impact area, multiple wound tracks (when using buckshot), shorter range, and reduced penetration of walls (when using lighter shot), which significantly reduces the likelihood of unintended harm, although the handgun is also common.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{commercial}} <b>shotguns</b> have a {{bore diameter}} greater than [...] inch, but are exempt {{due to their}} [...] "sporting purpose"; however, both the Street Sweeper and USAS-12 <b>shotguns,</b> designed for military or police use, were reclassified as DDs when the ATF determined they were combat <b>shotguns</b> not [...] "generally recognized as particularly suitable for sporting purposes".|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{severing}} {{business association}} with Benelli in 1998, Heckler & Koch replaced their entire line of <b>shotguns</b> with those manufactured by FABARM. [...] The line featured hunting and sport <b>shotguns</b> in over-and-under, side-by-side, semi-automatic autoloaders and pump <b>shotguns</b> including youth models. For military, {{law enforcement and}} home defense use, H&K released four variants of the FP6 model.|$|R
5|$|Team GB had a {{total of}} five {{competitors}} for the shooting disciplines at the 2008 Olympics, with four entered in the <b>shotgun</b> events and one in the rifle events.|$|E
5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled <b>shotgun.</b> It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the <b>shotgun</b> under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{left the}} WWF {{in the fall}} of 1997, {{partially}} in protest to the Montreal Screwjob. His absence was explained by a storyline injury sustained during a brawl with Kane on the November 24 episode of Raw is War. Crush's last appearance was on the November 29 episode of <b>Shotgun</b> Saturday Night, where DOA defeated enhancement talents Steve Corino, Marty Garner, Mike Hollow, and Jason Ahrndt.|$|E
50|$|Although a {{technically}} sound gun design, {{the market}} for lever-action <b>shotguns</b> waned considerably, as John Browning had predicted, after {{the introduction of the}} Winchester 1897 and other contemporary pump-action <b>shotguns.</b> Model 1887 production totaled 64,855 units between 1887 and 1901. Between 1901 and 1920, an additional 13,500 Model 1901 <b>shotguns</b> were manufactured before the Model 1887/1901 product line was discontinued.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two primary}} modes of {{operation}} for combat <b>shotguns,</b> the pump action, and various semi-automatic designs, mostly gas operation and recoil operation designs. The SPAS-12, SPAS-15, and Benelli M3 <b>shotguns,</b> combine the two, offering pump action or, when the pump is locked forwards, autoloading operation. There have also been a few fully automatic <b>shotguns</b> produced such as the AA-12 and Pancor Jackhammer.|$|R
5000|$|In the US and Canada, <b>shotguns</b> {{are widely}} used as a support weapon by police forces. One of the {{rationales}} for issuing <b>shotguns</b> is that, even without much training, an officer will probably be able to hit targets at close to intermediate range, due to the [...] "spreading" [...] effect of buckshot. This is largely a myth, as the spread of buckshot at 25 feet averages 8 inches, which is still very capable of missing a target. Some police forces are replacing <b>shotguns</b> in this role with carbine rifles such as AR-15s. <b>Shotguns</b> are also used in roadblock situations, where police are blocking a highway to search cars for suspects. In the US, law enforcement agencies often use riot <b>shotguns,</b> especially for crowd and riot control where they may be loaded with less-lethal rounds such as rubber bullets or bean bags. <b>Shotguns</b> are also often used as breaching devices to defeat locks.|$|R
