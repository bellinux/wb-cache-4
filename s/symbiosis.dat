5|$|A lichen is a <b>symbiosis</b> of a {{macroscopic}} fungus with photosynthetic microbial algae or cyanobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning <b>symbiosis</b> is a {{mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning <b>symbiosis</b> is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{evolutionary}} {{developmental biology}} (eco-evo-devo) integrates research from developmental biology and ecology {{to examine their}} relationship with evolutionary theory. Researchers study concepts and mechanisms such as developmental plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, genetic assimilation, niche construction and <b>symbiosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural <b>symbiosis,</b> bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called <b>symbiosis.</b> Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Mycorrhizal <b>symbiosis</b> between {{plants and}} fungi {{is one of}} the most {{well-known}} plant–fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and persistence in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and are dependent upon this relationship for survival.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{coloration}} can {{signal the}} services an animal offers to other animals. These {{may be of}} the same species, as in sexual selection, or of different species, as in cleaning <b>symbiosis.</b> Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may be understood by many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited by different species of fish, and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning <b>symbiosis</b> {{is known}} from several groups of animals {{both in the}} sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine {{reptiles}} including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning the teeth of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus).|$|E
5|$|Greek {{influence}}, {{which had}} {{made its way}} to Phoenicia during the Persian period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen. This spreading Hellenization interacted with the local Semitic population substratum, which remained faithful to its gods and its language. It resulted in an artistic and architectural <b>symbiosis</b> best illustrated in the artifacts of Umm el 'Amed and Bustan esh Sheikh.|$|E
5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning <b>symbiosis.</b> In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial <b>symbiosis</b> plays {{a crucial role}} in the immune system. The microorganisms that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
5|$|Roridula has a {{more complex}} {{relationship}} with its prey. The plants in this genus produce sticky leaves with resin-tipped glands that look {{similar to those of}} larger Drosera. However, the resin, unlike mucilage, is unable to carry digestive enzymes. Therefore, Roridula species do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, they form a mutualistic <b>symbiosis</b> with species of assassin bugs that eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' feces.|$|E
5|$|Russulaceae {{are also}} an {{important}} group of orchid mycorrhizal fungi. This <b>symbiosis</b> is mutualistic {{in the case of}} green orchids, but a partly or fully epiparasitic relationship in the case of myco-heterotrophic and mixotrophic orchids, respectively. In some cases, the association with Russulaceae is, as in monotropoid mycorrhiza, very specific: the Mediterranean orchid Limodorum abortivum predominantly associates with Russula delica and closely related species; in Corallorhiza maculata, different genotypes of the same species have distinct Russula partners.|$|E
5|$|This {{research}} has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal <b>symbiosis</b> in the Amanita genus. DNA analysis has shown that a group of species in the subsection Vittadiniae (which includes S.thiersii) has few derived characteristics. This clade has a single ancestor (or a very small number) and seems to have come into being at a very early stage {{in the evolution of the}} genus.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg {{boundary}} into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow tropical waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the photic zone) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary. Colonial coral species rely upon <b>symbiosis</b> with photosynthetic algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–Pg boundary, however, the use of data from coral fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent Paleocene recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|As Ezri Tigan was {{the only}} unjoined Trill {{available}} on board, she agreed to be joined to the symbiont {{even though she was}} unprepared and did not previously seek to be joined to one. Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the <b>Symbiosis</b> Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are {{essentially}} the well-known ectomycorrhizal {{trees and shrubs}} in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal <b>symbiosis,</b> such as Lactarius and Russula species that only grow with Cistus shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial <b>symbiosis.</b> In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} <b>symbiosis</b> one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} <b>symbiosis,</b> Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
5|$|Phallus hadriani is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and thus}} obtains nutrients by decomposing organic matter. In North America, {{it is commonly}} associated with tree stumps, or roots of stumps that are decomposing in the ground. In Great Britain, its distribution {{is more or less}} restricted to coastal dunes, while in Poland, it has been noted to avoid humid and humic forest soils, and live in <b>symbiosis</b> with xerophilous grasses and the black locust tree, Robinia pseudoacacia. The mushroom is one of three species protected by the Red Data Book of Latvia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the <b>symbiosis</b> partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his <b>symbiosis</b> with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E
5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the <b>symbiosis</b> of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum <b>symbiosis</b> could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizae, {{a form of}} mutualist <b>symbiosis</b> wherein fungal hyphae invade plant root {{cells and}} both species benefit from the {{resulting}} increased supply of nutrients. All known Glomeromycota species reproduce asexually. The symbiotic association between the Glomeromycota and plants is ancient, with evidence dating to 400 million years ago. Formerly part of the Zygomycota (commonly known as 'sugar' and 'pin' molds), the Glomeromycota were elevated to phylum status in 2001 and now replace the older phylum Zygomycota. Fungi that {{were placed in the}} Zygomycota are now being reassigned to the Glomeromycota, or the subphyla incertae sedis Mucoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina, the Zoopagomycotina and the Entomophthoromycotina. Some well-known examples of fungi formerly in the Zygomycota include black bread mold (Rhizopus stolonifer), and Pilobolus species, capable of ejecting spores several meters through the air. Medically relevant genera include Mucor, Rhizomucor, and Rhizopus.|$|E
5|$|Suillus pungens is an ectomycorrhizal (EM) {{basidiomycete}} {{that forms}} symbiotic relationships almost exclusively with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and bishop pine (Pinus muricata); some collections {{have been made}} under knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), but only {{within the range of}} Monterey pine. All these trees have small scattered natural ranges largely restricted to California. An EM <b>symbiosis</b> is a mutualistic relationship between an EM fungus and the root tip of a compatible EM plant. The fruit bodies of Suillus pungens grow solitarily, scattered or in groups in humus. They are often found growing near fruit bodies of Chroogomphus vinicolor and Helvella lacunosa. Suillus pungens is often the most abundant Suillus in the San Francisco Bay Area. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco, where it occurs in abundance during the fall and winter seasons. Although it occurs most frequently in the autumn and winter, {{it is one of the}} few species of Suillus that continue to fruit sporadically throughout the year, especially in wet weather. It has also been identified in the southeastern Sierra Nevada and on Santa Cruz Island.|$|E
5|$|Suillus salmonicolor, {{commonly}} known as the Slippery Jill, is a fungus in the family Suillaceae of the order Boletales. First described {{as a member of the}} genus Boletus in 1874, the species acquired several synonyms, including Suillus pinorigidus and Suillus subluteus, before it was assigned its current binomial name in 1983. It has not been determined with certainty whether S.salmonicolor is distinct from the species S.cothurnatus, described by Rolf Singer in 1945. S.salmonicolor is a mycorrhizal fungus—meaning it forms a symbiotic association with the roots of plants such that both organisms benefit from the exchange of nutrients. This <b>symbiosis</b> occurs with various species of pine, and the fruit bodies (or mushrooms) of the fungus appear scattered or in groups on the ground near the trees. The fungus is found in North America, Hawaii, Asia, the Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and Central America. It has been introduced to several of those locations via transplanted trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} bought by BSA in 1961 {{at a cost of}} £8.5million and became known in legal terms as BSA-Churchill Machine Tools Ltd. In October 1962 H G Sturgeon, OBE, {{previously}} managing director at de Havilland Aircraft, was appointed to the same position at Churchill; he moved on in 1964 to become managing director of the BSA group's Motorcycle division. In 1966 Churchill merged in a joint-venture agreement with Alfred Herbert and became part of Herbert-BSA Ltd, the intention being that the combined concerns would gain benefits from rationalisation and <b>symbiosis</b> of their activities. The general expectation – held also by the Department of Trade and Industry and the stock market – of rewards from the venture did not materialise and BSA sold its entire holding in August 1971, writing off £6.9M {{as a consequence of the}} need to have cash in hand to address issues elsewhere in its activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal <b>symbiosis</b> is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species richness and endemism, which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E
5|$|Within the abyssal and hadal zones, {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have {{by far the}} greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through <b>symbiosis.</b> These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning <b>symbiosis.</b> Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E
5|$|Moser was {{promoted}} to Associate University Professor in 1964. Two years later, the Faculty of Science of the University of Innsbruck recommended that a chair of microbiology should be created at the Botanical Institute in Innsbruck. The Federal Ministry of Education accepted the recommendation. Moser was the only candidate for the position, and was unanimously named {{by a number of}} leading European botanists and mycologists for the post in 1967. Subsequently, in 1968, Moser {{was promoted}} to full professor, and, in 1972, Moser became the head of the newly established Institute of Microbiology, {{the first of its kind}} in Austria. He remained in charge of the Institute until his retirement. He taught on a wide range of subjects, including the taxonomy of fungi, ecology of fungi, mycogeography, bacteria, viruses, chemotaxonomy, molecular genetics, microbial toxicology, immunology and <b>symbiosis.</b> During his career at the university, he oversaw over 60 doctoral theses, in addition to a number of diploma theses. In 1970, Moser became the president of the Austrian Mycological Society, taking over after the death of the previous post-holder, Kurt Lohwag. Lohwag, in turn, had taken up the position after the death of his predecessor, Thirring, earlier that year. Moser remained the society's president for 21 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Symbiosis</b> may be obligate or facultative. In obligate <b>symbiosis,</b> {{one or both}} species {{depends on}} the other for survival. In facultative <b>symbiosis,</b> the {{symbiotic}} interaction is not necessary {{for the survival of}} either species.|$|E
25|$|Many modern agronomic {{practices}} are disruptive to mycorrhizal <b>symbiosis.</b> There is {{great potential for}} low-input agriculture to manage the system {{in a way that}} promotes mycorrhizal <b>symbiosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Symbiosis</b> Law School, Pune and ILS Law College, Pune.|$|E
25|$|Both paleobiological and {{molecular}} evidence indicate that AM {{is an ancient}} <b>symbiosis</b> that originated at least 460 million years ago. AM <b>symbiosis</b> is ubiquitous among land plants, which suggests that mycorrhizas {{were present in the}} early ancestors of extant land plants. This positive association with plants may have facilitated the development of land plants.|$|E
25|$|EcM {{plants and}} fungi exhibit a wide taxonomic {{distribution}} and are similarly present across all continents (apart from Antarctica), suggesting the EcM <b>symbiosis</b> has ancient evolutionary roots, as well. Pinaceae represents the oldest extant plant family in which <b>symbiosis</b> with EcM fungi occurs, and fossils from this family {{date back to}} 156 million years ago.|$|E
