(C5) Referred to in English {{speaking}} {{countries as}} a [...] "tanto" [...] or [...] "tanto point" [...] (a {{corruption of the}} Japanese word tantō though the tip bears no resemblance to a tantō) or a chisel point. ("Chisel point" [...] refers to the <b>straightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> that comprises {{the end of the}} blade, whereas [...] "chisel grind" [...] usually refers to a blade ground on only one side even though chisels can be ground on one or both sides.) It is similar to, but not the same as, some early Japanese swords that had kamasu kissaki ("barracuda tip"), a nearly straight edge at the tip whereas the typical [...] "tanto point" [...] as found in the west has a straight edge. The barracuda tip sword was sharp but also fragile whereas modern tanto point are often advertised as being stronger at the tip for having nearly the whole thickness of the blade present until quite close {{to the end of the}} knife. Knife tests have shown that penetration ability of this style of blade is comparatively poor but it is possible, if the tip is strong, that more force can be applied allowing greater penetration without damaging the tip.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic weight {{functions}} are discussed, for arbitrary time-dependent loading {{of a plane}} semi-infinite crack extending at constant speed in an infinite isotropic elastic body. Then, the weight function appropriate {{to the case of}} general normal (or Mode I) loading is constructed explicitly, employing Fourier transforms to develop and solve a Wiener-Hopf problem. Transforms are inverted by a variant of Cagniard's technique. The weight function is then employed to develop a relationship, in the framework of first-order perturbation theory, between the Mode I stress intensity factor and a small but otherwise arbitrary time-varying deviation from <b>straightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the crack. 1. INTRODUCTION Weight functions were introduced into elastostatics by Bueckner (1970). They provide weights for the loads applied to the crack surfaces, such that their weighted integrals over the crack surfaces provide the stress intensity factors at a chosen point. Thus, they are related to Green's functions [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} new Fourier-Statistical Features (FSF) in RGB space for {{detecting}} text in video frames of unconstrained background, different fonts, different scripts and different font sizes. This work {{consists of two}} parts namely automatic classification of text frames from a large database of text and non-text frames and FSF in RGB for text detection in the classified text frames. For text frame classification, we present novel features based on three visual cues, namely, sharpness in filter-edge maps, <b>straightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> and proximity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> to identify a true text frame. For text detection in video frames, we present new Fourier transform based features in RGB space with statistical features and the computed FSF features from RGB bands are subject to K-means clustering to classify text pixels from <b>the</b> background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame. Text blocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classified text pixels are determined by analyzing the projection profiles. Finally, we introduce a few heuristics to eliminate false positives from the frame. <b>The</b> robustness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments {{on a variety of}} frames of low contrast, complex background, different fonts, and sizes <b>of</b> text in <b>the</b> frame. Both our own test dataset and a publicly available dataset are used for the experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is superior to existing approaches in terms of detection rate, false positive rate and misdetection rate...|$|R
40|$|Direct laser {{patterning}} {{of various}} materials has {{found its way}} into several micro-system production lines like inkjet printing, solar cell technology, flat-panel display production, semiconductors and medical treatment. Typically, TEM 00 single-mode solid state lasers and their higher harmonics are used, especially for machining of holes and trenches. The most prominent lasers are short pulse solid-state lasers based on Nd-doped gain materials and their harmonics @ 266, 355 and 532 nm. Traditionally, the original Gaussian beam profile is used. With optimised top hat optics <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generated micro-structures - especially <b>straightness</b> and steepness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> - can be improved. Additionally, the process time can be reduced since for a top hat profile less energy is lost in <b>the</b> shoulders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profile compared to a Gaussian one. Based on LIMO’s unique production technology free-form refractive optics were developed which exhibit high efficiencies (> 98 %) and inhomogeneities below 10 %. With optimized depths of field above +/- 300 µm and integration into industrial scanning systems these optics can boost the performance and throughput in laser-based solar cell manufacturing lines. Processing results are demonstrated for various laser-based processes in thin film (e. g. P 1, P 2 and P 3) as well as crystalline Silicon solar cell production...|$|R
40|$|Flat and {{piercing}} tips made {{of polished}} rock and bone are typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Neolithic in the Western Alps. Most of them, realised in tenaceous rocks (serpentinite and amphibolite), come from <b>the</b> internal valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alps in Switzerland (Valais), Italy (Val D’Aosta, Western Piedmont) and France (Savoy). Production sites {{have been identified}} at Bessans (Savoie) and Roreto (Piedmont), whereas unfinished tips are known on several sites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Alps. Contextual examination allows it to be demonstrated that production occurred on the outcrops, or in their immediate neighbourhood. According to the archaeological facts, the operative process is simple: flat blanks (thin plates) were shaped out by retouching, then polished. <b>The</b> obtaining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blanks and the manufacturing process are difficult to understand on the archaeological artefacts, so an experimental approach was necessary; this was done in 2003. The results allow us to argue that only one «chaîne opératoire» was used. In summary: the blanks are obtained from small massive blocks; these blocks offer a small but discernible schistosity; <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> heat is not required; obtaining blanks is <b>the</b> decisive step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> «chaîne opératoire»: their regular thinness conditions <b>the</b> regularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip and the working time required for shaping; shaping is quite quick (half an hour to one hour), executed by retouching with a stone hammer, followed by more or less covering polishing. All the shapes and the dimensions known in archaeological contexts can be reproduced with no real variation in the difficulties. <b>The</b> levels <b>of</b> know-how appear in <b>the</b> symmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip and <b>the</b> <b>straightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral <b>edges.</b> Manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tips in polished rock does not require highly developed know-how {{for people who are}} familiar with working tenaceous rocks for axeheads.

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{important}} {{variables in}} <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end cap calorimeter is <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> angular divisions {{that should be}} made in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calorimeter array. While it would be ideal to have no such divisions, they are unavoidable because the maximum size for uranium sheets is less than <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> array. These divisions create regions which are either partially or totally devoid of absorber and readout. It is <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> this note to analyze <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> different parameters on <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> these cracks. This analysis assumes wedge shaped structures of significant depth (i. e. > 20 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total depth). For such modules there are five variables which affect <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> a crack. They are: (1) The clearance between modules. The {{extent to which the}} module wall and the array extend into this region depends on the tolerances on <b>the</b> manufacture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module construction techniques currently under consideration have very tight tolerances (e. g. 2 mils). Therefore, this region is assumed to be void of solid material. In the C. C this region is thought to be. 090 inches wide. (2) <b>The</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module walls. The wall thickness depends on which module is discussed. Design thicknesses range from. 078 inches in the C. C. modules to. 150 inches in the E. C leakage modules. Because tight tolerances are assumed on <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modules the skin is assumed to be perfectly flat. (3) The dimension tolerance on the uranium width. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dimension tolerance varies depending on <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module. Modules near the a o'clock and 9 o'clock position will see a gray zone equal to the dimension tolerance at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> each module. There will be a solid black zone at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> each module. This results from gravity pulling the uranium plates down to touch <b>the</b> lower wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module. Modules near the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock region will see a gray zone equal to the dimension tolerance at both edges of a module since there are no plans for a mechanism to insure their alignment along one wall. (4) The straightness tolerance on <b>the</b> plate <b>edges.</b> <b>The</b> straightness tolerance creates a gray zone equal to its width along each side of a module. (5) <b>The</b> region <b>of</b> reduced signal pickup. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> this region is not yet well understood. The current design requires an area along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module which does not have resistive coat. <b>The</b> width <b>of</b> this region has not been determined. Some portion of this region should still collect all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal. <b>The</b> size <b>of</b> this region is not known, either. As an example we can use the tolerances currently achieved for the Harvard plates at Rocky Flats. The width tolerance requested was + 0. 000, - 0. 020 inches. Rocky Flats is delivering plates with a width tolerance of + 0. 000, - 0. 040 inch. There is no tolerance on <b>the</b> <b>straightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> datum <b>edge.</b> If we assume that. 010 inch <b>of</b> <b>the.</b> 040 inch tolerance is do to straightness variation then we can determine the crack sizes for a C.
