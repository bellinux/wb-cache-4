40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aims of {{our study}} were to compare the {{interobserver}} reproducibility of two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) saline contrast sonohysterography (SCSH) and agreement of these techniques with hysteroscopy, and to determine which SCSH findings best discriminate between benign and malignant endometrium. METHODS: Consecutive women with postmenopausal bleeding and endometrial thickness >/= 4. 5 mm underwent 2 D and 3 D SCSH; the results were videotaped and stored electronically, respectively, for analysis by two independent experienced examiners who were blinded to each other's results. A histological diagnosis was obtained by dilatation and curettage, hysteroscopic resection or hysterectomy. The hysteroscopist was blinded to the ultrasound results and used the same standardized research protocol to describe the uterine cavity as the ultrasound examiners. RESULTS: Of 170 consecutive women with postmenopausal bleeding and endometrial thickness >/= 4. 5 mm, 84 (14 with endometrial malignancy) fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Hysteroscopy findings in 54 women (one with endometrial malignancy) {{were used to determine}} agreement with SCSH. Interobserver agreement of 2 D and 3 D SCSH was 95 % (80 / 84) vs. 89 % (75 / 84) with regard to presence of focal lesions, 89 % (75 / 84) vs. 88 % (74 / 84) for presence of focal lesions <b>with</b> <b>irregular</b> <b>surface,</b> 67 % (54 / 81) vs. 63 % (51 / 81) for number of focal lesions, and 77 % (46 / 60) vs. 70 % (42 / 60) for location of focal lesions. The agreement between 2 D and 3 D SCSH and hysteroscopy was 94 % (51 / 54) vs. 93 % (50 / 54) with regard to presence of focal lesions, 74 % (40 / 54) vs. 76 % (41 / 54) for presence of focal lesions <b>with</b> <b>irregular</b> <b>surface,</b> 63 % (34 / 54) vs. 54 % (29 / 54) for number of focal lesions, and 66 % (29 / 44) vs. 64 % (28 / 44) for location of focal lesions. The SCSH finding that best discriminated between benign and malignant endometrium was the presence of focal lesion(s) <b>with</b> <b>irregular</b> <b>surface</b> (for 2 D SCSH: sensitivity 71 %, specificity 97 %, positive likelihood ratio 25, negative likelihood ratio 0. 3; for 3 D SCSH: sensitivity 43 %, specificity 97 %, positive likelihood ratio 15, negative likelihood ratio 0. 6). CONCLUSIONS: 3 D SCSH {{does not seem to be}} superior to 2 D SCSH when performed by experienced ultrasound examiners either with regard to reproducibility, agreement with hysteroscopy findings or diagnosis of endometrial malignancy. The presence of focal lesion(s) <b>with</b> <b>irregular</b> <b>surface</b> is the best SCSH variable for discrimination between benign and malignant endometrium. Copyright (c) 2009 ISUOG.

In this paper, the collisions of ballistic particles interacting <b>with</b> an <b>irregular</b> <b>surface</b> modeled by a quadratic Koch curve, are studied numerically. The q moments of the source spatial distribution of collision numbers μ(x) are characterized by a sequence of "collision exponent" τ(q). The measure μ(x) {{is found to be}} multifractal even when a random micro-roughness (or random re-emission) of the surface exists. The dimensions f(α), obtained by a Legendre transformation from τ(q), consist of two parabolas corresponding to a trinomial multifractal. This is demonstrated for a particular case by obtaining an exact f(α) for a multiplicative trinomial mass distribution. The trinomial nature of the multifractality is related to the type of surface macro-irregularity considered here and is independent of the micro-roughness of the surface which however influence the values of α_min and α_max. The information dimension D_I increases significantly with the micro-roughness of the surface. Interestingly, in contrast with this point of view, the surface seems to work uniformly. This correspond to an absence of screening effects in Knudsen diffusion. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

The paper shows how lattices can be integrated with a more traditional ray tracer, with several examples.

The governing equations of motion in terms of the viscous shear stress and the boundary conditions in the cylindrical coordinate system are first transformed using a radial coordinate transformation before they are discretized using a finite difference scheme based on central difference approximations on non-uniform grids. The numerical results obtained in terms of blood flow characterictics show that the values of the axial velocity and flow rate in the power-law model are lower while the resistance to flow and the wall shear stress are higher compared to the Newtonian model. These features concur with the general observations of blood flowing through small stenosed arteries. ...|$|R
