25|$|Immunity from {{suits for}} acts or {{omissions}} in {{the discharge of}} judicial duties can promote the independence of judges in their decision-making. The State Courts Act ("SCA") provides that a judicial officer of the State Courts – that is, a district judge, magistrate, coroner or registrar – may not be sued for any act done by him in the discharge of his judicial duty, {{whether or not the}} judge is acting within the limits of his jurisdiction, so long as at the time he in good faith believed himself to have jurisdiction to do or order the act complained of. There is no corresponding statutory provision applicable to Supreme Court judges, but at common law a superior court judge enjoys absolute immunity from personal civil liability in respect of any judicial act which he does in his capacity as a judge. The immunity extends to acts done outside the judge's jurisdiction, so long as he has acted reasonably and believing in good faith that the act was within his powers. Like judicial officers of the State Courts, the Registrar, Deputy Registrar, Assistant Registrars and other persons acting judicially in the Supreme Court are given <b>statutory</b> <b>immunity</b> from civil suit.|$|E

The article proposes that the High Court, in its 2004 decision in Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 592, has expressly articulated a policy-based control on the intermediary's liability, one sufficiently broad to qualify the absolute liability imposed upon s 52 and its cognates.

40|$|Mail {{delivery}} {{is one of}} the few economic activities that has avoided the wave of deregulation and privatization that has swept network industries over the past two decades. Nonetheless, postal services throughout the world are receiving critical reexamination, not only because of the technological developments that appear to be changing the essential character of communications, but also because of a growing body of experience and scholarly research concerning the regulation and public ownership of enterprise. Such experience and research now provides policymakers with a better understanding than they had a generation or more ago of the costs and benefits of the existing way in which postal services are produced. This Article builds on that experience and research by examining the following questions concerning the business activities of Canada Post Corporation (Canada Post) in a competitive environment: What should be the appropriate mandate of Canada Post? In particular, is Canada Post a natural monopoly and, if so, what form of regulation would best serve Canadian consumers?

40|$|With the {{enduring}} doctrine of federal sovereign immunity, {{it is too}} late in the day to suggest that the United States should be treated as an ordinary party in the federal courts. Yet as the Supreme Court has become more comfortable with the increasingly common encounter with a <b>statutory</b> waiver of <b>immunity,</b> the rigidity of interpretive approach has eased. An early jaundiced judicial attitude has resolved into a greater respect for the legislative promise of relief to those harmed by their government. After sketching the history of statutory waivers over the past century-and-a-half and examining Supreme Court decisions across the decades, this Article maintains that a coherent and principled jurisprudence of federal sovereign immunity has been gradually emerging. The Court now reserves absolute jurisdictional analysis for verifying the existence of a statutory waiver for a general class of claims, while judiciously employing strict construction to preclude judicial implication of new causes of actions or remedies. By contrast, the Court is more inclined to use ordinary modes of statutory construction when examining other standards, limitations, or exceptions in statutory waivers, even presuming that procedural rules apply in government cases {{in the same manner as}} in private litigation. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court decision resurrected an old line of cases that translated a statute of limitations for certain claims against the United States into a jurisdictional rule. This Article suggests that the negative effect of this decision on the course of the law, although not negligible, is limited by the decision 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on stare decisis. This Article concludes that the Court should speak more purposively to its interpretive approach in the future if the renewed drift in its federal sovereign immunity jurisprudence is to be arrested...|$|R
40|$|In Rich v ASIC (2004) [*] 78 ALJR 1354 the {{majority}} of the High Court held that ASIC's proceedings for an order under s 206 C of the Corporations Act disqualifying a person from managing a corporation are proceedings that expose a person to a penalty. It is argued in this article that the decision in Rich v ASIC means that {{it is more likely that}} ASIC's power to disqualify directors under s 206 F of the Corporations Act and ASIC's power to make banning orders under s 920 A of the Corporations Act will, in future litigation, be classified as penal, rather than protective, in nature. If such proceedings are classified as penal in nature, then ASIC's power under these provisions to make disqualification or banning orders may be unconstitutional under Ch III of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK). Reforms are suggested in this article to avoid any potential constitutional problems. The decision in Rich v ASIC also means that where the examinee claims the penalty privilege at ASIC's oral examination, the evidence given by that examinee at that examination will be inadmissible (by virtue of the use evidential immunity contained in ss 68 (3) (b) and 76 (1) (a) of the ASIC Act) against that examinee in any subsequent court proceedings or ASIC hearing in which it is sought to disqualify that examinee from managing corporations or in any subsequent ASIC hearing in which it is sought to ban that examinee from providing financial services. It is argued that this evidential immunity will severely prejudice ASIC's ability to obtain or make disqualification orders and banning orders and prejudice the public interest underpinning ASIC's power to obtain or make such orders. It is suggested that ss 68 (3) (b) and 76 (1) (a) of the ASIC Act be amended to restore the operation of use evidential immunity to the same position as it was in before the decision in Rich v ASIC so that the answers given at ASIC's oral examination that expose the examinee to the risk of a disqualification order being made by the court or by ASIC, or to the risk of a banning order being made by ASIC, do not attract the <b>statutory</b> use evidential <b>immunity</b> in subsequent proceedings for such orders...|$|R

40|$|For {{many big}} city mayors and gun control advocates, filing {{lawsuits}} against the firearms industry represents {{a way to}} pursue gun control policies that they have failed to achieve through the political process. Efforts to pass laws mandating safer gun designs and imposing marketing restrictions have for many decades been thwarted by the National Rifle Associate (NRA) and its legislative allies. The mayors and gun control advocates blame their failure to achieve stricter gun laws on NRA corruption of the legislative process. So they have turned to the courts, asking judges to impose gun controls that they believe would otherwise be passed by an uncorrupted legislative process. In response to these lawsuits, the gun industry, {{with help from the}} NRA, has turned to state legislatures and Congress for protection. Together, they have introduced bills seeking <b>statutory</b> <b>immunity</b> from suit in forty-six state legislatures and Congress, and industry immunity laws have been passed in thirty-two states, including Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, Michigan, and Ohio. Supporters of these immunity bills have argued that plaintiffs are misusing the tort system, seeking gun control regulations through litigation that they have been unable to achieve legislatively and filing municipal suits en masse in order to create overwhelming defense costs that will force the industry to settle, regardless of the legal merits of the claims against them. Proponents of the lawsuits respond that the gun lobby 2 ̆ 7 s success in obtaining <b>statutory</b> <b>immunity</b> merely confirms its undue legislative influence, which explains the need for filing lawsuits in the first place. Furthermore, proponents of the suits point out that the industry 2 ̆ 7 s <b>statutory</b> <b>immunity</b> undermines the integrity of the tort system, determining liability on the basis of political muscle rather than judicial procedure. Thus, while the gun industry and its supporters accuse plaintiffs of misusing the court system in order to subvert legislative democracy, plaintiffs and their allies accuse the gun lobby of corrupting the legislative process and undermining judicial independence. Both sides in the controversy over gun litigation have sought to gain an advantage by using one branch of government in order to compensate for lack of influence within another. The debate is no longer merely about the merits of gun control, but also about whether to hold the debate in the statehouse or the courthouse. In this chapter, I critically examine the arguments of both sides. On one hand, I question gun control advocates 2 ̆ 7 justification of gun litigation as a response to legislative failure. There is reason to be skeptical of the claim that NRA influence has corrupted the legislative process and that this justifies recourse to the courts as a way to circumvent the legislative process altogether. On the other hand, I challenge defendants 2 ̆ 7 use of immunity legislation to stifle litigation. Broad grants of <b>statutory</b> <b>immunity</b> undermine the integrity of the judicial process by resolving lawsuits on the basis of political power rather than legal principle, and they impair the capacity of courts to play a supportive role in refining and enforcing the legislature 2 ̆ 7 s own regulatory policies...|$|E

Though anecdotal evidence suggests that immunity promotes corruption, neither the political economy literature on accountability nor the empirical literature on the determinants of corruption has devoted attention to the immunity of politicians. A likely reason for this omission is the dearth of available data. In this paper we quantify the strength of immunity protection in 74 democracies and verify that the strength of immunity is strongly associated with corruption on an aggregate level. To our knowledge, this represents the first systematic attempt to code the strength of immunity protection for politicians and test its impact on corruption. We show both theoretically and empirically that immunity provisions add an important new dimension to the study of accountability and corruption. The incidence of corruption soars when politicians are placed above the law. This key empirical finding echoes, among others, the relationship between diplomatic immunity and parking violations, as uncovered by Fisman and Miguel (2007).

This policy could have negative repercussions as peacekeepers adopt increasingly complex responsibilities, especially in areas afflicted by terrorism.

40|$|An online provider’s {{termination}} of a user’s online account {{can be a}} major-and potentially even life-changing-event for the user. Account termination exiles the user from a virtual place the user wanted to be; termination disrupts any social network relationship ties in that venue, and prevents the user from sending or receiving messages there; and the user loses any virtual assets in the account, which could be anything from archived emails to accumulated game assets. The effects of account termination are especially acute in virtual worlds, where dedicated users may be spending a majority of their waking hours or have aggregated substantial in-game wealth. However, the problem arises in all online environments (including email, social networking and web hosting) where account termination disrupts investments made by users. Because of the potentially significant consequences from online user account termination, user-rights advocates, especially in the virtual world context, have sought legal restrictions on online providers’ discretion to terminate users.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore and examine the impact of s. 158 of the Planning Act 2008 in the UK, which awards the defence of {{statutory}} authority to developers of major infrastructure projects in private nuisance actions. The paper will assess the extent to which this provision could broaden the scope of the existing defence and consider the practical implications of the new measures. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyses existing case law, and the historic evolution of the UK doctrine of statutory authority, in order to assess the potential judicial approach to the defence in infrastructure planning decisions. Findings – Although s. 158 of the Planning Act 2008 appears to further broaden the opportunity for the <b>statutory</b> <b>immunity</b> defence to be used, certain historical restrictions will affect its application. In awarding the defence, the judiciary have taken into account a variety of considerations such as the specificity of the location, the inevitability of the nuisance, the effect on statutory provisions, and the bearing that negligence has on the defence. These exceptions prove that there is no such thing as “blanket immunity”, and developers may still be held responsible for their un‐neighbourly conduct. Practical implications – The scope of the protection conferred on developers of major infrastructure projects can appear confusing and could potentially create the assumption that statutory authority will act as a total defence to any actions. Developers, and their advisers, will need to be aware of the aforementioned exceptions before seeking to rely on the statutory authority defence. Originality/value – This paper proposes that the doctrine of statutory authority has gained a newly significant status and uses recent legislation and a comprehensive overview of the existing case law to demonstrate these findings...|$|E
40|$|The Clean Air Act (CAA) {{includes}} enforcement provisions {{by which}} violators of the Act {{can be held}} civilly liable for penalties. When federal agencies violate the CAA, however, the Constitution and the sovereign immunity doctrine serve as obstacles to civil enforcement. Federal agencies contend that the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s separation of powers doctrine, unitary executive theory, and 2 ̆ 2 case or controversy 2 ̆ 2 justiciability requirement bar the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from proceeding against them in civil enforcement actions. This Article addresses these arguments and examines the executive branch 2 ̆ 7 s approach to enforcing the Act against federal agencies. Federal agencies also have asserted the sovereign immunity doctrine as a defense to civil suits by states, local governments, and citizens. This doctrine protects the federal government from lawsuits unless Congress has explicitly waived sovereign immunity in a statute. While {{there is some evidence}} that Congress has intended to waive federal immunity in the CAA, federal courts have inconsistently applied such waivers. This Article examines the developing judicial applicability of the CAA 2 ̆ 7 s sovereign immunity waiver by comparing its language and legislative history to that of other environmental statutes.

40|$|The {{current state}} of Fourth Amendment {{jurisprudence}} leaves it to technology corporations to challenge court orders, subpoenas, and requests by the government for individual users’ information. The third-party doctrine denies people a reasonable expectation of privacy in data they transmit through telecommunications and Internet service providers. Third-party corporations become, by default, the people’s corporate avatars. Corporate avatars, however, do {{a poor job of}} representing individuals’ interests. Moreover, vesting the Fourth Amendment’s government-oversight functions in corporations fails to cohere with the Bill of Rights’ populist history and the Framers’ distrust of corporations. This article examines how the third-party doctrine proves unsupportable in the big data surveillance era, in which communicating and sharing information through third parties’ technology is a necessary condition of existence, and non-content data, such as Internet subscriber information or cell site location information, provides an intimate portrait of a person’s activities and beliefs. Recognizing the potential for excessive government surveillance, scholars, courts, and Congress have endorsed corporations as one solution to executive branch overreach and privacy invasion. This article demonstrates through government and corporations’ reports that companies have rarely challenged government requests for their users’ data. Incentives to cooperate with government surveillance, including highly profitable relationships with government, government regulation of companies, and <b>statutory</b> <b>immunity,</b> make it unlikely corporations will ever prove adequate avatars. The article further documents how expansive search powers originated in England with the aid of private industry, making corporations dubious guardians of the Fourth Amendment. The article offers practicable solutions that will increase individual agency. First, the third-party doctrine should be limited in order to permit an expectation of privacy in some non-content data. Second, Congress should enact proprietary rights in certain personal data. In many instances, government surveillance may constitute a deprivation of that property interest, requiring notice and an opportunity to challenge the surveillance. Finally, advances in technology should facilitate individuals’ selection of corporations’ services and devices that ensure notice of government surveillance and enable direct communication between the people and government over searches and seizures...|$|E

Even when ISPs have operated websites that have left digital "scarlet letters" on individuals, they have not been liable if the ISPs did not "create or develop" the defamatory contents. Bloggers, as website operators, could be immunized even when they exercised the "traditional editorial functions" unlike the traditional journalists. By contrast, ISPs in the United Kingdom could not enjoy such absolute immunity. Following the U. K. tradition of plaintiff-friendly libel law, the Defamation Act 1996 did not adopt any separate provision for ISP liability. Under Section 1, ISPs in England are subject to liability for defamation by third parties if they are notified of harmful online contents but fail to remove the postings promptly. Meanwhile, the new Defamation Act 2013 provides a separate provision for ISP liability. Section 5 is novel because ISP liability hinges on whether the original speaker is identifiable. I suggest that CDA Section 230 should be revised. One possible way of revising Section 230 is borrowing from the U. K. Defamation Act 2013. But such adoption is not compellingly urgent. It needs time to see what impact the new U. K. defamation law will have on freedom of speech. Regardless, the U. K. experience with ISP liability will provide a useful comparative framework to rebalance free speech with reputation on the Internet...|$|E
40|$|This conference {{explores the}} role of crowds in {{establishing}} online reputations. My talk will address the malevolent side of that story—how online crowds can destroy the privacy and reputations of individuals, particularly women. Social networking sites and blogs have recently become breeding grounds for anonymous groups that attack women with lies, threats of sexual violence, and damaging photographs. In response, some women have gone offline or assumed gender-neutral pseudonyms. Because search engines reproduce the attacks, the online reputations of targeted women are repeatedly battered. These destructive groups update a pattern from the past. From the anti-immigrant mobs {{of the nineteenth century}} to the Ku Klux Klan, anonymous groups have come together to inflict harm. According to social psychology literature, several conditions accelerate dangerous group behavior while other conditions defuse the dangerousness of crowds. Unfortunately, Web 2. 0 technologies provide all of the accelerants of mob behavior but very few of its inhibitors. For instance, social networking sites, message boards, and chat rooms foster a feeling of closeness among people with shared negative views. Group members’ views, in turn, tend to polarize, leading to greater hostility and more aggressive behavior. Individuals who feel anonymous do and say things online that they would never seriously entertain doing and saying offline because they sense that their conduct will have no consequences. A site operator’s decision to keep up damaging posts encourages destructive group behavior. Online mobs also have little reason to fear that their victims will retaliate against them. The factors that slow down mobs are largely absent on the Web. Studies show that group leaders and authority figures {{play a critical role in}} controlling a group’s destructive behavior. But site operators, often viewed as wielding authority, have little incentive to discourage hostility because they enjoy <b>statutory</b> <b>immunity</b> for others’ postings. Posters may not fear getting caught if they have hidden their identity with pseudonyms or anonymizing technologies. Because cyberspace has a way of making us feel that people are “informational artifacts,” destructive groups will not view their victims as persons with whom they should empathize or whom they need. And online groups face little problems organizing due to the Internet’s efficiency in gathering together individuals. It is true that the mobs of prior centuries inflicted physical harm whereas the harm here is primarily economic and emotional. But in an age when identity and reputation are bound up in the Internet, the harm to online reputation and privacy is potent. Employers review Google results in making interviewing and hiring decisions. Threats, lies, and the disclosure of private facts discourage women from blogging in their own names. Women lose opportunities to establish online identities that would enhance their careers and attract clients. Destructive online groups prevent the Web from becoming an inclusive environment. Disappointingly, this phenomenon throws us back to the nineteenth century, when women wrote under gender-neutral pseudonyms to avoid discrimination. Our inclination to make abusive private collaborations a public policy concern implicitly depends on whether private mechanisms will rein in the abuses of these groups. The social psychological literature, however, gives us little reason to expect self-correction of this serious problem...|$|E
