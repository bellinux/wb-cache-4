25|$|In 2008, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Mayor Joseph P. Keating, the city invested in renovating the downtown area sidewalks with a brick theme. Colorful brick pavers line the sidewalks along the curbside and at street crossings. Black street lights and <b>sign</b> <b>posts</b> were also placed to enhance the appearance of the downtown. Trees were also planted throughout the central business district. Since 2008, more downtown restoration has occurred. Older buildings are being demolished and newer structures (i.e., condominiums, restaurants, bars, and stores) are being built. Pittston is currently making a comeback since the start of its economic decline decades ago.|$|E

500|$|Determined to {{make her}} novels as {{accurate}} as possible, Heyer collected reference works and research materials to use while writing. At {{the time of her}} death she owned over 1,000 historical reference books, including Debrett's and an 1808 dictionary of the House of Lords. In addition to the standard historical works about the medieval and eighteenth-century periods, her library included histories of snuff boxes, <b>sign</b> <b>posts,</b> and costumes. She often clipped illustrations from magazine articles and jotted down interesting vocabulary or facts onto note cards, but rarely recorded where she found the information. Her notes were sorted into categories, such as Beauty, Colours, Dress, Hats, Household, Prices, and Shops; and even included details such as the cost of candles in a particular year. Other notebooks contained lists of phrases, covering such topics as [...] "Food and Crockery", [...] "Endearments", and [...] "Forms of Address." [...] One of her publishers, Max Reinhardt, once attempted to offer editorial suggestions about the language in one of her books but was promptly informed by a member of his staff that no one in England knew more about Regency language than Heyer.|$|E

2500|$|The current [...] "blue crescent" [...] logo was {{designed}} by the New York-based Sterling Group and made its official debut on 1 July 1999. Sterling Group changed {{the color of the}} restaurant's name from red to burgundy, tilted the bun halves and the font on an axis, used a smaller bun motif and wrapped the burger with a blue crescent, which gave it a more circular appearance. Most restaurants did not acquire new signs, menus, and drive-thru ordering speakers until 2001. All secondary signage was updated with the new logo and all <b>sign</b> <b>posts</b> were repainted to match the blue coloring of the new crescent, replacing the original black.|$|E
