5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant <b>scatter</b> in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the <b>scatter</b> of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic light <b>scattering</b> {{provides}} {{insight into}} the dynamic properties of soft materials by measuring single <b>scattering</b> events, meaning that each detected photon has been <b>scattered</b> by the sample exactly once.

40|$|By large-distance asymptotics, in {{conventional}} <b>scattering</b> theory, {{at the cost}} of losing the information of the distance between target and observer, one arrives at an explicit expression for <b>scattering</b> wave functions represented by a <b>scattering</b> phase shift.
