40|$|Abstract. In {{view of the}} {{characteristics}} of the blasting tunneling roadway, the paper has analyzed the distribution law and the movement rule of dust in roadway. Combined with the practical problems existing in the field, a series of methods were conducted to investigate and analyze the the dust source of tunneling, the authors propose the following optimal comprehensive directional measures: At first, using the wet shotcrete technology as more as possible to improving the shotcrete. Taking use of the corresponding measures of spraying and watering, and the use of water stemming is mandatory. The amount of wind in the exit of the ventilation duct should be controlled and the quality of water should be improved, enhancing the atomization effect. The settled dust {{on the walls of the}} tunnel should be moistened with <b>sticking</b> <b>agent</b> and the individual safeguard should be done better. Adopting the above dustproof measures should effectively solve the problems of a large amount of dust and the working environment of high dust concentration in the heading face by blasting. The working environment can be improved by the effective control for the dust concentration in the heading face. The work of dust comprehensive prevention in the heading face is of significance...|$|E

The {{aim was to}} find out the best K application stage for improvement in drought tolerance potential. Drought stress was created by withholding irrigation at the three growth stages and then K was sprayed with carboxymethyl cellulose as a <b>sticking</b> <b>agent,</b> whereas Tween- 20 was used as a surfactant for foliar spray. At maturity, aboveground nitrogen, phosphorus, K, sodium and calcium uptakes by the crop were measured. Besides, water potential, osmotic potential and turgor potential of crop were also estimated. The results indicated that the drought stress at all three critical growth stages of wheat adversely affected plant's nutrient uptake, water potential, osmotic potential and turgor potential of wheat plants. The exogenous application of K under drought stress at all three critical growth stages enhanced tolerance of wheat by reducing toxic nutrient's uptake and improving the physiological efficiency. In this regards, both varieties showed uniform behavior. Maximum improvement in all the recorded nutrients uptake and physiological parameters was achieved when K was applied at grain filling stage of both cultivars...|$|E

Laser cladding of the Nickel base alloy powder + 50 % tungsten carbide powder on EN 9 steel substrate was performed with powder injection method as well. A Finite Element Method for calculating the surface temperature distribution was used to help prediction of temperature distribution {{laser cladding}} results. Composition of cladding materials was designed; a <b>sticking</b> <b>agent</b> was chosen for the pre-placed powder method. Clad coatings were obtained for different process parameters for laser cladding, and a detailed study of the affects of these parameters has been carried out. The characteristic microstructure and properties of the clad layers and interface were investigated by using an optical microscope, a micro hardness tester and a makeshift wear test. A comprehensive review is presented on the dilution of the coating and the typical problems experienced with the coating substrate interface. The results show that microstructure of clad layers comprise three zones: the cladding layer, bonding zone and heat-affected zone. The results showed that tungsten carbide particles increased the hardness and wear resistance as expected. Wear resistance of laser cladding coating is 3. 5 times than that of substrate. The micro hardness range of the cladding layer is from RV 981. 5 to RV 1187, which is 2 - 3 times than that of substrate. The micro hardness varies from cladding coating to transition layer then to heat affected zone and substrate along a gradient...|$|E

50|$|Once {{an ideal}} cooking heat is reached on the disk (usually medium to low heat works best) the first meat to be {{introduced}} is the bacon. This is placed {{at the center of}} the concave disk where the heat is concentrated. The natural fat from the bacon will prevent the meats from sticking. Beer or dark cola is added to create a broth for simmering the meats which also acts as a non <b>stick</b> <b>agent.</b> The bacon is placed away from direct heat onto the side of the disk once its cooked, and the sausage links are introduced to the remaining broth. As each piece of meat is removed from the direct heat, the meat's natural juices and the beer or cola create a broth for the next meat piece {{to be introduced}} to. Once cooked, the sausage is also set aside and the ham is added. The ham is set aside, and the chorizo is added next. The beef as well as the cook's choice of seasoning is finally added to the collective broth. Each meat is cooked for about 10 to 15 minutes. The beef is covered with a lid during the cooking process to contain its natural flavor and juices. The lid is then removed to allow the broth to reduce, and the meats can now be combined with the beef and the collective broth from the different meats. The onions, peppers, and tomatoes are chopped and added to the mix providing the dish with color and the meats with flavor.|$|R
40|$|Compatible solutes rescue {{plants in}} the hour of intense water deficit conditions. Glycinebetaine (GB) and {{potassium}} (K) are main solutes, playing role in improving plant water potential and ultimately the crop yield. However, only a few {{attempts have been made}} so far to study their optimum dozes and interactions to ameliorate the drought stress in wheat. To explore this, GB solutions of 0, 50, 100 and 150 mM concentration and K solutions of 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 % concentration were sprayed at milking stage of two wheat varieties under stress (Auqab- 2000; drought sensitive and Lasani- 2008; drought resistant). The stress was created by withholding water up till appearance of wilting symptoms and then the solutes (alone and/or in combination) were sprayed with carboxymethyl cellulose as a <b>sticking</b> <b>agent,</b> whereas Tween- 20 was used as a surfactant for foliar spray. At maturity, ten random plants from field-experiments and three in case of pot experiment were selected to estimate plant height, spike length, number of spikelets spike- 1, number of grains spike- 1, and grain yields. Besides, water potential, osmotic potential and turgor potential of crop were also estimated. The results indicated that the drought stress adversely affected all the above parameters. The exogenous application of GB and K to wheat significantly improved spike length, number of grain per spike and grain yields. Moreover, a significant interaction between these solutes was observed since at a given level of GB all these yield parameters were increased (p < 0. 05) with K concentration. The highest values were obtained when GB and K were applied in combination at 100 mM and 1. 5 %, respectively. The same treatment also improved the leaf water potential, osmotic potential and turgor potential to maintain plant water potential gradient under stress. These findings lead us to conclude that application of GB and K (100 mM and 1. 5 %, respectively) is the best strategy to ameliorate the drought impact on wheat at milking stage with improved production...|$|E

(2) for Prototype group if SL just a little greater than zero, then the group could rapidly toward consensus. However, for a group in evolution, because each individual imposes different influence weights on others (this means the group is heterogeneous comparing with Prototype group), with the continuously increasing of SL, the number of iterations needed to reach consensus (group consensus time) shows smoothing decaying characteristic.|$|R

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{structural}} composite wood panels has created an op-portunity for novel cost effective binder systems. Recently, much data has been published extolling the virtues of isocyanates (PMDI) as binders for composite wood panels intended for exterior applications. To date, {{there are two main}} drawbacks which inhibit the wide spread use of PMDI as binders: 1) generally, isocyanates are more expensive than the commonly used formaldehyde binder systems and 2) isocyanates adhere strongly to the caul plate during the pressing cycle. To overcome this <b>sticking</b> problem, release <b>agents</b> are necessary which in-creases the overall cost of an isocyanate binder system. This study was undertaken to investigate the cost/performance of isocyanate binder systems which incorporate significant levels of low cost reactive diluents. Several binder systems were evaluated which were cost/performance effective when compared to phenol-formaldehyde (exterior) and urea-formaldehyde (inter-ior) binders for composite wood panels. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that propylene carbonate (PC) is one such effective diluent in conjunction with isocyanates.

40|$|We analyze {{symmetric}} protocols to rationally coordinate on an asymmetric, efficient allocation in an infinitely repeated N-agent, C-resource allocation problems, {{where the}} resources are all homogeneous. Bhaskar proposed {{one way to}} achieve this in 2 -agent, 1 -resource games: Agents start by symmetrically randomizing their actions, {{and as soon as}} they each choose different actions, they start to follow a potentially asymmetric “conven-tion ” that prescribes their actions from then on. We extend the concept of convention to the general case of infinitely repeated resource allocation games with N agents and C resources. We show that for any convention, there exists a symmetric subgame-perfect equilibrium which implements it. We present two conventions: bourgeois, where <b>agents</b> <b>stick</b> to the first allocation; and market, where agents pay for the use of resources, and observe a global coordination signal which allows them to alternate between different al-locations. We define price of anonymity of a convention as a ratio between the maximum social payoff of any (asymmetric) strategy profile and the expected social payoff of the subgame-perfect equilibrium which implements the convention. We show that while the price of anonymity of the bourgeois convention is infinite, the market convention decreases this price by reducing the conflict between the agents. 1...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare the bond strength of a stainless steel orthodontic wire vs various fiber-reinforced composites (FRC) used as orthodontic retainers on enamel, analyze the failure types after debonding, and investigate the influence of different application procedures of stainless steel wires on bond strength. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Caries-free, intact human mandibular incisors (N = 80, n = 10 per group) were selected and randomly distributed into 8 groups. After etching with 37 % H 3 PO 4 for 30 s, rinsing and drying, bonding <b>agent</b> (<b>Stick</b> Resin) was applied and light polymerized. Then one of the following FRC materials was applied on the flowable composite (Stick Flow) using standard molds: group 1 : Angelus Fibrex Ribbon; group 2 : DentaPreg Splint; group 3 : ever-Stick Ortho; group 4 : Ribbond. In group 5, Quad Cat Wire was applied {{in the same manner as}} in FRC groups. In group 6, after applying bonding <b>agent</b> (<b>Stick</b> Resin), Quad Cat Wire was placed directly on the tooth surface and covered with Stick Flow composite. In group 7, after bonding agent (Heliobond) was applied, Quad Cat Wire was placed directly on the tooth surface and covered with Tetric Flow composite. In group 8, after applying bonding agent (Heliobond) and polymerization, Tetric Flow composite was applied, not polymerized, and Quad Cat Wire was placed and covered with Tetric Flow again. Specimens were thermocycled for 6000 cycles between 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C and loaded in a universal testing machine under shear stress (crosshead speed: 1 mm/min) until debonding occurred. The failure sites were examined under an optical light microscope. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer adjustment test (alpha = 0. 05). RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the groups (p = 0. 0011) (ANOVA). Bond strength results did not significantly differ either between the FRC groups (groups 1 to 4) (6. 1 +/- 2. 5 to 8. 4 +/- 3. 7 MPa) (p > 0. 05) or the wire groups (groups 5 to 8) (10. 6 +/- 3. 8 to 14 +/- 6. 7 MPa) (p > 0. 05). Failure types varied within the FRC groups, but mainly composite was found left adhered on the enamel surface at varying degrees. In the stainless steel wire groups, when the retainer was applied onto the bonding agent and then covered with flowable resin, partially attached composite on the enamel was often found after debonding. When the wires were embedded in the flowable composite, the Heliobond group (group 8) showed more adhesive failures between the enamel and the composite compared to group 5, where the bonding <b>agent</b> was <b>Stick</b> Resin. CONCLUSION: Regardless of their application mode, stainless steel orthodontic bonded retainers delivered higher bond strengths than those of fiber retainers. The differences were statistically significant compared to those of Angelus Fibrex Ribbon and DentaPreg Splint...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The endocrown is a {{mean for}} {{restoring}} endodontically treated teeth. It has a circumferential preparation with a butt-joint border and accessory retention within the pulp chamber. It {{does not require}} root preparation for placement of posts or post and cores making it a more conservative restoration that evades the shortcomings of the above-mentioned. Aim: Evaluation of the clinical performance and longevity of three-unit FPD’s with endocrown preparation for the distal abutment tooth and comparison with a conventional FPD’semploying the Split-mouth method. Methods and materials: Patients with identical defects on the maxillary or mandibular dental arches are examined. 22 patients are chosen amongst them with a minimal step of randomization (n= 3). The design {{of the study is}} based on the method of auto-control and consistent with the CONSORT Statement. The type of the preparation design for the distal abutment tooth is randomly chosen for each side of the dentition. Both FPD’s are fabricated from Laboratory resin composite (Vita LC/VM) with infrastructure made from glass fibres - Turka GS/CSB (<b>Stick</b> Tech). Silane <b>agent</b> is applied to the inner aspects of the bridges and a 3 Steps adhesive system is used (Optibond (Kerr / Hawe).
