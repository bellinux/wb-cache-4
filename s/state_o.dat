The government had introduced the Emergency Powers Bill following the assassination in July of the British Ambassador to Ireland, Christopher Ewart-Biggs, by the IRA; it had passed the Dáil on 21 September. After consultation with the Council of <b>State,</b> <b>Ó</b> Dálaigh referred the Bill to the Supreme Court two days later. Although the Court ruled that the Bill was constitutional, and Ó Dálaigh subsequently signed the Bill into law on 16 October, an IRA action {{on the same day}} in Mountmellick resulted in the death of a member of Garda Michael Clerkin. Cosgrave's government, already infuriated, blamed Ó Dálaigh's delaying enactment of the bill for Clerkin's murder. On 18 October Minister for Defence Paddy Donegan attacked the President for sending the bill to the Supreme Court, calling him a [...] "thundering disgrace".|$|E

6000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1754 Rousseau, in company with his Theresa, went to revisit the city of his birth, partly because an {{exceptionally}} favourable occasion presented itself, but in yet greater part because he was growing increasingly weary of the uncongenial world in which he moved. On his road he turned aside to visit her who {{had been more than}} even his birth-place to him. He felt the shock known to all who cherish a vision for a dozen years, and then suddenly front the changed reality. He had not prepared himself by recalling the commonplace which we only remember for others, how time wears hard and ugly lines into the face that recollection at each new energy makes lovelier with an added sweetness. [...] "I saw her," [...] he says, [...] "but in what a <b>state,</b> <b>O</b> God, in what debasement! Was this the same Madame de Warens, in those days so brilliant, to whom the priest of Pontverre had sent me! How my heart was torn by the sight!" [...] Alas, as has been said with a truth that daily experience proves to those whom pity and self-knowledge have made most indulgent, as to those whom pinched maxims have made most rigorous,--morality is the nature of things.[233] We may have a humane tenderness for our Manon Lescaut, but we have a deep presentiment all the time that the poor soul must die in a penal settlement. It is partly a question of time; whether death comes fast enough to sweep you out of reach of the penalties which the nature of things may appoint, but which in their fiercest shape are mostly of the loitering kind. Death was unkind to Madame de Warens, and the unhappy creature lived long enough to find that morality does mean something after all; that the old hoary world has not fixed on prudence in the outlay of money as a good thing, out of avarice or pedantic dryness of heart; nor on some continence and order in the relations of men and women as a good thing, out of cheerless grudge to the body, but because the breach of such virtues is ever in the long run deadly to mutual trust, to strength, to freedom, to collectedness, which are the reserve of humanity against days of ordeal.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the World War I, German Samoa was occupied by New Zealand in 1914, and was subsequently organized as a trust territory of New Zealand in 1920. The territory gained independence in 1962 as the Independent State of Samoa. The Constitution, adopted in 1960 during the transitional period of autonomy, provides that the executive power is vested in the head of <b>state</b> (<b>O</b> le Ao o le Malo), elected by the Legislative Assembly, and who acts only on the recommendation of the government. The head of state has a ceremonial role. The real executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and his cabinet. The Prime Minister is appointed by the head of state {{as a member of the}} Legislative Assembly who enjoys the confidence of a majority in the Legislative Assembly (Article 32 (2) (a)). The Prime Minister may be removed from office by the Legislative Assembly (Article 33 (1) (b)). Samoa is thus a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster system.|$|E

The second is the Hall of Learning, in which the individual becomes aware of other facets of human life but is distracted by an interest in psychic powers. The third is the Hall of Wisdom, in which union with the higher self is made; this is then followed by the Vale of Bliss. At this point the human soul can merge into the One.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The O + H 2 {{reaction}} {{is a particular}} example to alert {{the importance of a}} clear definition of the quantum state of an atom when referring to a chemical reaction. In its ground <b>state,</b> <b>O</b> (3 P), the oxygen atom reacts with H 2 through an energy barrier with small rate constant. In contrast, when the oxygen atom is in its first excited <b>state,</b> <b>O</b> (1 D), the reaction O + H 2 occurs without energy barrier and the rate constant is seven orders of magnitude higher. The dynamic behaviour of this reaction depends also on the quantum state of the oxygen atom...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} "bridges" for {{the simple}} exclusion process on Z, either symmetric or asymmetric, in which particles jump to the right at rate p {{and to the left}} at rate 1 -p. The initial <b>state</b> <b>O</b> has all negative sites occupied and all non-negative sites empty. We study the probability that the process is again in <b>state</b> <b>O</b> at time t, and the behaviour of the process on [0,t] conditioned on being in <b>state</b> <b>O</b> at time t. In the case p= 1 / 2, we find that such a bridge typically goes a distance of order t (in the sense of graph distance) from the initial state. For the asymmetric systems, we note an interesting duality which shows that bridges with parameters p and 1 -p have the same distribution; the maximal distance of the process from the original state behaves like c(p) log(t) for some constant c(p) depending on p. (For p> 1 / 2, the front particle therefore travels much less far than the bridge of the corresponding random walk, even though in the unconditioned process the path of the front particle dominates a random walk.) We mention various further questions. Comment: 15 page...|$|E
