40|$|Interest in science, technology, {{engineering}} and mathematics (STEM) has lately {{received a lot}} of attention in research due to an observed gap between the amount of STEM students and the labour market’s need. However, it appears that graduating secondary school students (<b>seniors)</b> <b>interested</b> in STEM frequently do not pursue university education in a STEM field, suggesting that interests’ role in educational choice is not a strait forward one. The present study aims to increase understanding of how STEM <b>interested</b> <b>seniors</b> weigh their multiple interests in making educational choices, thereby taking a multiple interests perspective. Participants were 91 STEM <b>interested</b> <b>seniors</b> enrolled in a STEM programme of Utrecht University for secondary school students. A questionnaire with both open-ended and closed-ended items was administered. Results indicated that participants generally pursued and perceived to combine multiple interests in the educational programmes of their choice. In these combinations, participants did not only mention STEM interests, but also interests from other academic disciplines, and interests not concerning academic disciplines. Furthermore, participants frequently referred to general preferences for certain characteristics of activities and environments. Combination between the first three domains especially occurred for those who, next to their STEM interests, also had interests in other knowledge domains. These findings stress the importance of a multiple interests perspective to interest development and educational choice. Furthermore, results can explain why STEM <b>interested</b> <b>seniors</b> frequently do not pursue university education in a STEM field; they might feel that a STEM programme does not sufficiently satisfy their multiple interests...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2013. Advisor: Paul Sackett. Major: Psychology. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxi, 318 pages. A national shortage {{of workers in}} Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) occupations has led to efforts to identify why people leave these fields. Lower persistence rates in STEM for females than for males have also led to examinations of features that cause females to leave STEM fields. The current study examines individual- and school-level features that influence undergraduate students' decisions to leave STEM majors, focusing on potential explanations for why females {{are more likely than}} males to leave. Persistence in STEM was examined in three samples: (a) persistence through the second year of college in a sample of high school <b>seniors</b> <b>interested</b> in STEM majors; (b) persistence through the fourth year of college in a sample of second year undergraduate STEM majors; and (c) persistence through the second, third, and fourth years of college in a sample of high school <b>seniors</b> <b>interested</b> in STEM majors. Differences between persistence in male-dominated and non-male-dominated STEM majors were also examined. In all samples, gender differences were found for most individual-level predictors, with males tending to score higher than females on measures such as SAT-Math, self-rated STEM ability, and high school extracurricular activities and awards in STEM. On the other hand, females earned better high school grades and had stronger relative non-STEM ability and achievement than males. Bivariate analyses indicated that those who persisted in STEM majors typically had higher scores {{than those who did not}} persist for SAT-Math, high school achievement, STEM course taking, undergraduate STEM grades, self-rated STEM ability, interest in STEM, extracurricular activities and awards in STEM, degree goals, and socioeconomic status. Multivariate analyses identified SAT-Math as one of the best predictors of persistence in high school samples, and undergraduate STEM GPA was one of the best predictors in the samples of second year undergraduates. In several samples, a significant cross-level interaction was found between gender and undergraduate females' college-level proportional representation in STEM; however, the effects were inconsistent across samples. Even when controlling for various individual- and school-level predictors, gender effects tended to remain significant, with females in most samples leaving STEM majors at higher rates than males...|$|R

The Vascular territory (carotid or vertebrobasilar) was agreed upon in only 24 of the 36 patients in whom both diagnosed TIA's (kappa = 0. 31).

40|$|The {{projected}} {{growth of}} persons ages 65 and older in the U. S. {{over the next}} few decades will usher in an era of unprecedented numbers of seniors licensed to drive. For some members of this group, there will come a time where driving will have to cease due to a variety of factors. At that juncture in their lives, these seniors may have to consider transportation alternatives other than the personally operated vehicle. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate potential changes in transit market share arising from travel behavior changes of seniors who lose their driving privileges. This includes determining <b>seniors</b> <b>interest</b> in, ability to, and subsequent use of public transit. First, a literature review of developments that have impacted senior travel behavior is presented. Developments such as the changing demographics of seniors, senior socio-economic status, the process of driving retirement, and factors influencing transit use by seniors are presented. Estimates of the numbers of licensed and former drivers are derived for the year 2030 using several methodological approaches. Trip rates are applied to the predicted non-driving population to derive estimates of the potential demand for transit and subsequent market share. Discussion of the estimated market share results also incorporates a descriptive overview of senior travel behavior as derived from analyses of publicly available datasets followed by focus group results illustrating the experiences of seniors and their transportation choices. Recommendations range from transit agencies engaging in direct 2 ̆ 2 generational 2 ̆ 2 marketing to seniors in order to understand their transportation needs as well as perceptions about transit, promoting the use of transit, and demonstrating the viability of transit for specific trip purposes and partner with rideshare providers. Despite the predicted increase in transit market shares attributable to the senior population, transit providers have extensive work to do to change the perceptions of transit service provision and subsequently encourage the use of such services by senior populations in forthcoming generations if transit is to become a viable transportation alternative for those seniors ceasing to drive...|$|R
