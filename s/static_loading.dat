[...] This makes it unlikely for intensive green roofs to become widely implemented {{due to a lack}} of buildings that are able to support such a large amount of added weight as well as the added cost of reinforcing buildings to be able to support such weight. [...] Some types of green roofs do have more demanding structural standards especially in seismic regions of the world. [...] Some existing buildings cannot be retrofitted with certain kinds of green roof because of the weight load of the substrate and vegetation exceeds permitted <b>static</b> <b>loading.</b> The weight of a green roof caused the collapse of a large sports hall roof in Hong Kong in 2016.

40|$|Abstract. Before {{concrete}} {{structures are}} subjected to dynamic loadings such as earthquake, usually they have already withstood <b>static</b> <b>loads.</b> Accordingly, the study on the strain-rate sensitivity of concrete should also be {{closely related to the}} initial <b>static</b> <b>loads</b> that concrete structures experience. But majority of the available documents concerning the dynamic properties of concrete do not take initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> into consideration. In this study, experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> on the dynamic strength and deformation characteristics of concrete in compression. A load was initially applied on the specimen at a very low speed to a specified value and then the dynamic load was applied at a high strain rate up to the failure of the specimen. From the test results it was revealed that the initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> had significant influence on the dynamic strength. The dynamic strength tended to decrease as initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> increased. An exponential function was proposed to formulate the relationship between the initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> and the dynamic strength...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test, {{the pile}} body {{is likely to}} have the problem of {{eccentric}} compression. Engineering practice suggests that the key of <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test lies in the avoidance of pile eccentric compression, the precise control of pile driving pressure, and accurate measurement of vertical deformation of the pile by dial indicator, especially for minor diameter plain concrete piles. Therefore, this paper made an improvement in the traditional <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test device, developed an installation technology of the pile head treatment device for vertical <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test of minor diameter rigid embankment pile regarding the special-shaped pile, and introduced the technology in terms of technical principles, scope of application, technical features, construction technique and operating points...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{stiffness}} of a magnetic bearing that {{is subjected to}} the combined action of <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>loads.</b> Since their sum cannot exceed the saturation <b>load,</b> a large <b>static</b> <b>load</b> will imply that the bearing can carry only a small dynamic load. This smaller dynamic load together with the practical vibration amplitude define a practical upper bound to the dynamic stiffness. This paper also presents approximate design formulas and curves for this stiffness capacity {{as a function of}} the ratio of dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, it indicates that vibrations larger than a certain gap fraction can destabilize the magnetic bearing.

The {{way in which the}} kinetic energy is distributed through the section is also important in determining its response. Projectiles apply a Hertzian contact stress at the point of impact to a solid body, with compression stresses under the point, but with bending loads a short distance away.

50|$|The {{amount of}} shock {{transmitted}} {{by a particular}} cushioning material is largely dependent on {{the thickness of the}} cushion, the drop height, and the load-bearing area of the cushion (<b>static</b> <b>loading).</b> A cushion must deform under shock for it to function. If a product is on a large load-bearing area, the cushion may not deform and will not cushion the shock. If the load-bearing area is too small, the product may “bottom out” during a shock; the shock is not cushioned. Engineers use “cushion curves” to choose the best thickness and load-bearing area for a cushioning material. Often two to three inches (50 - 75 mm) of cushioning are needed to protect fragile items.|$|E
50|$|The term fatigue {{refers to}} the effect of cyclic or {{intermittent}} loads.

Ultimately they expand and join {{to such an extent that}} the material can no longer hold and support the stress. Fractures can be characterized by a series of concentric crack growth bands that grow from the surface initiation site. Cyclic loading can bring about failure in polymer due to: chain scission, built up heat due to hysteresis, recrystallization of material and cumulative crack generation.|$|E
