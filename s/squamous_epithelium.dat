5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> without glands. In fish, {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium,</b> and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E

5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium,</b> which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} the cervix, {{squamous}} metaplasia can sometimes {{be found in the}} endocervix, as it is composed of simple columnar epithelium, whereas the ectocervix is composed of stratified <b>squamous</b> non-keratinized <b>epithelium</b> [...]|$|R
25|$|The {{proximity}} of the dento-alveolar process explains the forming of palatal abscesses and the palatal mucosa and submucosa with its numerous glands and the <b>squamous</b> keratinized <b>epithelium</b> is in correlation with the rich tumoral pathology.|$|R

5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|Mature human {{vocal folds}} are {{composed}} of layered structures which are quite different at the histological level. The topmost layer comprises stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> which is bordered by ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. The inner lining surface of this <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> is covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorally and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance keeps the vocal folds essentially moist and lubricated.|$|E
25|$|The {{epidermis}} {{is composed}} of the outermost layers of the skin. It forms a protective barrier over the body's surface, responsible for keeping water {{in the body and}} preventing pathogens from entering, and is a stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium,</b> composed of proliferating basal and differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes.|$|E
50|$|The navicular fossa is the spongy part of {{the male}} urethra located at the glans penis portion. It is {{essentially}} the part right before the external urethral orifice. It is lined by stratified <b>squamous,</b> non-keratinizing <b>epithelium</b> when viewed histologically.|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{management}} of severe proximal hypospadias or long strictures of the posterior urethra {{is a difficult}} clinical task. Often, the therapeutic approach involves the autologous graft of free flaps of bladder or oral mucosa. We recently reported the use of autologous graft of cultured <b>squamous</b> urethral <b>epithelium</b> during urethroplasty in patients with severe proximal hypospadias. The main limitation to {{the widespread use of}} cultured epithelium was the long hospitalization due to the requirement of 2 surgical steps. We now report a substantial modification of the surgical procedure which allows for rapid 1 -step urethroplasty. Cultured <b>squamous</b> urethral <b>epithelium</b> is tubularized in vitro {{with the aid of a}} tubular polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) support and 1 -step urethroplasty is performed within 30 minutes.

25|$|Nasal lining – At the vestibule, {{the human}} nose {{is lined with}} a mucous {{membrane}} of <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium,</b> which tissue then transitions to become columnar respiratory epithelium, a pseudo-stratified, ciliated (lash-like) tissue with abundant seromucinous glands, which maintains the nasal moisture and protects the respiratory tract from bacteriologic infection and foreign objects.|$|E
25|$|The {{secretory}} epithelium {{is mainly}} pseudostratified, comprising tall columnar cells and basal cells which {{are supported by}} a fibroelastic stroma - containing randomly oriented smooth-muscle bundles - that's continuous with the bladder. The epithelium is highly variable and areas of low cuboidal or <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> are also present, with transitional epithelium in the distal regions of the longer ducts.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper surface}} of the tongue is covered in {{masticatory}} mucosa a type of oral mucosa which is of keratinized stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Embedded in this are numerous papillae that house the taste buds and their taste receptors. The lingual papillae consist of filiform, fungiform, vallate and foliate papillae. and only the filiform papillae are not associated with any taste buds.|$|E
50|$|The last {{section of}} the lactiferous ducts is always lined with <b>squamous</b> keratinizing <b>epithelium</b> which appears to have {{important}} physiological functions. For example, the keratin forms plugs sealing the duct entry and has bacteriostatic properties. In SMOLD the keratinizing lining {{which is supposed to}} form only the ends of the lactiferous ducts extends deep into the ducts.|$|R
25|$|The entire {{lingual surface}} and the apical portion of the {{laryngeal}} surface (since it is vulnerable to abrasion due to its relation to the digestive tract) are covered by stratified <b>squamous</b> non-keratinized <b>epithelium.</b> However, {{some parts of the}} laryngeal surface, which is in relation to the respiratory system, has respiratory epithelium: pseudostratified, ciliated columnar cells and mucus secreting goblet cells.|$|R
25|$|The {{growth of}} human hair occurs {{everywhere}} on the body except for the soles of the feet, the lips, palms of the hands, some external genital areas, the navel, scar tissue, and, apart from eyelashes, the eyelids. Like skin, hair is a stratified <b>squamous</b> keratinized <b>epithelium</b> made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft.|$|R
25|$|The {{external}} pharyngeal walls {{consisting of}} the four constrictor muscles form part of the mechanism of swallowing. The microscopic anatomy is composed of four layers, being from the lumen outwards, the mucosa, submucosa, muscles and the fibrosa, or fibrous layer. The mucosa consists of stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium,</b> that is generally non-keratinised, except when exposed to chronic irritants such as tobacco smoke. The submucosa contains aggregates of lymphoid tissue.|$|E
25|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} {{refers to}} an abnormal change (metaplasia) in {{the cells of the}} lower portion of the esophagus. It is characterized by the replacement of the normal stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> lining of the esophagus by simple columnar epithelium with goblet cells (which are usually found lower in the gastrointestinal tract). The medical significance of Barrett's esophagus is its strong association (0.1 per 1 cm Prague C>M> total segment length per patient-year) with esophageal adenocarcinoma, a very often deadly cancer, because of which it {{is considered to be a}} premalignant condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{epithelial}} {{covering of}} the cervix is continuous with the epithelial {{lining of the}} vagina. The vaginal mucosa is absent of glands. The vaginal epithelium consists of three rather arbitrary layers of cells – superficial flat cells, intermediate cells and basal cells – and estrogen induces the intermediate and superficial cells to fill with glycogen. The superficial cells exfoliate continuously and basal cells replace them. Under the influence of maternal estrogen, newborn females have a thick stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> for two to four weeks after birth. After that, the epithelium remains thin {{with only a few}} layers of cells without glycogen until puberty, when the epithelium thickens and glycogen containing cells are formed again, {{under the influence of the}} girl's rising estrogen levels. Finally, the epithelium thins out during menopause onward and eventually ceases to contain glycogen, because of the lack of estrogen. In abnormal circumstances, such as in pelvic organ prolapse, the vaginal epithelium may be exposed becoming dry and keratinized.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{lingual surface}} and the apical portion of the {{laryngeal}} surface (since it is vulnerable to abrasion due to its relation to the digestive tract) are covered by stratified <b>squamous</b> non-keratinized <b>epithelium.</b> However, {{some parts of the}} laryngeal surface, which is in relation to the respiratory system, has respiratory epithelium: pseudostratified, ciliated columnar cells and mucus secreting goblet cells.|$|R
50|$|The anal canal {{is divided}} into three parts. The zona {{columnar}}is is the upper half of the canal and is lined by simple columnar epithelium. The lower half of the anal canal, below the pectinate line, {{is divided into}} two zones separated by Hilton's white line. The two parts are the zona hemorrhagica and zona cutanea, lined by stratified squamous non-keratinized and stratified <b>squamous</b> keratinized <b>epithelium,</b> respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{macroscopic}} (from endoscopy) and microscopic positive {{findings are}} required to make a diagnosis. Barrett's esophagus is marked {{by the presence of}} columnar epithelia in the lower esophagus, replacing the normal <b>squamous</b> cell <b>epithelium</b> - an example of metaplasia. The secretory columnar epithelium may be more able to withstand the erosive action of the gastric secretions; however, this metaplasia confers an increased risk of adenocarcinoma.|$|R
25|$|The pRb {{protein is}} inactivated by E7 in HPV+OPC, but in HPV-OPC {{it is the}} p16 tumour {{suppressor}} part of the pRb tumour suppressor network that is inactivated. Also the pRb pathway is inactivated by E7 instead of Cyclin D1 amplification. CDKN2A is a tumour suppressor gene that encodes a tumor suppressor protein, p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependant kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest. p16 expression is cell cycle dependent and is expressed focally in only about 5–10% of normal <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Like most HPV+ cancers, HPV+OPC express p16 but the latter does not function as a tumour-suppressor, because the mechanism by which this is achieved, pRb, has been inactivated by E7. p16 is upregulated (over-expressed) due to E7-related loss of pRB with reduced negative feedback, whereas it is downregulated in up to 90% of HPV-OPC. This diffuse over-expression in the tumour cells provides a diagnostic marker for HPV involvement. Although HPV E6 and E7 reduce tumour suppressor activity, they do so less than genetic and epigenetic processes do in HPV-OPC.|$|E
500|$|The endocervical mucosa {{is about}} [...] thick, lined {{with a single}} layer of {{columnar}} mucous cells, and contains numerous tubular mucous glands which empty viscous alkaline mucus into the lumen. In contrast, the ectocervix is covered with nonkeratinized stratified <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium,</b> which resembles the <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> lining the vaginal. The junction between {{these two types of}} epithelia is called the squamocolumnar junction. [...] Underlying both types of epithelium is a tough layer of collagen. The mucosa of the endocervix is not shed during menstruation. [...] The cervix has more fibrous tissue, including collagen and elastin, {{than the rest of the}} uterus.|$|E
500|$|In prepubertal girls, the {{functional}} squamocolumnar junction is present just within the cervical canal. Upon entering puberty, due to hormonal influence, and during pregnancy, the columnar epithelium extends outwards over the ectocervix as the cervix everts. Hence, this also causes the squamocolumnar junction to move outwards onto the vaginal {{portion of the}} cervix, where it is exposed to the acidic vaginal environment. [...] The exposed columnar epithelium can undergo physiological metaplasia and change to tougher metaplastic <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> in days or weeks, which {{is very similar to}} the original <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelium</b> when mature. The new squamocolumnar junction is therefore internal to the original squamocolumnar junction, and the zone of unstable epithelium between the two junctions is called the transformation zone of the cervix. After menopause, the uterine structures involute and {{the functional}} squamocolumnar junction moves into the cervical canal.|$|E
