40|$|A 45 {{year old}} patient with AIDS is {{described}} in whom Balint's syndrome developed over several days without other higher cognitive defects.

40|$|Among 102 brains {{obtained}} from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 34 cases with <b>subacute</b> AIDS <b>encephalitis</b> {{were characterized by}} immunohistochemistry using an antibody that binds to a human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) envelope glycoprotein, gp 41. This glycoprotein was detected in mononucleated and/or multinucleated cells in 90 % of adult and 50 % of pediatric brains with <b>subacute</b> AIDS <b>encephalitis.</b> In addition, many gp 41 -positive cells with bipolar or multipolar processes were found in 10 cases, and these cells occurred most frequently in the basal ganglia and internal capsule. The phenotype of the gp 41 -positive cells was determined using an improved double-labeling immunohistochemical technique that employed beta-galactosidase and peroxidase conjugated reagents. Cell-type specific markers for double-labeling included: Ricinus communis agglutinin- 1 (RCA- 1) for macrophages and microglia; Ulex europaeus agglutinin- 1 for endothelium; anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes; anti-amyloid precursor protein for neurons; and anti-leukocyte common antigen for leukocytes. Results of double-immunostaining revealed that gp 41 -positive cells of all morphologic types, including cells with bipolar or multipolar processes, were double-labeled with RCA- 1, but not with markers for astrocytes, neurons, or endothelia.

Neither {{classical}} onconeural antibodies nor antibodies to voltage gated potassium channels (VGKC) were detected, but the serum was positive for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). The patient serum also stained synaptic boutons of pyramidal cells and nuclei of granule cells of rat hippocampus. The {{objective of the}} study was to identify new antibodies associated with LE. Screening a cDNA expression library identified collapsin response mediator protein 3 (CRMP 3), a protein involved in neurite outgrowth. The serum also reacted with both CRMP 3 and CRMP 4 by Western blot. Similar binding pattern of hippocampal granule cells was obtained with the patient serum and rabbit anti-serum against CRMP 1 – 4. The CRMP 1 – 4 antibodies stained neuronal nuclei of a biopsy from the patient's temporal lobe, but CRMP 1 – 4 expression in thymoma could only be detected by immunoblotting.

40|$|A new subtype of {{autoimmune}} encephalitis {{associated with}} antibodies against GABAB receptor was recently identified. Although immune-mediated functional abnormalities are suggested for the pathogenesis, functional brain imaging such as perfusion SPECT {{has not been}} documented. A 62 -year-old woman with anti-GABAB receptor associated encephalitis underwent 123 I-IMP SPECT in the beginning and after methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection {{analysis was used to}} evaluate the cortical distribution of perfusion abnormality. The patient presented with clinical features of <b>subacute</b> limbic <b>encephalitis.</b> Antibodies to GABAB receptor were identified in her serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but no tumor was detected. Despite normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, the first SPECT revealed hypoperfusion of the frontal, parietal and medial temporal lobes, as well as thalamus, and cerebellum. These areas are known to contain high levels of GABAB receptors. In contrast, the SPECT revealed hyperperfusion in the motor strip and left temporal lobe, which are areas related to some of the patient's symptoms, including seizures, orolingual dyskinesia, and Wernicke aphasia. After treatment with pulses of methylprednisolone, the neuropsychiatric symptoms resolved and the SPECT findings showed substantial improvement in most of these regions.

40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work We report seven patients, six {{from a single}} institution, who {{developed}} <b>subacute</b> limbic <b>encephalitis</b> initially considered of uncertain aetiology. Four patients presented with symptoms of hippocampal dysfunction (i. e. severe short-term memory loss) and three with extensive limbic dysfunction (i. e. confusion, seizures and suspected psychosis). Brain MRI and [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET complemented each other but did not overlap in 50 % of the patients. Combining both tests, all patients had temporal lobe abnormalities, five with additional areas involved. In one patient, FDG hyperactivity in the brainstem that was normal on MRI correlated with central hypoventilation; in another case, hyperactivity in the cerebellum anticipated ataxia. All patients had abnormal CSF: six pleocytosis, six had increased protein concentration, and three of five examined had oligoclonal bands. A tumour was identified and removed in four patients (mediastinal tera-toma, thymoma, thymic carcinoma and thyroid cancer) and not treated in one (ovarian teratoma). An immunohistochemical technique that facilitates the detection of antibodies to cell surface or synaptic proteins demonstrated that six patients had antibodies to the neuropil of hippocampus or cerebellum, and one to intraneuronal antigens.

40|$|The neurovirulence of two {{wild type}} (wt) and seven Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) measles virus strains was tested in young adult ferrets by {{intracerebral}} (IC) inoculation of infected Vero cell suspensions. Wt strains Edmonston and Woodfolk and SSPE strains Mantooth, Halle, and LEC-S {{did not produce}} a detectable encephalitis in the ferrets, but caused a significant formation of serum antibodies against measles virus. SSPE strains LEC, IP- 3, Biken, and D. R., on the other hand, were all neurovirulent in ferrets, particularly strain D. R. which caused an acute encephalitis in all inoculated animals. Strain Biken was of particular interest since it caused a <b>subacute</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in four of seven ferrets. The <b>subacute</b> <b>encephalitis</b> was characterized by a long incubation time, persistence of virus in the brain for at least 8 mo, widespread inflammatory lesions, and production of measles virus specific IgG in the brain. A study of the biological properties of the various measles virus strains showed that wt strains Edmonston and Woodfolk and SSPE strains Mantooth, Halle, and LEC-S produced free virus particles in significant titers both in Vero and ferret brain (FB) cultures. Cytopathic effect (CPE) with cell- fusion was marked in Vero cultures, whereas only minimal CPE and no cell-fusion were observed in the FB cultures. SSPE strains LEC, IP- 3, Biken, and D. R., on the other hand, were mostly cell-associated in Vero and FB cultures, although atypical cell-free particles were produced by strains Biken and IP- 3. All four strains showed cell-fusing activity in FB cultures, particularly strain D. R., which was the only strain that spread more actively by fusion in FB than in Vero cultures. The results are discussed {{in relation to the}} neurovirulence of the various measles virus strains in adult ferrets.

40|$|After {{infection}} with the neurotropic CAM/RBH measles virus (MV) strain, newborn Lewis rats succumb to an acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Passive transfer of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against MV hemagglutinin prevented this disease process. Instead, either an antibody-induced acute or <b>subacute</b> measles <b>encephalitis</b> developed after a prolonged incubation period with a restricted expression of MV structural proteins. The molecular biological analysis of MV gene expression in brain tissue of rats treated with MV-neutralizing antibodies revealed a transcriptional restriction of viral mRNAs, {{particularly for the}} envelope proteins, leading to a steep expression gradient. Based on in situ hybridization, {{it was concluded that}} the efficiency of transcription of viral genes at the single-cell level is reduced compared with that of controls. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies directed against other MV structural proteins proved to be ineffective. Similar results were obtained in MV-infected weanling Brown Norway rats. These rats developed a clinically silent encephalitis in the presence of high titers of neutralizing antibodies. In such animals, a pronounced attenuation of the viral gene transcription was observed. These findings indicated that neutralizing antibodies directed against a restricted set of specific antigenic sites on the viral hemagglutinin protein expressed on cell membranes exert a modulating effect on the viral gene expression at the level of transcription. This phenomenon contributes to the switch from the acute cytopathic effect to a persistent infection in the central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the pathogenesis of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) encephalitis. In mice, outcome of infection varies according to age of the mouse and strain of the virus and can include acute <b>encephalitis,</b> <b>subacute</b> demyelinating meningoencephalomyelitis, and persistent subclinical central nervous system (CNS) infection. All strains of virus are virulent in mice infected 14 days age, whereas the A 7 (74) strain is avirulent. The genetic difference between these strains maps to the nsp 3 gene. For A 7 (74) virus, age-related virulence correlates with ability of CNS neurons to replicate virus and undergo apoptotic cell death. Immature developing neurons support complete virus replication but as neuronal populations and circuits mature in the postnatal brain, virus infection becomes progressively restricted and nonproductive. This restricted replication can be overcome by gold I compounds, which may function by inducing neuronal dedifferentiation to a state permissive for virus replication. Biochemical pathways associated with membrane biogenesis may be an important determinan...|$|R
40|$|South Africa, {{home to the}} world’s largest {{population}} of people living with HIV (5. 7 million), experienced a measles outbreak that started in late 2009. 1 There was a stepped increase in cases of measles, with the highest incidence reported in March 2010. 2 By September 2010, more than 17 000 new measles cases had been reported to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases since January 2009. A mass vaccination campaign from mid-April to early May 2010 resulted in a significant decline in new measles cases. The measles virus is highly contagious, and outbreaks are fuelled by overcrowding and poor vaccine coverage, making elimination status in South Africa difficult to attain. Measles may infect {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) as acute viral encephalitis, or result after 2 - 4 weeks in a post-infectious immune-mediated inflammatory disorder or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

The various viral strains passaged in hamsters showed a great similarity of behaviour including the ability of producing in a proportion of apparently unaffected survivors a <b>subacute</b> sclerosing <b>encephalitis,</b> leading to atrophy of {{parts of the brain}} especially the rhinencephalon. When large groups of animals were used for transmission experiments it became obvious that within one week after intranasal exposure, all the hamsters either died or became clinically affected, or did not show signs of disease but developed acute inflammatory brain lessions. tlater on, between 2 - 6 weeks following inoculations only 90 % of hamsters were affected with either overt signs of disease or subacute brain lesions, suggesting that in about 10 % of hamsters the initial infection did not progress further and that in these animals the early brain lesions disappeared. Passage levels, irrespective of the virus used, did not influence the total numbers of infected hamsters but showed a significant effect on the mortality in TP 21 and HNT infections where the number of dead and clinically affected increased in the higher passes. In these higher passes the number of survivors with subacute brain lesions decreased. In SSPE-measles virus the number of clinically affected hamsters and those surviving but developing brain lesions remained constant throughout. Vacuolated neurons were present in the brains of hamsters that survived one of the above 3 viral infections.

40|$|Background. Although routine lumbar {{puncture}} (LP) is often recommended {{as part of}} the assessment of fever-associated seizures in children, accumulating evidence questions its value and reveals a decrease in its frequency. Our primary hypothesis was that children who present with a single seizure but with no clinical signs of meningism or coma do not require LP as part of initial diagnostic assessment. Methods. We prospectively followed up 377 children aged 2 months through 10 years who presented with at least 1 fever-associated seizure to Modilon Hospital, Madang, Papua New Guinea, from November 2007 through July 2009. Clinical management was performed by hospital staff according to national pediatric guidelines. Results. Of 188 children with a single seizure and 189 children with multiple seizures, 139 (73. 9 %) and 154 (81. 5 %), respectively, underwent a LP {{as part of the}}ir initial assessment. Of the 130 children with a single seizure but no evidence of meningism (ie, neck stiffness, positive Kernig’s or Brudzinski’s sign, and bulging fontanelle) or coma (Blantyre Coma Score 2), none (95 % confidence interval, 0 %– 3. 6 %) had proven or probable acute bacterial meningitis, and only 1 patient had viral <b>encephalitis</b> (<b>subacute</b> sclerosing panencephalitis).

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A measles {{outbreak}} {{occurred in}} South Africa between 2009 and 2011 with 18 699 confirmed cases. This highly contagious virus {{can affect the}} central nervous system in many ways. Early in the disease course there may be direct viral involvement as a primary measles encephalitis or indirectly as an inflammatory immune mediated demyelinating meningoencephalitis. Latent infections are rare and may manifest in two ways: years later as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) caused by viral persistence in a seemingly immunocompetent host or months later as <b>subacute</b> measles <b>encephalitis</b> (SME) in an immunocompromised host. SME is characterised by seizures, typically epilepsia partialis continua, and altered mental status and carries a high mortality. It is an elusive diagnosis and usually confirmed on brain biopsy. Patients and results: Eight patients were diagnosed with SME between July and October 2010 at our tertiary referral hospital. All patients were HIV positive, with a median CD 4 lymphocyte count of 37 cells/µl (range 1 to 268). All patients had epilepsia partialis continua {{during the course of the}} illness and other common features included encephalopathy, visual loss, hearing loss, and generalised seizures. Strikingly, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was normal in all patients and computed 4 tomography (CT) Brain imaging was normal in all but one patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Brain demonstrated superficial and deep grey matter abnormalities in the majority of patients with contiguous cortical spread over weeks documented in one patient. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) showed periodic epileptiform discharges in seven patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by brain biopsy in one patient, by post-mortem examination in three patients and by supportive laboratory findings (positive measles PCR and/or measles antibodies in urine or CSF) in the remainder. The outcome was fatal in seven of the cases with a median time to death of 3 weeks. Conclusion: South Africa has the greatest number of people living with HIV: 12. 6 % of the population (6 · 4 million people) are infected. This is the largest SME case series to date and is seen in the aftermath of a measles outbreak in South Africa. Immunocompromised patients are clearly susceptible and typically present with epilepsia partialis continua and rapid decline in neurological functioning and death ensuing within a month in the majority of cases. MRI T 2 -weighted signal changes in the cortical grey matter, are typical. In the absence of a brain biopsy, we propose the use of measles virus PCR in urine and CSF. The importance of herd immunity, by enforcing the national vaccination programme, is reiterated...|$|R
40|$|Young adult ferrets were immunized with {{measles vaccine}} and 5 to 6 weeks later inoculated intracerebrally with Vero cells {{persistently}} infected with cell-associated strain D. R. of measles virus isolated {{from a patient}} with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Of nine ferrets which survived the infection for 3 weeks or longer, five showed neurological signs. At {{the time of death}} they had widespread inflammation in their brains, and cell-associated virus was isolated from three ferrets sacrificed from 5 weeks to 7 months after inoculation. Four ferrets did not develop clinical signs, but two of these had mild inflammation in the brain 7 months and 2 1 / 2 years after inoculation, respectively. Cerebrospinal fluids drawn by cisternal puncture from infected ferrets at the time of sacrifice had neutralizing titers against measles virus similar to the titers found in sera, but antibody against the measles virus matrix protein was not detectable. Cerebrospinal fluid showed increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) and had distinct measles virus-specific oligoclonal IgG bands. The intensity of the bands correlated with the neutralizing titers of the fluids. These results confirm and extend earlier findings and indicate that persistent measles virus infection in ferrets is similar to human subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and can be used to study certain aspects of persistent brain infections leading to <b>subacute</b> <b>encephalitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) has been clearly {{associated with a}} variety of new illnesses, including profound immunodeficiency (acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]), wasting syndromes (formerly termed AIDS-related complex [ARC]) and neurologic syndromes, including neuropathy, myelopathy and encephalopathy (often termed <b>subacute</b> <b>encephalitis</b> or AIDS dementia complex). HIV- 1 preferentially infects T lymphocytes by binding to a membrane receptor protein, CD 4, associated with helper function. The virus can also attack macrophages and, possibly, other cells such as neuronal cells, colonic epithelial cells and B lymphocytes. Infection of macrophages or monocytes may be involved in neurologic disease. Knowledge about HIV- 1 has rapidly increased, and investigators have characterized its structure, ways in which it infects cells, replicates and is cytopathic for certain cells, and how the immune system responds to it. The ideal vaccine would prevent adsorption of the virus into the cell, {{but it is difficult to}} develop stable resistance because the virus has many antigenic patterns and mutates frequently. The results of vaccine trials in animals have not been promising, but work is being done with monoclonal antibodies. Antiviral therapies being investigated include those to prevent virus binding and entry, to inhibit reverse transcription, to inhibit the virus's life cycle and to restore immune competence in immunocompromised patients...|$|E
40|$|A primate {{lymphotropic}} lentivirus {{was isolated}} {{on the human}} T-cell line HuT 78 after cocultivation of a lymph node from a pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) that had died with malignant lymphoma. This isolate, originally designated M. nemestrina immunodeficiency virus (MnIV) and now classified as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV/Mne), was inoculated intravenously into three juvenile rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), three juvenile pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina), and two juvenile baboons (Papio cynocephalus). All six macaques became viremic by 3 weeks after inoculation, whereas neither of the baboons developed viremia. One pig-tailed macaque died at 15 weeks with suppurative peritonitis secondary to ulcerative, necrotizing colitis. Immunologic abnormalities included a marked decrease in CD 4 + peripheral blood lymphocytes. Although five macaques mounted an antibody response to SIV/Mne, the animal that died at 15 weeks remained antibody negative. Three other macaques (two rhesus and one pig-tailed) died 66 to 87 weeks after inoculation after exhibiting progressive weight loss, anemia, and diarrhea. Histopathologic findings at necropsy included various manifestations of immune deficiency, nephropathy, <b>subacute</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> pancreatitis, adenocarcinoma, and lymphoid atrophy. SIV/Mne could be readily isolated from the spleens and lymph nodes of all necropsied macaques, and from the cerebrospinal fluid, brains, bone marrow, livers, and pancreas {{of some of the}} animals. SIV antigens were localized by avidin-biotin immunohistochemistry to pancreatic islet cells and to bone marrow endothelial cells. The data suggest that African baboons may be resistant to infection by SIV/Mne, whereas Asian macaques are susceptible to infection with this pathogenic primate lentivirus...|$|E
40|$|WE have {{recently}} {{had the opportunity}} of investigating 4 patients with myoclonic epilepsy, children of a marriage between first cousins, once removed. One sibling had died in convulsions {{at the age of}} 2 and another not seen by us, is said to be completely normal. As 3 of our 4 patients showed signs of cerebellar disturbance, they fell into a category described by Ramsay Hunt (1921), and it became of interest to explore the confused field of myoclonus in an attempt to determine the relationship of the "Ramsay Hunt syndrome " to progressive myoclonic epilepsy {{on the one hand and}} the familial cerebellar ataxias on the other. Myoclonus may be defined in clinical terms as "a disturbance of neuronal activity characterized by very sudden involuntary jerks, which are arrhythmic and asynergic, involving portions of muscles, whole muscles or muscle groups " (Bradshaw, 1954). Individual jerks are provoked by change in posture, and it is probable that muscle stretch is the essential stimulus (Dawson, 1947). The onset of drowsiness commonly releases a tendency to myoclonic jerks in normal people (Symonds, 1953), and photic or auditory stimulation may initiate myoclonus in susceptible subjects. Patients with idiopathic epilepsy often experience isolated myoclonic jerks, particularly in the mornings, and the. intensification of these attacks preceding a grand mal seizure is well known. It is not remarkable that lapses of awareness in petit mal epilepsy may also be associated with myoclonus, and indeed myoclonus has been in-voked as an explanation for the third component of the petit mal triad, the falling attack. <b>Subacute</b> inclusion body <b>encephalitis</b> is usually characterized by recurring myoclonic jerks in its later stages (Brain, Greenfield and Russell, 1948), and myoclonus may also be a feature of cerebral lipidosis.
