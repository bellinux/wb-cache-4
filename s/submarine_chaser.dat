5|$|In November 1942, Hubbard {{was sent}} to the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Chaser</b> Training Center in Miami, Florida for {{training}} on <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> vessels. He subsequently undertook a ten-day anti-submarine warfare training course at the Fleet Sound School in Key West and on January 17, 1943 he was posted to the Albina Engine & Machine Works in Portland, Oregon, where he was to take command of the subchaser USS PC-815 when she was commissioned.|$|E
5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a work-up {{patrol in}} the Norwegian Sea, {{she spent the}} bulk of the war in the Mediterranean. While working up, Unrivalled fired a torpedo at what was thought to be a {{submerged}} enemy submarine. Only the periscope was sighted, and the torpedo was fired in the direction detected by the hydrophones, but no German submarine was in the area. Whilst in service in the Mediterranean, she sank a number of small merchantmen and small naval auxiliary vessels with both torpedoes and gunfire. These included the Italian auxiliary <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> O 97 / Margherita, the Italian merchants Maddalena, Mostaganem and Pasubio, the Italian tugs Genova and Iseo, the Italian sailing vessels Triglav, Albina, Margherita, Sparviero and Ardito, the German auxiliary submarine chasers UJ 2201/Bois Rose and UJ 2204/Boréal, the Italian tanker Bivona, the small Italian merchant Santa Mariana Salina, the Italian auxiliary minesweeper R 172 / Impero and the small Italian vessel San Francisco di Paola A.|$|E

50|$|<b>Submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> {{were used}} mostly by the United States Coast Guard in World War II for {{destroying}} German U-boats that were stationed {{off the coast}} of the United States that were trying to sink merchant convoys as they departed American ports. By the end of World War II, <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> had sunk around 67 German U-boats. In the Pacific Theatre, <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> were used for amphibious landings, courier and escort duty.|$|R
50|$|During World War I, {{the company}} built five {{hundred and eighty}} 80-foot <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> (aka motor launches) for the British Admiralty, and 448 110-foot <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> and 284 boats of other types for the US Navy.|$|R
5|$|By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) {{remaining}} large warships {{were unable}} to put to sea due to shortages of fuel and the dangers of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines. While most of these warships were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller warships were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay. At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagatos secondary armament and about half her anti-aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> Fukugawa Maru No.7 and an auxiliary boiler located on the pier. The destroyer Ushio was also docked nearby {{in a position where}} she was able to protect the battleship with her 25mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
25|$|The Ethiopian Navy's first {{military}} ship, {{a former}} U.S. Navy PC-1604-class <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> {{donated by the}} United States Army in 1956, was christened Zerai Deres. A Soviet-made Petya-class frigate was also dedicated to the Eritrean patriot; it was launched in 1968 and sank in February 1991 near the island of Nocra.|$|E
50|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy had around 250 <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> in World War II, principally about 200 of the No.1-class {{auxiliary}} <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers.</b> Some {{of these}} survived {{to serve in}} the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) after the war.|$|R

25|$|The PC-1264 {{soon had}} her K-guns {{removed from the}} afterdeck, and on 31 July she left for Norfolk. After an {{inspection}} by base personnel, PC-1264 left for Miami and arrived at the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Chaser</b> Training Center on 5 August. PC-1264 was due to remain at the Center for ten days training, but an incident cut that time short.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July 1944, the ship's {{shakedown}} {{cruise and}} post-inspection was completed. PC-1264 was then ordered to a {{three and a}} half-days' exercise at the Fleet Sound School in Key West.

25|$|A {{little over}} a half hour {{after the start of}} the {{afternoon}} watch on 16 May 1944, Zeus got underway in company with the internal combustion engine repair ship , and the <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> , their escort. The ships joined convoy 435, encountering a moderate sea on the beam that caused Zeus to roll quickly to 30 degrees. The convoy reached Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, without incident at 17:43 on 22 May, then sailed less than 24 hours later with convoy GZ-62, setting course for Panama.|$|E
25|$|The first Soviet {{trainees}} reached Cold Bay aboard five Soviet merchant ships, each carrying nearly 500 Soviet trainees, {{that arrived}} one per day each day from 10 to 14 April 1945, {{by which time}} 2,358 Soviet personnel of what were to become the Soviet Navys 16th Minesweeper Division and 2nd <b>Submarine</b> <b>Chaser</b> Division had disembarked, joining 1,350 American personnel. Rear Admiral Boris Dimitrievich Popov arrived on 11 April aboard the steamer Sevastopol and took command of Soviet personnel at Cold Bay, who the Soviet Navy designated the 5th Independent Detachment of Soviet Navy Ships.|$|E
25|$|Her first {{patrol in}} the Far East {{was to the}} Malacca Straits between Malaya and Sumatra, both then {{occupied}} by the Japanese. On 11 March 1944 she sank her first victim, a 500-ton coaster, with gunfire. In April she patrolled to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal south of Rangoon and on 14 April made her first sinking by torpedo, a 3,500-ton merchant vessel. The following day Storm attacked a merchant ship that was escorted by what was originally identified as a destroyer, but was actually a minesweeper, plus a <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> and one other anti-submarine ship. She sank the minesweeper, W-7, with torpedoes.|$|E

25|$|After loading {{ammunition}} at Iona Island {{and leaving}} West Point, the ship sailed to Fort Lafayette to load depth charges. Then it {{reported to the}} United States Naval Frontier Base at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, which became the PC-1264s home port. This base cared for the escort ships that accompanied convoys to many destinations. Once at Tompkinsville, the ship's crew continued training and calibrating their equipment, especially the ship's radio direction finder. Besides checking the structural strength of the hull and target practice on the range at Sandy Hook, the ship went through many other tests before going to sea for the first time. Finally, the PC-1264 was ready for its shakedown cruise to the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Chaser</b> Training Center in Miami, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Despite these difficulties, {{the first}} convoy of {{transferred}} ships – three minesweepers and five auxiliary motor minesweepers – departed Cold Bay for the Soviet Union on 28 May 1945; the second – of three minesweepers and six submarine chasers – departed on 30 May, {{with one of}} its submarine chasers dropping out at Adak for repairs, and the third, made up of three minesweepers and seven submarine chasers, left on 7 June 1945. However, poor repair work and supply problems in Seattle plagued the <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> program, and Maxwell was forced to arrange for submarine chasers assigned to duty in the U.S. Navys 13th Naval District to substitute {{for some of those}} originally scheduled for transfer in order to meet a deadline of having all ships transferred by 1 October 1945.|$|E
25|$|Convoy Hi-81 {{was under}} the command of Rear Admiral Tsutomu Sato of the Eighth Escort Fleet in the escort ship Etorofu.

The other Japanese vessels known to have taken part in the mission was the seaplane tender Kiyokawa Maru, the destroyer Kashi, the escort ships Tsushima, Daito, Kume, Shonan, CD No. 9 and CD No. 61. There was also the <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> No. 156, five oilers, Arita Maru, Toa Maru, Hishidate Maru, Marii Maru, Otowasan Maru and three landing craft depot ships, Shinshu Maru, Kibitsu Maru and Mayasan Maru. The landing craft depot ships were carrying hundreds of men and supplies of the Imperial Japanese Army 23rd Division from Manchuria and were directed to separate from the main convoy at Mako and reinforce the Japanese army engaged in the Philippines Campaign. The rest of the convoy would then continue on to Singapore.|$|E
50|$|Recommissioned on 25 July, {{while still}} {{undergoing}} overhaul, Salem {{stood out of}} Boston harbor on 12 March 1918 for New London, Connecticut, to join a force gathering to convoy <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> across the Atlantic. From 31 March-15 June, she served as flagship for two convoys of <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers,</b> leaving both at Ponta Delgada, Azores, and returning westward. On 18 June, she became a flagship of a flotilla of 12 <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> assigned to Key West to operate against German submarines.

25|$|In {{the last}} year of the war the Norwegian {{resistance}} movement established base areas in remote locations in Norway to provide hiding places for people on the run from the German occupiers. Five base areas were planned, although only two were completed (Bjørn and Elg) {{by the time of the}} German capitulation on V-E Day, with a third (Varg) still under construction. In addition to serve as safe heavens the bases were also to train the refugees in guerilla tactics, using instructors from Norwegian Independent Company 1. Kayser, then a lieutenant, was second-in-command of the base Bjørn West at Matre in Masfjorden and took part in the 28 April3 May 1945 fighting after the base was discovered by the Germans. Kayser had arrived in Masfjorden in October 1944 with a fellow Norwegian Independent Company 1 soldier, second lieutenant Severin Synnes. The two had been transported to Masfjorden from the UK on the Royal Norwegian Navy <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> HNoMS Vigra with orders to establish Bjørn West.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, the Israeli Navy {{consisted}} of three former Aliyah Bet ships that had been seized by the British and impounded in Haifa harbor, where they were tied up at the breakwater. Work on establishing a navy had begun shortly before Israeli independence, and the three ships were selected due to them having a military background – one, the INS Eilat, was an ex-US Coast Guard icebreaker, and the other two, the INS Haganah and INS Wedgwood, had been Royal Canadian Navy corvettes. The ships were put into minimum running condition by contractors dressed as stevedores and port personnel, who were able to work in the engine rooms and below deck. The work had to be clandestine to avoid arousing British suspicion. On 21 May 1948, the three ships set sail for Tel Aviv, and were made to look like ships that had been purchased by foreign owners for commercial use. In Tel Aviv, the ships were fitted with small field guns dating to the late 19th century and anti-aircraft guns. After the British left Haifa port on 30 June, Haifa became the main base of the Israeli Navy. In October 1948, a <b>submarine</b> <b>chaser</b> was purchased from the United States. The warships were manned by former merchant seamen, former crewmembers of Aliyah Bet ships, Israelis who had served in the Royal Navy during World War II, and foreign volunteers. The newly refurbished and crewed warships served on coastal patrol duties and bombarded Egyptian coastal installations in and around the Gaza area all the way to Port Said.|$|E

50|$|The PC-461 class <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> were a {{class of}} 343 <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers</b> built mainly for the US Navy built from 1941-1944. The PC-461s were based {{primarily}} on two experimental <b>submarine</b> <b>chasers,</b> the PC-451 and PC-452. While PC-461 began the series, {{the first of the}} class to enter service was the PC-471. As part of the Lend-Lease program, 46 ships of this class were transferred to allies of the United States. Fifty-nine PC-461s were converted to other types of patrol vessels. Eight vessels of this class were lost, and one vessel was lost after conversion to a PGM-9 class motor gunboat. Only one PC-461, USS PC-566 commanded by Lieutenant Commander (later Captain) Herbert G. Claudius, actually sank a submarine, , during World War II.|$|R
