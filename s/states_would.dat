5|$|Like {{the other}} New River settlers, Cooley did not buy land; he simply {{occupied}} {{the land in}} hope that the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> eventually survey the area and grant ownership to the present settlers. The settlement was primarily populated by Bahamians, who survived by turtling, fishing, shipbuilding and wrecking.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status {{to any of the}} princely states, nor would it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that the <b>states</b> <b>would</b> sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and that the <b>states</b> <b>would</b> suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements.|$|E

The Palestinian <b>state</b> <b>would</b> also {{be defined as}} a [...] "non-militarized state", and would not possess conventional military forces, but would be allowed to have a [...] "strong security force". The Palestinian <b>state</b> <b>would</b> also have an international force for border security and deterrence.|$|R

5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the <b>states</b> <b>would</b> have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the <b>states</b> <b>would</b> be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the <b>states</b> <b>would</b> have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E
5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 <b>states</b> <b>would</b> now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E
5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern <b>states</b> <b>would</b> dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

50|$|The {{powers of}} the {{proposed}} Head of <b>State</b> <b>would</b> not have been substantially {{different from those of}} the Queen and Governor General. The Head of <b>State</b> <b>would</b> have been vested with the powers of executive government, but those powers would have been normally exercised on the advice of ministers.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem can}} be {{interpreted}} as a search problem where the set of possible partial-order plans is the search space. The initial <b>state</b> <b>would</b> be the plan with the open preconditions equal to the goal conditions. The final <b>state</b> <b>would</b> be any plan with no open preconditions, i.e. a solution.|$|R
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} did not end the U.S. trade embargo, since ending the embargo required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and {{to lay the groundwork for}} more economic involvement.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootdown, South Korea, {{owner of the}} {{aircraft}} and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal for the Soviet Union to salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters. If it did so, the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> now be legally entitled to use force against the Soviets, if necessary, to prevent retrieval of {{any part of the}} plane.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Harrison and Gresham {{competed for}} {{influence}} at the 1884 Republican National Convention; the delegation ended up supporting James G. Blaine, the eventual nominee. In the Senate, Harrison achieved passage of his Dependent Pension Bill, {{only to see}} it vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. His efforts to further the admission of new western states were stymied by Democrats, who feared that the new <b>states</b> <b>would</b> elect Republicans to Congress.|$|E
50|$|The {{right of}} return of Greek Cypriots to {{their homes in the}} areas coming {{under the control of the}} Turkish Cypriot {{component}} <b>state</b> <b>would</b> be strictly limited if not, in some cases, forbidden, thus the possibility of Turkish Cypriots becoming a minority in their respective component <b>state</b> <b>would</b> not exist.|$|R

5|$|In Tucson between April 2 and April 5, 1860, a {{convention}} of settlers from the southern half of the New Mexico Territory drafted a constitution for a provisional Arizona Territory, three years before the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> create such a territory. This proposed territory consisted of the part of New Mexico Territory south of 33° 40' N. On April 2, they elected a governor, Lewis Owings. The provisional territory was to exist {{until such time as}} an official territory was created, but that proposal was rejected by the U.S. Congress at the time.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the bill}} granted the Governor of Alaska {{authority}} {{to enter into}} reciprocal mental health treatment agreements with the governors of other states. Alaskans who became mentally ill in the lower 48 <b>states</b> <b>would</b> be properly treated locally until they could be returned to Alaska; likewise, citizens of the lower 48 who fell mentally ill in Alaska would receive care there, before being returned to their home states.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> manage the businesses. With the money generated, the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand <b>would</b> benefit. The <b>state</b> <b>would</b> not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|R

5|$|It was {{intended}} to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so—something that it was thought the <b>states</b> <b>would</b> not accept.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 2010 the European Council agreed a two line {{amendment}} to the EU Lisbon Treaty {{to allow for a}} permanent bail-out mechanism to be established including stronger sanctions. In March 2011, the European Parliament approved the treaty amendment after receiving assurances that the European Commission, rather than EU <b>states,</b> <b>would</b> play 'a central role' in running the ESM. The ESM is an intergovernmental organisation under public international law. It is located in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence {{announced}} at a In Defense of Christians annual dinner meeting in Washington that the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> stop funding United Nations relief efforts, cases tackling {{the persecution of}} Christians in the Middle East, but insisted that the U.S. would instead help and aid Christians directly through the U.S. Agency for International Development. Pence said {{that he will be}} visiting the Middle East in December and will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss peace agreements.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln {{campaign}} began cultivating {{a nationwide}} teen and young adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which {{it used to}} generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern <b>states</b> <b>would</b> vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's {{delegation}} did {{not attend}} the convention. Edward Rucker, a Tennessean who happened to be in Baltimore, was picked to cast its 15 votes, so that all the <b>states</b> <b>would</b> endorse Van Buren. Senator Silas Wright, of New York, prevailed upon Rucker to vote for Johnson, giving him just more than twice the votes cast for Rives, and the nomination.|$|E
5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) {{determined}} how the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> {{control and}} manage the nuclear technology it had jointly developed with its World War II allies, the United Kingdom and Canada. Most significantly, the Act ruled that nuclear weapon development and nuclear power management would be under civilian, rather than military control, and established the United States Atomic Energy Commission for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|South Carolina <b>State</b> <b>would</b> {{maintain}} their dominance {{for the remainder}} of the 1970, winning 5 MEAC football titles in the decade. In 1976, A&T spoiled South Carolina State's chances at a perfect season. In their 1976 meeting, the Aggies handed the Bulldogs their lone defeat with a closely contested 15-14 victory in Greensboro, NC. Although suffering a loss to the rival Aggies, South Carolina <b>State</b> <b>would</b> go on to win the MEAC title and be crowned the Black College Football National Champions. From 1977 to 1985, the South Carolina <b>State</b> <b>would</b> go on a 9-game winning streak, bringing the series record to a tie in 1982.|$|R
