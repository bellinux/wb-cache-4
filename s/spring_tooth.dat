The digging <b>spring</b> <b>tooth</b> for corn stubble harvester including self-exited vibration S-shaped spring handle and curved chisel-shaped bionic tooth is designed based on the mechanism of drag reduction of self-excited vibration and bionic drag reduction for reduce digging resistance and power consumption, and the statics analysis of digging <b>spring</b> <b>tooth</b> is done by ANSYS software, the stress and strain distribution diagrams show the design is reasonable...|$|E
40|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War II {{augmented}} {{the necessity of}} utilizing agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s resources to the fullest extent in meeting increased food demands with reduced supplies of labor. One of the principal means of expanding production under such conditions is by fuller use of available farm machinery. Unfortunately, however, when a state of national emergency was declared in May, 1941, little was known either about the utilization of Iowa farm machinery or about the numbers of various types of machines available on the farms. To provide the needed information a survey was conducted in August and September of 1941 {{with the cooperation of}} the Work Projects Administration and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Information was collected in August from 2, 911 farms regarding corn planters, grain binders, grain drills, double disks, single disks, hay loaders, manure spreaders, mowers, plows, rakes, rollers, seeders, spike harrows and <b>spring</b> <b>tooth</b> harrows. The September survey obtained information from 3, 012 farms on. cornpickers, combines, ensilage cutters, grain elevators, corn shellers, feed grinders, milking machines, tractors, trucks, trailers and wagons 2 (table 1) ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, field {{cultivator}} (FC), disk harrow (HD), combination of cultivator with <b>spring</b> <b>teeth</b> and rotary harrow (CS+RH) {{were used as}} secondary tillage equipment in spring. Physical properties of soil such as bulk density, porosity, mean weight diameter and aggregate stability were determined before and after tillage. Moreover, effect of different seedbed preparation techniques on yield of sunflower was also investigated. In {{the result of the}} study, differentiations among the secondary tillage equipment were observed due to bulk density and porosity. Small sized aggregates (1 - 5 mm) were highly in tillage with combination of cultivator with <b>spring</b> <b>teeth</b> and rotary harrow. While the mean weight diameter, which shows the durability of aggregates to water, was 2. 83 mm before tillage, it was 3. 96 mm in tillage with DH, 1. 80 mm in tillage with FC and 2. 50 mm in tillage with combination equipment. Although the mean weight diameter in tillage with DH increased, decreased in tillage with FC. The best aggregate stability obtained from seedbed preparation by disc harrow. On the other hand {{field cultivator}} is the most affective soil embossing tool while the cultivator with <b>spring</b> <b>teeth</b> rotary harrow combination is smashing. The yield values were found 2. 002 Mg ha- 1 with DH, 2. 106 Mg ha- 1 with FC, 2. 175 Mg ha- 1 with CS+RH...|$|R
40|$|It is {{imperative}} {{to carry out research}} on residual plastic film collection technology to solve the serious problem of farmland pollution. The residual plastic film baler was designed as a package for film strip collection, cleaning and baling. The collection device is a core component of the baler. Response surface analysis was used in this study to optimize the structure and working parameters for improving the collection efficiency of residual film and the impurity of film package. The results show that the factors affecting the collection rate of residual film and the impurity of the film package are the speed ratio (k) between the trash removal roller and eccentric collection mechanism, the number (z) and the mounting angle (θ) of <b>spring</b> <b>teeth</b> in the same revolution plane. For the collection rate, the importance of the three factors are in the order, k>z>θ. Meanwhile, for the impurity, the importance of three factors are in the order, z>k>θ.

40|$|The aim of {{this animal}} study {{was to develop a}} model of {{orthodontic}} tooth movement using a microimplant as a TSAD in rodents. A finite element model of the TSAD in alveolar bone was built using μCT images of rat maxilla to determine the von Mises stresses and displacement in the alveolar bone surrounding the TSAD. For in vivo validation of the FE model, Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 25) were used and a Stryker 1. 2 × 3 [*]mm microimplant was inserted in the right maxilla and used to protract the right first permanent molar using a NiTi closed coil <b>spring.</b> <b>Tooth</b> movement measurements were taken at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. At 8 weeks, animals were euthanized and tissues were analyzed by histology and EPMA. FE modeling showed maximum von Mises stress of 45 [*]Mpa near the apex of TSAD but the average von Mises stress was under 25 [*]Mpa. Appreciable tooth movement of 0. 62 ± 0. 04 [*]mm at 4 weeks and 1. 99 ± 0. 14 [*]mm at 8 weeks was obtained. Histological and EPMA results demonstrated no active bone remodeling around the TSAD at 8 weeks depicting good secondary stability.

40|$|Sixteen {{acres of}} corn were grown {{on the grounds}} of the Iowa Experiment Station in 1889. The {{principal}} part of it was produced from the best ears of our last year’s crop of Learning corn, and the remainder consisted of Arleus and early Mastodon corn. It was grown on a black heavy soil, which was too wet formerly in wet seasons, to produce paying crops of anything, except grass; but last year it was tile-drained thoroughly. The greater part of the field had been used for many years as a pasture and the remainder, (perhaps five acres) was a part of an old field which had been used for different kinds of crops. It was well plowed early in September, 1888. Last spring, we ran over it twice with a disc harrow and once with a reversible harrow and then plowed it about eight inches deep. Then we ran over it again with a disc harrow and a reversible harrow and also with a heavy farm roller. It was planted May 2 d and 3 d, with a two horse planter in rows three feet and eight inches apart. From two to three grains were planted in each of the hills, which were thirty inches apart in the rows; but the entire field was thinned afterwards to two stalks in each hill. The field was harrowed twice with a Thomas smoothing harrow after the com came up; when it was divided into four lots, each of which was cultivated four times afterwards and hoed once. The south lot was cultivated each time with the Tower cultivator. The lot next to it was cultivated each time with the Eagle- Claw cultivator. The next or third lot, was cultivated with the riding Pearl cultivator, and the remainder of the field each time with the Albion <b>Spring</b> <b>Tooth</b> cultivator. The work of the Tower cultivator was excellent where oat stubble had been plowed under; but where old weeds or corn stalks were near the surface of the ground, it did not work well. The work of the Eagle-Claw cultivator was better than could be done by the walking or riding plows which are used in every neighborhood; because it pulverizes the surface of the ground better and leaves it level. But the Albion 248 <b>Spring</b> <b>Tooth</b> cultivator excels all other kinds which we have used, on all kinds of ground and in every respect. When our crop of corn was husked and measured during the latter part of October, the yield of the entire field proved to be eighty bushels per acre of sound shelled corn. I find from the reports of the Secretary of the Iowa Board -of Agriculture, that the average yield of corn in Iowa for the years 1883 - 8 inclusive, was 31 and 312 / 3 bushels per acre. The highest average yield per acre for a single year, was considered remarkable, being 411 / 4 bushels. When we compare such crops with our crop, we can not help asking, why are there such differences...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how micro-osteoperforations (MOPs) affect tooth movements and bone characteristics, including bone turnover, bone density, and bone volume. Methods: A split-mouth design with 7 beagle dogs was used to evaluate bone surrounding maxillary second premolars that had been retracted for 7 weeks. The maxillary third premolars were extracted and, after 1 month of healing, 8 MOPs (1. 5 mm wide and 7 mm deep created with the PROPEL device) were placed without flaps around the experimental side maxillary second premolars. The maxillary second premolars were retracted bilaterally with 200 g nickel-titanium closed coil <b>springs.</b> <b>Tooth</b> movements were measured intraorally and radiographically. Microcomputed tomography analysis was used to evaluate the material density and bone volume fraction of bone adjacent to the moving teeth. Hematoxylin and eosin sections and fluorescent sections were used to examine the bone. Results: Overall tooth movements were slightly greater on the MOP side, but neither the intraoral tooth movement measurements nor radiographic tooth movement measurements showed statistically significant (p= 0. 866, p= 0. 528) differences. There also were no statistically significant differences in bone density (p= 0. 237) and bone volume fraction (p= 0. 398). Fluorescent image and histologic evaluations also showed no apparent differences near the tooth being moved. Bone healing was evident in and near the MOP sites, which had nearly, but not completely repaired by 7 weeks. Regions of acellular bone were evident extending approximately 0. 8 mm from the MOP sites. Conclusions: The extent of MOPs effects on tooth movements are limited. MOPs placed 3 mm away do not increase tooth movements and have little or no effect on bone adjacent to the tooth being moved...|$|R

40|$|A wheat {{stubble field}} (clay-loam, light alkali; light salty and poor of organic matter) was {{established}} to carry out an experiment at Gökhöyük Agricultural Institute, Turkey. Effects of three different tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage on penetration resistance, emergence time, shooting degree and yield were investigated. Conventional tillage used a moldboard plough for primary tilling and a combined <b>spring</b> tine cultivator-spike <b>tooth</b> harrow for consecutive secondary tilling. Reduced tillage included only a cultivator-tooth harrow combination. No-tillage was accomplished by a direct (stubble) drill.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{elucidate}} {{the pattern of}} initiation of the first teeth and the pattern of tooth replacement on the dentary of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), throughout nearly all stages of its life cycle, using serially sectioned heads and jaws, cleared and stained animals, and X-rays. The dentary teeth are set in one row. Tooth germs appear around hatching, first in odd positions, followed by even positions. From position 8 further backwards, teeth are added in adjacent positions. The first replacement teeth appear in animals of about 30 mm fork length. On the dentary of early life stages (alevins and fry), every position in the tooth row holds a functional (i. e. attached and erupted) tooth and a replacement tooth. The alternating pattern set up anteriorly in the dentary by the first-generation teeth changes in juveniles (parr) whereby teeth are in a similar functional (for the erupted teeth) or developmental stage (for the replacement teeth) every three positions. This pattern is also observed in marine animals during their marine life phase and in both sexes of adult animals prior to spawning (grilse and salmon), but every position now holds either a functional tooth or a mineralised replacement tooth. This is likely {{due to the fact}} that replacement tooth germs have to grow to a larger size before mineralisation starts. In the following <b>spring,</b> the dentary <b>tooth</b> pattern of animals that have survived spawning (kelts) is highly variable. The abundance of functional teeth in post-spawning animals nevertheless indicates that teeth are not lost over winter...|$|R
