40|$|Turbo {{molecular}} {{vacuum pumps}} constitute {{a critical component}} in many accelerator installations, where failures can be costly {{in terms of both}} money and lost beam time. Catastrophic failures can be averted if prior warning is given through a continuous online monitoring scheme. This paper describes the use of modem machine learning techniques for online monitoring of the pump condition through the measurement and analysis of pump vibrations. Abductive machine learning is used for modeling the pump status as 'good ' or 'bad ' using both radial and axial vibration signals measured close to the pump bearing. Compared to other statistical methods and neural network techniques, this approach offers faster and highly automated model synthesis, requiring little or no user intervention. Normalized 50 -channel spectra derived from the low frequency region (0 - 10 kHz) of the pump vibration spectra provided data inputs for model development. Models derived by training on only 10 observations predict the correct value of the logical pump <b>status</b> <b>output</b> with 100 % accuracy for an evaluation population as large as 500 cases.

40|$|Existing {{techniques}} for sensor validation and sensor fusion are {{often based on}} analytical sensor models. Such models can be arbitrarily complex and consequently Gaussian distributions are often assumed, generally with a detrimental effect on overall system performance. A holistic approach has therefore been adopted {{in order to develop}} two novel and complementary approaches to sensor validation and fusion based on empirical data. The first uses the Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator to provide competitive sensor fusion. The new algorithm is shown to reliably detect and compensate for bias errors, spike errors, hardover faults, drift faults and erratic operation, affecting up to three of the five sensors in the array. The inherent smoothing action of the kernel estimator provides effective noise cancellation and the fused result is more accurate than the single 'best sensor'. A Genetic Algorithm has been used to optimise the Nadaraya-Watson fuser design. The second approach uses analytical redundancy to provide the on-line sensor <b>status</b> <b>output</b> μH∈[0, 1], where μH= 1 indicates the sensor output is valid and μH= 0 when the sensor has failed. This fuzzy measure is derived from change detection parameters based on spectral analysis of the sensor output signal. The validation scheme can reliably detect a wide range of sensor fault conditions. An appropriate context dependent fusion operator can then be used to perform competitive, cooperative or complementary sensor fusion, with a <b>status</b> <b>output</b> from the fuser providing a useful qualitative indication of the status of the sensors used to derive the fused result. The operation of both schemes is illustrated using data obtained from an array of thick film metal oxide pH sensor electrodes. An ideal pH electrode will sense only the activity of hydrogen ions, however the selectivity of the metal oxide device is worse than the conventional glass electrode. The use of sensor fusion can therefore reduce measurement uncertainty by combining readings from multiple pH sensors having complementary responses. The array can be conveniently fabricated by screen printing sensors using different metal oxides onto a single substrate...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the use of}} fuzzy logic to support the evaluation of project status. A brief description of fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic {{and the process of}} calculation is given. The major goal {{of this paper is to}} present an expert decision-making fuzzy model for evaluating project status. The model results from the application of the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. This fuzzy model is based on two basic indices, schedule performance index (SPI) and cost performance index (CPI), of earned value management (EVM). The ad- vantage of the fuzzy model is the ability to transform the input indices SPI and CPI into linguistic variables, as well as linguistic evaluation of over- all project <b>status</b> (<b>output).</b> With this approach it is possible to simulate the risk and uncertainty that are always associated with real projects.

40|$|Cropping schemes have {{developed}} in east-central Argentina for rainfed soybean (Glycine max Merr.) production that invariably employ no-tillage management. Often these schemes include growing soybean {{in a sequence}} of crops including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). The full impact of various rotation schemes on soil water balance through a sequence of seasons has not been explored, although {{the value of these}} rotations has been studied experimentally. The objective of this work was to investigate through simulations, potential differences in temporal soil water status among rotations over five years. In this study, mechanistic models of soybean (Soy), maize (Maz), and wheat (Wht) were linked over a five-years period at Marcos Juárez, Argentina to simulate soil water status, crop growth, and yield of four no-till rotations (Soy/Soy, Soy/Wht, Soy/Maz, and Soy/Maz/Wht). Published data on sowing dates and initial soil water contents in the first year from a no-till rotation experiment were used as inputs to the model. After the first year, soil water <b>status</b> <b>output</b> from the model was used to initiate the next crop simulation in the sequence. The results of these simulations indicated a positive impact on soil water balance resulting from crop residue on the soil surface under no-till management. Continuous soybean and the two-year soybean/maize rotation did not efficiently use the available water from rainfall. Residue from maize was simulated to be especially effective in suppressing soil evaporation. Thus, the Soy/Maz simulation results indicated that this rotation resulted in enhanced soil water retention, increased deep water percolation, and increased soybean yields compared with continuous soybean crops. The simulated results matched well with experimental observations. The three-crop rotation of Soy/Maz/Wht did not increase simulated soybean yields, but the additional water retained as a result of decreased soil evaporation resulting from the maize residue allowed the addition of a wheat crop in this two-year rotation. Simulated soybean yields were poorly correlated with both the amount of soil water at sowing and the rainfall during the cropping period. These results highlight the importance of temporal distribution of rainfall on final yield. These models proved a valuable tool for assessing the consequences of various rotation schemes now being employed in Argentina on temporal soil water status, and ultimately crop yield.

We developed a statistical model to determine likely points of origin of the outbreak to help identify variables associated with disease emergence and spread. We modeled disease spread across the study area, using suitable habitat conditions for apes as proxy for local ape densities. Infectious <b>status</b> <b>outputs</b> from that spread model were then used alongside vegetation, temperature, precipitation and human impact factors as explanatory variables in a Generalized Linear Model framework to explain observed 2007 - 2011 ape nest trends in the region.

Roads were consistently associated with attenuation of modeled virus spread. As disease is amongst the leading threats to great apes, gaining a better understanding of disease transmission dynamics in these species is imperative. Identifying ecological drivers underpinning a disease emergence event and transmission dynamics in apes is critical to creating better predictive models to guide wildlife management, develop potential protective measures for wildlife and to reduce potential zoonotic transmission to humans.

40|$|Analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) {{converters}} {{are important}} blocks in signal processing system {{because they provide}} {{the link between the}} analog world and digital systems. Compared with Nyquist-rate data converters, oversampling data converters are more desirable for modern submicron technologies with low voltage supplies. Today, all existing oversampling modulators in popular use are derived from sigma-delta modulation. Stability is the most significant problem in the sigma-delta modulator, because the ultimate accuracy is limited by stability. As the aggressiveness of the design increases, the margin of stability diminishes rapidly. This thesis presents the design and experimental results of the first prototype circuit implementation of the novel oversampling modulation scheme proposed by Dr. Takis Zourntos. This new class of oversampling modulators are theoretically stable. With less stability limitation, the new class of modulators can potentially achieve higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or less power by designing the modulator more aggressively. This thesis describes the methods and procedures of how the new oversampling modulation theory is implemented into a circuit. Some novel circuit architectures are proposed in this modulator, such as a filter which can provide <b>status</b> <b>outputs</b> for the controller and realize arbitrary zeros and poles, comparators with synchronization latches to eliminate the effect of metastability, and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with current calibration circuits for high linearity.
