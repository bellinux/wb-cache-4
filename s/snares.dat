5|$|The British post-hardcore band Fall of Efrafa is {{a concept}} band who has {{recorded}} a trilogy of albums based loosely on the mythology of Watership Down. This trilogy is known as The Warren of <b>Snares</b> and consists of the albums Owsla (2006), Elil (2007) and Inlé (2009).|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} is further complicated when considering fusion in vivo since biological fusion {{is almost always}} regulated {{by the action of}} membrane-associated proteins. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Eukaryotic cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the <b>SNAREs.</b> SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether <b>SNAREs</b> are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.|$|E

The next day, while searching for GoldenEye's {{satellite}} dish, they are shot down. Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks Bond. After a fight ensues, Bond shoots down the helicopter, which <b>snares</b> Onatopp and crushes her to death against a tree. Bond and Natalya watch water draining out of a lake, uncovering the satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, and Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the second GoldenEye (Misha), concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.|$|E

50|$|The <b>snare</b> drum {{originates}} {{from the}} tabor, a drum first used {{to accompany the}} flute. The tabor evolved into more modern versions, such as the kit <b>snare,</b> marching <b>snare,</b> tarol <b>snare,</b> and piccolo <b>snare.</b> Each type presents a different style of percussion and size. The <b>snare</b> drum that one might see in a popular music concert is usually used in a backbeat style to create rhythm. In marching bands, it {{can do the same}} but is used mostly for a front beat. In comparison with the marching <b>snare,</b> the kit <b>snare</b> is generally smaller in length, while the piccolo is the smallest of the three. The <b>snare</b> drum is easily recognizable by its loud cracking sound when struck firmly with a drum stick or mallet. The depth of the sound varies from <b>snare</b> to <b>snare</b> because of the different techniques and construction qualities of the drum. Some of these qualities are head material and tension, dimensions, and rim and drum shell materials and construction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Snare</b> drums may be {{made from}} various wood, metal, acrylic, or composite, e.g., {{fiberglass}} materials. A typical diameter for <b>snare</b> drums is 14 in (36 cm). Marching <b>snare</b> drums are deeper (taller) in size than <b>snare</b> drums normally used for orchestral or drum kit purposes, often measuring 12 in deep (tall). Orchestral and drum kit <b>snare</b> drum shells are about 6 in (15 cm) deep. Piccolo <b>snare</b> drums are even shallower at about 3 in (7.6 cm) deep. Soprano, popcorn, and firecracker <b>snare</b> drums have diameters as small as 8 in (20 cm) and are often used for higher-pitched special effects.|$|R
5|$|The {{drive to}} capture wildlife, and {{particularly}} slow lorises, is increasingly dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In {{the case of}} long-lived primates, such as the slow lorises, populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow lorises are particularly vulnerable {{because they tend to}} freeze when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire <b>snares,</b> and spotlights, have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point of sustainability. These new factors threaten slow loris survival.|$|E
5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, <b>snares,</b> drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E
5|$|With demos completed, Green Day {{relocated}} to Los Angeles to continue {{work on the}} album. The group first recorded at Ocean Way Recording, then moved to Capitol Studios to complete the album. Cool brought multiple drum kits to the studio, including over seventy-five <b>snares.</b> Drum tracks were recorded on two-inch tape to produce a compressed sound and were transferred to Pro Tools to be digitally mixed with the other instruments. All drum tracks were produced at Ocean Way Studio B, picked for its high ceiling and acoustic tiling, which produced better sound. The songs were recorded in order as they appear on the track listing, which was a first for the trio. Each song would be recorded in its entirety before proceeding to the next. They reversed {{the order in which}} they recorded guitars and bass (recording the guitars first), as they heard that was how the Beatles recorded songs. Armstrong admitted that at points during the recording process he expressed fear at the amount of work before him, likening it to climbing a mountain.|$|E

25|$|Primed vesicles fuse {{very quickly}} in {{response}} to calcium elevations in the cytoplasm. This fusion event {{is thought to be}} mediated directly by the <b>SNAREs</b> and driven by the energy provided from SNARE assembly. The calcium-sensing trigger for this event is the calcium-binding synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. The ability of <b>SNAREs</b> to mediate fusion in a calcium-dependent manner recently has been reconstituted in vitro. Consistent with <b>SNAREs</b> being essential for the fusion process, v-SNARE and t-SNARE mutants of C. elegans are lethal. Similarly, mutants in Drosophila and knockouts in mice indicate that these <b>SNARES</b> {{play a critical role in}} synaptic exocytosis.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic cells use entirely {{different}} classes of fusion proteins, the best studied {{of which are}} the <b>SNAREs.</b> SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether <b>SNAREs</b> are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion. Even once the role of <b>SNAREs</b> or other specific proteins is illuminated, a unified understanding of fusion proteins is unlikely as {{there is an enormous}} diversity of structure and function within these classes, and very few themes are conserved.|$|E

The geography of these islands is characterized by tundra, with some trees on <b>Snares</b> and Auckland Islands. These islands are all located near the Antarctic Convergence (with Kerguelen {{south of the}} Convergence) and are properly considered to be subantarctic islands.|$|E

Through a large amount of experimentation, metal carriers made their debut midway through the 2014 season for halftime and parade use only. The <b>snares</b> and basses are still carried by traditional sling for pregame, due to the visuals done with the drums that add to the excitement of the Ramp entrance.|$|E
25|$|Tom-tom drums, or toms for short, are drums without <b>snares</b> {{and played}} with sticks (or {{whatever}} tools the music style requires), and are the most numerous drums in most kits. They provide the bulk of most drum fills and solos.|$|E
5000|$|While General MIDI {{does not}} specify {{particular}} sound characteristics for its drum kits, it does include two distinct <b>snare</b> sounds, {{sometimes referred to}} as acoustic <b>snare</b> (38) and electric <b>snare</b> (40), the latter usually implemented with a [...] "gated snare" [...] sound.

40|$|The {{synaptic}} vesicle protein synaptobrevin {{engages with}} syntaxin and SNAP- 25 {{to form the}} <b>SNARE</b> complex, which drives membrane fusion in neuronal exocytosis. In the <b>SNARE</b> complex, the <b>SNARE</b> motif of synaptobrevin forms a 55 -residue helix, {{but it has been}} assumed to be mostly unstructured in its prefusion form. NMR data for full-length synaptobrevin in dodecylphosphocholine micelles reveals two transient helical segments flanked by natively disordered regions and a third more stable helix. Transient helix I comprises the most N-terminal part of the <b>SNARE</b> motif, transient helix II extends the <b>SNARE</b> motif into the juxtamembrane region, and the more stable helix III is the transmembrane domain. These helices may have important consequences for <b>SNARE</b> complex folding and fusion: helix I likely forms a nucleation site, the C-terminal disordered <b>SNARE</b> motif may act as a folding arrest signal, and helix II likely couples <b>SNARE</b> complex folding and fusion...|$|R

25|$|This {{structural}} evolution seems {{highly unlikely}} to have arisen by chance alone; therefore, many researchers suggest this key adaption in Utricularia allowed for radical morphological evolution of relatively simple trap structures to highly complex and efficient <b>snares.</b> This adaptation may have enhanced the genus' fitness by increasing its range of prey, rate of capture, and retention of nutrients during prey decomposition.|$|E
25|$|Marching snare drums are {{deeper in}} size than <b>snares</b> {{normally}} used for orchestral or drum kit purposes. This gives the drum the big, full sound necessary for outdoor use. Standard sizes (listed as diameter x depth) are 13x11 and 14x12 inches. They can weigh anywhere from 16-45lb. Smaller sizes such as 13x9 {{have become increasingly}} popular in recent times {{with the proliferation of}} indoor drum lines.|$|E
40|$|<b>SNARE</b> {{proteins}} play {{a critical}} role in intracellular membrane fusion by forming tight complexes that bring two membranes together and involve sequences called <b>SNARE</b> motifs. These motifs have a high tendency to form amphipathic coiled-coils that assemble into four-helix bundles, and often precede transmembrane regions. NMR studies in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles suggested that the N-terminal half of the <b>SNARE</b> motif from the neuronal <b>SNARE</b> synaptobrevin binds to membranes, which appeared to contradict previous biophysical studies of synaptobrevin in liposomes. NMR analyses of synaptobrevin reconstituted into nanodiscs and into liposomes now show that most of its <b>SNARE</b> motif, except for the basic C terminus, is highly flexible, exhibiting cross-peak patterns and transverse relaxation rates that are very similar to those observed in solution. Considering the proximity to the bilayer imposed by membrane anchoring, our data show that most of the synaptobrevin <b>SNARE</b> motif has a remarkable reluctance to bind membranes. This conclusion is further supported by NMR experiments showing that the soluble synaptobrevin <b>SNARE</b> motif does not bind to liposomes, even though it does bind to DPC micelles. These results show that nanodiscs provide a much better membrane model than DPC micelles in this system, and that most of the <b>SNARE</b> motif of membrane-anchored synaptobrevin is accessible for <b>SNARE</b> complex formation. We propose that the charge and hydrophobicity of <b>SNARE</b> motifs is optimized to enable formation of highly stable <b>SNARE</b> complexes while at the same time avoiding membrane binding, which could hinder <b>SNARE</b> complex assembly...|$|R

50|$|Much {{scholarly}} debate exists {{over the}} role of <b>SNARE</b> proteins in kiss-and-run exocytosis. <b>SNARE</b> proteins mediate vesicle fusion - the exocytosis of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane at the fusion pore. When a vesicle fuses with the presynaptic membrane, a <b>SNARE</b> transition occurs from a trans position to a cis position, followed by <b>SNARE</b> dissociation. This process was thought to be irreversible. If kiss-and-run exocytosis occurs, however, then it would suggest that reversible association of <b>SNARE</b> proteins occurs and mediates the kiss-and-run mode of exocytosis. Manipulation of the <b>SNARE</b> proteins during kiss-and-run may give more insight to how the two relate, and more scholarly research is required.|$|R
