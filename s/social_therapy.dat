2500|$|The term {{group therapy}} {{was first used}} around 1920 by Jacob L. Moreno, whose main {{contribution}} was the development of psychodrama, in which groups were used as both cast and audience for the exploration of individual problems by reenactment {{under the direction of}} the leader. The more analytic and exploratory use of groups in both hospital and out-patient settings was pioneered by a few European psychoanalysts who emigrated to the USA, such as Paul Schilder, who treated severely neurotic and mildly psychotic out-patients in small groups at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The power of groups was most influentially demonstrated in Britain during the Second World War, when several psychoanalysts and psychiatrists proved the value of group methods for officer selection in the War Office Selection Boards. A chance to run an Army psychiatric unit on group lines was then given to several of these pioneers, notably Wilfred Bion and Rickman, followed by S. H. Foulkes, Main, and Bridger. The Northfield Hospital in Birmingham gave its name to what came to be called the two [...] "Northfield Experiments", which provided the impetus for the development since the war of both <b>social</b> <b>therapy,</b> that is, the therapeutic community movement, and the use of small groups for the treatment of neurotic and personality disorders. Today group therapy is used in clinical settings and in private practice settings.|$|E

He argues that <b>social</b> <b>therapy</b> is more about, [...] "empowering people to help one another." [...] Group therapy {{is a form of}} <b>social</b> <b>therapy,</b> but with the evolution of technology, <b>social</b> <b>therapy</b> is evolving into other forms.

40|$|Background: In {{occupational}} science, {{the discussion}} about social issues and the link with justice and occupations in daily life has grown {{in the last two}} decades. The occupational justice concept articulates occupational equity, occupational fairness, occupational empowerment and occupational rights (Wilcock 2 ̆ 6 Townsend, 2000). Social injustice exists when people face persistent disadvantages that restrict their social inclusion both as individuals and communities, and this concept calls us all to reflect on our intellectual and practical responsibility to develop ways to work toward social inclusion (Townsend 2 ̆ 6 Wilcock, 2004). <b>Social</b> Occupational <b>Therapy</b> aims to work toward social inclusion with individuals and groups who experience persistent social, cultural, and economic disadvantage; and it is well developed in Brazil (Barros, Ghirardi, Lopes, 2005). In a society with pervasive inequity, the research on inequity that has been used to develop <b>Social</b> Occupational <b>Therapy</b> emphasizes interprofessional practice, including occupation-based interventions, connecting the personal level and macro level. The claim in <b>Social</b> Occupational <b>Therapy</b> is that a politically and ethically framed perspective is essential for researchers to understand contemporary social issues and to use research knowledge to improve living conditions, to enable inclusive entitlements and social and occupational rights. Statement of purpose: This research poster will consider if occupational justice is an applicable concept in Brazil. In order to consider this international use of an occupational science concept, a research project is underway, for which the main question is: What are the possibilities of theoretical dialogue on occupational justice ideas as conceptualized in occupational science and the foundations of Brazilian <b>Social</b> Occupational <b>Therapy?</b> In other words, one of the steps in this project is to understand the realm of knowledge on occupational justice and analyze the applications that are possibile in Brazilian <b>Social</b> Occupational <b>Therapy.</b> Methods: The paper will present a scoping review using occupational justice and <b>Social</b> Occupational <b>Therapy</b> as the main key words, in Portuguese and English. Peer reviewed and grey literatures have been included. Narrative analysis will be done (Levac, Colquhoun 2 ̆ 6 O’Brien, 2010) to reveal trends, similarities, contradictions, and conceptual tensions in the data. Much attention will be given to the contexts in which the literature has been published. Discussion of the scoping review will reflect on how to advance the understanding of what content is widely translatable and what is not, in the different circumstances. Contribution of the study to occupational science: It is expected that the outcomes of this literature review will contribute to a deeper understanding of occupation and its underpinnings and the assumptions of <b>Social</b> Occupational <b>Therapy.</b> As well the literature review will shed light on the potential implications for the use of occupational science and justice knowledge in the education of occupational therapists who practice in macro environments. The learning objectives are to deepen understanding of occupational justice and <b>Social</b> Occupational <b>Therapy.</b> This paper will stimulate discussions on interprofessional education and the translation of knowledge in occupational science across international contexts, indicating others interlocutors to dialogue in Occupational Science.

50|$|Newman and {{his colleagues}} make no effort to {{reconcile}} these points of view. On their view, <b>social</b> <b>therapy</b> is not socialist, but it is Marxist.

40|$|Background: Provision {{of early}} {{intervention}} services {{has increased the}} rate of social recovery in patients with first-episode psychosis; however, many individuals have continuing severe and persistent problems with social functioning. We aimed to assess the efficacy of early intervention services augmented with <b>social</b> recovery <b>therapy</b> in patients with first-episode psychosis. The primary hypothesis was that <b>social</b> recovery <b>therapy</b> plus early intervention services would lead to improvements in social recovery. Methods: We did this single-blind, phase 2, randomised controlled trial (SUPEREDEN 3) at four specialist early intervention services in the UK. We included participants who were aged 16 – 35 years, had non-affective psychosis, had been clients of early intervention services for 12 – 30 months, and had persistent and severe social disability, defined as engagement in less than 30 h per week of structured activity. Participants were randomly assigned (1 : 1), via computer-generated randomisation with permuted blocks (sizes of four to six), to receive <b>social</b> recovery <b>therapy</b> plus early intervention services or early intervention services alone. Randomisation was stratified by sex and recruitment centre (Norfolk, Birmingham, Lancashire, and Sussex). By necessity, participants were not masked to group allocation, but allocation was concealed from outcome assessors. The primary outcome was time spent in structured activity at 9 months, {{as measured by the}} Time Use Survey. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN 61621571. Findings: Between Oct 1, 2012, and June 20, 2014, we randomly assigned 155 participants to receive <b>social</b> recovery <b>therapy</b> plus early intervention services (n= 76) or early intervention services alone (n= 79); the intention-to-treat population comprised 154 patients. At 9 months, 143 (93 %) participants had data for the primary outcome. <b>Social</b> recovery <b>therapy</b> plus early intervention services was associated with an increase in structured activity of 8 · 1 h (95 % CI 2 · 5 – 13 · 6; p= 0 · 0050) compared with early intervention services alone. No adverse events were deemed attributable to study therapy. Interpretation: Our findings show a clinically important benefit of enhanced social recovery on structured activity in patients with first-episode psychosis who received <b>social</b> recovery <b>therapy</b> plus early intervention services. <b>Social</b> recovery <b>therapy</b> might be useful in improving functional outcomes in people with first-episode psychosis, particularly in individuals not motivated to engage in existing psychosocial interventions targeting functioning, or who have comorbid difficulties preventing them from doing so...|$|R
