5000|$|Lescudjack Hill fort is {{the name}} given to the unexcavated Iron Age {{settlement}} located in Penzance, Cornwall. The name might originate from the Cornish words lan (enclosure) and scosek (shielded)- <b>shielded</b> <b>enclosure</b> or, more likely, [...] "nans" [...] (valley) and [...] "cosek" [...] (wooded); however, compare: [...] "lesky" [...] (to burn), [...] "cunnys" [...] (fuel) and [...] "ack" [...] (a place where found), since [...] "LESKInnick" [...] terrace is just below {{on the west side}} of the hill; therefore it could mean a [...] "beacon place". It is positioned on the summit of a steep hill in the east of Penzance and consists of a single rampart enclosing an area of 3 acre. The site has been damaged and contains allotments and an open area of land which has recently been cleared of thick undergrowth. It is reported that a small lead-copper mine was situated [...] "just outside" [...] the ramparts, however all trace of this appears to have vanished.|$|E

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{electromagnetic}} interference regulation, the radiated emission from {{device under test}} such as electronic devices must be carefully manipulated and accurately characterized. Instead of resorting to the direct far-field measurement, in this paper, a novel approach is proposed to model the radiated emission from electronic devices placed in <b>shielding</b> <b>enclosures</b> by using the near electric field only. Based on the Schelkkunoff’s equivalence principle and Raleigh–Carson reciprocity theorem, only the tangential components of the electric field over the ventilation slots and apertures of the <b>shielding</b> <b>enclosure</b> are sufficient to obtain the radiated emissions outside the shielding box if {{the inside of the}} <b>shielding</b> <b>enclosure</b> was filled with perfectly electric conductor (PEC). In order to efficiently model wideband emission, the time-domain sampling scheme is employed. Due to the lack of analytical Green’s function for arbitrary PEC boxes, the radiated emission must be obtained via the full-wave numerical methods by considering the total radiated emission as the superposition between the direct radiation from the equivalent magnetic currents in free space and the scattered field generated by the PEC shielding box. In this study, the state-of-the-art discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method is utilized, which has the flexibility to model irregular geometries, keep high-order accuracy, and more importantly involves only local operations. For open-region problems, a hybridized DGTD and time-domain boundary integration method applied to rigorously truncate the computational domain. To validate the proposed approach, several representative examples are presented and compared with both analytical and numerical results...|$|R
