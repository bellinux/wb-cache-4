40|$|Introduction Various {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that environmental smoking cues elicit smoking-related responses in smokers. However, cue reactivity studies among adolescent smokers are scarce. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of <b>smoking</b> portrayal <b>in</b> movies on immediate <b>smoking</b> behavior <b>in</b> adolescent smokers. Method A total of 65 adolescent daily smokers (between the ages of 16 and 18 years) were exposed to a one-hour movie clip, with or without smoking characters, and were allowed to smoke while watching the movie. Results The exposure to <b>smoking</b> cues <b>in</b> movies had no effect on immediate smoking behavior. This association was not affected by several smoking- and movie-related variables. Conclusions No influence of <b>smoking</b> cues <b>in</b> movies on immediate <b>smoking</b> behavior <b>in</b> adolescent daily smokers was found. More experimental research on the effects of environmental cues on adolescent smokers in different stages of addiction is needed...|$|R

5|$|The Nazi anti-tobacco {{campaign}} included banning <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> trams, {{buses and}} city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, {{and raising the}} tobacco tax. The National Socialists also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. The anti-tobacco movement {{did not have much}} effect {{in the early years of}} the Nazi regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939, but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in postwar Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{recognizing}} {{the harmful effects}} of smoking on health, several items of anti-smoking legislation were enacted. The later 1930s increasingly saw anti-tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis. In 1938, the Luftwaffe and the Reichspost imposed a ban on smoking. Smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions, but also in several public offices and in rest homes. Midwives were restricted from smoking while on duty. In 1939, the Nazi Party outlawed <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> all of its offices premises, and Heinrich Himmler, the then chief of the Schutzstaffel (SS), restricted police personnel and SS officers from smoking while they were on duty. Smoking was also outlawed in schools.|$|E

5|$|The early anti-smoking {{campaign}} {{was considered a}} failure, and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} infant exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) among infants attending child health clinics in regional NSW; the association between such exposure and household smoking behaviours; and the factors associated with <b>smoking</b> restrictions <b>in</b> households with infants. Methods: Parents completed a computer-based questionnaire and infant urine samples were collected. Information was obtained regarding the smoking behaviours of household members and samples were analysed for cotinine. Results: Twenty seven per cent of infants had detectable levels of cotinine. Infant ETS exposure {{was significantly associated with}} the smoking status of household members, absence of complete <b>smoking</b> bans <b>in</b> <b>smoking</b> households and having more than one smoker <b>in</b> the home. <b>Smoking</b> households were significantly less likely to have a complete <b>smoking</b> ban <b>in</b> place. Conclusions: This study suggests that a significant proportion of the population group most vulnerable to ETS were exposed. Implications: Future efforts to reduce children's exposure to ETS need to target cessation by smoking parents, and <b>smoking</b> bans <b>in</b> households of infants where parents are smokers if desired reductions in childhood ETS-related illness are to be realised...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores gender {{differences}} <b>in</b> <b>smoking</b> using information on 15, 277 adults {{obtained from the}} Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2001 and 2005. Applying a decomposition approach extended from the Oaxaca-Blinder method, we obtained factors influencing {{gender differences}} <b>in</b> <b>smoking</b> and estimated their separate contributions. According to the outcomes of decomposition analyses, gender differences in smoking-tendency (or inclination to smoke) accounted for 98 % of the total gender difference <b>in</b> <b>smoking.</b> When the gender difference <b>in</b> <b>smoking</b> was decomposed into specified factors, the difference in smoking-tendency between married men and women {{was found to be}} the most crucial factor as it explained 11 % of the total gender difference <b>in</b> <b>smoking.</b> The gender difference in the proportion of persons attaining a low level of education contributed to a 6 % reduction of the total gender difference <b>in</b> <b>smoking.</b> Additionally, factors influencing the gender-specific smoking-tendency were found to be important in explaining the gender difference <b>in</b> <b>smoking.</b> We conclude that, understanding separate contributions of sets of factors affecting gender differences <b>in</b> <b>smoking</b> and devising appropriate policies could effectively reduce the smoking rate of a target gender group to the level of that of a reference gender group.
