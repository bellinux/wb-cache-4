500|$|Kuwait's 1980 census, {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} the original show's premiere, showed that 48% of its citizens were [...] "either totally illiterate or... barely [...] read or write". [...] Several studies in Kuwait showed that parents' illiteracy adversely affected their children's educational and social development. [...] Half of Kuwaitis {{who lived in the}} rural areas of the country were illiterate. [...] Literacy rates for women and girls were worse: UNESCO reported in 2005 that they [...] "account for two thirds of the region's illiterates". [...] In 2000, before the revived show aired, the Arab region had some of the world's lowest adult literacy rates, at a little over 62%, which was well below the world average of 84% and in developing countries (almost 76.5%). [...] The Kuwaiti 1980 census also <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Kindergarten was free for its citizens, 30% of children aged 3 to 5 attended; the number was much lower for the 12 million preschoolers in the Arab world, at about 2%.

2500|$|On remand, the {{district}} court again held for SAMTA, ruling that the historical record <b>showed</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> local mass transit operations had been largely privately owned in the past, they had also been heavily regulated by state and local governments, creating at least an [...] "inference of sovereignty". Noting {{that the federal government}} had historically exempted the operations of state and local governments from federal regulation in many instances, it ruled that refusing to apply the FLSA would not run counter to a century of regulation, {{as was the case in}} the railroad industry, and that exemption of state and local governments' operations was, in fact, a supervening federal policy. Called on to draw a distinction between those governmental functions that were traditional and those that were not, the Court analogized the task to Justice Potter Stewart's famous definition of pornography in Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964), holding that it was impossible to articulate the distinction but [...] "someone knows it when they see it". Both Garcia and the Department of Labor appealed again.|$|E
60|$|We {{always do}} best to seek {{rational}} explanations in large affairs. It {{may be true}} that “if there were no blunders {{there would be no}} politics,” but when we have made full allowance for blunder, caprice, chance, folly, craft, still reason and the nature of things have a share. The secret of the strange reversal in 1867 of all that had been said, attempted, and done in 1866, would seem to be that the tide of public opinion had suddenly swelled to flood. The same timidity that made the ruling classes dread reform, had the compensation that very {{little in the way of}} popular demonstration was quite enough to frighten them into accepting it. Here the demonstration was not little. Riots in Hyde Park, street processions measured by the mile in the great cities from London up to Glasgow, open-air meetings attended by a hundred, two hundred, two hundred and fifty thousand people at Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the workmen might not be anxious to demand the franchise, yet they would not stand its refusal. In the autumn of 1868 Mr. Bright led a splendid campaign in a series of speeches in England, Scotland, and Ireland, marked by every kind of power. It is worthy of remark that not one of the main changes of that age was carried in parliament without severe agitation out of doors. Catholic emancipation was won by O’Connell; the reform act of 1832 by the political unions; free trade by the league against the corn law. Household suffrage followed the same rule.|$|E

One part responds to the hypnotist while the other retains awareness of reality. Hilgard made subjects take an ice water bath. None mentioned the water being cold or feeling pain. Hilgard then asked the subjects to lift their index finger if they felt pain and 70% of the subjects lifted their index finger.

50|$|The proof {{showed that}} the machine is {{equivalent}} to a variant of a tag system already known to be universal. Smith first constructed a sequence of rule systems showing that the (2,3) Turing machine is capable of arbitrary finite computations. He then employed a novel approach to extend that construction to unbounded computations. The proof proceeds in two stages. The first part emulates the finite evolution of any two-color cyclic tag system. The emulation is a composite {{of a series of}} emulations involving the indexed rule systems 'system 0' through 'system 5'. Each rule system emulates the next one in the sequence. Smith then <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the initial condition of the (2,3) Turing machine is not repetitive, the construction of that initial condition is not universal. Hence the (2,3) Turing machine is universal.|$|E
50|$|Another {{experiment}} {{was conducted by}} Steven Most, along with Daniel Simons, Christopher Chabris and Brian Scholl. Instead of a basketball game, they used stimuli presented by computer displays. In this experiment objects moved randomly on a computer screen.

After several trials, a red cross unexpectedly appeared and traveled across the display, remaining on the computer screen for five seconds. The results of the experiment <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the cross was distinctive from the black and white objects both in color and shape, about a third of participants missed it. They had found that people may be attentionally tuned to certain perceptual dimensions, such as brightness or shape.

This suggests that in regards to language use, both L1 and L2 are accessed and compete for selection during L2 production.|$|E
50|$|Many quantum {{information}} applications, such as quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, and superdense coding, rely on entanglement. However, entanglement is {{a fragile}} quantum property between particles {{and can be}} easily destroyed by loss and noise arising from interaction with the environment, leading to quantum decoherence. Entanglement is therefore considered very hard to use in lossy and noisy environment. Lloyd, Shapiro and collaborators <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> entanglement itself may not survive, the residual correlation between the two initially entangled systems remains much higher than any initial classical states can provide. This implies {{that the use of}} entanglement should not be dismissed in entanglement-breaking scenarios. Quantum illumination takes advantage of this stronger-than-classical residual correlations between two systems to achieve a performance enhancement over all schemes based on transmitting classical states with comparable power levels. Quantum illumination is particularly useful in extremely lossy and noisy situations.|$|E

His first appearance in the Series was when he started Game 4 at the Seibu Dome.

Kishi also became the second pitcher ever to have at least one strikeout every inning in a complete game effort. In an ironic twist, the first was former Giants pitcher Takashi Nishimoto in the 1981 Japan Series against the Nippon-Ham Fighters. Kishi also became the 12th pitcher to throw a complete-game shutout in his first career Japan Series start, with the last one before him being Shunsuke Watanabe in the 2005 Japan Series against the Hanshin Tigers.|$|E

50|$|In 1854, J C Maxwell {{suggested}} a lens whose refractive index distribution {{would allow for}} every region of space to be sharply imaged. Known as the Maxwell fisheye lens, it involves a spherical index function and {{would be expected to}} be spherical in shape as well (Maxwell, 1854). This lens, however, is impractical to make and has little usefulness since only points on the surface and within the lens are sharply imaged and extended objects suffer from extreme aberrations. In 1905, R W Wood used a dipping technique creating a gelatin cylinder with a refractive index gradient that varied symmetrically with the radial distance from the axis. Disk-shaped slices of the cylinder were later shown to have plane faces with radial index distribution. He <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the faces of the lens were flat, they acted like converging and diverging lens depending on whether the index was a decreasing or increasing relative to the radial distance (Wood, 1905). In 1964, a posthumous book of R. K. Luneburg was published in which he described a lens that focuses incident parallel rays of light onto a point on the opposite surface of the lens (Luneburg, 1964). This also limits the applications of the lens because it is difficult to use it to focus visible light; however, it has some usefulness in microwave applications.|$|E
