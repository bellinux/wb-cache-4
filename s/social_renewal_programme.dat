40|$|Developing complex {{indicators}} measuring economic output, {{added value}} and indicators relying on {{an entirely different}} basis, researchers worked {{on the assumption that}} economic output does not correlate strongly with people’s happiness or quality of life. Most measurements relate to countries and federal states. Only a few seek to present or model differences at lower territorial levels. This study discloses the first results of pilot calculations that have been performed as part of Hungary’s <b>Social</b> <b>Renewal</b> <b>Programme.</b> These explore differences at the level of Hungarian districts (LAU 1) with the proviso, that the spatial structure presented only reflects what is called objective well-being. A more comprehensive picture can be obtained only if the subjective well-being dimensions incorporating and weighted by the results of a large-scale sample survey, conducted in the meantime, are also taken into accoun...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} EU cohesion policy {{in the field of}} human resources development and improving conditions for employment. The main objective of the analysis is to present a comprehensive picture about funding opportunities in connection with financing the activities of organisations of the social economy. As a background, the study stresses that the success of the European integration process depends to a great extent on the strength of economic and social cohesion between EU member states and regions. In order to create conditions for sustainable and balanced growth with social inclusion, {{there is a need to}} enhance the competitiveness of less developed regions combating the difficulties of structural change, and to improve their development prospects. To achieve this aim, one of the most important fields is to improve human resources. The paper points out, that EU cohesion policy has a crucial role in reducing disparities. After a general introduction to the EU level regional policy funding, the study focuses on the activities supported by the European Social Fund (ESF). The next part of the study deals with the possible types of the social economy projects and problems of self-financing. The author emphasises that social innovation emerges where State and markets fail to deliver for society (theory of non-profit/third sector) but not just to fix or replace them. The author concludes that these projects require state subsidies (official grants) at the beginning, but at the same time they can generate income. In this respect they follow same economic goals as other market actors, however, the crucial difference is that their main goal is not to make high profits for the owners. In the last part, as a concrete case study, the paper concentrates on the priorities of the Hungarian development plan in relation to social renewal. The author explains the priorities and fields of interventions of the <b>social</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>programme.</b> Finally, the chapter deals with the recent changes in the Hungarian employment policy and related measures supported by the European Social Fund. The chapter concludes that several employment programmes, projects for the development of social economy and programmes assisting the spreading of voluntariness and the training of volunteers have been launched with the co-financing of ESF...|$|E

After the article appeared, Mengyi denied the corruption charges and cast himself as the victim of criminals who abused his name.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} those factors which may have an influence on entrant teachers' career choices, aspirations for {{further education and training}} and access to leadership/management positions. These are strong gender stereotypes and polarization of sexes or the standardized requirements of the teaching profession. This study analyzes data from the "Graduate Follow-up Research 2010 ", a Hungarian national survey supported by the <b>Social</b> <b>Renewal</b> Operational <b>Programme</b> (SROP) "Higher Education System-level Development" project. The survey examines those higher education students who completed their undergraduate or graduate studies in 2007. The current study focuses on those who undertook teacher training. The total sample consisted of 49, 382 people, the surveyed sample is 4, 511 participants, and of this number 738 people have a teaching qualification. The results suggest that phenomena based on gender stereotypes are very typical among teachers. For example, the individual's sex fundamentally defines his or her career opportunities: leaders {{are much more likely to}} be men, while women have less chance to move forward even if their performance is better. At the same time teachers who chose masculine disciplines are more likely to undertake further education and training than those who chose feminine disciplines – regardless of their sex...|$|R

40|$|Original title: Sociale vernieuwing. <b>Social</b> <b>renewal</b> {{began in}} Rotterdam in 1989, as a {{response}} to the presence of stubborn social disadvantage. The Idenburg Committee produced recommendations in that year suggesting how these social problems could best be tackled at local level. Central government adopted these ideas in 1990, since when <b>social</b> <b>renewal</b> policy has really taken off. Most municipalities have joined in, developing <b>social</b> <b>renewal</b> policy and creating an administrative apparatus for it. At the request of the ministries most closely involved, SCP has studied the process of <b>social</b> <b>renewal</b> from the start to the present day and has published on this regularly. The present study reports on the latest policy developments in a number of municipalities. It looks at how the new approach is translated into administrative practice at local level and asks policymakers and residents for their views and opinions on the content and outcomes of the <b>social</b> <b>renewal</b> policy, in the form of projects designed to improve neighbourhood liveability and projects intended to help more people find work. The report concludes with a summary of the achievements of some seven years of <b>social</b> <b>renewal</b> policy. To what extent have the objectives been achieved, such as more integrated policy implementation, a greater policy focus on specific problems, more cooperation between organisations and more involvement of citizens in the policy?  ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} Ward Councillors executed their Constitutional and developmental mandate to enhance basic service delivery in relation to the National Urban <b>Renewal</b> <b>Programme</b> (NURP). For practical purposes, a case study approach was chosen, using Motherwell in Nelson Mandela Bay as the specific area of focus. Motherwell was declared by the national government as one of eight nodal zones for urban renewal in South Africa. The Preamble to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, states that the injustices of the past have to be addressed and those who suffered for justice and freedom in the country should be honoured. The results of the 1994 national and 1995 local government elections marked a political breakthrough in South African politics. The new democratic and social reconstruction agenda necessitated the transformation of the legislative framework in various areas. In this study, the role of Ward Councillors was interrogated and investigated to establish whether the Urban <b>Renewal</b> <b>Programme</b> had benefited the Motherwell community in Nelson Mandela Bay in accessing basic services. In this regard, a legislative framework regulates and guides municipal Councillors in performing their developmental duties to achieve local government developmental outcomes. The legislative prescriptions that underpin the operations and activities of municipal Councillors in delivering public services to citizens and in ensuring the effective and efficient implementation of government policies generally, and the Motherwell Urban <b>Renewal</b> <b>Programme</b> in particular, were examined and interrogated. An overview of the National Urban <b>Renewal</b> <b>Programme</b> was presented. The legislative framework underpinning the Urban <b>Renewal</b> <b>Programme</b> was also reviewed. The study concluded with a number of recommendations based on the findings of the literature, legislative reviews and an empirical surve...|$|R
