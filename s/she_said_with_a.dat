2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> choking voice, [...] "For me, {{this is not just}} a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> travel-tired smile - [...] Who shall {{lift the}} years O! - [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> travel-tired smile, [...] Half scared by scene so strange; [...] She said, outworn by mile on mile, [...] The blurred lamps wanning her face the while, [...] "O Love, I am here; I am with you!" [...] . Ah, {{that there should}} have come a change! ...|$|E
6000|$|Josie O'Gorman {{went back}} to Washington well pleased with her success, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little grimace of feigned regret: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I couldn't {{return to}} him,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> instinctive {{reference}} to his having forced her marriage on. 'I could not return to him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "C'est ca!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{ethereal}} smile, disclosing a set {{of large}} teeth. [...] "Come this evening to plead for your forgiveness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} no," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> almost harsh {{practical}} decision, incompatible with her previous abandonment. [...] "We {{might be seen}} together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you have}} seen the colonel already?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{scarcely}} perceptible alteration of expression, which, however, struck Paul.|$|E
6000|$|She {{lifted her}} eyes. 'John, I cannot!' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cheerless smile. 'Positively I cannot. Will {{you make me}} a promise?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By no means,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> courteous air; and then, remembering {{she was a}} hostess, 'Is there {{anything}} that you require?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Cynthia broke {{under the}} defence {{she was trying}} to make. [...] "Yes," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> indrawn sigh, and she began to sob piteously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you like}} also {{biscuits}} with your coffee, {{the two of}} you?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> amiable intonation which her strange black looks belied.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Sir John,’ <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air {{of perfect}} honesty, ‘I {{am sure you}} mean most kindly, but these matters have no {{interest}} for me.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{smattering of}} science, sir," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{malicious}} smile, [...] "includes, I presume, {{a smattering of}} medicine as well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep your mercy {{for your}} fellow-spy," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> contemptuous gesture towards her husband; [...] "I go with these gentlemen!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{you tell}} papa, will you, Mr. Smith, if I tell you something?' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sudden impulse {{to make a}} confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm awfully sorry," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} on her face of real distress. [...] "I shan't be able to come tonight after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m afraid; I {{feel that}} no good can come of it,” <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{appealing}} look. “You mustn’t {{let him have}} any part in it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neale, {{they told}} me you gave up your work--were going to the bad," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eloquence of {{distress}} changing her voice and expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you not rather live, milor?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{smile of}} {{infinite}} tenderness, [...] "for then only could I taste happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I am Miss Smithers," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little blush; [...] "and this is Lady Holmhurst, whose husband"--and {{she checked}} herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} {{success in a}} praiseworthy attempt," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sudden coldness. She turned and walked {{directly}} into the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never told}} me, Jack," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> aggrieved ring in her voice, [...] "that you dressed {{differently}} at Birmingham {{to what you}} do here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir John," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air {{of perfect}} honesty, [...] "I {{am sure you}} mean most kindly, but these matters have no {{interest}} for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And France {{must look}} {{once more to}} England, I suppose. It is humiliating to be always in need of help," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{impatient}} little sigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "So the Government {{is going}} to climb down, after all," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> provocative {{assumption}} of private information on the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something like that. I {{call it a}} very poetical idea," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sort of provisionality, as if distrusting another ambush.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton {{understood}} the woman--soul that spoke in these words. [...] "Well," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deep, long breath, [...] "be ready, then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm better now," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> effort; [...] "it's only a kind o' blind chill I must hev {{got on the}} Marsh last night. What's that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> accent half Wessex, half Danish. [...] "I {{seek the}} Countess Judith, {{if it will}} please {{you to tell me}} where she lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{encouraging}} smile, [...] "there is {{no reason}} why you shouldn't make a career yet. I almost think you could if you wanted to." ...|$|R
6000|$|Therefore, {{the very}} next time that the girl pleaded with her to make Kenneth her heir, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clever {{assumption}} of resignation: ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave him}} a reproachful look, and hurried the {{telltale}} book out of sight as <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> momentary shadow on her face,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Believe me, {{they are}} less {{dangerous}} to our plans than women! Do you not trust me, Victor?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dazzling smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "And--and--did {{she look}} {{so much like}} me?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> added laugh, that he {{perceived}} had an hysterical note in it. [...] "You're letting your rarebit get cold!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should tell}} Mr. Bragg, sir," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{appealing}} {{look at the}} captain, [...] "that flattery is a dangerous vice, and one altogether unsuited to a Christian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of {{resignation}} which {{struck him as}} out of place, [...] "I suppose {{you had to do}} so; but you lost no time." ...|$|R
