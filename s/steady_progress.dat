Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the largest element of intraseasonal variability in the tropical atmosphere recognized by an eastward propagating pattern of cloud cover primarily in the equatorial Indian and western Pacific Oceans. This 30 -to 60 - day cycle oscillates eastward in a longitudinal fashion and is a teleconnection to global weather patterns. As MJO progresses across the Indian and Pacific basins, it is associated with the development of distinct weather patterns and regimes across the mid-latitudes. This research further clarifies how MJO can be classified in terms of phase in an attempt to enhance the use of MJO as a weather and climate predictor. In this research, 16 MJO phase cycle event types were identified and classified in terms of movement (<b>steady</b> <b>progressing,</b> variable, oscillating, and unclassified) and event length (0 to 29 days, 30 to 44 days, 45 to 59 days, and 60 + days). Phase cycle (PC) was defined as the time in days it takes for a MJO to evolve from the first day in phase 2 (western Indian Ocean) progressively back to the final day in phase 1 (Africa). In observing and analyzing 248 MJO events, from February 4, 1979 through April 30, 2010, climatological background information was defined while the PC events were characterized in terms of duration and magnitude. It was discovered that the number of annual events has decreased from an average of 8. 5 events per year in 1980 to 7. 5 events per year in 2009, and the length of these events has increased from an average of 42. 5 days per event in 1979 to 49. 5 days per event in 2010. Additionally, <b>steady</b> <b>progressing</b> PC events went through their cycles much quicker and had a higher amplitude value (including number of days where amplitude is greater than 1) than the remaining three PC types. MJO data were additionally related to sea surface temperature (SST) data fluctuations, primarily involving the well-studied El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results indicated that MJO events are most commonly observed in phases 1 and 3 (4 through 6) in El Nino (La Nina) conditions. Additionally, over 43 % of <b>steady</b> <b>progressing</b> events since 1990 occurred during El Nino conditions, whereas variable, oscillating, and unclassified events typically occurred most commonly during neutral or weak ENSO conditions...|$|R

Low temperature differential Stirling engine have been built that run on differentials ranging. This means that Stirling engines can now utilize low grade heat sources for their operation ranging from passive solar or geothermal energy to industrial process waste heat. Whether Low temperature differential Stirling engines can be put to practical use is an open question and still the subject of ongoing research and development work is being carried out worldwide at universities, government laboratories, and in private sector...|$|R

However, the offensive by Army Group B was a diversion. The main thrust of Fall Gelb was to be conducted by Army Group A through the Ardennes in Luxembourg and southern Belgium. Once these lightly defended areas were negotiated, Army Group A's XIX. Panzerkorps (19th Tank Corps), under the command of Heinz Guderian, was to strike into France at Sedan, located on the Meuse river.

On the fourth day, England continued to make <b>steady</b> <b>progress</b> and Johnston was unsuccessful although he was able to make the ball move sideways in the morning under cloudy conditions. He was then attacked by Hardstaff, who drove several fours through the off side and forced Bradman to remove Johnston. He returned to remove Barnett and English captain Norman Yardley late on the fourth day as the hosts’ neared 300. Barnett was caught by Miller in the slips and Johnston took a return catch to remove the English skipper. Johnston bowled 30 overs, the most of any bowler for the day, as England reached the penultimate evening on 345/6, a lead of one run.

5|$|On 19 June, {{the first}} part of the long-awaited French {{contingent}} (in total some 6,000 soldiers and 31 ships), under the command of François, Duke of Beaufort, arrived at Candia. The second part, comprising the galley fleet, would arrive on 3 July. The Ottomans had been making <b>steady</b> <b>progress</b> over the past years, having reached the outer bastions of the fortress; the defenders were in dire straits, while most of the city of Candia lay ruined. The French staged their first sally on 25 June. Caught by surprise, the Ottomans were quickly routed, but the French became disorganized among the siege trenches, and an Ottoman counter-attack drove them back. The attack thus ended in disaster, costing the French some 800 dead, including the Duke of Beaufort himself, who was hit by a bullet and left on the field. The arrival of the second half of the French expeditionary force revived the defenders' morale, and a combined attack was agreed upon, involving bombardment of the Ottoman siege lines by the powerful allied fleet. The attack was launched on 25 July, in an impressive display of firepower: up to 15,000 cannonballs were said to have been fired by the fleet alone. The Ottomans however were well-protected by their deep earthworks, and suffered comparatively little damage, while things went awry for the Christian fleet, as an accident caused the explosion of the French ship Thérèse, which in turn caused significant casualties among the surrounding French and Venetian ships.|$|E

He made <b>steady</b> <b>progress</b> {{over the next three}} seasons but was overshadowed by other amateur batsmen. His contemporaries at Oxford and Cambridge attracted more attention in the press, as did the next generation of amateur batsmen. He was appointed vice-captain to Fender for the 1924 season. Several professionals, such as Jack Hobbs, could have been made captain, but Jardine was preferred as an amateur. In that season, Jardine was selected for the Gentlemen v Players match {{for the first time and}} came third in the Surrey averages. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,249 runs at an average of 40.29. In the following season, Jardine was less successful, scoring fewer runs at a lower average and with a highest score of 87 (1,020 runs at 30.90). Suggestions made in the press that Jardine should captain the Gentlemen with a view towards the future of the England Test team, were ignored. In the event, owing to an injury sustained playing village cricket, he was unable to appear in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. In 1926, Jardine had his most successful season to date, with 1,473 runs (average 46.03), although he was again overshadowed by other players and by the attention given to the Ashes series being played. Towards the end of the season, his batting became more attractive and his rate of scoring increased as {{he began to}} play more shots.

Many Union regiments fragmented entirely; the companies and sections that remained on the field attached themselves to other commands. Sherman, who had been negligent in preparing for an attack, became {{one of its most}} important elements. He appeared everywhere along his lines, inspiring his raw recruits to resist the initial assaults, despite the staggering losses on both sides.
