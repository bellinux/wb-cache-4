[...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I <b>say</b> <b>here,</b> because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E

500|$|Hitchens first {{referred}} to The Rage Against God in August 2009, {{in one of}} his weekly columns: [...] "Above all, I seek to counter the assertion, central to my brother's case ... that the Soviet regime was in fact religious in character. This profound misunderstanding {{of the nature of the}} USSR is the key to finding another significant flaw in what is in general his circular argument". Then, a week before the book's publication, Hitchens wrote: [...] "...it is obvious much of what I say [...] arises out of my attempt to debate religion with him , it would be absurd to pretend that much of what I <b>say</b> <b>here</b> is not intended to counter or undermine arguments he presented in his book, God Is Not Great...".|$|E
500|$|Manson {{recorded}} his vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November 2008 and his January 5, 2009 birthday. He described the album as containing [...] "extreme" [...] autobiographical content {{relating to the}} dissolution of both his marriage to burlesque artist Dita Von Teese, and his later relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood, explaining: [...] "Some of the things I <b>say</b> <b>here,</b> it's sad to say them—they're relationship-destroying statements. Some of it is stuff I should have said to my ex-wife. Some are things I've never said to the world." [...] Manson used his home as a canvas to document the disintegration {{of his relationship with}} Wood, writing the album's lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia. Much of the album's artwork was shot there.|$|E
500|$|... "Have You Seen This Snail?" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called the episode deeply hilarious {{and described the}} plot as a [...] "bittersweet riot". He drew attention to how the story {{is similar to the}} plot of [...] "Dumped", an earlier episode in which Gary deserted SpongeBob. David Johnson of the DVD Verdict positively reacted to the DVD release of the episode and said [...] "I'm not sure what to <b>say,</b> <b>here.</b> Mr. Squarepants is so ridiculously popular, this disc will most definitely sell itself." [...] Aida Ekberg of Yahoo! Voices ranked Amy Poehler on her [...] "Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Guest Stars" [...] list and said [...] "I'm surprised more comedians haven't been guest stars on SpongeBob. Amy Poehler does a great job with her creepy grandma voice, playing pure evil masked behind plate after plate of chocolate chip cookies." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk loved the scene [...] "When Gary realizes he has to escape from her crushing love (which equals constant overeating) or die like the other snail shells he finds" [...] He said [...] "it's both funny and rather touching." ...|$|E

500|$|Creator Matthew Weiner {{conceived}} {{the script for}} [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] in 2000, while he {{was working as a}} writer for the sitcom Becker. The first draft of the episode was written as a spec script and was titled [...] "The Division". Two years later, Weiner sent the script to David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, although Weiner's agents insisted that he not proceed with his plans. Chase later recruited him upon first glance. [...] "It was what you’re always hoping to see," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was lively and it had something new to <b>say.</b> <b>Here</b> was someone who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism." [...] Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years to focus on The Sopranos. Neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project until the commencement of The Sopranos final season. During that time, AMC began looking into the television market for new programming. [...] "The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series," [...] according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, [...] "and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after, in May 1924, {{the club}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour, beginning with an ill-tempered match against Czechoslovakian side Sparta Prague. The match was an intensely physical encounter with Cardiff accusing their opposition of dirty tactics. As the teams left the pitch {{at the end of}} the first-half, a furious Keenor, upset at the nature of some tackles he had received, yelled at the Prague players [...] "If I get anymore kicks on the shin I shall be chopping someone off at the knee". In the second-half, Cardiff players found themselves being physically assaulted by members of the crowd, who aimed kicks and punches at the players, when they approached the sidelines to take throw-ins and corner-kicks, going on to lose the match 3–2. They later played matches against First Vienna in Austria and Borussia Dortmund and Hamburger SV in Germany. The following season, the side reached the final of the 1924–25 FA Cup where they suffered a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United, who claimed their fifth FA Cup win, following a goal from Fred Tunstall. After the Final, Keenor stated: [...] "Just because we lost in our very first Cup Final, I don't think there is any cause to get down in the mouth. I can <b>say</b> <b>here</b> and now that one day soon our followers can be sure that Cardiff City will bring that cup to Wales." ...|$|E

We've been bombing Iraq for ten years. We've been in the Middle East [...] I think [...] Reagan was right. We don't understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics. Right now, we're building an embassy in Iraq that is bigger than the Vatican. We're building 14 permanent bases.

2500|$|They {{began working}} more quickly on {{material}} then they ever had. [...] "We write songs in like five minutes now," [...] Maida {{said at the}} time, [...] "The energy's there." [...] For the first time, Mazur {{was included in the}} songwriting process, having not been in the band yet while Gravity was being written. [...] "On this record we really tried to write together," [...] Maida says. [...] "It’s easy for me to come in with a song, <b>say</b> <b>here</b> it is, lets go record it and it’ll be done in a couple of days. But when you have to sit in your rehearsal hall and you wait for that magic to happen, well, it doesn’t always happen right away, but that was the M.O. for this record and it worked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vang {{said that}} he had studied the script {{as if it was a}} textbook. According to Vang, after the first film cut ended, Vang did not hear a {{response}} from Eastwood. When Vang asked if something was wrong, other people told Vang that if Eastwood did not make a comment, then his performance was satisfactory. Vang added that Eastwood encouraged ad-libbing with the Hmong actors. Ahney Her said that she liked the improvisation work, even when she was required to translate between the English and Hmong languages. When asked if the in-character racial slurs offended the actors in real life, Ahney said that she did not feel offense. Vang said [...] "I was called so many names that I can’t <b>say</b> <b>here</b> because of how vulgar they were. It disturbed me quite a lot, but at the end of the day it was just a script." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the accused}} mutineers was David Creagh, second officer of the Charles II. He testified that after refusing to {{participate}} in the mutiny—the only officer to do so—he was ordered to return below deck. On the way to his cabin, Creagh encountered William May, Captain Gibson's former steward. May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W. May, the Prisoner at the Bar. What do you <b>say</b> <b>here?</b> says he. I made him no Answer, but went down to my Cabin; and he said, God damn you, you deserve to be shot through the Head; and he then held a Pistol to my Head. Then I went to my Cabin, and presently came orders from Every, that those that would go ashore, should prepare to be gone. And when the Captain was got out of Bed, who was then very ill of a Feaver, Every came and said, I am a Man of Fortune, and must seek my Fortune.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, John Bell {{showed that}} this {{assumption}} can be falsified, {{since it would}} imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption {{that led him to}} the suggestion of his hidden variables. These hidden variables may be [...] "hidden" [...] because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small. [...] This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem {{to be in the same}} place at the same time when observed. [...] This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles. [...] Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer. [...] Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting Karl Popper's philosophy of invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments. That is to <b>say,</b> <b>here</b> Einstein's [...] "basic assumption" [...] became falsified by experiments based on Bell's inequalities. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.|$|E
