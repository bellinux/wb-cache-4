500|$|While {{speaking}} of the Serbsky Center, Yuri Savenko alleges that [...] "practically nothing has changed. They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, {{and they do not}} want to apologize for all their actions in the past." [...] Attorney Karen Nersisyan agrees: [...] "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It's an organ of power." [...] According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there. She <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a situation like after the defeat of fascism in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.|$|E

Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E

Riches cover a multitude of sins in the most virtuous community in the world. Your Aunt Caroline brought him a pretty fortune, you know. We had ominous times this spring, with the associations forming, and the 'Good Intent' and the rest being sent back to England. His Excellency was at his wits' end for support. It was Grafton Carvel who helped him most, and spent money like tobacco for the King's cause, which, being interpreted, was for his own advancement. But I believe Colonel Lloyd suspects him, tho' he has never said as much to me. I have told Mr. Swain, under secrecy, what I think.

6000|$|In his defence of the Cuvierian doctrine, Professor Owen avails {{himself of}} the odium theologicum. He {{attributes}} to his opponents [...] "the insinuation and masked advocacy of the doctrine subversive of {{a recognition of the}} Higher Mind." [...] Now, saying nothing about the questionable propriety of thus prejudging an issue in science, we think this is an unfortunate accusation. What is there in the hypothesis of necessary, as distinguished from actual, correlation of parts, which is particularly in harmony with Theism? Maintenance of the necessity, whether of sequences or of coexistences, is commonly thought rather a derogation from divine power than otherwise. Cuvier says--"None of these parts can be changed without affecting the others; and consequently, each taken separately, indicates and gives all the rest." [...] That is to say, in the nature of things the correlation could not have been otherwise. On the other hand, Professor Huxley <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no warrant for asserting that the correlation could not have been otherwise; but have not a little reason for thinking that the same physiological ends might have been differently achieved. The one doctrine limits the possibilities of creation; the other denies the implied limit. Which, then, is most open to the charge of covert Atheism? ...|$|E
60|$|Your {{dispatch}} to General Halleck, referring to what I may {{think in the}} present emergency, is shown me. General Halleck <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> absolutely no force here fit {{to go to the}} field. He thinks that with the hundred-day men and invalids we have here we can defend Washington, and, scarcely, Baltimore. Besides these there are about eight thousand, not very reliable, under Howe, at Harper's Ferry with Hunter approaching that point very slowly, with what number I suppose you know better than I. Wallace, with some odds and ends, and part of what came up with Ricketts, was so badly beaten yesterday at Monocacy, that what is left can attempt no more than to defend Baltimore. What we shall get in from Pennsylvania and New York will scarcely be worth counting, I fear. Now, what I think is, that you should provide to retain your hold where you are, certainly, and bring the rest with you personally, and make a vigorous effort to destroy the enemy's forces in this vicinity. I think there is really a fair chance to do this, if the movement is prompt. This is what I think upon your suggestion, and is not an order.|$|E
