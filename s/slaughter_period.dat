To {{evaluate}} {{the effect that}} a series {{of changes in the}} handling techniques used throughout the pre and post slaughter periods and during the handling of cooled carcass have on the presence of DFD (Dark, firm and dry) meat. Materials and methods. Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals were estimated applying logistic regression models. Data from 18 visits to the slaughterhouse regarding: animal handling on arrival, <b>slaughter</b> <b>period,</b> and carcass storage was obtained {{through the use of a}} questionnaire. A total of 572 carcasses were analyzed to determine DFD meat using pH and color (L*, a*, b* and C*) measurements done on the Longissimus dorsi muscle. Results. Even after of the changes were made, the lairage period to slaughter continued to be a factor (p< 0. 05) associated to the presence of DFD meat (OR= 1. 13). Of the complementary variables, the amount of time that cattle spent on the resting pens was associated (p< 0. 05) to the presence of DFD meat (OR= 1. 003). Conclusions. Regardless of the changes made in the ante mortem handling, a high frequency of DFD was found (39 %), suggesting a permanent audit program to detect other critical points in the supply chain...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identity}} metabolites and transformation products (TPs) in chicken muscle from amoxicillin (AMX), cephapirin (PIR) and ceftiofur (TIO), which are antibiotics of the β-lactam family. Liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) mass spectrometry was utilized due to its high resolution, high mass accuracy and MS/MS capacity for elemental composition determination and structural elucidation. Amoxicilloic acid (AMA) and amoxicillin diketopiperazine (DKP) were found as transformation products from AMX. Desacetylcephapirin (DAC) was detected as a metabolite of PIR. Desfuroylceftiofur (DFC) and its conjugated compound with cysteine (DFC-S-Cys) were detected as a result of TIO in contact with chicken muscle tissue.

40|$|The {{study was}} aimed to compute Pb and Cd {{bioaccumulation}} in different organs of broiler. Carcass, heart, liver, gizzard, intestine, and excreta. The {{data were obtained}} from broiler reared in the litter cage. Four treatments of feed {{were given to the}} broiler chicken, i. e.   T 1 = X brand of commercial feed, T 2 = Y brand of commercial feed, T 3 = self-prepared feed without fish meal addition and T 4 = self prepared feed without fish meal but contaminated with cadmium chloride (Cd. Cl 2. 4 H 2 O). For each treatment, five broiler chicken were grouped each week (from week I up to week VI). Results of the first stage of this study was analyzed descriptively. A polinomial regression equation was used as an empirical model to describe the heavy metal bioaccumulation phenomenon in broiler carcasses. The quadratic equation  {{turned out to be the}} most suitable model for describing the bioaccumulation of heavy metal in broiler carcasses. From the simulation, it was found that  quadratic model fit to 61. 31 % and 54. 17 %  bioaccumulation data of Pb and Cd respectively. According to the model, initially metal concentrations declined since the first week and started to rebound at the fifth week, both in terms of chronological and physiological age. The patterns of Pb and Cd bioaccumulation in this study can be used as a reference to determine the proper <b>slaughter</b> <b>period.</b> It can be concluded that for reducing the risk of metal contamination the proper slaughter time of the broiler is before the fifth week. </p...|$|E

40|$|The study broadly {{investigates the}} econometric {{implications}} of the rational price expectations hypothesis with three alternative formulations of the U. S. broiler market model, each of which was already biologically restricted {{in terms of the}} structural equations describing broiler supply. Each of the three alternative structural models reflects a different assumption about the nature of vertical integration in the broiler industry;Each model was estimated in its restricted and unrestricted form. Resulting estimates of regression coefficients were, in most cases, consistent with economic theory predictions and statistically significant. The elasticities of response of the various broiler production activities with respect to broiler feed cost and expected broiler price variables decline in value as the broiler <b>slaughter</b> <b>period</b> approaches. In a dynamic sense, this is interpreted to mean that the closer firms are to the broiler marketing period, the less time is available for adjusting to changes in the variables affecting their decisions;Reduced forms of the broiler supply equations in the alternative structural models were also evaluated using non-nested test procedures. Finally, the broiler sector was evaluated for structural change using time-varying parameter regressions. On the basis of the results obtained from the tests of rationality restrictions, non-nested evaluations of the models and the trend behavior of the simulated time-varying weights, the following conclusions were drawn. First, there are no strong indications that firms in the U. S. broiler industry overwhelmingly fully integrate all the broiler production activities. What appears to happen is that firms vertically integrate varying numbers of the broiler production activities in the industry. Second, provided that the information requirements are met, rational expectations hypothesis offers a promising approach to the modeling of agricultural commodity systems even when the relevant planning (expectations) horizons are longer than the current period...|$|E
40|$|After the Chernobyl {{accident}} {{the sampling}} and measuring {{program of the}} Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety was intensified both for surveillance and research purposes. The deposition pattern of radionuclides was more complicated than from the global fallout after the nuclear weapons tests. The radioactive deposition was very unevenly distributed in Lapland, as also {{in the rest of}} Finland. Fortunately, the amounts of deposition in Lapland were only about one-tenth of the corresponding amount of deposition in southern Finland. In 1986 - 87 the mean concentration of Cs- 137 in lichens and in reindeer meat increased to about the same level as in 1972 - 73 or to about 30 per cent of the maximum levels found in 1964 - 65 after the nuclear weapons tests. The activity concentrations in reindeer tissues vary according to season. In winter, reindeer eat considerable amounts of lichens with high radiocesium concentrations. In summer, lichens are replaced by other forage such as leaves from trees, green plants, etc. The ratio of Cs- 137 concentration in reindeer meat between summer and winter is about 0. 2.

An experiment was conducted to study the effect of extract n-hexane of jaloh bark (EHJ) administration on body temperature, level of calcium and glucose in serum, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lung tissue, and behaviors of broilers exposed to heat stress at temperature 33 ± 1 oC. This study used 18 broilers aged 20 days which were divided into 3 groups. The first group was broilers given heat stress without EHJ (CP). The second group was treated heat stress and EHJ at dose 10 mg/kg BW (CP+EHJ). The EHJ was given 1 hour before cage temperature was raised.

40|$|Data on radiocaesium {{contamination}} of reindeer from five regions in Sweden have been used, together with interpolated radiocaesium deposition data, to quantify spatial variation in transfer to reindeermeat {{and to consider}} how it changes with time in different areas. Since the regions were contaminated to different extents by global and Chernobyl fallout, it was also possible to {{determine the influence of}} the origin or age of radiocaesium fallout on the transfer to reindeermeat. The regions differed significantly with regard to transfer of radiocaesium to reindeermeat. In two regions in the North of Sweden, where there was less Chernobyl 137 Cs, aggregated transfer coefficients (Tag), estimated for the main <b>slaughter</b> <b>period</b> in the first year after the Chernobyl fallout, were low (0. 15 and 0. 36 m 2 kg− 1 in January–April). Average Tag values calculated for the winter period (January–April) in two regions in the middle of Sweden, where deposition from Chernobyl dominated (83 and 94 %, respectively, of the total deposition), were 0. 78 and 0. 84 m 2 kg− 1, respectively with a maximum Tag for an individual reindeer of 1. 87 m 2 kg− 1. There was a threefold increase in Tag values from early autumn to late winter reflecting the change in the reindeer diet from less contaminated vascular plants to more contaminated lichens. The decline of 137 Cs in reindeermeat from 1986 to 2000 differed between regions with longer effective half-lives (Tef) in the northerly regions (11. 0 and 7. 1 years, respectively) with less Chernobyl fallout, and shorter half-lives in the other three regions (3. 5 – 3. 8 years). This observation, together with a lack of a decline in early autumn in the region with least Chernobyl fallout, supports the theory of a gradual, but reversible, fixation of radiocaesium in the soil over the mid-long term. The results suggest that both the extent of transfer of 137 Cs to reindeermeat, and its subsequent decline with time, are affected by the differing origins of radiocaesium and that previous contamination may substantially influence radiocaesiumtransfer {{in the event of a}} further accident...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} effect of yeast supplements on the performance and health of beef cattle during the receiving and finishing period. Furthermore, another aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the applicability of rumenocentesis on beef cattle and the viability of transabdominal ultrasonography of the rumen mucosa as a suitable, non-invasive diagnostic tool to identify beef cattle affected by SARA. Three trails were conducted in order to do achieve that. Trail I and Trail II were conducted simultaneously using the same animals, while the third trail used a larger sample but always in the same herd. Trail I and II assessed the effect of dietary supplementation of yeast cell wall (YCW) and live cell yeast (LY) at different dosages on rumen’s metabolites. Sixty Charolaise steers were divided into two groups on the basis of their feeding phase: growing and finishing. Growing and finishing groups were each randomly divided into equal three subgroups (n = 10) : no supplement (growing control), supplemented with YCW, and supplemented with LY + YCW, no supplement (finishing control), supplemented with LY and supplemented with LY + YCW. Ruminal fluid has been collected before, after 21 and 42 days of experimental period in order to evaluate the volatile fatty acids concentrations and pH values. Faeces samples were collected before (T 0), after 21 (T 1) and 42 (T 2) days of the start of the study, which took place simultaneously and analysed for dry matter (DM), Ash, crude protein (CP), ethereal extract (EE), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and Starch detection. Dietary supplementation of LY and YCW increased (P< 0. 05) DM, ADF and ADL faecal concentrations in the growing phase; DM, ADL and Starch faecal concentrations in the finishing phase. T 2 /FC Diet showed a significant effect (P< 0. 001) of different diets respect to T 2 /FB in the finishing stage. The obtained results suggest that yeast supplementation do not have beneficial effects with all type of diet condition. Statistical analysis of VFA's data showed a significant effect of time (P <. 05) on all studied parameters except iso-valeric acid both in growing and finishing groups. Changes among growing subgroups (P <. 05) on propionic acid, acetic acid, iso-butyric acid and n-butyric acid were found, whereas no statistical significances were found among finishing subgroups. Trail III was conducted on 478 beef cattle of Charolaise breed, they were monitored three times during the livestock cycle in order to evaluating the rumen fluid pH and to assess the measures of the rumen wall: T 0 : 5 ± 3 d after the arrival in farm;T 1 : 60 ± 10 d after arrival; T 2 : 1 month before <b>slaughter.</b> <b>Period</b> effect (P< 0. 001) were found between the three periods after 10 days from the housing, rumen pH values were lower than the threshold value of 5. 71 in T 0 than in T 1 and T 2.

Usou-se o delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, em parcelas subdivididas, com 12 tratamentos nas parcelas (fatorial 2 x 6, sendo dois níveis de ingestão de pasto: alimentação restrita e alimentação irrestrita e seis épocas de abate) e as cinco seções do TGI nas subparcelas. Foram utilizados 36 novilhos, abatendo-se três animais de cada nível nutricional ao início do experimento e a cada 35 dias. Na ocasião, pesou-se e amostrou-se a digesta de cada seção do TGI. Nos 16 dias que antecederam o abate, os animais receberam duas doses diárias de 5 g de Cr 2 O 3. Foram determinados os teores de matéria seca (MS), fibra detergente neutro (FDN), fibra detergente ácido (FDA) e proteína bruta (PB) e as concentrações de cromo e energia bruta (EB) nas digestas das várias seções. O nível alimentar teve pouca influência sobre a composição da digesta, somente afetando (P The {{influence of}} the level of intake of elephantgrass, under grazing, on the composition of digesta and on concentration of the marker Cr 2 O 3 throughout the gastrintestinal tract (GTI) of bovines was studied. A split-plot completely randomized design with twelve treatments in the main plots (a 2 x 6 factorial with two levels of forage ingestion: restricted - NA 1 and unrestricted - NA 2, and six <b>slaughter</b> <b>periods)</b> and the five sections of GTI in the split-plots was used. Thirty six steers were used, and three animals from each feeding level were slaughtered {{at the beginning of the}} trial and at each 35 days. After slaughter, the digesta of each TGI section was weighed and sampled. In the last sixteen days that preceded the slaughter, the animals received daily two doses of 5 g of Cr 2 O 3. The contents of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), crude protein (CP) and the concentrations of chrome and gross energy (GE) were determined in the digesta samples. Feeding level had small influence on composition of digesta, affecting only the contents of DM in reticulum-rumen (RR) and small intestine (SI) and percent CP in SI. In both feeding levels the digesta from SI tended to show the lowest levels of DM, NDF, ADF and the highest levels of CP and GE, while digesta from gross intestine (GE) tended to show the lowest levels of GE and CP and the highest level of ADF. Higher forage ingestion resulted in sharp reduction in chrome concentration in digesta of all sections. The SI secretions reduced the levels of DM, NDF and ADF and the concentration of chrome in the digesta, which could interfere in the results of partial digestion coefficients in that section, in the case of chrome being used as external marker...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of metazoan parasites {{in the stomach}} and small intestine was investigated in 70 horses <b>slaughtered</b> in the <b>period</b> February 1994 - July 1994. Most horses were young (1. 5 - 3 years) and in good condition. Trichostrongylus axei was the most prevalent parasite species in the stomach (51. 4 %), followed by Gasterophilus intestinalis (41. 4 %) and Habronema spp. (4. 3 %). In the small intestine, Parascaris equorum (28. 6 %) and Paranoplocephala mamillana (1. 4 %) were found. The mean worm burden of T. axei was 957 (max. 8502), of G. intestinalis 21 (max. 84), of Habronema spp. 3 (max. 5), and of P. equorum 32 (max. 308). One single specimen of P. mamillana was seen.

50|$|In {{traditional}} Jewish law, kosher animals may {{be eaten}} if they're killed using the slaughter method known as shechitah, where {{the animal is}} killed by having its throat cut swiftly using an extremely sharp and specially designed knife. Many Rabbis assert that these regulations {{were put in place}} to reduce tza'ar ba'alei chayim and to ensure that the animal has the easiest possible death. The design of the kosher knives as well as regulation relating to how the cut is made have been seen to greatly reduce or completely eliminate reaction from the kosher cut. Even modern day scientists that are critical of shechita agree that it greatly improved welfare at <b>slaughter</b> in historical <b>periods.</b> Though, there is disagreement as to shechita's effectivity when compared to modern day slaughter methods, with some scientific experts in favor of the humanness of shechita and others opposed.|$|R

5000|$|Dhabiha {{requires}} that God's name be pronounced before each slaughter. (see Islamic Concept of God). Dhabiha meat by definition is meat that is slaughtered in the shariah manner {{and the name}} of Allah is said before the slaughter. In Shechita, a blessing to God is recited before beginning an uninterrupted period of slaughtering; as long as the shochet does not have a lengthy pause, interrupt, or otherwise lose concentration, this blessing covers all the animals <b>slaughtered</b> in that <b>period.</b> This blessing follows the standard form for a blessing before most Jewish rituals ("Blessèd are you God ... who commanded us regarding such-and-such", in this case, Shechita). The general rule in Judaism is that for rituals which have an associated blessing, if one omitted the blessing, the ritual is still valid Maimonides Laws of Blessings 11:5; as such, even if the shochet failed to recite the blessing before Shechita, the slaughter is still valid and the meat is kosher.|$|R
40|$|About 4 farms {{breeding}} Blonde d’Aquitaine (farm A), Piemontese (farms B and D) and Limousin (farm C) bulls {{were used}} in a 3 year research project to {{study the effects of}} supplementation of a phytotherapic compound (containing ginger and European stoneseed) on performance, meat quality and fatty acid composition of finishing bulls. In each farm, 20 bulls were divided in two balanced groups: treatment (TRT, n = 10) and control (CTR, n = 10) group. The two groups were placed in two separate pens where concentrate and straw were offered ad libitum. During the last 60 days before <b>slaughtering</b> (finishing <b>period),</b> the phytotherapic compound (50 g/head/day) was added into the diet of the TRT group. Animals were weighted every 2 weeks in order to calculate the Average Daily Gain (ADG) of the trial. At the end of the experimental <b>period,</b> bulls were <b>slaughtered</b> and muscle conformation, fat covering, pH and temperature were measured on carcasses. On beef samples were analyzed color, drip losses, cooking losses, meat cooking shrinkage and shear force. Moreover, fatty acid profile and sensory traits of meat were also investigate on samples collected in farm A and D. The TRT groups of farms A and B showed higher (p< 0. 05) ADG compare to the respective CTR group. Very few significant differences of physical, chemical and sensory characteristics emerged on beef samples. Globally, the supplementation with the phytotherapic compound did not negatively affect meat quality. The obtained results thus suggest that the considered plant extracts might enhance bulls’ performance but further investigations should help to clarify the dose-response relationship...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} radioisotopes of cerium, {{ruthenium}} and silver may be {{released into the}} environment and potentially contaminate foodstuffs. For ruminants, data on the absorption, transfer and excretion rates of these radionuclides are sparse and were previously insufficient to allow the development of reliable dynamic models to enable the prediction of contamination levels in food products. In this study, groups of sheep were given single oral administrations of radiocerium, radioruthenium, and radiosilver and <b>slaughtered</b> at various <b>periods</b> up to 1 year. The resulting data were used to develop compartment models to describe {{the transfer of the}} three radionuclides to sheep tissues. Values for gut absorption and transfer to muscle (the most important tissue in terms of contamination of the food chain) derived from the models were considerably lower than previously advised values for the radionuclides studied. For all three radionuclides there were certain organs which contained significantly higher activity concentrations than muscle. The models developed allow prediction of the likely levels of these radionuclides in the tissues of sheep as a result of single or continuous contamination events...|$|R
