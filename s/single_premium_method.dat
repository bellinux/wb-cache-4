40|$|Life {{insurers}} often {{claim that}} the life settlement industry reduces their sur-render profits and leads to an adverse shift in their portfolio of insured risks, i. e., bad risks remain in the portfolio instead of surrendering. In this paper, we aim to quantify the effect of altered surrender behavior––subject to the health status of an insured––in a portfolio of life insurance contracts on the surrender profits of primary insurers. Our model includes mortality het-erogeneity by applying a stochastic frailty factor to a mortality table. In {{the course of our}} investigation, we additionally analyze the impact of the <b>premium</b> payment <b>method</b> by comparing results for annual and <b>single</b> <b>premium</b> payments...|$|R
40|$|The Diploma Thesis {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of an estimate of the discount rate and the single parameters used especially in the two basic methods for its determination: the surcharge (<b>premium)</b> <b>method</b> and the CAPM model. In the first part there are presented the effects which influence the discount rate and thus also the method of its estimate. The second part of the thesis describes the surcharge (<b>premium)</b> <b>method</b> which includes an estimate of the riskfree rate, the risk premiums and the liquidity premium. The third part of the work is devoted to the CAPM model, and it is divided into two chapters. Firstly, the CAPM model is derived in chapter 3. Then, in chapter 4, there are presented the possibilities of estimate of its <b>single</b> parameters and <b>premiums</b> which are most frequently added to the basic CAPM model...|$|R

A loading for expenses is added to determine the gross premium. With determining life expectancy, age is the most important factor, other significant factors are sex of the individual and smoking.

40|$|This paper investigates a {{technique}} for developing investment assump-tions for pricing {{that are consistent}} with the investment practices of the company. An investment strategy is defined to be a specific allocation of investable funds among given representative fixed-income instruments. The investment strategy problem consists of two parts: how to invest funds initially received on a block of new issues and how to reinvest any excess of investment cash flow over the cash-flow needs of the block of business at later durations. Since capital market conditions are known at the time of issue but are largely uncertain for the future, the initial-investment problem is con-siderably easier to analyze than is the reinvestment problem. Also, for <b>single</b> <b>premium</b> business, the amount of investable funds at issue is significantly larger than the amount of investable funds at later times. Thus, the initial-investment strategy {{is more important than the}} rein-vestment strategy for <b>single</b> <b>premium</b> business. This paper analyzes initial-investment strategies that produce asset-liability matching for specified durations. It shows how to express a subset of the entire region of feasible initial-investment strategies in a way that can be visualized easily and communicated to investment de-partment officers. Practical applications of the theory to the pricing of <b>single</b> <b>premium</b> immediate annuities are given. I...|$|R
