The microbial species used in this study were Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia liquefaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Enterobacter cloace. Each species, as well as a synthetically prepared consortium of the five species, were compared in their ability to rapidly degrade organic samples in the presence of ferricyanide. The microbial consortium demonstrated a greater extent and rate of biodegradation compared to the individual microbial seeds.

After, the teeth were separated into eight groups according to the surface treatments prior to the repair: control group (c), adhesive application (a), sandblasting (S) and sandblasting followed by adhesive application (Sa). Next, a composite resin cylinder (Ø[*]=[*] 0.95  mm e h[*]=[*] 2  mm) simulating a repair was built onto each surface. The specimens were submitted to a microshear bond test after 24  h, using a universal testing machine (1  mm/min, 50 kgf) until fracture. The data was subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test, with a significance level of 5 %. ANOVA showed statistical difference for the interaction artificial teeth material* surface treatment (p[*]=[*] 0.001). CR teeth (29.79 [*]±[*] 11.54  MPa) showed higher bond strength mean values than AR (18.48 [*]±[*] 9.73  MPa). Regardless the artificial teeth material, Sa (36.92 [*]±[*] 6.16  MPa) treatment showed the higher bond strength values. The highest bond strength value was found in CRSa (45.93 [*]±[*] 7.13  MPa) and the lowest was found in ARc (5.38 [*]±[*] 0.90  MPa). Based on the results, tooth material should be taken in account in order to choose the best surface treatment and achieve suitable bond strength values when a repair is necessary. For artificial teeth in acrylic resin, applying an adhesive system is the best procedure, with or without sandblasting the alumina particles. However, for artificial teeth in composite resin, an association of sandblasting followed by applying an adhesive system showed more promising bond strength values.|$|R

This modified lignin based adhesive is expected to replace the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>resins</b> like UF and PF and because of commonly available soy flour it will be economical and eco friendly. The fiberboards were prepared from three different adhesives, which are urea formaldehyde (UF) resins, natural adhesive (lignin) and protein-lignin based adhesives. Hot pressing at constant temperature 180 ºC and pressure 2 MPa within 4 minutes pressing was done to form the boards. For each board were tested for mechanical properties including modulus of rupture (MOR),thickness swelling (TS) and internal bond strength (IB). Results showed that SF,lignin,acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) and sodium hydroxide were all essential components for the adhesive and the SF: lignin:CH 3 COOH weight ratio of 3 : 75 : 10 with pH 11 resulted in the highest value of MOR, IB strength and water resistance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an automatic device for in situ and continuous {{monitoring of the}} ageing process occurring in natural and synthetic resins widely used in art and in the conservation and restoration of cultural artefacts. The results of tests carried out under accelerated ageing conditions are also presented. This easy-to-assemble palm-top device, essentially consists of oscillators based on quartz crystal resonators coated with films of the organic materials whose response to environmental stress is to be addressed. The device contains a microcontroller which selects at pre-defined time intervals the oscillators and records and stores their oscillation frequency. The ageing of the coatings, caused by the environmental stress and resulting in {{a shift in the}} oscillation frequency of the modified crystals, can be straightforwardly monitored in this way. The kinetics of this process reflects the level of risk damage associated with a specific microenvironment. In this case, natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>resins,</b> broadly employed in art and restoration of artistic and archaeological artefacts (dammar and Paraloid B 72), were applied onto the crystals. The environmental stress was represented by visible and UV radiation, since the chosen materials are known to be photochemically active, to different extents. In the case of dammar, the results obtained are consistent with previous data obtained using a bench-top equipment by impedance analysis through discrete measurements and confirm that the ageing of this material is reflected in the gravimetric response of the modified quartz crystals. As for Paraloid B 72, the outcome of the assays indicates that the resin is resistant to visible light, but is very sensitive to UV irradiation. The use of a continuous monitoring system, apart from being obviously more practical, is essential to identify short-term (i. e. reversible) events, like water vapour adsorption/desorption processes, and to highlight ageing trends or sudden changes of such trends.

40|$|Artificial protein hydrogels have {{attracted}} interest as injectable fillers and scaffolds for tissue engineering and regeneration, {{but the same}} features that enable minimally-invasive implantation of these biomaterials typically make them susceptible to mechanical degradation in the tissue environment. Achieving a rapid and sufficiently large increase in gel toughness post-injection is a crucial challenge for developing load-bearing injectable implants that persist for the needed lifetime of the implant. To address these complex goals, {{the objective of this}} thesis has been to engineer physical hydrogels that shear-thin at low temperatures but responsively assemble into a nanostructured, reinforced state at body temperature. For this purpose, the thermoresponsive aggregation of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) was leveraged to assemble nanostructured hydrogels from dual-associative block copolymers. Hybrid protein-polymers or protein fusions were formed by fusing PNIPAM or ELPs to the termini of a <b>soluble</b> <b>artificial</b> polypeptide decorated with self-associating [alpha]-helical domains. In cold solutions, these polypeptide block copolymers formed weak, injectable gels due to helix-associations alone; upon heating to physiological temperatures, the endblocks aggregated to form a reinforcing network of close-packed micelles throughout the gel, leading to over a 10 -fold increase in elastic modulus and over 10 ³-fold increase in the longest stress relaxation time. Micelle packing and morphology could be tuned by endblock chemistry and block architecture, allowing for orthogonal control of gel viscoelasticity over timescales separated by four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, through the discovery of a new gelation mechanism for ELPs, simple but tough hydrogels were engineered and explored as biocompatible substrates for tissue engineering. Unlike solutions of other ELPs that have been studied extensively for decades, ELPs that have an alanine mutation in the third position of the repeat unit (i. e. VPAVG) were found to undergo arrested phase separation upon heating when formulated above a critical concentration. Solidification resulted in a bicontinuous, nanoscale network that could be manipulated by ELP design. Critically, this reversible mechanism produced extremely stiff physical gels with a relaxation time greater than 10 ³ seconds and shear moduli almost 10 MPa, nearly that of natural rubber despite consisting of 70 % water. These ELPs were chain-extended via reversible coupling of terminal cysteine residues, leading to oxidatively-responsive increases in gel extensibility and overall toughness. Biofunctionalized gels maintained the viability of mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes in 2 D and 3 D, respectively, making these simple gel formulations a promising platform for biomedical applications. Ultimately, through controlled macromolecular synthesis and functionalization, combined with a fundamental understanding of the structure and mechanics of these new materials, this thesis has {{led to the development of}} responsively tough biomaterials that are promising for long-term performance under physiological conditions. by Matthew James Glassman.

And, regarding the “surface treatment” factor independent of the artificial teeth material, the bond strength values increased in the ratio: no treatment (12.40 [*]±[*] 3.38)d[*]<[*]sandblasting (21.31 [*]±[*] 4.82)c[*]<[*]adhesive system application (26.08 [*]±[*] 5.74)b[*]<[*]sandblasting followed by adhesive system application (36.92 [*]±[*] 6.16)a. Table  1 summarizes the descriptive statistical analysis and the multiple comparison between groups. The repaired composite <b>resin</b> <b>artificial</b> teeth showed the highest bond strength mean values when treated with sandblasting and adhesive system application. While for acrylic resin teeth, {{the application of the}} adhesive system significantly improved the mean bond strength values, preceded or not by sandblasting.|$|R
40|$|Neural {{progenitor}} {{cells were}} encapsulated in vitro within a three-dimensional network of nanofibers formed by self-assembly of peptide amphiphile mole-cules. The self-assembly is triggered by mixing cell suspensions in media with dilute aqueous solutions of the molecules, and cells survive {{the growth of}} the nanofibers around them. These nanofibers were designed to present to cells the neurite-promoting laminin epitope IKVAV at nearly van der Waals density. Relative to laminin or <b>soluble</b> peptide, the <b>artificial</b> nanofiber scaffold induced very rapid differentiation of cells into neurons, while discouraging the devel-opment of astrocytes. This rapid selective differentiation is linked to the am-plification of bioactive epitope presentation to cells by the nanofibers. Artificial three-dimensional (3 D) scaffolds that store or attract cells, and then direct cell proliferation and differentiation, are of criti-cal importance in regenerative medicine. Ear-lier work demonstrated that tissue regenera...|$|R
30|$|Full arch {{prosthesis}} is one {{alternative to}} rehabilitate edentulous patients. This prosthesis consists of artificial teeth {{mounted on a}} mucus supported acrylic resin base with the purpose to restore aesthetics, phonetics and mastication [1]. During chewing, the stresses induced in the denture may cause injury to the support tissue, if equilibrium conditions suitable for occlusal adjustment are not created [2]. The most common material used for artificial teeth is acrylic resin with acceptable mechanical properties and durability [3]. Acrylic resin is easily adjusted and concentrates less stress compared to ceramic teeth [4]. Furthermore, there is a chemical interaction between the <b>resin</b> base and <b>artificial</b> teeth [3]. Regarding disadvantages, acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>artificial</b> teeth exhibit often-occlusal wear, which leads to decreased masticatory efficiency and loss of vertical dimension [5].They also present clinical problems, as they suffer remolding of worn occlusal surfaces in denture teeth [5, 6], and fractures or debonding from the prosthesis base [7].|$|R
40|$|Currently, reuse {{of solid}} waste from disused {{infrastructures}} is an important environmental issue to study. In this research, polymer concrete was developed by mixing orthophthalic unsaturated polyester <b>resin,</b> <b>artificial</b> microfillers (calcium carbonate), and waste aggregates (basalt and limestone) coming from the recycling process of concrete sleepers. The variation of the mechanical and physical properties of the polymer concrete (compressive strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, density, and water absorption) was analyzed based on the modification of different variables: nature of the recycled aggregates, resin contents (11 wt%, 12 wt%, and 13 wt%), and particle-size distributions of microfillers used. The results show the influence of these variables on mechanical performance of polymer concrete. Compressive and flexural strength of recycled polymer concrete were improved by increasing amount of polyester resin and by optimizing the particle-size distribution of the microfillers. Besides, the results show the feasibility of developing a polymer concrete with excellent mechanical behavior...|$|R
40|$|A resistência de união entre dente {{artificial}} e resina acrílica para base protética foi avaliada sob a influência de duas marcas comerciais de dentes artificiais (Biotone e Trilux) e de três resinas acrílicas, sendo duas polimerizadas convencionalmente em banho de água (QC- 20 e Lucitone 550) e uma resina polimerizada por meio da energia de microondas (Acron-MC). As avaliações foram realizadas por meio de um ensaio mecânico de cisalhamento através da aplicação de uma carga perpendicular à interface dente-resina. Os resultados indicaram que, para a mesma resina, a resistência foi semelhante, independentemente do tipo de dente utilizado. Para os dois tipos de dente avaliados, as resinas Acron MC e Lucitone 550 apresentaram valores de resistência de união entre dente artificial e resina acrílica estatisticamente semelhantes e superiores em relação à resina QC- 20. Shear {{bond strength}} between <b>artificial</b> acrylic <b>resin</b> teeth and denture base resin was evaluated {{under the influence}} of two brands of artificial teeth (Biotone and Trilux) and three denture base resins. Two of these resins were conventionally polymerized in water bath (QC- 20 and Lucitone 550), while the other was a microwave-polymerized resin (Acron-MC). The evaluations were done by means of a shear bond strength test with application of a perpendicular load to the interface tooth-resin. The results showed that, for the same denture resin, the strength was similar regardless of the tooth brand. Also, for the two evaluated brands of tooth, the resins Acron MC and Lucitone 550 presented similar shear bond strengths, which were statistically higher than for resin QC- 20...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of artificial teeth for endodontic teaching. A questionnaire was prepared and submitted to 18 professors of Endodontics from different Brazilian universities to evaluate the following features of five cloudy <b>resin</b> <b>artificial</b> teeth: internal and external anatomy; coronal chambers regarding their size, shape and canal path; root canal regarding their size, shape and position; fulfillment of the pulp chamber and root canals by considering the texture, quantity, color, and ease of handling; resin hardness and visualization of the radiographic image. The results presented favorable opinions, in terms of internal and external anatomy, coronal pulp chambers and root canal and handling and radiographic imaging. The contents of the pulp space and hardness of the teeth were considered satisfactory. The average grade assigned to the artificial tooth quality was 8. 4, in a 0 - 10 scale. In conclusion, the artificial teeth have potential to replace the natural teeth in endodontic teaching; however, improvements are still necessary to reach a better quality model...|$|R
