2500|$|Notable {{features}} that distinguish the gray whale from other mysticetes include its baleen that is variously described as cream, off-white, or blond {{in color and}} is unusually short. Small depressions on the upper jaw each contain a lone <b>stiff</b> <b>hair,</b> but are only visible on close inspection. Its head's ventral surface lacks the numerous prominent furrows of the related rorquals, instead bearing two to five shallow furrows on the throat's underside. The gray whale also lacks a dorsal fin, instead bearing 6 to 12 dorsal crenulations ("knuckles"), which are raised bumps on the midline of its rear quarter, leading to the flukes. This {{is known as the}} dorsal ridge. The tail itself is [...] across and deeply notched at the center while its edges taper to a point.|$|E

60|$|So {{the animal}} pranced {{into the forest}} and soon came {{trotting}} back to them. When he drew near they found a soft-shell crab clinging fast to the <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> of the zebra's head, where it held on by one claw.|$|E
60|$|Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, {{from where}} he sat, of a most {{remarkable}} goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it {{to be caused by}} a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> on Mr. Cruncher's head.|$|E
60|$|Amos Ridings was the chairman, tall, grim-lipped and earnest-eyed. His curt speech {{carried the}} {{convention}} with him. His platform was a wagon box, {{and he stood}} there with his hat off, the sun falling upon his shock of close-clipped <b>stiff</b> <b>hair,</b> making a powerful and resolute figure {{with a touch of}} poetry in his face.|$|E

60|$|Thus I dreamed as {{we moved}} on toward Thuria. My dreaming was rudely {{shattered}} by a savage growl from Raja. I looked down at him. He had stopped in his tracks as one turned to stone. A thin ridge of <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> bristled along {{the entire length of}} his spine. His yellow green eyes were fastened upon the scrubby jungle at our right.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are the baboons of {{the hill}} country," [...] {{suggested}} another. [...] "They are as many as {{the leaves of the}} forest. They, too, hate the Gomangani. They love to fight. They are very savage. Let us ask them to accompany us. Then can we kill all the Gomangani in the jungle." [...] He rose and growled horribly, bristling his <b>stiff</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel {{produced}} it. [...] "This envelope," [...] he said, [...] "was {{left with}} {{me by the}} man with short <b>stiff</b> <b>hair,</b> who came just before you, and who announced himself as Sir Charles Vandrift. He said {{he was interested in}} tea in Assam, and wanted me to join {{the board of directors of}} some bogus company. These are his papers, I believe," [...] and he handed them to his cousin.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile I {{made my way}} to {{the little}} figure that was {{stretched}} upon the rock {{at the edge of the}} river. She had fainted, but even before I reached her I saw from her small size and the strange hoop of <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> that she wore about her head, that it was none other than Sihamba, Sihamba whom I had last seen upon the eve of that unlucky marriage day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] {{answered}} Marie, whose blushes I {{could see}} {{even in the}} shadow of her cap, [...] "I was not sitting in the sun, but under the shade of a peach tree. Also, I was working out the sums that Monsieur Leblanc set me on my slate. See, here they are," [...] and she held up the slate, which was covered with figures, somewhat smudged, it is true, by the rubbing of my <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> and of her cap.|$|E
6000|$|Vida {{had once}} beheld Raymie as a thin man with spectacles, mournful {{drawn-out}} face, and colorless <b>stiff</b> <b>hair.</b> Now {{she noted that}} his jaw was square, that his long hands moved quickly and were bleached in a refined manner, and that his trusting eyes indicated that he had [...] "led a clean life." [...] She began to call him [...] "Ray," [...] and to bounce in defense of his unselfishness and thoughtfulness every time Juanita Haydock or Rita Gould giggled about him at the Jolly Seventeen.|$|E

5000|$|Liatris elegans grows from rounded or turnip-shaped corms, {{that produce}} stems 30 to 120 centimeters tall. The upright growing stems {{generally}} have soft hairs but sometimes plants have coarse <b>stiff</b> <b>hairs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{these species}} the mucunain {{is found in}} <b>stiff</b> <b>hairs,</b> or trichomes, {{covering}} the seed pods. When the hairs rub off and {{come in contact with}} skin they cause severe itching and irritation.|$|R
60|$|But to return. Although we won't {{say that}} the quadruped in {{question}} was stunning, we will say again that it was striking--so powerfully striking that {{the force of the}} stroke was calculated almost to stun. It was uncommonly tall, remarkably short in the body, and had a piebald coat. Moreover, it had no tail--to speak of--as that member had, in some unguarded moment, got into the blaze of the camp fire and been burnt off close to the stump. The stump, however, was pretty long, and, at the time when the trappers became possessed of the animal, that appendage was covered with a new growth of sparsely scattered and very <b>stiff</b> <b>hair,</b> about three inches long, so that it resembled a gigantic bottle-brush. Being a spirited animal, the horse had a lively bottle-brush, which was grotesque, if it was nothing else.|$|E
6000|$|I never {{expected}} to see him again; yet {{it is one of}} the two or three odd coincidences of my life that I did see him. At some public sports or recreation ground I saw a group of rather objectless youths, one of whom was wearing the dashing uniform of a private in the Lancers. Inside that uniform was the tall figure, shy face, and dark, <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> of Simmons. He had gone to the one place where every one is dressed alike--a regiment. I know nothing more; perhaps he was killed in Africa. But when England was full of flags and false triumphs, when everybody was talking manly trash about the whelps of the lion and the brave boys in red, I often heard a voice echoing in the under-caverns of my memory, [...] "Shut up... O, shut up... O, I say, shut it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The meeting {{opened with}} the regular weekly [...] "stunts." [...] Retiring President Vergil Gunch {{was in the}} chair, his <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> like a hedge, his voice like a brazen gong of festival. Members who had brought guests {{introduced}} them publicly. [...] "This tall red-headed piece of misinformation is the sporting editor of the Press," [...] said Willis Ijams; and H. H. Hazen, the druggist, chanted, [...] "Boys, when you're on a long motor tour and finally get to a romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to the wife, 'This is certainly a romantic place,' it sends a glow right up and down your vertebrae. Well, my guest to-day is from such a place, Harper's Ferry, Virginia, in the beautiful Southland, with memories of good old General Robert E. Lee and of that brave soul, John Brown who, like every good Booster, goes marching on--" ...|$|E

6000|$|Next to Pappas Brothers was {{the grey}} wooden {{building}} of Mule Spinners' Hall, that elite organization of skilled labour, and underneath it the store of Johnny Tiernan, its windows piled up with stoves and stovepipes, sheet iron and cooking utensils. Mr. Tiernan, like the Greeks, was happy, too: unlike the Greeks, he never {{appeared to be}} busy, and yet he throve. He {{was very proud of}} the business in which he had invested his savings, but he seemed to have other affairs lying blithely on his mind, affairs of moment to the community, as the frequent presence of the huge policemen, aldermen, and other important looking persons bore witness. He hailed by name Italians, Greeks, Belgians, Syrians, and [...] "French"; he hailed Janet, too, with respectful cheerfulness, taking off his hat. He possessed the rare, warm vitality that is irresistible. A native of Hampton, still in his thirties, his sharp little nose and twinkling blue eyes proclaimed the wisdom that is born and not made; his <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> had a twist like the bristles in the cleaning rod of a gun.|$|E
6000|$|The King {{had come}} to Tours to meet Joan. At the present day this poor thing is called Charles the Victorious, on account of {{victories}} which other people won for him, but in our time we had a private name for him which described him better, and was sanctified to him by personal deservingCharles the Base. When we entered the presence he sat throned, with his tinseled snobs and dandies around him. He looked like a forked carrot, so tightly did his clothing fit him from his waist down; he wore shoes with a rope-like pliant toe a foot long {{that had to be}} hitched up to the knee to keep it out of the way; he had on a crimson velvet cape that came no lower than his elbows; on his head he had a tall felt thing like a thimble, with a feather it its jeweled band that stuck up like a pen from an inkhorn, and from under that thimble his bush of <b>stiff</b> <b>hair</b> stuck down to his shoulders, curving outward at the bottom, so that the cap and the hair together made the head like a shuttlecock. All the materials of his dress were rich, and all the colors brilliant. In his lap he cuddled a miniature greyhound that snarled, lifting its lip and showing its white teeth whenever any slight movement disturbed it. The King's dandies were dressed in about the same fashion as himself, and when I remembered that Joan had called the war-council of Orleans [...] "disguised ladies' maids," [...] it reminded me of people who squander all their money on a trifle and then haven't anything to invest when they come across a better chance; that name ought to have been saved for these creatures.|$|E
