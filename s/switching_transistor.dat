25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|E

50|$|Failure of the <b>{{switching}}</b> <b>transistor</b> is common. Due to {{the large}} switching voltages this transistor must handle (around 325 V for a 230 VAC mains supply), these transistors often short out, in turn immediately blowing the main internal power fuse.|$|E
5000|$|When {{used in a}} {{switching}} transformer, one winding of the bifilar coil {{is used as a}} {{means of}} removing the energy stored in the stray magnetic flux which fails to link the primary coil to the secondary coil of the transformer. Because of their proximity, the wires of the bifilar coil both [...] "see" [...] the same stray magnetic flux. One wire is clamped to ground usually by a diode so that when the other [...] "primary" [...] wire of the bifilar coil no longer has a voltage applied across it by the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor,</b> the stray magnetic flux generates a current in the clamping coil with the primary side voltage appearing across it, causing an equal voltage to appear across the primary winding. If this clamping coil was not used, the stray magnetic flux would attempt to force a current to flow through the primary wire. Since the primary wire is switched off and the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> is in a high resistance state, the high voltage which would appear on the semiconductor <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> would exceed its electrical breakdown or even damage it.|$|E
5000|$|Another way {{to speed}} up DTL is to avoid saturating the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor.</b> That {{can be done with}} a Baker clamp. The Baker clamp is named for Richard H. Baker, who {{described}} it in his 1956 technical report [...] "Maximum Efficiency Switching Circuits." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the control of <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> for use in clocked transistor output stages or half/full bridges at fixed working frequencies and a pulse duty factor of about 1 : 1. Clocked output stages in present-day use are mainly implemented with MOS transistors. The disadvantage {{here is that the}} capacitance across the control terminal physically caused by MOS transistors and the resulting capacitor effect prevents a shortening of the switching times. In the invention, the clock or working frequency of <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> can be increased. This is achieved by the input capacitance of the MOS transistor forming a resonant circuit in conjunction with an inductance, said resonant circuit being tuned to the working frequency. To obtain floating control, the resident circuit has two coupled coils L 1, L 2 (resonance transformers) via which energy is also transferred. With the described control circuit for <b>switching</b> <b>transistors,</b> clock rates of the order of magnitude of 1 MHz can be implemented using simple technical means...|$|R

50|$|The next generation's {{inverter}} {{technology for the}} CCFL Lighting is the current resonance type inverter circuit. The resonance current which causes at the secondary side of the transformer is directly switching the primary side of the transformer through the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor.</b> It simplifies the circuit and improves efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The ASDTIC circuit used {{is based}} around an {{integrator}} and a threshold detector. The incoming signal is integrated {{over time and}} when it exceeds a threshold, a control pulse is generated by the ASDTIC. Within the converter control circuit outside the ASDTIC, a One-Shot Pulse Generator then generates a pulse of constant length to drive the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a more {{constant}} {{output voltage}} is desired, the Joule Thief {{can be given}} a closed-loop control. In the example circuit, the Schottky diode D1 blocks the charge built up on capacitor C1 from flowing back to the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> Q1 when it is turned on. A 5.6 Volt Zener diode D2 and transistor Q2 forms the feedback control: when the voltage across the capacitor C1 {{is higher than the}} threshold voltage formed by Zener voltage of D2 plus the base-emitter turn-on voltage of transistor Q2, transistor Q2 is turned on diverting the base current of the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> Q1, impeding the oscillation and prevents the voltage across capacitor C1 from rising even further. When the voltage across C1 drops below the threshold voltage Q2 turns off, allowing the oscillation to happen again. If the load requires even lower ripple, in this example some delicate digital circuitry like a microcontroller, a linear regulator can be used after this to smooth the ripple out.|$|E

5000|$|The JEDEC EIA370 {{transistor}} device numbers usually {{start with}} [...] "2N", indicating a three-terminal device (dual-gate field-effect transistors are four-terminal devices, so begin with 3N), then a 2, 3 or 4-digit sequential number with no significance as to device properties (although early devices with low numbers {{tend to be}} germanium). For example, 2N3055 is a silicon n-p-n power transistor, 2N1301 is a p-n-p germanium <b>switching</b> <b>transistor.</b> A letter suffix (such as [...] "A") is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant, but rarely gain groupings.|$|E
50|$|Adding a sleep {{transistor}} {{to every}} cell {{that is to}} be turned off imposes a large area penalty, and individually gating the power of every cluster of cells creates timing issues introduced by inter-cluster voltage variation that are difficult to resolve. Fine-grain power gating encapsulates the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> {{as a part of the}} standard cell logic. Switching transistors are designed by either the library IP vendor or standard cell designer. Usually these cell designs conform to the normal standard cell rules and can easily be handled by EDA tools for implementation.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{application}} is when DC power {{needs to be}} fed into a transmission line, which {{may be necessary to}} power an active device connected to the line, such as a <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> or a varactor diode for instance. An ideal DC voltage source has zero impedance, that is, it presents a short circuit and it is not useful to connect a short circuit directly across the line. Feeding in the DC via a λ/4 transformer will transform the short circuit into an open circuit which has no effect on the signals on the line. [...] Likewise, an open circuit can be transformed into a short circuit.|$|E
50|$|This technology, {{also known}} as air-bridge technology, has {{established}} itself for its unsurpassed reliability in high-frequency silicon <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> and ultra-high-speed integrated circuits for telecommunications and missile systems.

50|$|Furthermore, {{gallium nitride}} HEMTs on silicon {{substrates}} {{are used as}} power <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> for voltage converter applications. Compared to silicon power transistors gallium nitride HEMTs feature low on-state resistances, and low switching losses due to the wide bandgap properties. Gallium nitride power HEMTs are commercially available up to voltages of 200 V-600 V.|$|R
5000|$|Beam lead {{technology}} is a method of fabricating a semiconductor device. Its original application was to high-frequency silicon <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> and high-speed integrated circuits. It eliminated the labor-intensive wire-bonding process used for integrated circuits at the time, and allowed automated assembly of semiconductor chips onto larger substrates to produce hybrid integrated circuits.|$|R
5000|$|The {{output voltage}} {{is of the}} {{opposite}} polarity than the input. This is a switched-mode power supply with a similar circuit topology to the boost converter and the buck converter. The output voltage is adjustable based on the duty cycle of the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor.</b> One possible drawback of this converter is that the switch {{does not have a}} terminal at ground; this complicates the driving circuitry. However, this drawback is of no consequence if the power supply is isolated from the load circuit (if, for example, the supply is a battery) because the supply and diode polarity can simply be reversed. When they can be reversed, the switch can be on either the ground side or the supply side.|$|E

50|$|The diode-wired MOSFET {{version of}} the Dickson {{multiplier}} does not work very well at very low voltages {{because of the large}} drain-source volt drops of the MOSFETs. Frequently, a more complex circuit is used to overcome this problem. One solution is to connect in parallel with the switching MOSFET another MOSFET biased into its linear region. This second MOSFET has a lower drain-source voltage than the switching MOSFET would have on its own (because the switching MOSFET is driven hard on) and consequently the output voltage is increased. The gate of the linear biased MOSFET is connected to the output of the next stage so that it is turned off while the next stage is charging from the previous stage's capacitor. That is, the linear-biased transistor is turned off {{at the same time as}} the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} static CMOS inverter {{with two}} inputs and two outputs is proposed to reduce short-circuit current {{in order to}} increment delay and reduce power overhead where slow operation is required. The circuit is based on bidirectional delay element connected in series with the PMOS and NMOS <b>switching</b> <b>transistors.</b> It provides differences in the dynamic response so that the direct-path current in the next stage is reduced.
