5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached the United States East Coast on August 31, the United States Weather Bureau advised extreme caution to ships between Cape Hatteras and southern areas of New England. Storm warnings were issued for coastal regions between Wilmington, North Carolina and the Virginia Capes. These warnings were later extended northward to the Delaware Breakwater. Strong winds exceeding gale-force were expected {{for much of}} the East Coast, particularly for Cape Hatteras. On September1, hurricane warnings were ordered for areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Pamlico Sound, while previously issued storm warnings remained in place. On September2, gale warnings extended further north into Nantucket, Massachusetts. In Norfolk, Virginia, city department heads were ordered to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> potential emergency duties. United States Coast Guard personnel were also dispatched along the North Carolina coast. United States Navy personnel were detained in New London, Connecticut until the storm passed. In Westhampton, New York, a mass evacuation occurred, involving 10,000residences. Air traffic to and from Mitchel Air Force Base was cancelled, and 100airplanes stationed at the base were fastened to the ground. Police and firemen evacuated a 50mi (80km) stretch of the Rhode Island coastline. This included Roy Carpenter's Beach, where 1,000families were forced to evacuate. In Narragansett Bay, boats were sent back to harbors or towed to shore. The extensive precautionary measures undertaken occurred in part due to fears that the storm would cause similar effects to a destructive hurricane which swept through areas of New England two years prior.|$|E

25|$|Injury {{yet again}} hit Cooper {{early on in}} the 2006 season {{in the form of a}} damaged {{hamstring}} while playing in the season opening fixture against the Wests Tigers. Cooper was forced to miss several fixtures for the Dragons after failing to recover from a hamstring injury sustained during the round one NRL fixture. However Cooper was once again selected to play for Australia in the mid-season test match on 5 May 2006, he scored once during a dominating 50 to 12 win over New Zealand. This was the last time Cooper has represented Australia. His hamstring injury forced Cooper to withdraw from the starting line-up for the 2006 State of Origin series, being replaced by winger Eric Grothe, Jr. from the Parramatta Eels. After missing the first game of Origin for New South Wales, Cooper failed to be called up for game two with Grothe retaining his position after a solid performance in game one. On 11 June it was announced that Cooper had been called up as 18th man on <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> the game.|$|E

50|$|On 7 January 1967, {{the fleet}} tug shifted her homeport to Mayport, Florida. Increased {{training}} services- target towing and torpedo recovery- did not diminish her towing, rescue, and development support work. The following year, Salinan added support operations for NASA to her achievements, {{serving as the}} launch site sea salvage vessel for the Apollo 8 mission. As such, she <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> recovery purposes should the mission be aborted {{within a few minutes}} after launch. She performed the same service for Apollo 10, and in July 1969 <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> the historic launch of Apollo 11 - the first successful lunar landing.

500|$|The {{search for}} new weapons delayed Mehmedbašić's attempt on Potiorek. [...] Before Mehmedbašić was ready to act, Ilić summoned him to Mostar. [...] On 26 March 1914, Ilić {{informed}} Mehmedbašić that Belgrade had scrapped the mission to kill the governor. [...] The plan now was to murder Franz Ferdinand, and Mehmedbašić should <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> the new operation. (Apis confessed to the Serbian Court that he ordered the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in his position {{as head of the}} Intelligence Department.) The assassination was planned with the knowledge and approval of the Russian ambassador in Belgrade Nikolai Hartwig and the Russian military attache in Belgrade Viktor Artamonov.|$|E
500|$|Around 10:00a.m. on 21 June 1919, von Reuter sent a flag signal {{ordering}} the fleet to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> {{the signal to}} scuttle. At about 11:20 the flag signal was sent: [...] "To all Commanding Officers and the Leader of the Torpedo Boats. Paragraph Eleven of to-day's date. Acknowledge. Chief of the Interned Squadron." [...] The signal was repeated by semaphore and searchlights. Scuttling began immediately: seacocks and flood valves were opened and internal water pipes smashed. Portholes had already been loosened, watertight doors and condenser covers left open, and in some ships holes had been bored through bulkheads, all to facilitate the spread of water once scuttling began. One German ship commander recorded that prior to 21 June, seacocks had been set on a hair turning and heavily lubricated, while large hammers had been placed besides valves.|$|E
500|$|Prompted by the government, the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation {{told the}} public to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> an {{important}} announcement from the Prime Minister at 13:15 local time. Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence, then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become [...] "abundantly {{clear that it is}} the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution which we could possibly accept... I promised {{the people of this country}} that I would continue to negotiate to the bitter end and that I would leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to secure an honourable and mutually accepted settlement; it now falls to me to tell you that negotiations have come to an end".|$|E
50|$|The landing {{attempt at}} 0800 was {{repelled}} by enemy fire. The vessel {{was hit by}} enemy fire while approaching the beach again at 0940 and retracted with one wounded by shrapnel.

500|$|Dunn {{also claimed}} that Lodge put Diệm on hold {{in order to}} inform Conein where the Ngô {{brothers}} were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account. It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Diệm and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane {{would have to go}} directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in Guam, and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Diệm for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a US Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: [...] "One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day." [...] The historian Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown Diệm to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that [...] "when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Diệm to give up {{at a time when the}} outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive." ...|$|E

The warship steamed back east in October and, after a port visit to Fremantle, Australia, she sailed north for Yokosuka.

He played a Victorian butler in Forever and a Day (1943) and an Australian bar-owner in The Man from Down Under (1943). Simon Callow's 1987 biography quotes a number of contemporary reviews of Laughton's performances in these films. James Agate, reviewing Forever and a Day, wrote: [...] "Is there no-one at RKO to tell Charles Laughton when he is being plain bad?" [...] On the other hand, Bosley Crowther of the New York Times declared that Forever and a Day boasted [...] "superb performances".|$|E
2500|$|The Northern Fleet {{duty officer}} then {{notified}} {{the head of}} the fleet's search and rescue forces, Captain Alexander Teslenko, to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>for</b> orders. [...] Toslenko's primary rescue ship was a 20-year-old former lumber carrier, Mikhail Rudnitsky, which had been converted to support submersible rescue operations. Toslenko notified the ship's captain to be ready to depart on one hour's notice. Berthed at the primary Northern Fleet base at Severomorsk, the ship was equipped with two AS-32 and AS-34 s, a diving bell, underwater video cameras, lifting cranes, and other specialised gear. But she was not equipped with stabilisers capable of keeping the vessel in position during stormy weather and could only lower her rescue vessels in calm seas. The Russian Navy had previously operated two s, each of which carried a pair of Poseidon class DSRVs that could reach a depth of , but {{due to a lack of}} funds the vessels had been waiting in a St. Petersburg yard for repairs since 1994.|$|E
