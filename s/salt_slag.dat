40|$|Aluminium <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> (also {{known as}} {{aluminium}} salt cake), which {{is produced by}} the secondary aluminium industry, is formed during aluminium scrap/dross melting and contains 15 - 30 % aluminium oxide, 30 - 55 % sodium chloride, 15 - 30 % potassium chloride, 5 - 7 % metallic aluminium and impurities (carbides, nitrides, sulphides and phosphides). Depending on the raw mix the amount of <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> produced per tonne of secondary aluminium ranges from 200 to 500. kg. As <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> has been classified as toxic and hazardous waste, it should be managed {{in compliance with the}} current legislation. Its landfill disposal is forbidden in most of the European countries and it should be recycled and processed in a proper way by taking the environmental impact into consideration. This paper presents a review of the aluminium <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> chemical and mineralogical characteristics, as well as various processes for metal recovery, recycling of sodium and potassium chlorides content back to the smelting process and preparation of value added products from the final non metallic residue. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Waste {{water from}} the {{aluminium}} <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> processing plant ALUSCAN A/S in Norway discharges into the open recipient Sunndalsfjorden in western Norway. In October 1993 a diver survey {{in the vicinity of}} the discharge was performed. The survey showed visible effects closest to the outlet. A diverse marine flora and fauna was observed at 5 - 50 m from the discharge outlet. Some impact from the discharge was visible at distances ut to 50 - 100 m from the outlet. The effects of the discharge was enhanced by heavy sedimentation due to remaining sedimented materiale from the former iron mine. The discharge water is expected to rapidly dilute and disperse in the large recipient, causing minor eutrophication effects beyond 150 m from the discharge outlet. ALUSCAN A/...|$|E
40|$|This {{overview}} of oxidation and corrosion effects on silica-protected ceramics and composites {{is divided into}} two parts: (1) External effects and (2) Internal effects. In regard to the first part, the literature indicates silica the best of the common protective oxides in pure oxygen. However in actual applications, there are four major degradation routes which must be considered: (1) Formation of SiO(g); (2) water vapor enhancement of oxidation rate of Si(OH) 4 volatiles; (3) low level metal cation enhancement of oxidation rate; and (4) molten <b>salt</b> and <b>slag</b> corrosion. Several protective coating concepts have been discussed, which may minimize these effects. Internal effects deal with a microcrack providing a path for oxygen ingress to the oxygen sensitive fiber and fiber coating. This is a critical area of study for theses materials. Possible solutions involve a fluid glass to fill the cracks and/or oxygen getting along the walls of the crack...|$|R
40|$|Conceptual {{designs of}} {{advanced}} combustion systems that use coal as feedstock require high-temperature furnaces and {{heat transfer surfaces}} that can operate at temperatures much higher than in current coal-fired power plants. Combination of elevated temperatures and hostile combustion environments requires advanced ceramics. Objectives of this program are to evaluate the (a) chemistry of gaseous and condensed products arising during coal combustion, (b) corrosion behavior of candidate materials in air, <b>slag,</b> and <b>salt</b> environments, and (c) residual mechanical properties of the materials after corrosion. Temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000 - 1400 C for ceramics and 600 - 1000 C for metallic alloys are emphasized. Coal/ash chemistries developed on the basis of thermodynamic/kinetic calculations, together with slags from actual combustors, are used. Materials being evaluated include monolithic Si carbides from several sources: Si nitride, Si carbide in alumina composites, Si carbide fibers in a Si carbide-matrix composite, and some advanced Ni-base alloys. This paper presents results from an ongoing program on corrosion performance of candidate ceramic materials exposed to air, <b>salt,</b> and <b>slag</b> environments and their effect on flexural strength and energy absorbed during fracture of these materials. 10 figs, 4 tabs, 8 refs...|$|R
40|$|In steel {{refining}} process, {{an increase}} of interfacial area between the metal and slag through the metal droplets emulsified into the slag, so-called ``metal emulsion'', is one prevailing view for improving the reaction rate. The formation of metal emulsion was experimentally evaluated using Al-Cu alloy as metal phase and chloride <b>salt</b> as <b>slag</b> phase under the bottom bubbling condition. Samples were collected {{from the center of}} the salt phase in the container. Large number of metal droplets were separated from the salt by dissolving it into water. The number, surface area, and weight of the droplets increased with the gas flow rate and have local maximum values. The formation and sedimentation rates of metal droplets were estimated using a mathematical model. The formation rate increased with the gas flow rate and has a local maximum value as a function of gas flow rate, while the sedimentation rate is independent of the gas flow rate under the bottom bubbling condition. Three types of formation mode of metal emulsion, which occurred by the rupture of metal film around the bubble, were observed using high speed camera. During the process, an elongated column covered with metal film was observed with the increasing gas flow rate. This elongated column sometimes reached to the top surface of the salt phase. In this case, it is considered that fine droplets were not formed and in consequence, the weight of metal emulsion decreased at higher gas flow rate...|$|R
40|$|Recovery of a salt cake slag {{produced}} from aluminum scrap re-melted in rotary furnaces, {{at the lowest}} cost, while complying with all environmental laws is the main objective of this study. The characterisation of the slag residue involved determinations of the water leaching conditions, toxicological analysis, chemical analysis of the leaching waste, and mineralogical composition. A two-phase study was made {{to determine the effect}} of waste additions on mechanical properties of cement mortars, involving partial replacements of either sand or cement. SEM characterisation of fracture surfaces was also made. Partial substitution of cement, which is the most expensive component of the mortar, by <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> has both environmental and economical advantages. However, only small amounts (up to 10 wt. %) can be replaced by washed slag without significant damage to mortar characteristics. Sand substitution by slag is less problematic and 30 ± 50 wt. % replacement levels are easily achieved. However, the direct economical impact is less relevant. The incorporation of unwashed slag in impracticable, as a result of noxious gases released and significant volumetric expansion effects...|$|E
40|$|Dutch {{construction}} industry {{is well known}} for its wide use of mineral admixtures in concrete production. Ground granulated blast furnace slag cement (slag cement) is most commonly used in northern European countries including The Netherlands with a market share of more than 50 %. Slag cement exhibits economically as well as environmentally attractive properties. Having high durability and its suitability in low heat applications makes, slag-rich concrete one of the best options to be used in aggressive environments; e. g. exposure to acid, chloride attack and sulfate attack. Apart from all the positive aspects, it is known that slag-rich concrete has poor resistance against carbonation and frost <b>salt</b> scaling. Therefore <b>slag</b> cement is rarely used in the structures prone to frost attack i. e. roads, balconies of houses and bridge decks. Recently, a new Sodium monofluorophosphate (Na-MFP) based application has been introduced in order to enable self-healing in slag-rich concrete. Successful results have been obtained with respect to healing carbonation damage in slag-rich concrete in accelerated and natural conditions. In a new PhD project, possibilities will be investigated regarding the application of Na-MFP as curing agent, surface coat and encapsulated self-healing agent on concrete specimens prepared on specifications which are currently being used by Rijkswaterstaat, the Dutch roadwork administration.
