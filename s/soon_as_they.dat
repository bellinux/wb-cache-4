5|$|Surcouf {{arrived at}} Île de France in June, {{defeating}} the British blockade and capturing several ships on the journey.

Before Madero's victory many believed that the rebel forces would scatter as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were confronted by federal troops. The fall of Juárez proved that notion wrong and revealed the real strength of the rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|Among the American {{units that}} {{reinforced}} the Pusan Perimeter as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could arrive were the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the 7th Infantry Division, and the 25th Infantry Divisions, {{along with other}} units of the U.S. Eighth Army that provided logistical, medical, and intelligence support. Advance units of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 in the first encounter between American and North Korean troops. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, the 24th Infantry were repeatedly pushed back and forced southeastward by larger numbers of North Korean troops equipped with rugged Soviet-made T-34 tanks.|$|E

Leaving Hornet behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, Enterprise recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.|$|E

Red Bull pulled in both Webber and David Coulthard for their pit stops as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could when the safety car came on track, due to Nelson Piquet, Jr. crashing, giving them both great track position. This led to Webber running in 2nd place before a gearbox issue put {{him out of the}} race on lap 29.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} {{a litter of}} four capybara young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|If Sheshi {{is to be}} {{equated with}} Salitis, then the seals of Sheshi {{discovered}} in Nubia suggest that the Hyksos allied themselves with the Nubians against the native Egyptian 13th Dynasty as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> arrived in the Nile Delta, an event which Grimal places c. 1720 BC. Grimal envisions Sheshi's kingdom as comprising the entire Nile Delta and the Nile valley north of Gebelein. According to Manetho as reported by Josephus in Against Apion, Salitis reigned from Memphis, and fortified the existing town of Avaris, which was to become the Hyksos' seat of power.|$|E

5|$|In 1248, a Crusader {{fleet of}} 1,800 boats and ships arrived in Cyprus {{with the intent}} of {{launching}} a Seventh Crusade against the Muslims by conquering Egypt. Their commander, Louis IX, attempted to enlist the Mongols to launch a coordinated attack on Egypt, but when this failed to materialize, the Crusader force sailed to Damietta and the local population there fled as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> landed. When as-Salih Ayyub, who was in Syria at the time, heard of this, he rushed back to Egypt, avoiding Damietta, instead reaching Mansurah. There, he organized an army and raised a commando force which harassed the Crusaders.|$|E

Slave children instead worked as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could, were often separated from caregivers and family, and were subject to punishment of many sorts, sometimes no different than those levied on adults. The children's trauma was compared to that of war—enduring abuses, sexual exploitation, inability to protect themselves—and they aged prematurely through these experiences.|$|E

5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to {{organize}} the storm {{in such a way}} as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E

The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared just as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> came. Most stampeders were men but women also travelled to the region, typically as {{the wife of a}} prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E

5|$|The quick pace {{of change}} meant that many ships were {{obsolete}} as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were finished, and that naval tactics were {{in a state of}} flux. Many ironclads were built {{to make use of the}} ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> reached the Continent.|$|E
