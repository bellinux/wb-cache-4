60|$|That {{was almost}} true. Little birds, {{that had never}} seen a man in the woods before, came for the berries and billed them off within six feet of my face before they noticed {{anything}} unusual. When they did see me they would turn their heads so as to look at me, first with one eye, then with the other, and shoot up at last, with a <b>sharp</b> <b>Burr!</b> of their tiny wings, to a branch over my head. There they would watch me keenly, for a wink or a minute, according to their curiosity, then swoop down and whirr their wings loudly in my face, so as to make me move and show what I was.|$|E
60|$|Pericord leaned forward, {{his long}} sallow face quivering with excitement. His white nervous hands darted {{here and there}} among the wires. Brown stood impassive with {{critical}} eyes. There was a <b>sharp</b> <b>burr</b> from the machine. The huge yellow wings gave a convulsive flap. Then another. Then a third, slower and stronger, with a fuller sweep. Then a fourth which filled the barn with a blast of driven air. At the fifth the bag of bricks began to dance upon the trestles. At the sixth it sprang into the air, and would have fallen to the ground, but the seventh came to save it, and fluttered it forward through the air. Slowly rising, it flapped heavily round in a circle, like some great clumsy bird, filling the barn with its buzzing and whirring. In the uncertain yellow light of the single lamp it was strange to see the loom of the ungainly thing, flapping off into the shadows, and then circling back into the narrow zone of light.|$|E
50|$|Common names include buffelgrasses, sandburs, {{and sand}} spur. Such names allude to the <b>sharp,</b> spine-covered <b>burrs</b> characterizing the inflorescences {{of the members}} of the genus.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fruit is}} a green burr with long, silky white hairs and several hair-tufted <b>sharp</b> spines. The <b>burr</b> is around a {{centimeter}} long.|$|R
60|$|Later in the night, when Coralio was {{steeped in}} slumber, he and Billy went forth into the deserted streets with their coats bulging like balloons. All {{up and down}} the Calle Grande they went, sowing the <b>sharp</b> <b>burrs</b> {{carefully}} in the sand, along the narrow sidewalks, in every foot of grass between the silent houses. And then they took the side streets and by-ways, missing none. No place where the foot of man, woman or child might fall was slighted. Many trips they made to and from the prickly hoard. And then, nearly at the dawn, they laid themselves down to rest calmly, as great generals do after planning a victory according to the revised tactics, and slept, knowing that they had sowed with the accuracy of Satan sowing tares and the perseverance of Paul planting.|$|R
40|$|Microcomponents can be {{fabricated}} {{by traditional}} methods like micromilling/drilling, or by nontraditional methods like electrical discharge micromachining (EDM), laser micromachining, or electrochemical micromachining (ECM). These methods, however, often leave detrimental residual defects like <b>sharp</b> <b>burrs,</b> cracks in heat affected zones, {{in addition to}} rough surface finish. Electrochemical polishing (ECP) offers a non-contact technique to remove surface defects such as burrs, rolling/grinding/machining marks regardless of component size. This study develops an ECM/ECP technique to fabricate or polish microcomponents, and implements this technique to polish copper, titanium, and stainless steel microcomponents fabricated by EDM and micromilling. Assessment is made by optical microscopy, electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and interferometry. Burrs and surface defects of the tested microcomponents are effectively removed by ECP. Surface finish of polished surfaces of polycrystalline titanium, copper, and stainless steels is {{in the range of}} 100 - 300 nm Ra on polycrystalline surface and 1 - 10 nm Ra within a single grain...|$|R
60|$|Having {{washed up}} {{as best he}} could, the aristocratic cadet blew out the light he had {{borrowed}} and prepared to retire once more. He threw back the covers and dropped heavily upon the cot in just {{the spot where the}} <b>sharpest</b> of the <b>burrs</b> lay.|$|R
50|$|Fittings {{for central}} vacuum systems {{are similar to}} DWV fittings, but are usually of thinner and lighter {{construction}} because {{the weight of the}} materials conveyed is less. Vacuum-system designs share with DWV designs the need to eliminate internal ridges, <b>burrs,</b> <b>sharp</b> turns, or other obstructions which might create clogs.|$|R
5000|$|The process starts by {{loading the}} {{workpiece}} into an explosion-proof chamber, {{which is then}} sealed and clamped with approximately [...] The chamber is then evacuated of air and filled with an oxygen and fuel mix; this mixture is pressurized to [...] An electrical igniter then ignites the mixture, which burns for approximately 20 milliseconds, causing all of the <b>sharp</b> corners and <b>burrs</b> to burn away. The peak temperature reaches 3000 C.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSelective Laser Deburring (SLD) is an {{innovative}} edge-refinement process being {{developed at the}} Laser Zentrum Nord (LZN) in Hamburg. It offers a wear-free processing of defined radii and bevels at the edges {{as well as the}} possibility to deburr several materials with the same laser source. Sheet metal parts of various applications need to be post-processed to remove <b>sharp</b> edges and <b>burrs</b> remaining from the initial production process. Thus, SLD will provide an extended degree of automation {{for the next generation of}} manufacturing facilities. This paper investigates the dependence between the deburring result and the temperature field in- and post-process. In order to achieve this, the surface temperature near to the deburred edge is monitored with IR-thermography. Different strategies are discussed for the approach using the IR-information as a quality assurance. Additional experiments are performed to rate the accuracy of the quality prediction method in different deburring applications...|$|R
5000|$|Routing {{and design}} of vacuum tubing layout {{is very similar to}} drain-waste-vent (DWV) plumbing, with the {{exception}} that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required. Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, <b>burrs,</b> <b>sharp</b> turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages. Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal [...] "running start". In some jurisdictions, fire code regulations require that an intumescent firestop collar be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a firewall. If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external pipe insulation to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers.|$|R
