5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and <b>SCUD</b> <b>missiles</b> would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles</b> and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E

25|$|The thaw in {{diplomatic}} relations {{came to an}} abrupt end. In May 2010, the USA renewed sanctions against Syria, saying that it supported terrorist groups, seeks {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has provided Lebanon's Hezbollah with <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles</b> in violation of UN resolutions. In 2011 the UN's IAEA nuclear watchdog reported Syria to the UN Security Council over its alleged covert nuclear programme.|$|E
25|$|The Arrow missile, {{a missile}} {{designed}} to destroy ballistic missiles, including <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles,</b> was first deployed by Israel. In 2001, with the Peace Process increasingly in disarray, Ehud Barak called {{a special election}} for Prime Minister. Barak hoped a victory would give him renewed authority in negotiations with the Palestinians. Instead opposition leader Ariel Sharon was elected PM. After this election, the system of directly electing the Premier was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} Gulf War of 1991, Israel was {{attacked}} by Iraqi <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles.</b> Israeli Air Force pilots were on constant stand-by in their cockpits throughout the conflict, ready to fly to Iraq to retaliate. Diplomatic pressure as well as denial of IFF transponder codes from the United States, however, kept the IAF grounded while Coalition air assets and Patriot missile batteries supplied by the US and the Netherlands sought {{to deal with the}} Scuds.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary role}} of the Special Forces Task Group was to secure an area of western Iraq from which it was feared that <b>SCUD</b> <b>missiles</b> could be launched. The SAS {{successfully}} entered Iraq by vehicle and United States helicopters and secured their area of responsibility {{after a week of}} fighting. Following this the SAS patrolled the highways in the area in order to block the escape of members of the Iraqi government and to prevent enemy foreign fighters from entering the country.|$|E
25|$|The brigade was {{originally}} formed in 1953 as an engineering brigade operating <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles,</b> serving in western Ukraine until its 1958 relocation to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany in East Germany. There, {{it became the}} 23rd Rocket Brigade in 1960, and in 1981 relocated to Birobidzhan in eastern Russia. Serving in the Russian Ground Forces after {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union in 1992, the brigade became the 107th Rocket Brigade five years later after inheriting the lineage of a disbanded unit. By 2013 it had been reequipped with more modern Iskander-M tactical ballistic missiles.|$|E

Due to the operational environment and the NORAD ROE at the time, JDFN system was not able to positively identify the <b>Scud</b> <b>missile</b> attack realtime. It was only after this attack that the operational ROE was changed. Had the new operational ROE been in place before Feb 1991, JDFN would have positively identified the attack realtime.|$|R

25|$|Wallace left NBC in 1989 for ABC. At ABC News, Wallace was {{the senior}} {{correspondent}} for Primetime Thursday and occasionally hosted Nightline. During the first Gulf War in 1991, he reported from Tel Aviv on the Iraqi <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles</b> attacks. At the time, the Israeli Government {{did not want}} to advertise where the Scuds landed, in order to prevent the Iraqis from making adjustments to their launchers. On one episode of Nightline, Wallace started describing the location in Tel Aviv where a Scud missile landed. Nightline host Ted Koppel cut him off, and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location.|$|E
25|$|On 9 December 2002 Spanish frigate SPS Navarra (F85) intercepted the unflagged {{freighter}} So San {{several hundred}} {{miles southeast of}} Yemen {{at the request of}} the United States government. The frigate fired across So Sans bow after the freighter ignored hails and attempted to evade the frigate. The freighter’s crew was North Korean; 23 containers containing 15 complete Scud ballistic missiles, 15 high-explosive warheads, and 23 nitric acid (used as an oxidizer for fueling <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles)</b> containers were found on board. Yemen claimed ownership of the shipment and protested the interception and U.S. officials released the vessel after receiving assurances that the missiles would not be transferred to a third party.|$|E
25|$|The brigade traces its {{heritage}} {{back to the}} 77th Engineering Brigade of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK), activated in May 1953 at Kapustin Yar. It {{included the}} 229th, 232nd, and 234th Separate Engineering Battalions, and a technical battery, and in October 1953 it was transferred to Bilokorovychi, in northern Ukraine, armed with R-11 <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles.</b> Two years later, the brigade was rearmed with R-17 Elbrus missiles. The 232nd Battalion was deployed to the Baikonur Test Center in July 1955 and was replaced there by the 229th Battalion a year later, with the 229th Battalion returning to Ukraine in July 1956. In July 1958 the 77th Brigade {{became part of the}} army, dropping the RVGK designation, and simultaneously relocated to Weißenfels, becoming part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany.|$|E

25|$|During the 1991 Gulf War, Israel {{feared that}} Iraq would attack {{the country with}} {{missiles}} carrying chemical weapons and prepared accordingly. Four million gas masks were distributed to citizens across the country, {{as well as to}} residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and chemical-proof sealed rooms were prepared in homes. No chemical weapons were actually launched by Iraq, but Iraq did fire 39 conventional <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles</b> on Israel {{during the course of the}} war, hitting neighborhoods around Tel Aviv and elsewhere and causing extensive property damage. As soon as the first missile fell, Israel declared a chemical-weapons civil defense alert. Upon missile attacks, air-raid sirens sounded nationwide and civil defense authorities instructed the public, via radio, to don gas masks and close themselves in sealed rooms.|$|E
25|$|While Iraq's WMD {{capabilities}} were degraded under UN {{supervision and}} set back by Coalition strikes, some capabilities remain and others could quickly be regenerated. Despite claims that WMD efforts have ceased, Iraq probably is continuing clandestine nuclear research, retains stocks {{of chemical and}} biological munitions, and is concealing extended-range <b>SCUD</b> <b>missiles,</b> possibly equipped with CBW payloads. Even if Baghdad reversed its course and surrendered all WMD capabilities, it retains the scientific, technical, and industrial infrastructure to replace agents and munitions within weeks or months. A special concern {{is the absence of}} a UN inspection and monitoring presence, which until December 1998 had been paramount to preventing large-scale resumption of prohibited weapons programs. A new disarmament regime must be reintroduced into Iraq as soon as possible and allowed to carry out the mandates dictated by the post-Gulf War UN resolutions.|$|E
25|$|In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, {{triggering}} the Gulf War between Iraq {{and a large}} allied force, led by the United States. Iraq attacked Israel with 39 <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles.</b> Israel did not retaliate at {{request of}} the U.S., fearing that if Israel responded against Iraq, other Arab nations might desert the allied coalition. Israel provided gas masks for both the Palestinian population and Israeli citizens, while Netherlands and the United States deployed Patriot defense batteries in Israel as protection against the Scuds. In May 1991, during a 36-hour period, 15,000 Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) were secretly airlifted to Israel. The coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened new possibilities for regional peace, and in October 1991 the U.S. President, George H.W. Bush, and Soviet Union Premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, jointly convened a historic meeting in Madrid of Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian, and Palestinian leaders. Shamir opposed the idea but agreed in return for loan guarantees to help with absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. His participation in the conference led {{to the collapse of}} his (right-wing) coalition.|$|E
