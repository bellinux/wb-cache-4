5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the cure for {{political}} injustices {{is identical to the}} cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{there are}} now about 1800 botanical gardens and arboreta in about 150 {{countries}} (mostly in temperate regions) of which about 550 are in Europe (150 {{of which are in}} Russia), 200 in North America, and an increasing number in East Asia. These gardens attract about 150 million visitors a year, so it is hardly <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> many people gained their first exciting introduction to the wonders of the plant world in a botanical garden.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E
5|$|While Allied naval {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the approach of the German strike force and were successful in sinking two of the four submarines dispatched, efforts to locate and sink U-862 once she reached Australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti-submarine warfare. As the southern coast of Australia was thousands of kilometres behind the active combat front in South-East Asia and had not been raided for several years, it should not be considered <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> few anti-submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945.|$|E

5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, {{it is not}} <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> their players {{dominated}} the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs {{at a much higher}} average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were {{a large part of the}} success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Byrne's early life beyond {{the fact that he}} was born in Ireland in 1806. His first fight, in 1825, was a loss to Mike Larking; it lasted 138 rounds spread over two and a half hours—despite the fact that at this time a round could vary in length, and usually only ended when a man was knocked down. His second fight was a draw against Jack Manning in 1826, earning Byrne £100. Next was Byrne's first match against the Scottish boxer Alexander McKay, which Byrne won easily in five rounds, earning him a further £100. This match was McKay's first ever prize-fight. This victory was soon {{followed}} by a win against Bob Avery, earning a further £50, then another win over Phil Samson in 1829, earning him £200. By the standards of the day these latter sums were enormous; it is therefore <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> he was then offered £200 for a rematch, regardless of whether he won or not, against the less experienced McKay, whom he had beaten so easily on the first occasion. As of 2008 that would be the equivalent of about £13,600.|$|E
