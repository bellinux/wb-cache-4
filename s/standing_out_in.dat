25|$|Medullation {{can be an}} {{objectionable}} trait. Medullated fibers {{can take}} less dye, <b>standing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the finished garment, and are weaker. The proportion of medullated fibers is higher in the coarser, unwanted guard hairs: there is less or no medullation in the finer, lower micrometer fibers. These undesirable fibers are easy to see and give a garment a hairy appearance. Quality alpaca products should be free from these medullated fibers.|$|E

For this reason, the main characters change their appearance in certain worlds to avoid <b>standing</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> the worlds based on The Little Mermaid and The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sora, Donald, and Goofy transform into undersea creatures and Halloween monsters, respectively. For The Lion King, they transformed into animals (or, in Donald and Goofy's case, less humanoid forms) because Nomura felt that it would appear odd to have Sora and the others interact in their standard forms, since no humans appear in that film.|$|E

He rarely speaks and has the reputation of being a lone wolf. As Squall's story unfolds, he becomes fascinated with and falls in love with Rinoa, despite never outwardly expressing such until the ending. Squall is characterized by forlorn memories of <b>standing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the rain at the orphanage where he grew up, wondering where [...] "Sis" [...] went. Squall's weapon is a gunblade, a sword that uses components of a revolver to send vibrations through the blade when triggered. His Limit Break is a series of sword strikes called Renzokuken.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small moments, like Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean <b>standing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I {{know a lot of people}} have already given up, but I really feel like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good. It's not there yet, but I see glimmers." ...|$|E

Tom wears a goofy orange hat at the bar, which he calls [...] "peacocking", or <b>standing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a public setting like a peacock. The two talk to women at the bar, but Mark finds them boring and he leaves Tom alone. Ron enjoys the banquet's bacon-wrapped shrimp, [...] "my number one {{favorite}} food, wrapped around my number three favorite food". Leslie confronts Jeanine about her husband's DUI, but when Jeanine grows angry, Leslie is unable to go through with the blackmail; Jeanine splashes water in Leslie's face, and she leaves ashamed.

Mark comes back to the banquet hall to find Ann and Leslie, but is disappointed to see the banquet is over.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Stone reprised {{the role}} of Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. In an {{interview}} with Total Film, the actress explained that her character was not dependent on the film's protagonist. [...] "She saves him more than he saves her. She's incredibly helpful to Spider-Man... He's the muscle, she's the brains." [...] Her performance was well received by critics; an Empire reviewer praised her for <b>standing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the film: [...] "Stone is the Heath Ledger of this series, doing something unexpected with an easily dismissed supporting character." [...] The role earned her the Favorite Movie Actress award at the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards. Later that year, Stone took on a role in Woody Allen's romantic comedy Magic in the Moonlight, a modest commercial success. A. O. Scott criticized her role, and pairing with Colin Firth, describing it as [...] "the kind of pedantic nonsense that is meant to signify superior intellect".|$|E
500|$|Lavigne {{released}} her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, {{was released in}} summer 2009 in Europe, {{and later in the}} US and Canada.

2500|$|In September 2017, Francis made {{changes in}} Canon Law {{to leave to}} the {{discretion}} of local bishops’ conferences the wording of liturgical texts. This effectively reversed the efforts of those who, under popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, had required that these texts conform closely to the original Latin expression. In Francis’ words, “the vernacular languages themselves, often only in a progressive manner, {{would be able to}} become liturgical languages, <b>standing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a not dissimilar way to liturgical Latin for their elegance of style and the profundity of their concepts with the aim of nourishing the faith”.This was seen by some {{as the end of the}} “reform of the reform” movement that sought to overturn the principles of liturgical reform proposed by the Second Vatican Council. Earlier Francis had written: “We cannot demand that peoples of every continent, in expressing their Christian faith, imitate modes of expression which European nations developed at a particular moment of their history” (EG 118). And he had distanced himself from the previous popes who gave broad permission for reversion to the Mass in Latin, observing: ...|$|E
