5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), <b>spirometry,</b> electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain {{on the right side}} of the heart caused by OHS, and <b>spirometry</b> may show a restrictive pattern related to obesity.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{for using}} <b>spirometry</b> among those without {{symptoms}} {{in an effort}} to diagnose the condition earlier is of uncertain effect and is therefore currently not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of COPD {{should be considered}} in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness of breath, a chronic cough, sputum production, or frequent winter colds and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. <b>Spirometry</b> is then used to confirm the diagnosis. Screening those without symptoms is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to be caused by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and <b>spirometry.</b> Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spirometry</b> {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, <b>spirometry</b> would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E
5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as <b>spirometry.</b> Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all the air}} in {{the lungs}} can be {{expelled}} during maximally forced exhalation. This is the residual volume of about 1.0-1.5liters which cannot be measured by <b>spirometry.</b> Volumes that include the residual volume (i.e. functional residual capacity of about 2.5-3.0liters, and total lung capacity of about 6liters) can therefore also not be measured by <b>spirometry.</b> Their measurement requires special techniques.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequently}} used test for lung function for divers is <b>spirometry,</b> which measures the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air {{that can be}} inhaled and exhaled. <b>Spirometry</b> is an important tool used for generating pneumotachographs, which are helpful in assessing conditions such as asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and COPD, {{all of which are}} contraindications for diving. Sometimes only peak expiratory flow (PEF) is measured, which uses a much simpler apparatus, but is still useful to give an indication of lung overpressure risk.|$|E
25|$|Lung {{function}} tests (<b>spirometry)</b> {{should be}} performed at least annually in children old enough to perform them, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines given to eligible individuals, and sinopulmonary infections treated aggressively to limit the development of chronic lung disease.|$|E
25|$|The vaso-occlusive {{crisis is}} caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells that obstruct {{capillaries}} and restrict blood flow to an organ resulting in ischaemia, pain, necrosis, and often organ damage. The frequency, severity, and duration of these crises vary considerably. Painful crises are treated with hydration, analgesics, and blood transfusion; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac or naproxen. For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia devices are commonly used in this setting. Vaso-occlusive crisis involving organs such as the penis or lungs are considered an emergency and treated with red-blood cell transfusions. Incentive <b>spirometry,</b> a technique to encourage deep breathing to minimise the development of atelectasis, is recommended.|$|E
500|$|Other lung {{function}} tests include <b>spirometry,</b> measuring the amount (volume) {{and flow of}} air that can be inhaled and exhaled. The maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled is called the vital capacity. In particular, how much a person is able to exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1) {{as a proportion of}} how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). This ratio, the FEV1/FEV ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive. Another test is that of the lung's [...] diffusing capacity – this {{is a measure of the}} transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.|$|E
2500|$|The lungs {{expand and}} {{contract}} during the breathing cycle, drawing air {{in and out of}} the lungs. The volume of air moved in or out of the lungs under normal resting circumstances (the resting tidal volume of about 500ml), and volumes moved during maximally forced inhalation and maximally forced exhalation are measured in humans by <b>spirometry.</b> A typical adult human spirogram with the names given to the various excursions in volume the lungs can undergo is illustrated below (Fig.3): ...|$|E

The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society also recommends race-specific reference values when available.

50|$|<b>Spirometry</b> (meaning the {{measuring}} of breath) {{is the most}} common of the pulmonary function tests (PFTs).

50|$|The {{bronchial}} {{challenge test}} is physically demanding, {{and the results}} can be affected by muscular weakness or exhaustion. The inhaled drug can stimulate the upper airway sufficiently to cause violent coughing. This can make <b>spirometry</b> difficult or impossible. This test is contraindicated in patients with severe airway obstruction due to the obvious worsening of the obstruction. Also contraindicated by the presence of an aortic aneurysm, as <b>spirometry</b> will increase blood pressure, in proportion to both the patient's effort and the degree of obstruction in the lungs.|$|E
50|$|There is {{currently}} no precise {{test for the}} diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.
