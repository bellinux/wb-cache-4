40|$|AbstractIntroductionIn {{diagnosis}} of epilepsies electrophysiological findings {{play a key}} role. While spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and EEG with sleep deprivation (EEGsd) are widely evaluated and used, application of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in this field is primarily limited to presurgical assessment of focal epilepsies. MethodsIn this study we retrospectively compared MEG (M/EEG) and EEGsd in 63 (55) patients with focal and generalized epilepsy with regard to occurrence of epileptic spikes. ResultsMEG could record epileptic <b>spikes</b> <b>in</b> 38 patients (60 %), while EEGsd recorded <b>spikes</b> <b>in</b> only 32 patients (51 %). In a group of 55 patients simultaneous MEG/EEG (M/EEG) was able to record <b>spikes</b> <b>in</b> 38 patients (71 %) compared to epileptic <b>spikes</b> <b>in</b> 28 patients (51 %) recorded by EEGsd. In a subgroup of 17 MR-negative patients simultaneous M/EEG could record epileptic <b>spikes</b> <b>in</b> all patients, while EEGsd was successful in only 11 (64 %) of them. ConclusionIn this study, MEG showed a tendency to record epileptic <b>spikes</b> <b>in</b> more patients than EEGsd. Furthermore, simultaneous M/EEG {{has been shown to}} be especially successful in detection of epileptic <b>spikes</b> <b>in</b> patients with MR-negative epilepsy. This might at least in parts be explained by neocortical predominance of MR-negative epilepsy. Thus, this study motivates prospective studies to evaluate the substitutability of EEGsd by MEG more extensively...|$|R

This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were too expensive to operate compared to conventional equipment. The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E

A sampling of 378adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between December1992 and January1993. A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to {{the aftermath}} of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E

30|$|Categories 3 – 9 {{show the}} {{combined}} effect of dilution and sulphate spiking. Categories 3 – 7 show a declining trend of IFT {{with an increased}} concentration of sulphate. In category 3, the IFT of six times sulphate-spiked brine of SW/ 10 is 11 % {{less than that of}} SW/ 10 without sulphate <b>spiking.</b> <b>In</b> category 4, the IFT of six times sulphate-spiked brine of SW/ 50 is 7.8 % less than that of SW/ 50 without sulphate <b>spiking.</b> <b>In</b> category 5, the IFT of six times sulphate-spiked brine of SW/ 100 is 7.8 % less than that of SW/ 100 without sulphate <b>spiking.</b> <b>In</b> category 6, the IFT of six times sulphate-spiked brine of SW/ 200 is 4.7 % less than that of SW/ 200 without sulphate <b>spiking.</b> <b>In</b> category 7, the IFT of six times sulphate-spiked brine of SW/ 300 is 11.6 % less than that of SW/ 300 without sulphate <b>spiking.</b> This reduction <b>in</b> IFT in categories 3 – 7 is due to the increased amount of sulphate by 5310  mg/L <b>in</b> the <b>spiked</b> brine. So <b>in</b> categories 3 – 7, effect of sulphate spiking is more dominant than the effect of dilution. Observational error in categories 8 and 9 lead to an increasing trend of IFT. The same is to be confirmed from the IFT at high-pressure and high-temperature conditions because the sulphate has more effect at higher temperatures. In category 8, the IFT of six times sulphate-spiked brine of SW/ 400 is 6 % greater than that of SW/ 400 without sulphate <b>spiking.</b> <b>In</b> category 9, the IFT of six times sulphate-spiked brine of SW/ 500 is 19.8 % greater than that of SW/ 500 without sulphate <b>spiking.</b> This increase <b>in</b> IFT in categories 8 and 9 is due to the increased amount of sulphate by 5310  mg/L <b>in</b> the <b>spiked</b> brine. So effect of dilution is more than the effect of sulphate <b>spiking</b> <b>in</b> categories 8 and 9.|$|R
5|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence of global disruption of plant communities at the K–Pg boundary. Extinctions are seen both {{in studies of}} fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K–Pg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the Paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a fern <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> the geologic record; this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{conditions}} on the island also worsened under Rajoelina. The illegal exportation of endangered rosewood from protected national forests abruptly increased under the HAT, with several business leaders and politicians linked to the HAT having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects. A large, unexplained stash of rosewood logs was discovered at the presidential palace {{after the end of}} Rajoelina's term in office. Due to accelerating deforestation and a <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> bush meat consumption linked with deepening poverty, the island's lemurs moved closer toward extinction under Rajoelina's tenure. A July 2012 assessment found that 90percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, an increase from 38 percent in 2008. Lack of funds for pesticides and systematic spraying resulted in the March 2013 outbreak of a locust infestation that was anticipated to persist for five to ten years and require $41 million U.S. dollars to bring under control, deepening the risk of nationwide famine and destruction of habitat for endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
