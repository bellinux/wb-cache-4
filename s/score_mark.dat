40|$|With no {{significant}} changes in the design of rifle ranges in more than 100 years, the current range systems are not keeping pace with technological advancements. The Marine Corps rifle ranges are manpower and material intensive, requiring unit commanders to lose personnel to the training evolution for extended periods of non-productive time. Manual target operation, excessive transition time, and extra duties all contribute to eight to ten hours per day to accomplish one hour of live-fire training per individual Marine. Marines must remain at the range to act as scorekeepers, target makers, and/or target operators when not assigned to shoot. The design and implementation of an automated range system with capabilities specifically designed to operate, <b>score,</b> <b>mark,</b> and maintain targets would reduce the non-productive time a Marine spends on the rifle range. Results from this comparative analysis indicate that the automated range would reduce man-hours by seventy-five percent. Furthermore, the implementation of computer technology will enable instructors and shooters to better analyze each training evolution. U. S. Marine Corps (U. S. M. C.) author...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{the ease}} of {{subdivision}} of scored tablets is estimated in vivo. In order to replace such in vivo testing {{and to develop a}} surrogate test which uses in vitro techniques, the association between physical parameters of scored tablets and their ease of subdivision was studied. The physical properties of 23 brands of scored tablets of which their ease of subdivision in vivo was known were established. Statistical modeling using a logistic regression model was used to fit the data and estimate the contribution of each physical parameter to the goodness of the fit. For scored oblong tablets, the critical parameters for their ease of subdivision are: diameter; diameter/width ratio; depth of score line and resistance to crushing. Criteria for each of these parameters were derived. All criteria need to be complied with to guarantee sufficient ease of subdivision of scored oblong tablets. For scored round tablets the critical parameters, in decreasing order of importance, for their ease of subdivision, are: resistance to crushing, diameter, <b>score</b> <b>mark</b> (one- or two-sided), and shape (flat or biconvex). A five-parameter predictive model was developed, showing excellent discrimination. For development, the proposed surrogate tests are sufficiently reliable. For release testing and stability studies, resistance to crushing of a scored tablet is a reliable predictor of its ease of subdivision. © 2010 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the user-friendliness of medicines. Using medicines {{is a complex}} process during which many difficulties can be experienced, for instance {{with the opening of}} packaging, the breakability of tablets or the administration of eye drops. Such practical problems can lead to incorrect use of medicines and consequently into deterioration of medical conditions or to adverse effects ranging from bothersome complaints to serious reactions including disability or (re) admissions to hospital. We took the usability of medicines for older people {{as a starting point for}} our studies. Aging comes with an increased prevalence of functional decline, e. g. with regard to decreased vision, hearing, manual dexterity and hand-grip strength. Consequently, aging can affect patients’ ability to adequately use medicines. Besides, older people are the largest user group of medicines. Taking the capabilities of the aging population into account during the development of medicines will help older people to use their medicines independently. First, we investigated the practical problems that older people experience with the daily use of their medication through telephone questionnaires and interviews. These two studies provide insight in the variety of problems that older people may experience with the use of their medicines and their strategies to overcome the usability issues. In addition, the potential clinical consequences of the problems and solutions were determined. We then focussed on the suitability of the design of medicines for use by older people. We investigated the design features of medicines that caused the previously identified use problems among older patients, and the functionality of the <b>score</b> <b>mark</b> on tablets for dividing tablets in equal doses. At last, approaches to prevent usability problems with medicines are explored. This includes overcoming problems with the swallowing of tablets and with the subdivision of tablets. In addition, it was investigated to what extent pharmacy technicians identify problems with opening medicine packaging and how they assist patients in resolving these problems. This thesis demonstrates that the user-friendliness of medicines can be approved significantly. This requires a multifaceted approach; not only medicine developers can contribute to the better use of medicines, also regulatory agencies, health care providers, health insurers and patients themselves should be committed to contribute to this. We recommend that medicines developers evaluate the usability of medicines for the intended user population during product development. Concomitantly, we advise regulators to encourage medicine developers to conduct usability studies and assess the outcomes of such studies as part of the marketing authorisation application. In addition, collecting and sharing post-marketing reports on usability problems with medicines could significantly contribute to the prevention of similar problems with other products. As patients are not forthcoming about problems with the use of their medicines, health care providers should encourage patients to report their usability problems and address these problems as part of counselling. Health care insurance companies can play a role in preventing usability problems with medicines by taking the usability of a medicine into account when selecting preferred suppliers...|$|E
