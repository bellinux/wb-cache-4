40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 33) The rotating photometer is {{an astronomical}} device designed to position and rotate a reticon chip diode array. As the diode array rotates, it measures the surface {{brightness of the}} sun. One end of the half inch long diode array must be positioned to within. 001 inch of rotational center. Rotational error must be less than 15 minutes of arc. This corresponds to only. 002 inch at the diode array's half inch radius. A stepper motor rotates the device through a <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> pair. To remove backlash, an anti-backlash mechanism insures that the teeth are always in contact. A circular tube passes through two large bearings, allowing the device to rotate. These bearings are preloaded to reduce bearing radial play. The preload mechanism also allows for differential temperature expansion between the rotating tube and the device's mounting plate. Before reaching the diode array, sunlight passes through a lens. The lens must be precisely positioned in three axes. To align and position the diode array, a novel three axis fine adjustment is used...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a smart, motorized, voice controlled wheelchair using embedded system. Proposed design supports voice activation system for physically disabled persons incorporating manual operation. Arduino microcontroller and speaker dependent voice recognition processor have been used to support the navigation of the wheel chair. The direction and velocity of the chair are controlled by pre-defined Arabic voice commands. The speaker dependent, isolated word recognition system (IWRS) for a definite utterance of Arabic words to suit the patient's requirements has been programmed and successfully demonstrated. The technique of speech signal processing for extraction of sound parameters, noise removal, intensity and normalization of time, and features matching etc. have been done with the speech processor HM 2007 that being embedded efficiently in real time. Arduino receives the coded digital signals from the IWRS which being properly recognizes voice commands in order to control the function of the chair accordingly. The wheelchair does not respond to a false speech command. The overall mechanical assembly is driven by two 14 A/ 24 V/ 200 Watt DC motors having an engagement/disengagement clutch and <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> with built-in locking control.

40|$|Part I: Governing and Synchronization The {{design and}} {{construction}} of an aircraft propeller governor or synchronizer is a specialized problem concerning Servo-Mechanism Theory. Search developed that adequate theory existed to cover the specific variables involved. The sources used in this report {{are listed in the}} extensive bibliography. Short descriptions are presented of the various governing and synchronizing means used to control present day propellers. In this research an airplane engine-propeller system was simulated and a single unit of a synchronizer, suitable for use as a governor for one engine, was invented and constructed. It was demonstrated to meet the United States Army Air Corps tentative specifications for propeller synchronizers. Time and unavailability of material and overworked shop facilities did not permit the construction of a model for full scale multi-motored airplane test. It is contemplated that such a model will later be constructed at the Materiel Division, United States Air Corps, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. A detailed description of this invention is presented in Appendix I. A discussion is presented of the general servo-mechanism theory as applied to airplane propeller governors and synchronizers. In addition, a short discussion is presented of how synchronization of propellers influences the tactical employment of military aircraft. The physiological effect on occupants of aircraft is also shortly discussed. Part II: Effect of Variable Engine Reduction Gearing on Aircraft Performance The demand for improved performance in aircraft has led through the years to the development of more efficient propulsive systems, starting with the fixed pitch propeller directly driven from the engine and progressing to the modern geared constant speed variable pitch propeller. This development and the reasons for it are briefly described. The continued increase in performance leads to the two <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> and finally to the continuously variable reduction gear combined with the constant speed variable pitch propeller. The possible advantages of such an installation and the reasons for these advantages are described. Two examples of modern military airplanes are used to illustrate in detail the gains in performance that may be obtained. The extension to probable developments in airplanes to be built in the near future is considered. Mechanical difficulties and control problems are briefly discussed. ...|$|E

2500|$|Though a {{much larger}} aircraft, the G.11E used the same coaxial, three blade twin rotor layout as on the Gyroplane Laboratoire. It was {{initially}} powered by a fan cooled [...] Potez 9E nine cylinder radial engine mounted amidships, under the concentric rotor shafts. [...] There was 6.5:1 <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> between the engine and the rotor drive. The rotors are built around tapered tube spars, which carry ribs and are Dural clad at the leading edges and with alloy over 3-ply elsewhere. They are mounted on flapping hinges and have drag hinge dampers. The control column alters cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and pedals make torque corrections and control yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors. A mechanical inertial governor limited rotor accelerations; the pilot could increase the collective pitch over that set by the governor but not below it, emergencies apart.|$|R
50|$|The {{generator}} {{is required}} to be rugged and capable of very high speeds, as it is driven at the turbine's <b>speed,</b> without <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b> The rotor must thus be simple in design and there can also be no sliding contacts to sliprings or other brushgear. Although the power requirement for the missile may be a largely DC supply, the AC alternator and its need for a rectifier is still favoured for its mechanical robustness.|$|R
40|$|A compact sized PDE with an i. d. of 0. 75 in. {{and length}} of 1 m was paired with an {{automotive}} turbocharger. The turbine-compressor shaft was used to drive a small ac generator by means of <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> wheels. The PDE was tested with propane-oxygen mixture at 15 Hz {{for a period of}} about 20 s. The turbine spun up to a speed of 127, 000 rpm, whilst the generator produced electric power at 27 W and the compressor pumped air at a rate of 0. 055 kg/s. The exhaust of the turbine was measured to be 800 ˚C, which implies that the exhaust has enough enthalpy to drive a few more turbine stages. The radial turbine results in more losses as it diverts the flow by 90 ˚ and its housing also creates hot spots. Axial turbines are better suited for application with PDEs and also enable better <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> mechanisms to be applied, allowing larger and heavier generators to be used with turbines. The turbocharger did not exhibit any signs of damage after several minutes of testing. In subsequent tests with the PDE, detonations were observed for H 2 -O 2 mixtures, but H 2 -Air mixtures failed to detonate.

50|$|Centurion series {{engines are}} always fitted with {{constant}} speed propellers which allow {{the engine to}} be operated at optimum speed at all times. However, the normal operating speed is too high for any suitable propeller and so the propeller is driven through a reduction gearbox. The constant <b>speed</b> propeller and <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> result in a propeller tip speed that is 10-15% lower than comparable conventional avgas engines, reducing propeller noise.|$|R
50|$|The {{quest for}} economy {{was even more}} {{important}} when cruising speeds were considered. Cruising speed is roughly 50% of a warship's maximum speed and 20-25% of its maximum power level. This would be a speed used on long voyages when fuel economy is desired. Although this brought the propeller speeds down to an efficient range, turbine efficiency was greatly reduced, and early turbine ships had poor cruising ranges. A solution that proved useful {{through most of the}} steam turbine propulsion era was the cruising turbine. This was an extra turbine to add even more stages, at first attached directly to one or more shafts, exhausting to a stage partway along the HP turbine, and not used at high <b>speeds.</b> As <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> became available around 1911, some ships, notably the battleship , had them on cruising turbines while retaining direct drive main turbines. <b>Reduction</b> <b>gears</b> allowed turbines to operate in their efficient range at a much higher speed than the shaft, but were expensive to manufacture.|$|R
40|$|For project two {{you will}} be working in the same groups as project one. The {{second part of the}} design project is to select the two most {{appropriate}} power plants for final evaluation in Phase 3. You should use the propulsors selected in Phase I (corrected if necessary) to carry out economic evaluations of combinations of propulsors and power plants. The selection process should be based on minimum life cycle cost. The power plants to be considered should include (but are not limited to) simple gas turbines, inter-cooled recuperative gas turbines (ICR), and medium <b>speed</b> diesels. <b>Reduction</b> <b>gears</b> with controllable reversible pitch propellers (CRP) and electric drive with fixed pitch propellers should be considered for the drive train and propulsor.
