2500|$|The Wei Shu (魏書; Book of Wei) and the Jiuzhou Chunqiu (九州春秋) gave {{different}} accounts on how Lu Su urged Sun Quan {{to go to}} {{war with}} Cao Cao.

2500|$|Seven {{days before}} the invasion, a Soviet spy in Berlin, part of the Rote Kapelle (Red Orchestra) spy network, warned Stalin that the {{movement}} of German divisions to the borders was to wage war on the Soviet Union. Five {{days before the}} attack, Stalin received a report from a spy in the German Air Ministry that [...] "all preparations by Germany for an armed attack on the Soviet Union have been completed, and the blow can be expected at any time." [...] In the margin, Stalin wrote to the people's commissar for state security, [...] "you can <b>send</b> <b>your</b> 'source' from the headquarters of German aviation to his mother. This is not a 'source' but a dezinformator." [...] Although Stalin increased Soviet western border forces to 2.7 million men and ordered them to expect a possible German invasion, he did not order a full-scale mobilisation of forces to prepare for an attack. Stalin felt that a mobilisation might provoke Hitler to prematurely begin to wage war against the Soviet Union, which Stalin wanted to delay until 1942 in order to strengthen Soviet forces.|$|E

2500|$|St. Elsewhere {{was set at}} {{the fictional}} St. Eligius Hospital, a {{decaying}} urban teaching hospital in Boston's South End neighborhood. (The South End's Franklin Square House Apartments, {{formerly known as the}} St. James Hotel and located next to Franklin and Blackstone Squares, stood in for the hospital in establishing shots, including the series' opening sequence.) The hospital's nickname, [...] "St. Elsewhere", is a slang term used in the medical field to refer to lesser-equipped hospitals that serve patients turned away by more prestigious institutions; it is also used in medical academia to refer to teaching hospitals in general. In the pilot episode, surgeon Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) informs his colleagues that the local Boston media had bestowed the derogatory nickname upon St. Eligius since they perceived the hospital as [...] "a dumping ground, a place you wouldn't want to <b>send</b> <b>your</b> mother-in-law." [...] In fact, the hospital was so poorly regarded that its shrine to Saint Eligius was commonly defiled by the hospital's visitors and staff, and is passingly referred to by Dr. Wayne Fiscus as [...] "the patron saint of longshoremen and bowlers." [...] (Eligius is neither; he is patron saint of numismatists, metalworkers, and horses.) ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Summer of 1875, both Bristow and Pierrepont {{obtained}} President Grant's {{order to}} [...] "let know guilty man escape". During the Fall of 1875, evidence {{was discovered that}} Grant's private secretary, Orville Babcock {{had been involved in}} the Ring. Bristow and Pierrepont, stayed behind after a cabinet meeting with President Grant and showed him correspondence between Babcock and William Joyce in St. Louis, indicted in the Ring, cryptic telegram messages as evidence of Babcock's involvement in the Ring. Babcock was summoned to the Oval Office for an explanation and was told to send a telegram to bring Wilson to Washington, D.C. After Babcock did not return to the Oval Office, Pierrepont discovered Babcock {{was in the process of}} writing a letter warning Wilson to be on his guard. This angered Attorney General Pierrepont, who spilled ink over Babcock's letter and shouted, [...] "You don't want to <b>send</b> <b>your</b> argument; send the fact, and go there and make your explanation. I do not understand it." [...] Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in a trial in St. Louis, after an oral deposition from President Grant defending Babcock was given to the jury. The Justice Department obtained 110 convictions of persons involved in the Whiskey Ring.|$|E
2500|$|The enslaved {{people wanted}} peace {{and did not}} want war. They came up with a {{proposal}} that would serve as a peace offering among their master and all of his enslaved people. The terms were outlined as such: Enslaved people are to be given Fridays and Saturdays to work for themselves and these two days are not to be subtracted or counted as Saint's days. Furthermore, they must be given casting nets and canoes for survival. Slaves are also not obliged to fish in tidal pools or gather shellfish and if the master wishes to eat shellfish, the slaves asked to <b>send</b> <b>your</b> mina blacks. The proposal also stated the request of making a large boat so that when it goes to Bahia, the slaves can place their cargoes aboard and not pay freightage of carrying the goods in bulks. In addition, in the planting of manioc, they requested that the men to have a daily quota of two and a half hands and for the women, two hands. For manioc four, the daily quota must be five level alqueires or also equivalent to 36.27 litres in dry measure. The daily quota for sugarcane was set to five hands rather than six and with ten canes in each bundle. Next, on the boats it was stated that there are to be four poles, and one pole for the rudder to steer the ship, and the one at the rudder must work hard for the slaves. Upon that request, the wood that is sawed using a hand saw must have three men below and one men above. The following on the list was that the measure of firewood had to be practiced here, and for each measure a woodcutter and a woman had to be the wood carrier. The peace proposal also stated that they did not want the present oversees and to choose new ones with the approval of the slaves first. In the proposal, it was also written that at the milling rollers there has to be four women to feed in the cane, two pulleys, and a carcanha. Also, at each cauldron or pot there must be a person to tend the fire and this also must apply to each series of kettles. On Saturdays, there must be no work at all in the mill without fail. On top of that, sailors that go in the launch beside the baize shirt, must be provided with a jacket baize and with all other necessary clothing. The slaves agreed to go and work the canefield of Jabirú but it must remain as a pasture as they would not cut cane in the swamp. The terms also pointed out that the slaves are to be allowed to plant rice wherever they want and in any marsh, without needing to ask permission. Each slave is also allowed to cut jacaranda or any other wood without having to be accounted for it. The proposal concluded with saying that by accepting all the terms stated in the proposal and always allowing the slaves to possess the hardware, they would be ready to serve the master just as they did before but {{they do not want to}} continue living the bad customs like how it was in the other engenhos or known as sugar cane mills and facilities. Their last request was that they are to be able to play, relax and sing at any time they wished to do so without being hindered and that asking permission was not needed to do any of that.|$|E
