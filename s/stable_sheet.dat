40|$|International audiencehere {{have been}} years of {{discussion}} and controversy {{about the existence}} of very thin and <b>stable</b> temperature <b>sheets</b> and their relationship to the VHF radar aspect sensitivity. It is only recently that very high-resolution in situ temperature observations have brought credence to the reality and ubiquity of these structures in the free atmosphere and to their contribution to radar echo enhancements along the vertical. Indeed, measurements with very high-resolution sensors are still extremely rare and rather difficult to obtain outside of the planetary boundary layer. They have only been carried out up to the lower stratosphere by Service d'A´ eronomie (CNRS, France) for about 10 years. The controversy also persisted due to the volume resolution of the (Mesosphere) -Stratosphere-Troposphere VHF radars which is coarse with respect to sheet thickness, although widely sufficient for meteorological or mesoscale investigations. The contribution within the range gate of many of these structures, which are advected by the wind, and decay and grow at different instants and could be distorted either by internal gravity waves or turbulence fields, could lead to radar echoes with statistical properties similar to those produced by anisotropic turbulence. Some questions thus remain regarding the manner in which temperature sheets contribute to VHF radar echoes. In particular, the zenithal and azimuthal angular dependence of the echo power may not only be produced by diffuse reflection on stable distorted or corrugated sheets, but also by extra contributions from anisotropic turbulence occurring in the stratified atmosphere. Thus, for several years, efforts have been put forth to improve the radar height resolution in order to better describe thin structures. Frequency interferometric techniques are widely used and have been recently further developed with the implementation of high-resolution data processings. We begin by reviewing briefly some characteristics of the ST radar echoes with a particular emphasis on recent works. Their possible coupling with <b>stable</b> <b>sheets</b> is then presented and their known characteristics are described with some hypotheses concerning their generation mechanisms. Finally, measurement campaigns that took recently place or will be carried out in the near future for improving our knowledge of these small-scale structures are presented briefly...|$|R

Two schools of thought - dynamic versus <b>stable</b> ice <b>sheet</b> - have developed. One hypothesis calls for the Antarctic ice sheet to vary dramatically, for Antarctica at times to be vegetated and for circum-antarctic waters to be significandywarmer than at present. The other calls for a <b>stable</b> ice <b>sheet,</b> no vegetation and water temperatures much less varied. During 1995, the two sides converged by recognising that the change to conditions suitable for vegetation {{may not have been}} as marked as originally thought, and that oxygen isotope data may contain scope for more flexibility in interpretation than the stabilist view has supported. New data and new participants have emerged, but there is {{a long way to go}} in resolving the issue. The key issue remains the age of the Sirius Group in the Transantarctic Mountains and the source of its contained diatoms. Diatoms of Pliocene age have been recovered from the Sirius Group but also from modern ice, and this raises the question of whether the Sirius Group diatoms are actually in situ.

30|$|Our {{standard}} {{reference is}} the monograph [3]. There {{are a number}} of papers concerned with the small deviations for various stochastic processes. For details, we refer to the monographs [3, 4]. If properly defined, the small deviation in some literatures is called the small ball probability (see, e.g., [5, 6]). There are various motivations for the study of some additive processes, and it has been actively investigated recently from different points of view, see Khoshnevisan, Xiao, and Zhong [2, 7] for a detailed discussion and the bibliography for further works in this area. First of all, additive processes {{play an important role in}} the study of other more interesting multiparameter processes since they locally resemble multiparameter processes, such as Brownian sheet, fractional Brownian sheet, and <b>stable</b> <b>sheet,</b> and also because they are more amenable to analysis. For example, locally and with time suitably rescaled, the Brownian sheet closely resembles an additive Brownian motion (see, e.g., [8, 9]). They also arise in the theory of intersection and self-intersection local times of Brownian processes (see, e.g.,[10, 11]).|$|E

Four distinct flow regimes were identified (a <b>stable</b> <b>sheet,</b> a broken sheet, a flapping sheet and a lifted sheet) and mapped using Reynolds and Weber numbers. Subsequently, the Buckingham π theorem and a least squares analyses were employed leading to the proposal of two new dimensionless numbers {{referred to as the}} Prandtl Number of Evaporation and the Schmidt Number of Evaporation. These describe the heat and mass transfer in low temperature evaporation processes with crossflow interaction. Using these dimensionless numbers, empirical correlations for Sherwood and Nusselt numbers for the identified flow regimes were experimentally determined. These correlations were in a good agreement with their corresponding experimental values. It was found that flapping sheets have the strongest heat and mass transfer intensities whereas the weakest intensities were seen for the “stable” sheets...|$|E

40|$|Studying {{sample path}} {{behaviour}} of stochastic fields/processes is a classical research topic in probability theory and related {{areas such as}} fractal geometry. To this end, many methods have been developed since {{a long time in}} Gaussian frames.
