40|$|AbstractThis paper {{contains}} a general characterization for the permutation polynomials of the <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices</b> over any field. Specific characterizations are for <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices</b> over algebraically closed fields, principal axis fields, and finite fields. In {{the latter case}} enumeration formulas are established as well. More general results concerning permutation polynomials on sets other than the <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices</b> are sometimes stated...|$|R
40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis of positive deﬁnite <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices</b> is becoming increasingly important in many applications. The focus of this work is on spatially correlated random positive definite <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices.</b> First, the empirical Riemannian semivariogram of a ﬁeld of positive deﬁnite <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices</b> is deﬁned, using the Riemannian distance on the manifold of positive deﬁnite <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices.</b> Then, we propose an estimator of the mean matrix which takes into account both the non Euclidean nature of the data and the spatial correlation. Simulated data are then {{used to evaluate the}} performance of the proposed estimator...|$|R

The open Olshanski semigroup consists of Möbius transformations {{in the complex}} symplectic group which take the space complex <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices</b> of norm ≤ 1 into complex <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices</b> of norm < 1. Its closure is a maximal proper semigroup in the complex symplectic group.|$|R

25|$|Here, {{inductance}} L is a <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrix.</b> The diagonal coefficients Lm,m {{are called}} coefficients of self-inductance, the off-diagonal elements are called coefficients of mutual inductance. The coefficients of inductance are constant, {{as long as}} no magnetizable material with nonlinear characteristics is involved. This is {{a direct consequence of}} the linearity of Maxwell's equations in the fields and the current density. The coefficients of inductance become functions of the currents in the nonlinear case.|$|E
500|$|... {{produces}} only positive {{values for}} any input vector x. If f(x) only yields negative values then A is negative-definite; if f does produce both {{negative and positive}} values then A is indefinite. If the quadratic form f yields only non-negative values (positive or zero), the <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrix</b> is called positive-semidefinite (or if only non-positive values, then negative-semidefinite); hence the matrix is indefinite precisely when it is neither positive-semidefinite nor negative-semidefinite.|$|E
500|$|A {{square matrix}} A that {{is equal to}} its transpose, that is, A = AT, is a <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrix.</b> [...] If instead, A {{is equal to the}} {{negative}} of its transpose, that is, A = −AT, then A is a skew-symmetric matrix. In complex matrices, symmetry is often replaced by the concept of Hermitian matrices, which satisfy A∗ = A, where the star or asterisk denotes the conjugate transpose of the matrix, that is, the transpose of the complex conjugate of A.|$|E

Perfect families of <b>symmetric</b> <b>matrices</b> form a basis for the commutative Jordan algebra they generate.
