40|$|Earlier trials on Synacril Black A, Benzamin Black DS 167 % and Suprexcel Black VY- three {{possible}} substitute dyes for Chlorazol Black E -showed {{the effect of}} variations in dyebath conditions {{on the amount of}} dye deposited on coir (Canning, A. J., Jarman, C. G. and Mykoluk, S. M. (1979) Black dyes for coir fibre. Part 2. Evaluation of selected dyes. Report of the Tropical Products Institute, L 52). Further trials, in which both different concentrations of dye in the bath, and a <b>standing</b> <b>bath</b> were used, have now been carried out to obtain additional data on the exhaustion characteristics of the three dyes. Additionally, the effect of variations in dyebath conditions on the quality of colour, and the amount of each of the three dyes that needs to be deposited on to the fibre to produce an acceptable black, have been assessed. With all three dyes, dyebath exhaustion was approached more slowly with increased dyebath concentration. As a consequence, when additional dye is used, dyeing time must be increased to obtain the most efficient use of dye. Since the proportion of dye that exhausts from the bath is also reduced, particularly with the higher dyebath concentrations or the shorter dyeing times, increasingly large additions of dye are required in order to intensify the visual depth of shade. With low dyebath concentrations of the two direct dyes (Benzamin Black and Suprexcel Black), allowing the liquor to cool during dyeing could reduce heating costs since the exhaustion obtained after 1. 5 hours at 95 °C followed by cooling was similar to that obtained after 6 hours at 95 °C. However, with deeper shades the opportunity for reducing heating costs by reducing dyeing time at 95 °C and then cooling is less. The inclusion of sodium carbonate in the dyebath could also result in savings on dyestuff. When using a <b>standing</b> <b>bath</b> technique with Benzamin Black, significantly different exhaustion/time relationships were obtained with each batch of fibre. As a consequence there would be considerable practical difficulties in using this dye with this technique. On the other hand, the exhaustion of Suprexcel Black was only slightly affected by the use of replenished liquors and a <b>standing</b> <b>bath</b> technique could reduce costs. Because of its almost complete exhaustion, there would be no advantage in using a <b>standing</b> <b>bath</b> with the basic dye Synacril Black. All the dyes gave better light-fastness properties when they were concentrated at the periphery of the fibre rather than when they penetrated more deeply: however, staining of adjacent fabrics was greater. The distribution of the dye within the fibre did not affect the visual colour. All three dyes should produce black colours which are technically similar to those of commercial samples of black coir. The amounts which need to be deposited on the fibre to produce an acceptable black are estimated as approximately: Benzamin Black DS 167 % - 19 g per kilogram of fibre; Suprexcel Black VY - 22 g per kilogram of fibre; Synacril Black A - 10 g per kilogram of fibre. Fastness properties of the blacks vary with the dye and the technique used to apply it. Information on the development of optimum dyeing conditions is appended...|$|E

2500|$|Common {{positions}} include {{lying on}} back or face down, sitting, squatting, kneeling or <b>standing.</b> In a <b>bath</b> or shower a female may direct tap water at her clitoris and vulva.

Standing up, a chair, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine {{can be used to}} stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing. [...] Some masturbate only using pressure applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.

At {{the bottom of the}} furnace, there are nine lances aligned in two staggered rows, five in the upper row, 22 º offset from vertical line, and four in the lower row 7 º offset from vertical line. During smelting, oxygen enriched air is blown into molten bath from bottom lances and leads to different types of <b>standing</b> waves on <b>bath</b> surface. The features of the different standing waves are highly associated with bath splash, and can have an effect on refractory abrasion, matte droplet entrainment and settlement, and viscous slag tapping.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{recovery}} modalities on recovery and subsequent performance. Ten trained male rugby union players were tested three times completing a different, randomly assigned recovery modality on each occasion. Each test began with a maximal aerobic endurance field test (20 metre shuttle test) followed by one of three recovery strategies – passive recovery, active recovery or ice bath immersion. Passive recovery involved lying on a recovery bed for 20 mins; active recovery entailed cycling for 20 mins at 50 % heart rate reserve; and ice bath immersion required subjects to sit waist deep in an ice bath (5 - 8 °C) for 3 x 30 s repetitions separated by one minute <b>standing</b> outside the <b>bath.</b> Following the 45 minute post-recovery strategy period, subjects completed 6 shuttles of a timed performance test (Illinois agility test). Plasma lactate concentrations and muscle soreness ratings were measured at various intervals throughout the testing. Analysis of the data revealed that active recovery resulted in significantly greater rates of lactate removal 5 mins into the recovery strategy when compared to passive recovery (p = 0. 01). Muscle soreness was significantly lower for ice bath immersion than for active recovery immediately after the 20 minute recovery period (p = 0. 006). No significant differences were observed for the subsequent performance test...|$|R
40|$|Research objective: This article {{addresses}} the accounts on Staryi Krym, {{a town in}} the Crimean Peninsula, supplied by travelogues written after the joining of the region to Russia. Research materials: Modern archaeolgoists can use these textual and visual accounts {{as a source of}} information on the condition of Moslem monuments, which were later damaged by anthropogenic and natural factors, and science historians can draw conclusions on the features of discoverying and interpretation of Moslem history and “Oriental” architecture in the period of the Enlightenment. The travelogues developed a multi-dimensional image of Staryi Krym. Abandoned and collapsing Moslem town, a living illustration from the outgoing age, with still <b>standing</b> ancient mosques, <b>baths,</b> fortifications, and graves, got virtual connections with classic past of the Crimea, finding itself to be a “heir” of one or another settlement documented by Greco-Roman geographers. Research results and novelty: Through the travellers’ eyes, Staryi Krym, by images of the Cimmerians and the Cimbrians, got {{a key role in the}} history of Crimean Peninsula, and even supplied it with the name of Crimea, which connected the “noble barbarians” of antiquity with the “modern Celts” – the Frenchs and the Scots, and the Past of Europe with its Present. Staryi Krym became a component of literatural discourse, allowing the classics of the Sentimentalism to think of the frailty of earthly life. This town also became a subject of painting, which made it a part of romantic appearance of Taurica...|$|R
