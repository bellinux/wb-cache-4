The grape can be troublesome for the winemaker due to tendency to oxidize easily and lose color. To compensate for the grape's naturally low tannins and phenolic compounds, some producers will use excessively harsh pressing and hot fermentation with stems to extract the maximal amount of color and phenols from the skins. This can backfire to produce green, herbaceous flavors and coarse, astringent wine lacking the grape's characteristic vibrant fruitiness. To maintain those character traits, Grenache responds best to a long, <b>slow</b> <b>fermentation</b> at cooler temperatures followed by a maceration period. To curb against oxidation, the wine should be racked as little as possible. The use of new oak barrels can help with retaining color and preventing oxidation but too much oak influence can cover up the fruitiness of Grenache.|$|E

The objective of this research is to evaluate the nitrogen content and nutritional status of Oregon grapevines and winegrapes from specific vineyard sites for three vintages and to evaluate the effects of nutritional supplementation on fermentation behavior. Recognition of grapevine nutritional deficiencies during the growing season may allow for early prediction of nitrogen deficiencies in juice at harvest and allow correction by vineyard management practices such as nitrogen fertilization and by nutritional supplementation at harvest.

Winemakers in California have had problems with <b>slow</b> or stuck <b>fermentations</b> with grapes that have been treated with the insecticide Cryolite, which contains fluoride. A selection of 6 yeasts, 3 commercial strains and 3 natural strains, commonly associated with winemaking were used in this study. Preliminary experiments investigated a wide range of fluoride challenge with different pH and cell densities on solid and liquid media. The effectiveness of fluoride was compared between sodium fluoride and Cryolite, as the fluoride source. The effect of fluoride was more potent with sodium fluoride, as the fluoride source. The minimum inhibitory concentration of fluoride for the yeast strains was recorded. The most sensitive commercial yeast was Saccharomyces cerevisiae RS 1, the most resistant commercial yeast was Saccharomyces bayanus RS 2. The most sensitive yeast overall was Hansenula saturnus AWRI- 354. The next stage examined the effect of fluoride on the selected yeast in small scale grape juice fermentations. Within this investigation the effect of different media sources and heat treatments was included. Fluoride concentrations reflected levels of fluoride found in grape musts and wines. During this study we found that the effect of fluoride on yeasts is increased with lower pH and lower cell densities.

40|$|Cereal {{arabinoxylans}} {{from different}} sources {{have been found}} to possess a large structural heterogeneity and generate different fermentation profiles. Among them, corn arabinoxylan is a relatively homogeneous polymer group and has an initial <b>slow</b> <b>fermentation</b> property. A high level of complex branches containing terminal xylose and terminal galactose, other than the commonly existing terminal arabinose, have been identified in corn arabinoxylan and correlated to its <b>slow</b> <b>fermentation</b> property. Structural models of corn arabinoxylan relating to fermentation were previously proposed, but without considering possible distribution patterns of the various branches that may {{play an important role in}} determining its fermentation property. Therefore, the first objective of this study was to establish a more accurate structural model for corn arabinoxylan to explain its <b>slow</b> <b>fermentation</b> property. A highly organized structural feature of multiple layers was revealed for corn arabinoxylan for the first time, in which the complex branches assemble to form regions that are connected by simply-branched parts, and the complex-branched regions containing further sub-layers. The structural subunits containing high levels of complex branches were found to act as the functional parts of corn arabinoxylan with different <b>slow</b> <b>fermentation</b> properties. Based on the new structural model, a range of corn arabinoxylan-based fiber molecules (14 fractions) were produced by different enzymatic treatments and were fermented using human fecal microbiota. Differences in fermentation rates revealed a sensitive response of gut microbiota to subtly different structural features within one fiber polymer. To investigate the involved mechanisms of digestion, an idealized experimental model was designed using Bacteroides pure strains. Specific molecular regions of dietary fibers were found to differentiate xylanolytic Bacteroides growth and influence their competition patterns. While a most complex corn arabinoxylan structural region made one strain of B. cellulosylitcus (DSM 14830) outcompete a strain of B. ovatus (3 - 1 - 23), a more generalized lightly branched structure favored the latter strain. It is speculated that each bacteria type in the colon may have a substrate structure specific for itself, whereby it can be utilized to specifically favor its growth in the competitive environment of the colon. Moreover, different degradation mechanisms were found within one Bacteroides strain using four substrates by monitoring the targeted gene expression profiles and structural changes of the remaining substrate and were based on the structural composition of fiber molecules. In conclusion, the <b>slow</b> <b>fermentation</b> property of corn arabinoxylan was caused by molecular regions consisting of high structural complexity. A subtle manipulation of the structural complexity of fiber molecules resulted in a considerable change in human colon fermentation property. Gut bacteria compete for the different regions of fiber molecules and are equipped with different enzyme degrading systems that target unique structural features, which were revealed in different degradation mechanisms for fiber molecules according to their structural compositions. This work furthers our knowledge of substrate specificity for gut bacteria, and suggests the possibility for more specific manipulation of the colon microbiota composition and fermentation property in a designed way. ...|$|E

30|$|The Campbell Early grape, {{which is}} the most {{dominant}} cultivar in Korea, has a high malic acid content due to early harvesting for enhancing grape color.

For this reason, isolating and utilizing indigenous yeasts instead of imported yeast starters are necessary to make Korean wine competitive. Developing optimal industrial starter cultures for winemaking is essential for increasing the prevalence of indigenous Korean yeast starter products.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteJon FaubionBrewing of beer has a {{long history}} and has evolved over time as tastes, markets and science have progressed. Traditionally malted barley is the grain source used in brewing. Malt {{provides}} a multitude of benefits including: fermentable carbohydrates, nitrogen for yeast metabolism, color compounds, flavor compounds and minor constituents that provide for various qualities in beer such as foam and colloidal stability. There is, however, interest from brewers and drinkers alike for a variety of beer styles. Because of this and other reasons, brewers have worked with adjuncts such as oats, sorghum, wheat, rice, and maize. These grains can be used in unmalted or malted forms, but the incorporation of these grains affects the brewing process and final beer qualities. A review of literature reveals the use of grains other than malted barley reduce the nitrogen contribution and alter the amino acid profile available for yeast metabolism, leading to <b>slower</b> <b>fermentations</b> and variations in the fermentation products resulting in changes to beer flavor. Exceptions include sorghum and oats, which provide a more beneficial amino acid profile than barley despite lower levels of nitrogen when compared to barley. Extract is found to increase when using maize and rice, while oats and sorghum reduce the amount of extract. Wheat has comparable extract to barley. Grains that contribute B-glucans and arabinoxylans will increase viscosity, while grains without these components will reduce viscosity if fermentation is complete. Additionally, most grains will reduce the foam stability due to altered nitrogen and protein contributions; wheat being the lone exception that improves foam stability. This review will discuss the above mentioned attributes and more to explore the changes to be expected when brewing with unmalted and malted grains other than barley...|$|R
