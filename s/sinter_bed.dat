40|$|AbstractSintering is {{a process}} in sinter machine for {{agglomeration}} of iron ore and other raw material fines into a compact porous mass, i. e., sinter, used in Blast Furnaces as an iron bearing input charge material for hot metal production. ‘Permeability’ of sinter-bed on sinter machine i. e., the porosity in sinter-bed of charged materials, facilitates atmospheric air passes from the top to bottom across the depth of sinter-bed, when suction created {{from the bottom of}} the bed, for efficient heat carry over from top to bottom of the bed for complete burning of charged materials for effective sintering process controls the productivity of the sinter machine. The level of ‘permeability’ in sinter-bed is depending upon the effectiveness of ‘charging chute’ in size-wise ‘segregation’ of charge materials across the depth in sinter-bed, achieved due to differences in the sliding velocities of particles during charging into the moving sinter-bed. The permeability achieved by the earlier conventional ‘charging chute’ was limited due to its design and positional constraints in sinter machine. Improving the productivity of sinter machine, through increased permeability of <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> is successfully achieved through implementation of an innovatively designed and developed, “Magnetic Charging Chute” at Sinter Plant no. 2 of Rourkela Steel Plant. The induced magnetic force on the charged materials while the charge materials dropping down through the charge chute has improved the permeability of <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> through an unique method of segregating the para-magnetic materials and the finer materials of the charge materials to top layer of <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> along with improved size-wise segregation of charge materials. This has increased the productivity of the sinter machine by 3 % and also reduced the solid fuel consumption i. e., coke breeze in input charge materials by 1 kg/t of sinter...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of grain size {{distribution}} control of the raw material mixture on the permeability of the green <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> and the properties of the produced sinter. This was achieved by evaluating the granulation characteristics of the sinter mixture (moisture content, granulation time and mean granule diameter) in terms of its green bed permeability, and evaluating the productivity of the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed,</b> the coke rate, tumble index (TI), abrasion index (AI), reduction disintegration index (RDI) and reducibility (RI) of the produced sinter. The raw sinter mixtures contained combinations of Thabazimbi iron ore, Sishen iron ore, coke, lime and return fines. The grain size distributions were controlled by removing the – 0. 5 mm size fractions of the return fines and coke, and the – 1 mm size fraction of lime. Of the examined mixtures, a mixture of 20 mass% Thabazimbi iron ore, 80 mass% Sishen iron ore and fluxes where the coke, lime and return fines were all sized had the highest granulation effectiveness and permeability. The sintering properties of the mixtures in which the grain size distributions were controlled, were very similar for all the mixtures, but superior to the base case mixture in which the grain size distribution was not controlled...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a feasibility study of recycling manganese furnace dust generated in production of ferromanganese and silicomanganese at Tasmanian Electrometallurgical Company, Australia. Dried man-ganese furnace dust contains about 20 wt % of carbon, in average 33. 4 wt % of manganese and 1. 3 wt % of zinc. Manganese in the dust {{is in the form}} of MnO, Mn 3 O 4 and MnCO 3; zinc is mainly in the form of ZnO and ZnSO 4. Analysis of the zinc balance with dust recycling showed that to keep zinc intake at the acceptable level, it should be partly removed from the dust. In the reduction laboratory experiments, zinc oxide was reduced to zinc vapour by tar of the dust. Reduction of zinc oxide started at 800 oC and zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature; removal of zinc was close to completion at 1100 oC. Optimal conditions for removing zinc from the dust include temperature in the range 1000 - 1150 oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust frac-tion in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60 %. In the sintering of manganese ore with addition of manganese dust in the sintering pot, zinc was reoxidised and deposited in the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed.</b> Removal of zinc in the sintering pot tests was in the range 4 - 17 %. Up to 30 % zinc removal was achieved from the bottom layer of the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed.</b> It can be concluded that zinc removal will be low during the processing of manganese fur-nace dust in the sinter plant. The zinc removal rate will be the highest when pelletised manganese furnace dust is added to the bottom layer of the sintering bed...|$|E
40|$|Recently, coke in an {{iron ore}} {{sintering}} process is replaced {{in part by}} powdered anthracite; less expensive fuel. In this study, influence of the different fuel characteristics on the thermal condition in the <b>sintering</b> <b>bed</b> has been investigated using a mathematical model. Numerical simulation along with experiments in lab-scale sintering pot has been performed. The mathematical model {{is based on the}} assumption that the <b>sintering</b> <b>bed</b> can be treated as homogeneous medium, through which a reacting flow passes. Temperature distribution and flue gas composition are predicted for various kinds of solid fuel and various particle sizes of anthracite. The simulation results show that propagation of combustion zone is faster in the case of using coke than the case of using anthracite, which shows that the coke is more appropriate in the sintering process than the anthracite. However, the results also show that the reactivity of the anthracite can be improved by decreasing the size of fuel particles...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a sinter machine {{and the quality of}} the ensuing product are strongly dependent on the processes occurring in the descending flame front. As it is not possible to measure flame front properties in a <b>sintering</b> <b>bed</b> directly, embedded thermocouples are used to provide information in this area. Through making some assumptions, it is possible to assess flame front properties using the obtained thermocouple profiles. Flame front speed, thickness and maximum temperature are identified as important parameters. The total heat transferred to the material from the flame front is a function of these parameters. Experimental results show that increasing flame front speed decreases residence time, maximum temperatures and total heat transferred to the bed. Only indicative trends can be obtained because of the variability in thermocouple results, which are inherent in the experimental technique. Coke combustion efficiency also depends on flame front speed...|$|R

40|$|The {{reserve of}} tin-bearing iron ores is very large in China. However, {{they have not}} been {{utilized}} sufficiently so far due to the complex embedded relationship between iron- and tin-bearing minerals. In the present work, the behavior of tin in the tin-bearing iron concentrates during a reduction sintering process (RSP) were studied using XRD, SEM-EDS, chemical valence state analysis and morphology analysis. The results show that there is about 30 mass% tin deprived from the tinbearing iron concentrates by the RSP. The tin-bearing phases remained in the finished sinters exist as the form of stannic (Sn 4 +), stannous (Sn 2 +) compounds and metallic Sn (Sno).

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design of a feedforward control scheme aimed at minimising the waste product from a sinter strand process by manipulating strand speed. The results of simulation exercises are discussed in which the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> is assumed to be composed of a series of lumped sections. The velocity of the flame-front within a section is assumed to be nonlinear and initially proportional to the raw-mix permeability. Permeability data from plant are used as input and strand speed and acceleration are constrained to lie within practically realisable limits. The results of simulation exercises using simple control laws based on straight and weighted averaging of ideal section speeds are presented. The proposed control law involves a technique for modifying the time-shift increments associated with the straight-average law.

40|$|During {{iron ore}} sintering, {{material}} coalescence {{in the bed}} determines the physical properties of the agglomerated product. Sinter density and structural quantification by 2 D image analysis were used to elucidate the degree of coalescence and densification achieved during sintering. In the first program, samples - representing increasing temperatures - were obtained from three locations down a <b>sintered</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>Sinter</b> density, determined by liquid pycnometry, {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on green granulated bed bulk density. Image analysis results indicated a strong dependence between sinter density and porosity. Results also show that more coalescence occurs for blends containing porous ores at increasing sintering temperatures. When sinter basicity and/or coke rate is low the effect of temperature on coalescence is less pronounced for all blends. The second program compared coalescence using 19 to 21 mm sinter from eight different pot tests and blends containing significant porous ores. For the same ore blend sintered under different conditions, measured trends in sinter density and porosity were in line with expectations but the changes were not large because the material in sinter has a high specific gravity of over four and changes in porosity were less than 5 %. It was concluded that small increases in coke level could decrease sinter porosity by 5 %, resulting in increased sinter tumble strength. Both programs show that when melt volume is high, small increases in temperature {{have a significant effect on}} coalescence in the flame front...|$|R
40|$|Characterization {{and design}} of fluid-thermal {{transport}} through random porous <b>sintered</b> <b>beds</b> is critical for improving the performance of two-phase heat transport devices such as heat pipes. Two-dimensional imaging techniques are quite well developed and commonly employed for microstructure and material characterization. In this study, we employ 2 D image data (thin sections) for measuring critical microstructural features of commercial wicks for use in correlation-based prediction of transport properties. We employ a stochastic characterization methodology based on the two-point autocorrelation function, and compare the predicted properties such as particle and pore diameters and permeability with those from our previously published studies, in which 3 D x-ray microtomography data was employed for reconstruction. Further, we implement a reconstruction technique for reconstructing a three-dimensional stochastic equivalent structure from the thin sections. These reconstructed domains are employed for predicting effective thermal conductivity, permeability and interfacial heat transfer coefficient in single-phase flow. The current computations are found to compare well with models and correlations from the literature, {{as well as our}} previous numerical studies.

40|$|Temperature {{profiles}} {{in the lead}} smelter <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> at Xstrata Zinc Mount Isa sinter plant have been measured using a wireless temperature probe. Corresponding sinter samples have been collected for characterisation. The sinter peak bed temperatures {{were found to be}} in the range of 1000 - 1200 °C. Microstructures and softening temperatures of these sinters have been characterised. Strong correlations have been observed between peak bed temperature and peak hood temperature, and between mean sinter softening temperature and peak bed temperature. It was found that higher peak bed temperature results in higher sinter softening temperature. For the feed material used in the trials, to obtain sinters with mean softening temperatures above 1050 °C, peak bed temperatures above 1130 °C are required. There appears to be a direct correlation between granule size distribution in the feed and peak bed temperature attained.

It was found that the pO 2 is appreciably more oxidizing than previously assumed, with a minimum value of ~ 0. 01 atm. It is concluded that this value represents the {{oxygen potential}} of the gas phase and it is therefore a mixture of combustion gas and downdraft air. The contents of a quenched sinter pot where the reactions were interrupted with the flame front situated midway through the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> were investigated.

40|$|Porous {{sintered}} microstructures {{are critical}} to the functioning of passive heat transport devices such as heat pipes. The topology and microstructure of the porous wick {{play a crucial role}} in determining the thermal performance of such devices. Three sintered copper wick samples employed in commercial heat pipes are characterized in this work in terms of their thermal transport properties––porosity, effective thermal conductivity, permeability, and interfacial heat transfer coefficient. The commercially available samples of nearly identical porosities (61 % open volume) are CT scanned at 5. 5 lm resolution, and the resulting image stack is reconstructed to produce high-quality finite volume meshes representing the solid and interstitial pore regions, with a conformal mesh at the interface separating these two regions. The resulting mesh is then employed for numerical analysis of thermal transport through fluid-saturated porous <b>sintered</b> <b>beds.</b> Multiple realizations are employed for statistically averaging out the randomness exhibited by the samples under consideration. The effective thermal conductivity and permeability data are compared with analytical models developed for spherical particle beds.

40|$|The Outokumpu steel belt {{sintering}} {{technology is}} used for manufacturing chromite pellets that are charged into smelting furnace for ferrochromium production. Hot air is blown through the moving bed of raw pellets. Direct temperature and flow measurements are difficult {{to do in the}} bed of a real scale belt sintering process. Therefore, a tested and reliable mathematical model would be a valuable help for optimising operational parameters of the process and designing new constructional improvements. The aim of this work is to present a mathematical model that calculates the gas flow and temperature distribution in the bed of pellets and the atmosphere. Computational fluid dynamics program FLUENT is used to calculate the gas flow, composition and temperature of the gas in the <b>sintering</b> <b>bed</b> during processing.

40|$|Fundamental pore {{formation}} mechanisms in iron ore sinter and pellets were investigated. The study was first conducted with tablets made from iron ore and limestone particles, {{with and without}} addition of coke, {{and the results were}} then tested and proved in real pellets made with a laboratory ball mill and in real sinter made with a sintering pot. It was found that pores were formed at sites of limestone and coke particles and that a number of factors had a significant influence on the {{pore formation}} and the final pore structure, such as limestone particle size, coke particle size, iron ore particle size, amount of limestone, temperature and initial porosity, etc. It was also found that the air flow through the <b>sintering</b> <b>bed</b> was very unlikely to cause any pores to form in sinter. Different types of pores were classified in terms of their origins. The results have shown that an open or close to open pore structure may be achieved by controlling the temperature and using proper amounts and particle sizes of limestone, coke and probably other additives. The results have also shown that porosity and limestone particle size had a strong effect on reducibility and {{it might be possible to}} achieve high reducibility and high strength simultaneously with an open or close to open pore structure at low porosity.

40|$|Iron ore {{sintering}} is {{a complex}} agglomeration process that converts iron ore fines into a lumpy form suitable for charging into an ironmaking blast furnace. To achieve agglomeration iron ore fines are mixed with coke (fuel) and fluxes (which promote melt formation). During sintering high temperatures (~ 1350 °C) are reached and melts form amongst ore particles. Major structural transformation occurs in this high temperature region, where the packed bed of granulated material transforms into a bed with large agglomerated regions and voids. There is limited understanding of the forces driving agglomeration {{and it is not}} possible to observe the transformation process in-situ. Sintering melts play a fundamental role in driving structural change due to their wetting nature, resulting in strong surface forces. This exploratory study demonstrates how an ash fusion furnace can be utilised to investigate surface forces driving high temperature melt driven agglomeration. Wetting and reshaping of pressed analogue sinter mix tablets, with compositions that reflect melt forming regions in the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed,</b> were observed on alumina tiles as they were heated. Sinter mix tablets were then suspended in different configurations adjacent to pressed hematite substrates. On heating, melt formation activated capillary forces that pulled material together, while in another configuration melt wetting and surface energy reduction behaviour resulted in increased sphericity.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{replacing}} fine ore by coarse ore on sintering reactions was investigated using an infrared furnace on laboratory scale and sinter pots on pilot plant scale. Five sinter mixes were prepared {{by changing the}} percentage coarse ore from 0 % to 100 % in 25 % increments. Coarse ore fraction, sintering temperature, holding time and oxygen partial pressure were selected as sintering parameters, and two-level factorial design was used for identification of parameters that significantly influence the formation of sinter phases. Experimental {{results showed that the}} coarse ore fraction has a higher effect on the sintering process compared to those of other parameters. The experiment design also enabled to set these parameters to their optimum values. The porosity of compacted pellets was measured using a helium pycnometer. The replacement of fine ore by coarse ore resulted in a decrease in porosity (increase in packing density) of compacted pellets. The particles are closer to each other in pellets consisting of more coarse particles than fine particles. Laboratory experiments were performed at 1300 °C in air, using a high heating rate (15 °C/s). The holding time was set to 2. 5 minutes. X-ray diffraction (XRD), reflected light microscopy (RLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were used to characterize sintering reactions and sinter phases. XRD analysis revealed that sintered pellets consisted of hematite, SFCA, SFCA-I and calcium silicate. The proportions of SFCA slightly increased when the fraction of coarse ore varied from 0 % to 25 %, but decreased with a further increase in percentage coarse ore. At 25 % coarse ore fraction, the porosity of the compacted pellets decreased, resulting in an increase in packing density and sintering rate. More hematite reacted, resulting in the formation of high amounts of SFCA. Above 25 % coarse ore fraction, the amount of hematite increased, and the concentrations of columnar SFCA decreased despite a further decrease in porosity. This was attributed to the decrease in reaction surface area for coarse ore, and the short reaction time, which limited the extent of reaction of the coarse particles. The variation of SFCA-I and calcium silicate was not significant under laboratory conditions. Reflected light microscopy and SEM analysis easily identified two major sinter phases: hematite and SFCA. A clear distinction between the different types of SFCA could not be made using EDS analysis. Sinter pot tests were carried out in order to examine the effect of coarse ore fraction on physical and metallurgical properties of sinters. The tumbler and reduction disintegration indexes increased with increasing coarse ore fraction in the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed.</b> This was presumably due to the increase in amounts of hematite and decrease in surface area for reaction. Consequently, the reducibility of sinter decreased as the percentage coarse ore increased. This study has concluded that the presence of 25 % coarse ore in the sinter mix led to enhance sintering reactions. The amounts of SFCA increased, and sinter quality was improved. It is recommended that in future work, sintering reactions should further be investigated by also measuring the permeability of the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> and the reaction surface area of solid particles.

40|$|In a {{sintering}} bed {{the generation}} of melt in the descending flame front causes the coalescence of material and {{the transformation of the}} particulate bed. Interspersed between the large voids are the densified lumps of sinter which are released on crushing and used as blast furnace feed. The bed transformation process is critical in sintering and is an outcome of the work done on the material by the surface and opposing viscous forces. Less densified, weaker sinter forms when the level of coalescence achieved is low. The process is extremely complex in that it involves a three-phase melt–solids–gas system. In this study, the composition of the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed</b> was simulated using the pressed cylinders of laboratory grade chemicals and the coalescence process was studied by characterising the densification of the cylinders. The alumina, magnesia and basicity of the cylinders were altered (1 – 4 %, 0 – 2 % and 0 – 3, respectively) to change the properties of the melt and also its solid content. The estimation of solid–melt content, melt composition, viscosity and surface tension was obtained using a thermodynamic model (FactSage) and the reported equations in the literature. Using these results Laplace number of the system was determined as a function of temperature. At the completion of some tests the cooled solidified samples were studied under a microscope. The experimental results showed that the higher sinter density and densification factor were obtained when temperature and sinter mix basicity increased and alumina levels decreased. The effect of magnesia level on densification was less because the porosity of the cylinders altered with magnesium carbonate levels. The trends obtained in sinter densification are consistent with the micro-structural information indicated by optical micrographs. The use of Laplace number to quantify the relative influence of the surface to viscous forces on coalescence was encouraging with a prediction error within ± 10 %. It was also concluded that the most influential factor determining densification factor was the apparent viscosity of the molten mix as the change in surface force was comparatively small...|$|E

40|$|With the {{formation}} of melt, {{the structure of a}} <b>sintering</b> <b>bed</b> transforms because of material coalescence. The drivers of coalescence were studied using two bench-scale techniques. Analogue sinter mixes of varying the basicity and gangue levels were taken to high temperatures using thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and in an ash fusion test (AFT). In TMA, the penetration of a piston into the sinter mix as melt was generated provided information on the deformation, shrinkage, densification and flow of the sample as a function of temperature. Projected sample shapes in the AFT were used to determine sample density and densification level. A computer model FactSage and reported equations were used to provide estimates of melt volume and viscosity. Trends indicated by the TMA and AFT results were similar and large changes in results were only obtained with significant melt generation. Differences in results between the samples could not always be explained because varying the composition of the sinter mix altered the porosity of the sample. Increasing sample porosity meant that the generated melts were not as connected and more work is required to achieve the same level of densification. On a sinter strand, coalescence occurs under a normal load and this effect is simulated in the TMA. However, the excessive flow of melt from the crucible and chemical reactions means that TMA results are unreliable at temperatures greater than 1300 °C. For this reason, the AFT is the preferred technique to understand the factors that cause material coalescence on a sinter strand...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{technology}} of fuel gas utilization on the iron ore sintering {{process has been}} proposed as an alternative for reducing the environmental load and improvements on the sinter quality have been obtained with additional decrease on the return of fines (< 5 mm). This paper deals with the numerical simulation of this innovative technology in order to evaluate the emissions of poly chlorinated di-benzene dioxin (PCDD) and Poly Chlorinated di-benzene furan (PCDF). The methodology is to partially replace solid fuel (coke breeze) by steelworks gaseous fuels; coke oven gas (COG), blast furnace gas (BFG) and mixture of these gases. A multiphase mathematical model based on transport equations of momentum, energy and chemical species coupled with chemical reaction rates and phase transformations is proposed to analyze the inner process parameters and the rates of PCDD and PCDF formations. A base case representing the actual industrial operation was used to validate the model and afterwards used as reference to predict four cases of fuel gas utilization: (a) 10 % of the wind boxes inflow from N 01 to N 12 wind boxes with COG, (b) same condition with BFG, (c) same condition with 50 % COG and 50 % BFG and (d) mixture of 25 % COG and 75 % BFG. The model predictions indicated that for all cases, except only BFG, the sintering zone is enlarged and the solid fuel consumption is decreased. In order to maximize the steelworks gas utilization it is recommended the use of mixture of COG and BFG with optimum inner temperature distribution. It was found out that for all cases of gas utilization the PCDD and PCDF emissions could be decreased due to enlargement of the high temperature zone on the <b>sintering</b> <b>bed</b> and hence increasing the residence time of the reacting gas within the high temperature zone...|$|R
40|$|Manganese furnace dust {{is made up}} of {{volatiles}} {{and fine}} particles of the raw materials collected from the off-gas during smelting of manganese alloys. Impediments to the recycling of the manganese furnace dust back to the ferroalloy furnaces are handling due to the presence of tar, and the potential accumulation of zinc in the furnaces, which can cause irregularities in their operation. The aim of the thesis was to establish conditions for zinc removal from the dust and assess the feasibility of the dust recycling in the Tasmanian Electrometallurgical Company sinter plant. Major findings are: - Manganese furnace dust taken from the settling ponds contained water, carbonaceous materials (tar), and metal oxides. The carbon content of the dried furnace dust was about 20 % and the average manganese and zinc contents were 33. 4 and 1. 29 %, respectively. Moisture content was 30 - 60 %. - The tar components were aliphatic hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, their derivatives, and sulphur- and oxygen-containing compounds {{with a wide range of}} carbon number (15 - 28) and boiling point (230 - 530 oC). Light hydrocarbons were not detected. - If manganese furnace dust was recycled to ferroalloy furnaces through the sintering plant, the overall zinc input had increased by 51 - 143 %. Sustainable utilisation of manganese furnace dust should include enhanced zinc removal. - Reduction of zinc oxide from manganese furnace dust pellets started at 800 oC. Zinc oxide was reduced to zinc vapour by tar in the dust. Temperature and gas atmosphere were key parameters affecting the zinc removal from the dust. The zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature and was close to completion at 1100 oC. - Optimal conditions for removal of zinc from the furnace dust include: temperature in the range 1000 - 1150 oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust fraction in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60 %. - Zinc removal in the processing of manganese furnace dust in the sinter plant was low because of zinc reoxidation in the <b>sinter</b> <b>bed.</b> This makes the sinter plant unsuitable for recycling of the dust.

40|$|In an {{iron ore}} <b>sintering</b> <b>bed,</b> the {{combustion}} behaviour of coke particles together with {{velocity of the}} flowing gas stream determines the temperature, width and speed of the traversing flame front. A bed heat treatment mathematical model was formulated in an earlier study to describe this complex relationship. An area of improvement in the model is {{the description of the}} coke combustion process, which is highly dependent on the resistances controlling the flow of gases to and from the coke particles. These vary for different coke particles because of the prior coarsening of the sinter mix by granulation. The characteristic structure of granules – nuclear particle with an adhering fines layer – indicates that gases have better access to finer coke particles. In this study, an available granulation model is integrated into the heat treatment model to provide a novel description of coke positioning within granules. In addition to this change, two endothermic reactions were introduced into the model. Using the previous and modified models, predicted bed temperature–time profiles as a function of position down the bed, were compared against embedded thermocouples results from seventeen laboratory sinter tests. Generally, the modified definition of coke combustion behaviour resulted in improved comparison with experimental results. In the sintering literature, studies have been reported on: the use of charcoal/biomass char to replace coke, the preferential placement of coke particles on the outside of granules, and varying the size distribution of the coke particles. Improving the access of gases to coke particles and decreasing coke size are comparable to using more reactive fuels. Combustion rate, efficiency and flame front properties are all influenced by fuel reactivity. Model predictions of changes in bed temperatures, flame front properties and sintering performance caused by fuel type, location and size are consistent with reported observations...|$|R

Three commercial metal foam samples of similar volumetric porosity (in the range ∼ 91 – 93 %), but with different pore sizes (10, 20 and 40 pores per inch), are first considered for validating the direct simulation approach developed here. Effective transport properties such as thermal conductivity and interfacial heat transfer coefficient are computed and successfully compared against data and models from the literature. ^ A network model for the estimation of effective thermal conductivity of open-celled metal foams, constructed out of 3 D image skeletons is then presented, and significant computational cost savings relative to detailed numerical analysis are demonstrated. A thorough microstructural characterization of foam features—pore size, ligament thickness, ligament length and pore shapes—is also performed. All the three foam samples are observed to have similar pore shapes and volumetric porosity, while the other features scale with pore size. ^ The validated direct simulation approach is then employed for a detailed characterization of single-phase transport properties of commercially available sintered copper wick microstructures, in the second part of the thesis. A scan resolution of 5. 5 µm is employed, and the current computations are compared with correlations and other experimental data available in the literature. Based on the computational results, new correlations for predicting convective heat transfer through porous <b>sintered</b> <b>beds</b> are also proposed. ^ Pore-scale analysis of thin-film evaporation through sintered copper wicks is subsequently performed, again employing real microstructures. For improving convergence, modifications are introduced into the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model available in a commercial software package. Important two-phase characteristics, such as capillary pressure, effective pore radius, and evaporative mass and heat fluxes, are estimated. Based on the analysis, the best performing sample (particle size range) is identified along with the optimum contact angle. ^ The final part of the thesis focuses on reverse-engineering and design of sintered wick structures with two approaches. In the first approach, a cellular automaton model is developed for predicting microstructural evolution during sintering. After thorough validation, the developed model is employed to predict the sintering dynamics of randomly packed multi-particle configurations in two and three dimensions. The effect of sintering parameters, particle size, and porosity on fundamental transport properties, viz., effective thermal conductivity and permeability, is quantified. ^ The second approach employs 2 D image data which are readily obtainable via techniques such as SEM. Firstly, based on the two-point autocorrelation function, a detailed microstructural characterization of <b>sintered</b> <b>beds</b> is performed. Further, a reconstruction technique is implemented for reconstructing a three-dimensional stochastic equivalent structure of the considered thin-sections. These reconstructed domains are employed for predicting single-phase fluid-thermal characteristics, and a detailed comparison with the actual 3 D XMT data is also performed. Finally, based on the nature of two-point autocorrelation functions, a new parametrized model is proposed for the design of porous materials. The utility of this model in reconstructing three-dimensional porous microstructures with controllable fluid-thermal properties of interest is demonstrated. With advances in additive manufacturing techniques, such an approach may eventually be employed to design intricate porous structures with properties tailored to specific applications. ...|$|R

40|$|Manganese furnace dust {{is formed}} from {{volatiles}} and fines collected during wet scrubbing of the off-gas from manganese alloy smelting furnaces. This dust, {{in the form}} of slurry, contains tar, alkalies, zinc, manganese oxide and other elements. Impediments to the recycling of the manganese furnace dust back to the ferroalloy furnaces are the potential accumulation of zinc and alkalies, which can cause irregularities in furnace operation, and handling. This paper examines the behaviour of zinc during sintering pot tests of manganese ore with addition of manganese furnace dust. Laboratory reduction experiments showed that at temperatures above 800 °C zinc oxide was reduced by carbon in tar to zinc vapour. However, zinc removal in sintering pot tests was below 30 %, which was attributed to reoxidation of the zinc vapour. Zinc removal was the highest from the bottom section of the <b>sintering</b> pot <b>bed...</b>|$|R

Despite serious environmental concerns {{that need to be}} addressed, several companies in Australia are actively pursuing such a technology. Previous work at the University of Adelaide has demonstrated the feasibility of fluidized-bed gasification of Kingston coal using additives to control <b>bed</b> <b>sintering.</b> The present study reports a systematic investigation of the fluidised bed gasification of Kingston coal with silica sand as a bed material. The effect of air-to-fuel ratio (A/F), steamto- fuel ratio (S/F) and bed temperature (Tb) on the fraction of carbon converted to CO 2, CO, and CH 4 and on the concentration hydrogen was investigated. In cases where <b>bed</b> <b>sintering</b> was observed, the composition of the agglomerates was assessed using scanning electron microscopy. The optimum operating conditions, in this system, were identified to occur with A/F = 1. 82, S/F = 0. 75 and Tb = 850 degreesC. These conditions resulted in a product gas with the highest heating value per mass of coal feed and the highest extent of carbon conversion. Israa K. Alghurabie, Brent Jackson, Basim O.

40|$|The {{generation}} of sufficient melt of appropriate properties {{is essential for}} the transformation of a blended <b>sinter</b> mix <b>bed</b> into a bed composed of large discrete sinter particles. For a chosen sinter mix, melt properties are determined by the quantity of heat transferred from the moving flame front and the chemical properties of the bed. Temperature-time profiles from embedded thermocouples are used to assess the transferred heat. From considerations of melt initiation and solidification temperatures, a critical sintering reaction area in the profiles is defined. The area is about three times the flame front area as it includes high temperature regions outside the front. It represents the total amount of heat available to the material in the partially molten state. Reasonable correlations are obtained between this area and the tumble strength of the sinter product. Temperature-time profiles are quite variable and strong correlations cannot be expected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use {{of biomass}} fuels for energy {{production}} through combustion has a growing application worldwide mainly for two reasons: first, {{the utilization of}} biomass for energy contributes to mitigate emission of green house gases; second, its use decreases the dependence of imported fossil fuels in Europe. The objective of this work was to study the combustion behaviour of two endogenous biomass species: cardoon (cynara cardunculus) and arundo (arundo donax), which were specially produced in energy crops plantations. Mixtures of cardoon and a forestry biomass specie (eucalyptus) were also studied to evaluate potential benefits from synergies between both biomass fuel types. The {{results showed that the}} utilization of cardoon, in pelletized form, and loose arundo as feedstock, did not give rise to any operational problems related with the feeding system. It was verified that the mono combustion of cardoon could pose problems at industrial scale in fluidised bed systems, considering the high levels of HCl and NOX emissions obtained and tendency to <b>sinter</b> the <b>bed</b> sand material. The addition of the forestry biomass to cardoon appeared to prevent the bed agglomeration problem. Furthermore, both the NOX and SO 2 emissions were found to decrease at the same time suggesting potential synergy of blending different types of biomass regarding pollutant emissions and in bed agglomeration problems...|$|R
40|$|Sintered porous {{structures}} are ubiquitous as heat transport media for thermal management and other applications. In particular, low-porosity <b>sintered</b> packed <b>beds</b> {{are used as}} capillary-wicking and evaporation-enhancement structures in heat pipes. Accurate prediction and analysis of their transport characteristics for different microstructure geometries is important for improved design. Owing to the random nature and geometric complexity of these materials, development of predictive methods {{has been the subject}} of extensive prior research. The present work summarizes and builds upon past studies and recent advances in pore-scale modeling of fluid and thermal transport within such heterogeneous media. A brief review of various analytical and numerical models for simplified prediction of transport characteristics such as effective thermal conductivity, permeability, and interfacial heat transfer is presented. More recently, there has been a growing interest in direct numerical simulation of transport in realistic representations of the porous medium geometry; for example, by employing nondestructive 3 D imaging techniques such as X-ray microtomography. Future research directions are identified, looking beyond techniques intended for material characterization alone, and focusing on those targeting the reverse engineering of wick structures via modeling of the physical sintering fabrication processes. This approach may eventually be employed to design intricate sintered porous structures with desired properties tailored to specific applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} {{and composition of}} the ash content of straw poses technical challenges to its thermal conversion and have been widely reported to cause severe ash <b>sintering</b> and <b>bed</b> agglomeration during fluidised bed gasification. Literature indicates {{that a combination of}} reactor design and bed material measures is required to avoid defluidisation at temperatures above 800 °C. Using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy this study investigated the initial agglomeration of a mullite bed during the gasification of wheat straw in a small scale, air blown bubbling fluidised bed. The results show that the temperatures along the height of the bed converge prior to any marked drop in pressure or heating of the lower freeboard. This convergence was seen to occur at temperatures close to 750 °C in repeated gasification experiments. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicates coating-induced agglomeration caused by the reaction of alkali metals with silica. Scanning electron microscopy under high magnification revealed a layered structure to the agglomerates, where ash particles are subsumed into a fused material. This suggests the formation of agglomerates by the three step agglomeration process postulated by other authors. Analysis of indices used to predict agglomeration {{on the basis of a}} fuel 2 ̆ 7 s ash content and composition indicates that the Alkali Index is the most accurate, successfully predicting agglomeration for 7 of the 9 fuels where agglomeration was observed...|$|R
