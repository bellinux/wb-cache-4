Despite progress made in reducing stunting among children in the nation, child malnutrition and deaths are still high. In addition to the deep rooted poverty, recurrent drought and crop failures did aggravate the situation and international interventions were primarily targeted at provision of emergency food aid which couldn’t solve the problem in the long run. However, during the past decade, Ethiopia did attained significant economic development. The growing economy is expected contribute to reduction in child under nutrition and mortality. Yet, limited studies have been done reporting specific magnitude of child under nutrition and mortality across regions in the nation. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} assess current level of child death and under nutrition as well as possible predictors of the problem.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} development and deployment of renewable energy resources to meet the ever increasing electric power demand and to limit the use of fossil fuels. This has spurred offshore wind farm development, particularly in the North Sea, due to the vast offshore wind energy potential. Large scale wind farms in the North Sea pose grid integration challenges such as the need for long distance sub sea power transmission and managing the variability of wind power variation on in the power grid. These challenges can be properly met by the use of multi-terminal voltage source converter high voltage dc transmission (MTDC) grid. Even though the North Sea region is envisioned as the immediate target of application, MTDC can also be used as the highway of power in onshore systems, thereby connecting loads and generation sites involving very long distances. MTDC system consists of three or more HVDC converter stations connected to a common dc transmission network. Currently {{there are two types of}} converters used in HVDC, namely: line commutated converter (LCC) type and voltage source converter (VSC) type. VSC-HVDC is superior to LCC-HVDC for MTDC applications due to its flexibility and relative simplicity in power control, its bi-directional power transmission capability while keeping the dc voltage polarity unchanged and due to its reactive power support capabilities. Hence most recent research works in the area of MTDC have focused on VSC based systems only. Several R&D works have been done in the area of MTDC transmission, especially in its control aspects, in the past. In most cases however, only qualitative approaches have been used to describe the operational characteristics of the various proposed control strategies. In particular, studies exploring the quantitative analysis of the steady-state and dynamic operational characteristics of MTDC grids have been missing in the literature. The research work described in this thesis was started with the objective of filling some of these gaps, i. e. (1) to investigate the various control strategies of VSC for use in dc grids using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, (2) to propose improvements in the control and operation of MTDC systems and (3) to increase understanding of the dynamic behavior of MTDC systems. The main contributions of the research work can be put into three areas, namely MTDC control, MTDC operation and MTDC analysis. In the area of MTDC control grid frequency support strategy by MTDC has been proposed and analyzed. The control strategy enables exchange of primary reserves between asynchronous ac grids connected by MTDC without involving the use of communication systems between converter stations. In the area of MTDC operation a method for precise control of steady-state power flow in MTDC has been proposed and tested with simulation models. The method enables power injection control in MTDC based on the power dispatch and is applicable to any MTDC transmission topology. The contributions in the area of MTDC analysis comprise of three parts, namely: (1) steady-state MTDC interaction, (2) state-space modeling of a generalized MTDC topology and (3) large-disturbance stability analysis of MTDC. Methods have been proposed for each of the aforementioned MTDC analysis aspects and tested with various simulation models. In the integrated ac/dc system events, such as load insertion/ rejection in the ac grid will have impacts on grid frequencies as well as dc-bus voltages in the MTDC. The steady-state interaction analysis is used to estimate the steady-state changes (of frequencies, dc-bus voltages, transfered nodal powers) that come as a result of such events. The state-space modeling approach has been used to study the dynamic aspect of MTDC. The large-disturbance stability analysis has been principally proposed to study the impact of ac short circuit fault close to a converter terminal in rectifier mode of operation. Ac faults occurring close to inverters connected to MTDC transmission result in excess power in the MTDC during the fault duration. This however can be tackled by using fast acting dc voltage controllers and hence excess power in the dc grid may not as <b>sever</b> <b>problem</b> as shortage of power. In addition, secondary control of MTDC based upon steady-state sensitivity analysis has been proposed in the thesis. The method enables accurate compensation of power flow deviations in MTDC occurring due to the action of primary control. Various representative case models have been used to show the merits claimed for each of the proposed control methods, and to verify the validities of the proposed operational strategies and MTDC analysis approaches. Finally a hypothetical dc grid scenario has been used to demonstrate the various potential benefits of employing MTDC in the North Sea region.

40|$|Feeding horses {{outdoors}} {{in winter and}} cold climate presents a challenge to horse owners and stable managers. Low temperatures, harsh winds and rain, snow and ice all contribute to the increasing nutrient requirements a horse has to keep themselves warm and maintain their body weight. The most challenging is to feed young growing horses – {{the largest group of}} horses kept in loose stables - the focus being on the energy demands of the horse. When the climatic energy demands are taken into account, also the weanling horses can maintain their body condition and proper growth (Autio, 2008). Although horses are fed in groups, their individual needs have to be considered applying individual feeding. Some studies show both breed and individual differences in the digestibility of nutrients or energy demands among some horse breeds used in the Nordic countries (Saastamoinen, 1993; Ragnarsson, 2009; Jensen et al., 2010). There are also some studies found a tendency toward higher digestibility in ponies than in horses. Some individuals are so called “easy keepers” accumulating fat easily in their body. In addition, the amount of voluntary exercise of horses varies resulting different energy needs and feeding levels.

Firstly, medical services have some traits that inherently cause distributive problems. These traits are professional discretion, information gaps between doctor and patients, technical difficulty and form of private supply in medicine. Because of them distributive injustice cases {{could be cut}} into patient 2 ̆ 7 s private unlucky cases or attributed to individual dissatisfaction. So, we {{must be careful not}} to be caught into this trap. Secondly, innovation and its diffusion in medical technology can make some medical treatments free from distributive problems. But at the same time, it can produce another distributive problems in more crucial diseases. Innovation continuously changes basic condition of distribution, so distributive justice in medicine will change accordingly. We find that <b>sever</b> distributive <b>problems</b> occur not in the part of top innovation, but in moderate innovation. Thirdly, hospitals are constituted of many professinal or non-professinal staffs and variety of patients. Each members has own resources to be offered and distributive rules to follow.

Other serious adverse reactions could be mentioned as hives, rash, itching, and difficulty in breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue and throat. Tamsulosin therapy should be stopped in patients who experience hypotension. Conclusions To treat BPH therapeutically, it is necessary to stabilize severities of the patient’s symptoms with potential side effects of the treatment. Tamsulosin blocks alpha 1 -receptors in smooth muscles both in the bladder neck and prostate, which leads to relaxation and subsequently less resistance to urinary flow. By advancement of tamsulosin, pharmacotherapy strategies could provide more appropriate guideline treatments; therefore, in Isfahan, Iran, innovative medical treatment for BPH was suggested based on both pharmacological and surgical clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest to}} improve the {{performance}} of reservoir simulators has been evolving with the newly encountered challenges of modeling more complex recovery mechanisms and related phenomena. Reservoir subsidence, fracturing and fault reactivation etc. require coupled flow and poroelastic simulation. These features, in turn, bring a heavy burden on linear solvers. The booming unconventional plays such as shale/tight oil in North America demand reservoir simulation techniques to handle more physics (or more hypotheses). This dissertation deals with three aspects in improving the performance of reservoir simulation toward these unconventional challenges. Compositional simulation is often required for many reservoir studies with complex recovery mechanisms such as gas inject. But, it is time consuming and its parallelization often suffers <b>sever</b> load imbalance <b>problems.</b> In the first section, a novel approach based on domain over-decomposition is investigated and implemented {{to improve the}} parallel performance of compositional simulation. For a realistic reservoir case, it is shown the speedup is improved from 29. 27 to 62. 38 on 64 processors using this technique. Another critical part that determines {{the performance of a}} reservoir simulator is the linear solver. In the second section, a new type of linear solver based the combinatorial multilevel method (CML) is introduced and investigated for several reservoir simulation applications. The results show CML has better scalability and performance empirically and is well-suited for coupled poroelastic problems. These results also suggest that CML might be a promising way of precondition for flow simulation with and without coupled poroelastic calculations. In order to handle unconventional petroleum fluid properties for tight oil, the third section incorporates a simulator with extended vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations to consider the capillarity effect caused by the dynamic nanopore properties. The enhanced simulator can correctly capture the pressure dependent impact of the nanopore on rock and fluid properties. It is shown inclusion of these enhanced physics in simulation will lead to significant improvements in field operation decision-making and greatly enhance the reliability of recovery predictions...|$|R
