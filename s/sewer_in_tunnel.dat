40|$|The Lawrence Avenue Underflow Sewer System {{is a small}} deep <b>tunnel</b> system located <b>in</b> the Northwest part of {{the city}} of Chicago. This tunnel system connects to the Main Stream Des Plaines Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP) system. This tunnel was {{constructed}} to convey and store combine sewage in an effort to prevent combine sewer overflows (CSOs) and alleviate flooding in the city of Chicago, issues that are likely to occur during extreme storm events. The Lawrence Avenue Underflow Sewer System is characterized by unsteady flow conditions along with lack of geometric and spatial information of the pipe sewer network. This study herein focuses on the analysis of the system through the use of hydrological and hydraulic models. Two models, the Illinois Urban Hydrologic Model (IUHM) and the TARP Connecting Structures Model developed at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) were used in this study in combination with the commercial software Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) 5. 0. In this study, analysis of the hydraulic response of the system to four historical storms and four design storms is used to assess its optimal operation. The storm event analysis highlighted that the Lawrence Avenue underflow sewer system has the capacity to convey and capture flows from each of the modeled storms. Simulations showed significant surcharge throughout the interceptor system for all the storms. Moreover, surcharge conditions existed <b>in</b> the deep <b>tunnel</b> system during the peak time of two of the simulated storms. Furthermore, the real time regulation of the gate showed to be beneficial for the system's operation. Not only allowed for the maximum storage of combined <b>sewer</b> <b>in</b> the <b>tunnels</b> without surcharge. But also the volume of water leaving the system is controlled based on the storage capacity of the tunnels. Lastly, real time operation of the gate, leaded to determine that if the gates needed to be set at a fix position the opening should not be less than 33 %, independently of the conditions presented in the downstream system to which the Lawrence Avenue Tunnel connects. This gate opening showed to prevent surcharge conditions and the subsequent geyser events <b>in</b> the <b>tunnel...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{characteristics}} of tunneling problems, tunneling engineering is {{perhaps one of the}} areas in which numerical methods are more frequently adopted in practice. One important application is to examine the influence of an excavation and construction procedures on the stress distribution and deformation in the ground surrounding the opening and on the tunnel lining. Another important aspect of tunneling problems that can be accounted for in a numerical analysis is the complex geometry associated with typical applications. This is not only related to the shape of the opening, but also to the presence of non-homogenous or non-isotropic soil strata. A constitutive model that is suitable for the analysis of structured clays has been developed in this study based on the multilaminate framework. The model takes into account the elastic unloading-reloading, inherent and induced anisotropy, destructuration and bonding effects. The model is implemented into Plaxis finite element program, successfully calibrated and used to investigate the response of structured sensitive clay to the construction of the Gatineau <b>tunnel</b> <b>in</b> Gatineau, Quebec and the Ottawa <b>sewer</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>in</b> Ottawa, Ontario. Numerical results were compared to the field measurements taken during the tunnel construction. To improve the performance of the numerical model, an implicit integration algorithm is implemented and proven to be very effective as compared to the conventional explicit integration methods. The effect of different soil parameters including bonding and anisotropy on the tunneling induced displacements and lining stresses is also examined using a comprehensive parametric study. The results indicated that soil bonding and anisotropy have significant effects on the shape of the settlement trough as well as the magnitudes of surface displacements and lining stresses induced by tunneling...|$|R
