50|$|Mas-wrestling (Мас-рестлинг) is the {{international}} name used for the Yakut ethnosport derived from the traditional stick pulling game mas tard'yhyy (мас тардыhыы, 'stick tugging'). Reminiscent of the Eskimo Stick Pull featured at the World Eskimo Indian Olympics, Norwegian kjevletrekk, Finnish kartunveto or väkikapulan veto, {{as well as the}} Highland test of strength The <b>Swingle</b> <b>Tree</b> (played with a shepherd's crook), participants taking part in mas-wrestling competitions sit in front of each other, prop their feet against the board that divides the competition area and tug on a wooden stick (mas), making sure to keep it parallel to the propping board. Mas-wrestling demands great muscular strength from the hands, legs, back, and abdominals.|$|E
40|$|Ailanthus altissima (Miller) <b>Swingle</b> is a <b>tree</b> used in Chinese {{traditional}} medicine as a bitter aromatic drug {{and in the}} treatment of colds and gastric diseases. Previous phytochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of quassinoids in the plant, as well as indole alkaloids. The purpose of this work was to determine the phenolic, flavonoid, and total alkaloid contents of the ethanolic, methanolic, acetone, and hydroalcoholic crude extracts of A. altissima and then try to correlate them with antioxidant activity of corresponding extracts. Moreover, the phenolic compounds present in the extracts were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Extracts from leaves have greater phenolic content than the other parts of this tree. Concerning the extraction process, it is possible to conclude that the mixture of water and ethanol is the best solvent to extract substances with antioxidant activity. Analysis by RP-HPLC showed that ferulic acid was the most dominant hydroxycinnamic acid, with an occurrence percentage of 25. 59 %. These results presented a positive linear correlation between antioxidant activity index and total phenolic content of all the extracts...|$|R
40|$|The Appalachian National Scenic Trail (A. T.) is a {{footpath}} {{stretching from}} Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine and spanning over 3, 500 km of peaks, valleys, and ridges. The A. T. 2 ̆ 7 s gradients in elevation, latitude, and moisture and north-south alignment represent a continental scale cross-section, or 2 ̆ 2 MEGA-Transect, 2 ̆ 2 of eastern U. S. forest and alpine areas {{and offer a}} setting for collecting scientific data {{on the health of}} ecosystems and species that inhabit them. ^ The Appalachian Trail Decision Support System, or A. T. -DSS, is an Internet-based implementation and dissemination toolset directed at enhancing the decision-making process for managing natural resources. The A. T. -DSS provides a coherent framework for monitoring, reporting, and forecasting ecological conditions by integrating NASA multi-platform sensor data, NASA Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) models, and in situ measurements from A. T. MEGA-Transect partners. ^ The purpose of this research is to develop a prototype habitat suitability model for the invasive species tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) <b>Swingle),</b> an exotic <b>tree</b> species pervasive throughout the United States due to its rapid growth, high fecundity, hardy tolerance, and strong competitive ability. This prototype model demonstrates the capabilities of the A. T. -DSS by leveraging seamless geospatial data and climate models from TOPS along with ground based Forest Inventory and Analysis data from the USDA Forest Service to model the current and potential future distributions of suitable Ailanthus habitats within the A. T. landscape. ^ Analysis of the FIA records revealed that Ailanthus was most abundant in the Mid-Atlantic States and tended to occur at lower elevations, closer to roadways, and in younger forest stands. Maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) was used to relate the observed distribution of Ailanthus to an array of geospatial data layers representing environmental conditions, termed environmental variables. Significant relationships were detected for land cover (developed areas, canopy cover) and topographic (elevation, slope) variables. However, climatic variables were consistently the highest performing predictors, and revealed a preference for warmer and drier regions. ^ Projected precipitation and temperature data based on scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the period 2095 - 2099 were substituted for current climate variables to examine potential trends in the distribution of suitable Ailanthus habitats. The resulting models indicate that total suitable area will increase from 56...|$|R
40|$|Levia, Delphis F. Invasive species, {{along with}} habitat loss and fragmentation, are major factors {{attributed}} to biodiversity decline and ecosystem alteration (Vitousek, 1996; Williamson, 1996; Pimentel, 2000; Flory, 2009). Ailanthus altissima (Mill) <b>Swingle,</b> an invasive <b>tree</b> species, has {{been regarded as}} the “most serious threat to natural areas” both damaging and strongly invasive to native Maryland habitats (McKnight, 2004). In order to preserve biodiversity in Maryland forested habitats, biodiversity studies incorporating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with traditional inventory methods need to be completed. The purpose of this work is to study a suburban habitat that has experienced an influx of A. altissima. This thesis incorporates historic aerial imagery, shapefile production and plot inventories which included identifying tree species and measuring diameter at breast height (dbh). The {{study was conducted in}} two forested plot areas located in Fair Hill Natural Resources Management Area in northeastern Maryland. The two plot areas were similar in size, but differed in shape and proximity to transportation routes. Nineteen circles measuring 314 m 2 in area were studied in total. A tree inventory was taken for each circle with the species, and dbh in cm recorded for all tree species greater than 5 cm dbh. Other data resources included historic aerial imagery and dendrochronological data. The aerial images were used to view forest cover of image year, and used to develop GIS layers of forest edges. The data layers of the forests were used to calculate area, perimeter, and shape index. Dendrochronological data were also collected and allometric age equations were developed. The hypotheses in this study involved examining the diversity, and the year of entry of A. altissima. Due to the effects of A. altissima and its ability to form monocultures, areas where the species are present should have values that indicate levels of lower biodiversity compared to areas where the species is not present (Hypothesis one(H 1)). Hypothesis two (H 2) concerns edge effects acting on the forest plot and greater stand densities and dbh of A. altissima should be seen in edge circles compared to interior circles. Due to a sale from private ownership to the state of Maryland, the sale could have ushered in the species. If the entry of A. altissima was prior to 1975, then hypothesis three (H 3) will be disproved while if the year of entry is after 1975 then H 3 would be confirmed. The fourth and final hypothesis (H 4) investigates shape indices and years with higher shape indices would indicate entry periods for the species. Data involved in examining this hypothesis involves shapefile examination, tree ring analysis and historic aerial imagery analysis. It was found that H 1 was confirmed by the means that circles with A. altissima possessed lowered diversity in general than circles without the species. It was found that A. altissima were contained in 12 out of the 19 circles sampled and of the 12 circles, only three circles contained less than 50 % of the circle as A. altissima. Results in this study did not confirm that interior circles had greater biodiversity and smaller dbh than exterior circles. However, only two interior circles were present in this study, and each varied in biodiversity and age of circle. Circle C contains 68 % of the total species as A. altissima and contains dbhs of trees estimated of having an age of 45 years while the other interior circle, circle E, contains 52 % of the species A. altissima and has trees estimated at 24 years. It was found that the sale of ownership did not clearly support the introduction of A. altissima, which does not support H 3. However, for plot R 273 circles 8 and 9, it was estimated that year of entry of A. altissima was around 1980, which could support H 3, but entry of trees in Gallaher Rd Plot were estimated prior to 1970. The final hypothesis, H 4, was found to be validated and years with higher shape indices indicated entry time frames for A. altissima. For GALRD plot, a general trend of shape indices from more distended shapes to more compact shapes were seen over the imagery time frame, while for R 273 plot, shape indices fluctuated over the time period and years with higher indices saw introduction of A. altissima in the following years.
