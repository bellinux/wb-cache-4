5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E

In these follow-up studies the experimenters contacted certain individuals after foreseeable emotional experiences, such as {{the birth of a}} child, giving blood, or taking an exam. This way, the experimenters chose not only the emotional event to be recalled, but furthermore the types of emotional events they would be studying so that they could examine possible differences between types of emotional events. The findings of these studies supported those of the retrospective studies: 96–100% of emotional events were socially shared. Furthermore, no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the frequency of social sharing between different types of emotional events.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Internet {{theories}} arose {{about how}} the vote counting itself had been suspect, due to discrepancies between machine-counted votes (which supported Clinton overall) and hand-counted votes (which supported Obama overall). Fifth-place finisher Dennis Kucinich's campaign paid $25,000 to have a recount done of all Democratic ballots cast in the primary, saying [...] "It is imperative that these questions be addressed {{in the interest of}} public confidence in the integrity of the election process and the election machinery." [...] On January 16 the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s office began the recount. After recounting 23 percent of the state's democratic primary votes, the Secretary of State announced that no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in any candidate's total and that the oft-discussed discrepancy between hand-counted and machine-counted ballots was solely due to demographic factors.|$|E

2500|$|Many genetic {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions and Druze, Palestinians, Bedouin, Lebanese and other Levantines cluster near one another genetically. Many studies have found that Jews and Palestinians are closer to each other than the Palestinians or European Jews are to non-Jewish Europeans or Africans. They also found substantial genetic overlap between Israeli and Palestinian Arabs and Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. A small but statistically <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the Y-chromosomal haplogroup distributions of Sephardic Jews and Palestinians, but {{no significant differences were found}} between Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians nor between the two Jewish communities, However, a highly distinct cluster was found in Palestinian haplotypes. 32% of the 143 Arab Y-chromosomes studied belonged to this [...] "I Arab clade", which contained only one non-Arab chromosome, that of a Sephardic Jew. This could possibly be attributed to the geographical isolation of the Jews or to the immigration of Arab tribes in the first millennium. The Druze people, a [...] "genetic sanctuary" [...] for the diversity of the Near East in antiquity, have been found in genetic studies to be the closest to Jews of the populations in the Levant. Lebanese also cluster closely with Jewish ethnic groups, closer than Syrians and Palestinians, according to a 2010 study by Behar et al. The single archeogenetic study of the southern Levant (Salamon et al., 2010) explored mtDNA haplogroups of Chalcolithic period from a cave in the Judean Desert.|$|E

50|$|The {{molecular}} mimicry hypothesis, in which T cells are essentially confusing an HHV-6 viral protein with myelin basic protein, first appeared around this time. Early {{on in the}} development of this hypothesis (2002), Italian researchers used the HHV-6a variant along with bovine myelin basic protein to generate cross-reactive T cell lines. These were compared to the T cells of individuals with MS {{as well as those of}} controls, and no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> between the two.

40|$|The study {{compared}} the brain electrical activity of {{two groups of}} gifted {{children between the ages}} of 9 and 13 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded with eyes closed: "at rest" and during three simple cognitive tasks. <b>Significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in absolute power in the resting state EEG between the gifted high achievers and non-gifted, age-matched peers. No <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between the gifted underachievers and age-matched peers. <b>Significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in absolute and relative power during the word recognition task compared to the resting EEG.

50|$|However, not all {{experiments}} {{have concluded that}} reading from a digitized screen can be detrimental. The same year, another experiment was conducted on 90 undergraduates at a college in Western New York involving paper reading, computer reading, and e-book reading.

No <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> between any of the different forms of reading for either type of passage. However, the researchers noted that due to the participants being college students who were accustomed to using technology, they may react differently to reading on electronic devices than older individuals.|$|E

Again, a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> for males, and again Annett states this to be consistent with the right-shift model. Further examples are a 1986 study by Benbow and a 1990 study by Temple of staff at the University of Oxford, which, Annett states, show not that there is a predominance of left-handers in talented groups, whether that talent be with mathematics or otherwise, but rather that there is a shortfall in such groups of people who are strongly right-handed.|$|E

50|$|A further {{analysis}} of these rebreather deaths found significant inaccuracies in the original data. Review shows {{that the risk of}} death while diving on a rebreather is in the region of 5.33 deaths per 100,000 dives, roughly 10 times the risk of open circuit scuba or horseriding, five times the risk of skydiving or hang gliding, but one eighth the risk of base jumping. No <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> when comparing mCCRs with eCCRs or between brands of rebreather since 2005, but accurate information on numbers of active rebreather divers and number of units sold by each manufacturer are not available. The survey also concluded that much of the increased mortality associated with CCR use may be related to use at greater than average depth for recreational diving, and to high-risk behaviour by the users, and that the greater complexity of CCRs makes them more prone to equipment failure than OC equipment.|$|E

No <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> between mean values of ventilatory and RPE threshold, when they were expressed by parameters such as: speed, load, heart rate, absolute and relative oxygen consumption. The conclusion of this experiment was: the fixed value (12-13) of RPE scale may be used to detect the exercise intensity that corresponds to ventilatory threshold.|$|E
