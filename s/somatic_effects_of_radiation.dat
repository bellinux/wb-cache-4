40|$|The {{studies of}} {{radiation}} leukemogenesis in atomic bomb survivors is reviewed. Leukemia appeared early {{and was one}} of the most striking evident <b>somatic</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> in atomic bomb survivors. Leukemogenic effects of radiation vary by quality and quantity of radiation dose, age at the time of exposure, elapsed time after exposure and type of leukemia. Although the risk of leukemia in atomic bomb survivors is now greatly reduced with elapsed time after exposure, there is no evidence that the risk of leukemia has returned to control levels in those survivors who received a significant radiation dose even almost 30 years after the bombings. No significant clinical and pathologic manifestation of leukemia related to radiation dose was reported except the absence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in those survivors who received a significant dose. A briefer review is also made of various studies concerning atomic bomb exposure and the incidence of related disorders such as malignant lymphoma, aplastic anemia and other hematologic disorders. The leukemogenic effect of ionizing radiation in man has been demonstrated by the experience of the atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in patients with ankylosing spondylitis in Great Britain treated by X-rays, and by mortality studies of radiologists...|$|E
40|$|<b>Somatic</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> {{intensity}} on the mutable V {{and stable}} R genes were detected in plants of a heterozygous clone (vS 3 /vs, R/r) {{subjected to the}} same dose at four rates. The effects were compared by counting speckled and purple sectors in flowers from irradiated and control plants. Response curves were estimated from the mutant sector averages, observed {{over a period of}} transient response for successive mature flowers. A structure for integrating the mutational contributions from different flowers was provided by models. The average control mutation rates are 8, 110 per 107 cells for the V gene, and 49. 45 for R. At a constant intensity of 4320 roentgens/hour, average induced mutation rates per 107 cells per roentgen for V increase from 194 (at 24 r total dose) to 1, 116 (at 3 r dose); the corresponding rates for R increase from 7. 24 to 27. 65. With these responses as standards, both genes at corresponding total doses yield lower rates at lower intensities. For the series of intensities 1. 2, 0. 6, 0. 3 and 0. 15 roentgens/hour, the decreases in mutation rate for the V gene are, respectively, 66, 148, 315, and 617 per 107 cells per roentgen. The corresponding decrements for R are 4. 86, 8. 70, 14. 61, and 23. 51. These effects are non-linear functions of intensity for both genes, but V is at least 13 times as sensitive as R. Radiation operating to extinguish a buffering system against final mutation can account for the dose and dose-rate effects observed...|$|E
40|$|A 1984 {{interview}} in two sessions with Edward B. Lewis, then the Thomas Hunt Morgan Professor of Biology at Caltech. Dr. Lewis would be awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, along with Christiane Nüsslein-Vollhard and Eric F. Wieschaus, for discoveries concerning "the genetic control of early embryonic development. " In this interview, he recalls {{how he and}} a colleague, Edward Novitski (who would also receive a Caltech PhD), acquired stocks of Drosophila melanogaster {{while they were still}} high school students in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. In 1939, after a year at Bucknell on a music scholarship and only two years at the University of Minnesota, Lewis received his bachelor's degree (in biostatistics), whereupon he entered Caltech as a graduate student. Working under A. H. Sturtevant, he continued his Drosophila studies, receiving his PhD in genetics in 1942. After a wartime stint as a meteorologist in the Army Air Forces, Dr. Lewis returned to Caltech as an instructor in the Division of Biology in 1946. He became a full professor in 1956 and the Morgan Professor in 1966. He recalls the early days of genetics at Caltech and offers his recollections of Thomas Hunt Morgan, chair of the division from 1928 to 1942, and of Sturtevant and Theodosius Dobzhansky. He comments {{on the state of the}} Biology Division after Morgan's retirement and on the arrival of George W. Beadle as division chairman in 1946. He describes his work on the Drosophila bithorax complex of genes and also on the <b>somatic</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> on human beings and his part in the controversy over nuclear testing in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s. He recalls the visit of four geneticists from the Soviet Union in 1967. He concludes by commenting briefly on the changes in the field of genetics since the discovery of the genetic material and on his current work on the phenomenon of transvection. 	Dr. Lewis became emeritus in 1988 and died on July 21, 2004...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{assessment}} <b>of</b> the heritable <b>somatic</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> exposures {{has relied}} upon {{the assumption that}} radiation-induced lesions were 'fixed' in the DNA prior to the first postirradiation mitosis. Lesion conversion was thought to occur during the initial round of DNA replication or {{as a consequence of}} error-prone enzymatic processing of lesions. The standard experimental protocols for the assessment of a variety of radiation-induced endpoints (cell death, specific locus mutations, neoplastic transformation and chromosome aberrations) evaluate these various endpoints at a single snapshot in time. In contrast with the aforementioned approaches, some studies have specifically assessed radiation effects as a function of time following exposure. Evidence has accumulated in support of the hypothesis that radiation exposure induces a persistent destabilization of the genome. This instability has been observed as a delayed expression of lethal mutations, as an enhanced rate of accumulation of non-lethal heritable alterations, and as a progressive intraclonal chromosomal heterogeneity. The genetic controls and biochemical mechanisms underlying radiation-induced genomic instability have not yet been delineated. The aim is to integrate the accumulated evidence that suggests that radiation exposure has a persistent effect on the stability of the mammalian genome...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} causes various biological effects, {{which can be}} detected both in the exposed animals and their offspring. In the silkworm, Bombyx mori, many studies in <b>somatic</b> and genetic <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> have been conducted using various doses and qualities <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> sources, because <b>of</b> their usability for mutation induction. However, differences in sensitivity {{to radiation}} among silkworm strains remain unknown. In the present study, we have identified two resistant strains (p 50 and m 042) and two sensitive strains (f 12 and m 91) for γ-irradiation by screening genetic stocks of B. mori maintained in Kyushu University Graduate School. In reciprocal mating experiments, there is liability that F_ 1 progeny became more sensitive to γ-irradiation when the susceptible strains were used as the female parent. Even though details remain to be determined, it appears from the current studies that radiation sensitivity in the silkworm is controlled, at least in part, by maternal cytoplasmic inheritance...|$|R

40|$|Hoyle-Lyttleton type {{accretion}} is investigated, {{by taking}} account {{of not only}} the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> pressure but the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> drag. We calculate the trajectories of particles for three cases: only the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> gravity is considered (case A); the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> pressure is taken into account (case B); the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> drag as well as radiation pressure is taken into account (case C). The accretion radii for former two cases are 2 GM/v 2 ∞ for case A and 2 GM(1 − Γ) /v 2 ∞ for case B, where M is {{the mass of the}} accreted object, v ∞ the relative velocity, and Γ the normalized luminosity of the accreted object. We found that the accretion radius for case C is in between those of cases A and B under the present approximation; i. e., the accretion radius decreases due to radiation pressure while it increases due to radiation drag. In addition, the accretion radius for case C becomes larger as the incident velocity becomes fast. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> drag becomes more and more important when the velocity of the incident particle is comparable to the light speed.

40|$|The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> {{atomic bomb}} <b>radiation</b> {{exposure}} on the survivors {{and their children}} has been a worrisome problem since soon after the 1945 Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Researchers have examined physical and genetic effects; however, no {{research has focused on}} second-generation survivors’ (SGS) psychological effects. Consequently, this study shed light on the SGS’ experience of discrimination and prejudice and their anxiety concerning the genetic <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure. This study utilized semi-structured interviews with 14 SGS (10 women, mean age = 56 ± 6. 25 years, range = 46 – 68 years). Data were analyzed using {{a modified version of the}} grounded theory approach. Three categories were extracted: low awareness as an SGS, no health anxiety regarding the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation,</b> and health anxiety regarding the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation.</b> The results did not reveal that SGS who grew up in the bombed areas experienced discrimination or prejudice. They had little health anxiety from childhood to adolescence. In this study, some of the SGS developed health anxiety about their third-generation children, but only among female participants. Perhaps the transgenerational transmission of anxiety concerning the genetic <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure causes stress, particularly among women with children. However, a change was seen in adulthood health anxiety regarding the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation,</b> suggesting the possibility that changes in the psychological experiences of SGS can be observed throughout their lifetimes and that their own health status, and that of their children, the third-generation survivors, affects their health anxiety regarding radiation...|$|R
