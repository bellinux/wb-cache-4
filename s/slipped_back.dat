5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce {{began his}} final race weekend, the 1977 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, by setting the fastest {{time in the}} Wednesday {{practice}} session, held in wet weather. Pryce posted a time of 1 minute 31.57 seconds with the next best, the eventual 1977 World Champion Niki Lauda, a full second slower. The weather dried up prior to the Thursday session, and he <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> down the grid to fifteenth place, almost two seconds slower than James Hunt's pole position time.|$|E
5|$|Townshend {{took charge}} of the British forces and {{realised}} that Bougainville's column was approaching from the British rear, having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge. He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm's army <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> across the St. Charles.|$|E
50|$|Time slip {{became a}} popular device in British children's novels in that period. Other {{successful}} examples include Alison Uttley's A Traveller in Time (1939, <b>slipping</b> <b>back</b> {{to the period}} of Mary, Queen of Scots), Ronald Welch's The Gauntlet (1951, <b>slipping</b> <b>back</b> to the Welsh Marches in the fourteenth century), Barbara Sleigh's Jessamy (1967, back to the First World War), and Charlotte Sometimes by Penelope Farmer (1969, back to 1918).|$|R

5|$|Louis {{came down}} firmly {{in favour of}} Henry, but the French {{arbitration}} failed to achieve peace as the rebellious barons {{refused to accept the}} verdict. England <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> into the Second Barons' War, which was won by Henry's son, Prince Edward. Edward also invoked Magna Carta in advancing his cause, arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and were themselves acting against Magna Carta. In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the Statute of Marlborough, which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna Carta.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{government}} relied {{primarily on}} Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived. He attempted {{to settle the}} crisis permanently by forcing the barons {{to agree to the}} Treaty of Kingston. This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise. Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy. Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate. By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> towards open civil war.|$|E
50|$|The most {{disabling}} {{assumption that}} Rostow took is {{of trying to}} fit economic progress into a linear system. This assumption is false as due to empirical evidence of many countries making false starts then reaching a degree of progress and change and then <b>slipping</b> <b>back.</b> E.g.: In the case of contemporary Russia <b>slipping</b> <b>back</b> from high mass consumption to a country in transition, the main cause being {{the end of the}} Cold War and geopolitical struggles.|$|R

5|$|The {{disagreements}} {{between the}} leading barons {{involved in the}} revolt soon became evident. Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority {{and power of the}} major barons as well as the Crown; others promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers. Over the next four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England, and power swung {{back and forth between the}} different factions. By early 1263, what remained of Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> towards open civil war. Montfort convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue his radical agenda and by October, England faced a likely civil war. Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt. Montfort took Henry and Queen Eleanor prisoner, and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry's name, the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own, trusted men.|$|E

50|$|The minimum {{gap between}} the roller and the housing determines the maximum squeeze applied on the tubing. The amount of squeeze applied to the tubing affects pumping {{performance}} and the tube life - more squeezing decreases the tubing life dramatically, while less squeezing can cause the pumped medium to <b>slip</b> <b>back,</b> especially in high pressure pumping, and decreases {{the efficiency of the}} pump dramatically and the high velocity of the <b>slip</b> <b>back</b> typically causes premature failure of the hose. Therefore, this amount of squeeze becomes an important design parameter.|$|R

Venables succeeded Allison as manager in June 1976. It {{proved to be a}} busy month for Venables, as he turned down the surprise offer to walk out on Palace to succeed Bertie Mee as Arsenal manager and also had a para-sailing accident in Majorca which required 40 stitches.|$|E
25|$|At Pocono, Johnson cut a tire on lap 88, but did {{not take}} major damage. He was able to work {{his way through the}} field to finish in third place. He {{finished}} 19th at Michigan after the race was called for rain on lap 138. At Sonoma, Johnson led the most laps at 45 laps, but a late race caution caused by Casey Mears' broken wheel axle cost him, and he was passed by Kyle Busch with five laps to go, and <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> to sixth place.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{except the}} odd occasion, he wasn't the stroke player {{that he had}} been. He served as Billy Griffith's vice captain at Sussex in 1946 and took over the {{captaincy}} {{for the next three}} seasons. In 1947, he lifted Sussex from bottom to ninth place, but they <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> to 16th and 14th in the next two years. He scored more than a thousand runs in 1938, 1939 and 1947. Before the 1950 season, he resigned the captaincy following some disputes and returned to stockbroking. Later, he reconciled with the club and served as the President between 1977 and 1979.|$|E

His scream and gesture made his wife conclude that he had sat down on a pair of scissors, or the like: but very little harm had been done except the breaking of the glass.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, {{a budget}} {{shortfall}} of $49 million was announced by METRO, which has halted {{progress on the}} University/Blue Line. The line has already received a final Federal Record of Decision {{but there are no}} official words regarding when construction would start or how the line would be funded. METRO previously claimed that the completion of construction and opening of the Red Line Extension would be by 2013 and the Green Line by 2014. However, METRO announced on September 9, 2010 that the opening dates for the Red Line Extension, Purple and Green lines had been pushed back to 2014 and by September 2014, the start date had <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> to April 4, 2015.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September 1809, {{at about}} 3:30am, Curieux struck a rock off Petit-Terre off the Îles des Saintes. The rock was 30 {{yards from the}} beach in 11 feet of water. At first light, Hazard came to her {{assistance}} and her guns and stores were removed. Hazard then winched Curieux off {{a quarter of a}} cable but she <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> and ran directly onto the reef. There she bilged. All her crew was saved but the British burned her to prevent her recapture. A court martial board found Lieutenant John Felton, the officer of the watch, guilty of negligence and dismissed him from the service. Moysey died the next month of yellow fever.|$|E
5000|$|The {{elevation}} {{of up to}} 45° meant that the shell was at risk of <b>slipping</b> <b>back</b> after being rammed forward; only the copper driving band held the shell in place in a BL gun, and {{they had not been}} designed to operate at such high angles. The solution adopted was to develop a special high-angle reduced-charge cartridge with a hollow up the centre, through which the gunner inserted a 1+1/4 in stick about 40 inches long made of beech wood, to prevent the projectile from <b>slipping</b> <b>back</b> before firing. A [...] "light" [...] 290 lb shell was used for high-angle firing, rather than the standard 380 lb shell.|$|R

25|$|At Texas, Earnhardt ran {{near the}} front until lap 187, when his battery {{alternator}} quit {{and he ended up}} finishing 29th. At Kansas, he ran {{near the front}} until a debris caution happened while he, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., and Carl Edwards were all on pit road. Earnhardt would go a lap down, take the wave-around, and finish 16th. At Richmond, he finished 10th. At Talladega, he went a lap down early after some banging with Joe Nemechek. However, with a caution for a crash on lap 43, Earnhardt got the free pass {{to get back on the}} lead lap. He made his way back up through the field to the Top 5, but <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> to 17th at the end.|$|E
25|$|Montoya {{dominated}} the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard in Indianapolis on July 26 after starting from second position. It {{was the first}} time in his NASCAR career that he scored bonus points for leading the most laps in the event, however, he was penalized with a drive-through penalty after his last pit stop for speeding in the pit lane. His healthy 5-second advantage over the rest of the field was gone and he ended up finishing 11th. After a pit lane error Montoya <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> from his top-10 spot at the Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. However, a good pit call meant Montoya pitted prior to a caution which meant he started the next restart in 4th. After slipping back to 5th he made up good ground to pass Bowyer second. He went after leader Hamlin but could not catch him. The second-place finish was his first top 5 of the year and joint best on an oval. At the Carfax 400 at Michigan, Montoya posted the 3rd quickest qualifying time just 0.087 seconds off of the pole. In the race Montoya gradually <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> and grew frustrated with crew chief Brian Pattie as the car was getting tighter and tighter, Kasey Kahne and Montoya made contact when the 9 car got loose and its splitter touched the 42's right rear tire. The contact resulted in Montoya's right rear going flat and he lost a lap on pit road fixing the minor body damage. However he shortly got the lucky dog and raced up to 20th before dropping back to 23rd, Montoya gained 4 positions on the last lap as others ran out of fuel, resulting in a 19th-place finish which at least kept Juan 7th in points.|$|E
25|$|The {{scattered}} Sioux and Cheyenne feasted {{and celebrated}} during July with no threat from soldiers. After their celebrations, {{many of the}} Indians <b>slipped</b> <b>back</b> to the reservation. Soon the number of warriors who still remained at large and hostile amounted to only about 600. Both Crook and Terry remained immobile for seven weeks after the battle, awaiting reinforcements and unwilling to venture out against the Indians until they had at least 2,000 men. Crook and Terry finally took the field against the Indians in August. General Nelson A. Miles took command of the effort in October 1876. In May 1877, Sitting Bull escaped to Canada. Within days, Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The Great Sioux War ended on May 7 with Miles' defeat of a remaining band of Miniconjou Sioux.|$|E
