50|$|Before cotton is {{processed}} {{it has to}} be cleaned of its seeds and other impurities, which in the early days was done by spreading the raw cotton on a mesh and beating it with sticks, a process known as willowing or batting. A scutching machine for cotton, known as a <b>scutcher,</b> was invented in 1797, but did not get much attention until it was introduced in Manchester cotton mills in 1808 or 1809. By 1816 scutchers had been generally adopted.|$|E
50|$|Scutching {{is a step}} in the {{processing}} of cotton or the dressing of flax in preparation for spinning. The scutching process separates the impurities from the raw material, such as the seeds from raw cotton or the straw and woody stem from flax fibers. Scutching can be done by hand or by a machine known as a <b>scutcher.</b> Hand scutching of flax is done with a wooden scutching knife and a small iron scraper. The end products of scutching flax are the long flax fibers, short coarser fibers called tow and waste woody matter called shive.|$|E
50|$|The mule frames were {{provided}} by John Hetherington and Sons Ltd. On startup here were 86,868 mule spindles spinning medium counts from American cotton, that was 40's twists and 65 wefts. By 1903, this had increased to 93828, and by 1920, 22,000 doubling spindles had been added.In order to run these spindles in the spinning rooms, the cotton had to be prepared using openers, <b>scutchers,</b> carding engines.|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of airborne dust and bacteria were determined in 12 flax scutching mills {{and in two}} milk processing plants in Normandy, France. A total of 308 of 340 flax workers and 111 of 113 milk processors volunteered to answer a respiratory questionnaire. Personal exposure to airborne dust in the scutching mills varied from 22. 2 mg/m 3 to 144 mg/m 3 and areal concentrations from 8. 92 mg/m 3 to 47. 1 mg/m 3. The concentration of Gram negative bacteria ranged from 3970 (colony forming units) cfu/m 3 to 67, 900 cfu/m 3 and that of total bacteria from 12, 900 cfu/m 3 to more than 600, 000 cfu/m 3. In all, 20 % of the flax <b>scutchers</b> were found, {{on the basis of}} the questionnaire, to suffer from persistent cough and 25 % from chronic phlegm production. The corresponding figures among milk processors were 3. 6 % and 4. 5 %. Unexpectedly, only 12. 5 % of the <b>scutchers</b> appeared to suffer from byssinotic symptoms even though they were heavily exposed to airborne dust and bacteria. The low prevalence of byssinosis might be due to self selection of the workforce or a relatively low concentration of the causative agent despite high airborne contamination...|$|R
50|$|Corn and flax mills {{have been}} located there {{since the early}} 19th century when the Joseph Hunter. This {{combination}} of corn and flax mills is found mainly in Ulster where both types of mill were intimately linked to the surrounding farming economy. In 1861, Joseph Hunter sold the mills to John Devine and when Patrick Gallagher moved to Newmills in 1892, he bought the complex from William Devine, John's son. In addition to the mills, Gallagher purchased a residence, public house, grocery and ancillary buildings, including a <b>scutcher's</b> cottage This was located in a field beside the mill pond. The complex also included a forge {{on the opposite side}} of the road as well as a sizeable farm of land. The business at Newmills was continued by his son, P.F. Gallagher until his death in 1980.|$|R
50|$|This {{illustrates}} firstly {{the hand}} weavers cottage, with a frame loom {{with a hand}} thrown shuttle, mannikins represent the weaver and two women spinning the yarn on different types of wheel. A child is shown hand carding. It is here we see a 16 spindle spinning jenny that would have dated from about 1760, and a 50 spindle improved jenny. There is an original Arkwrights first carding machine. There is a complete sequence of machines that would have taken the bolls from the bales, opener, <b>scutcher,</b> breaker card, finisher card, draw frame and finally a complete Arkwright waterframe dating from 1790. Sharing the floor at Whitaker's Mill is the equipment needed to prepare the waste cotton for the cards in the room above. There is a single cylinder pisker for soft waste and a six cylinder devil for the hard waste.|$|E
50|$|Cotton was not {{the only}} {{industry}} in the locality, as foundries and engineering factories were required to produce the machinery needed by the mills. The largest of these were those operated by the brothers John Muir Hetherington and Thomas Ridley Hetherington, which were established in 1830. Eventually the company became known as John Hetherington and Sons Ltd and the principal factory was at Vulcan Works on Pollard Street. The company was also the proprietor of Curtis, Sons & Company, which was established in 1804 at the Phoenix Works, which were on both sides of Chapel Street (now Chapeltown Street). On one side of the street there was a brass and iron works {{and on the other side}} there was a machinery factory. Hetherington's produced a huge range of machinery for the textile industry that included machinery for opening, preparing, spinning and doubling cotton, cotton waste, wool and worsted. Their speciality was a machine called a Combined Opener and <b>Scutcher</b> that was very effective in the cleaning of most types of cotton without damaging the staple or losing serviceable fibre.|$|E
50|$|The female {{equivalent}} of the Haferbock is the Habergeiß ("oat goat")., also known as Korngeiß ("corn goat"), Weizengeiß ("wheat goat") Roggengeiß ("rye goat")., Hobagoaß ("oat goat") or Heugeiß ("hay goat"). The Habergeiß is sometimes said to have only three legs. It is sometimes also described as a three-footed bird, as a yellow bird with goat voice, as half a goat and half a bird, as a goat with horse feet and a mouth like a half-opened <b>scutcher</b> or as a young chamois with wings. The cry of the Habergeiß pronounces springtime as well as bad luck. Someone who imitates the cry of the Habergeiß will get punishment. The Habergeiß hunts, scratches or even eats the meddlesome one. If not, it wil hang itself as a bloody coat at the crier's door. This corn demon also slaps people looking {{out of the window}} at night or takes part in the wild hunt, is also the mount of the devil. In heavy thunderstorm the Habergeiß bring cut grain from one field to another foreign field. The appearance of the Habergeiß causes bad luck. The corn will spoil, the cows will lose weight, give no milk and felt. When the cry of the Habergeiß is heard in autumn this means a long winter and lack of hay.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{invitation}} of the assistant manager, Bill Crank, the Winstanleys, authors of the book cited below, visited May Mill in September 1980. They said: Although we expected to see some old spinning machines, we were very surprised to find so many still in use; in fact, {{there was very little}} new machinery. Many of the machines were pre-1920, and some dated to about the turn of the century. Slubber and drawing frames were said {{to be part of the}} original May Mill equipment These were made in 1902 by Howard & Bullough of Accrington. Numerous carding frames by Platt Brothers of Oldham were dated 1905, 1907 and 1920, but some of these had been converted to suit Courtauld's needs. Fly frames, also made by Howard & Bullough, were dated 1915. The <b>scutchers</b> made by Platt Brothers, were built in 1921 and 1924. Cone winders by Geo. Hattersley were made about 1950. Perhaps the most modern machines were ring spinning frames, dated 1967.|$|R
40|$|The {{spinning}} and weaving of flax {{have been carried}} on as domestic arts all over Ireland for many centuries. In the late 18 th century more efficient methods were introduced into the British Isles by refugee Huguenots. For historical, economic, and ecological reasons the manufacture of linen became concentrated in Ulster. There {{is no evidence of}} a respiratory hazard until mechanization of the processes took place. Ramazzini (1705) described a severe respiratory affection amongst <b>scutchers</b> and hacklers aggregated for work in enclosed spaces. In 1831 Thackrah and Jesse Leach (1863) described similar cases occurring in Leeds and Heywood, and in 1860 Greenhow noted the enormous increase in the mortality from respiratory disease following the introduction of linen manufacture to the Pateley Bridge area of Yorkshire. He recognized also the Monday exacerbation. In 1856 Malcolm in Belfast suggested, in a statistical study, that the incidence of respiratory disease was directly related to the dustiness of the occupation and in a series of papers from 1873 onwards Purdon (C. D.) {{and a number of other}} Ulster doctors described the syndrome. It is my view that, although the incidence of the disease has markedly decreased, cases still occur and that clinically these are indistinguishable from byssinosis in the cotton trade. Recen...|$|R
50|$|In 1960, Wim van der Lee and {{his manager}} made {{old and new}} rope-making {{technologies}} meet. They designed large braiding machines that could manufacture heavy hawsers for the shipping and off-shore industries. The ropes for these hawsers were twisted on the old ropewalk.The industry {{was faced with a}} major challenge in 1965 when the first synthetic yarn hit the markets which had many times the resistance of manila, and, additionally, is impervious. With developments in the synthetic industry taking place at breakneck speed, the family decided to buy into synthetic fibre, which meant closing their own spinning mill.On 1 July 1984, Wim van der Lee’s daughter and son, Saskia and Gijsbert van der Lee, and their cousin Willem Hendrik Schreijgrond, the oldest son of Christina van der Lee, who is Wim van der Lee’s sister, were appointed as supervisory directors alongside Johan Joseph Breen.Bernhard de Wit was appointed as director. By importing raw materials the family could now specialise. This change in production led to a new factory being built in 1993. Van der Lee’s product range, which is made using modern <b>scutchers</b> and braiding machines, now largely varies to include all kinds of ropes, yet the old craft still lives on at the G. van der Lee Rope Factory; hawsers for fisheries, water sport and replicas of VOC ships and the ropes are still twisted on the 350-metre long ropewalk.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} the control requirements of <b>scutcher</b> and introduces {{the control system}} scheme which is composed of programmable logic controller, touch panel and inverter. And it emphasizes the hardware constitution of S 7 - 200 PLC control system, the pressure detection and display of cotton feeding pipeline, together {{with the principles of}} the beater speed test program and the control program of cotton feeding motor. The <b>scutcher</b> control system can feed cotton continuously and equably and ensure the pressure stability of the cotton feeding pipeline. In this way, it can adjust process conveniently, decrease fault rate and cut the design development cycle of new equipments to improve the control level of textile machinery...|$|E
