This paper describes, in outline form, a series of laboratory and field tests on an instrumented heavy goods vehicle. The vehicle was instrumented in the laboratory and an extensive series of calibration tests performed to establish the relationship between measurements of axle strain and vehicle load; this testing regime was also used to validate the instrumentation. A field trial was then conducted with the vehicle being returned to service and axle strain measurements being recorded continuously. Estimates of the static load were then validated against daily weigh-bridge measurements.

Conventional <b>static</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem assumes the logistics information is accurate and timely, and {{does not take into}} account the uncertainties, which is therefore inadequate during practical applications. In this paper, a vehicle initial routing optimization model considering uncertainties is proposed, the vehicle capacity, customer time-window, and the maximum travelling distance as well as the road capacity are considered. In the cyber-physical logistics system background, a routing adjustment model is proposed to minimize the total distribution cost considering the road congestion, and the static and dynamic models are proposed for traffic information transmission network to quantitatively analyse the impact of the traffic information transmission delay on the vehicle routing optimization. The learnable genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the initial routing optimization model and the routing adjustment model. The simulation results have verified its effectiveness...|$|R

In crashes, the structure of vehicle bodies are greatly compressed and deformed because of high-speed impact force, which simultaneously generates high speed acceleration. Vehicle structural deformation constricts the driver and passengers, and acceleration can cause them physical harm. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to identify the sources of harm to driver and passengers when crashes occur.

40|$|The {{presence}} of highly non-linear friction damping in the suspensions of many freight vehicles reduces prediction accuracy when using traditional kinematic gauging techniques. These techniques, {{which are often}} applied to the more linear behaving passenger vehicles, {{are based on the}} quasi-static suspension behaviour. Due to this limitation and a market requirement for cost effective and rapid vehicle gauging, the current approach in the UK for freight vehicles is to use <b>static</b> <b>vehicle</b> gauges. This method can be very conservative and lead to in-efficient use of the available space between vehicle and infrastructure. Computer simulation-based dynamic gauging techniques offer a way to maximize the use of the space available, by introducing into the gauging analysis, the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. This paper describes the process of dynamic gauging for friction damped freight vehicles. The benefits of this method in terms of potential increase of the vehicle size are shown, but also difficulties within the process, especially concerning the adequate validation of the simulation models...|$|R

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{and control of}} a class of thrust propelled aerial vehicles subjected to lift and drag aerodynamic forces is addressed. Assuming a rotational symmetry of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>envelope</b> about an axis and the alignment of the thrust force with this axis, one shows that the resultant of aerodynamic forces can be decomposed as the sum of a term {{in the direction of}} the air velocity and a term {{in the direction of the}} thrust force. Conditions allowing for the derivation of a family of models of aerodynamic forces for which the first term does not depend on the vehicle's orientation are pointed out. When such a model applies, pre-compensation of the latter term with the thrust input allows one to recast the control problem into the simpler case of a spherical vehicle subjected to drag only for which nonlinear feedback controllers endowed with strong stability and convergence properties have been reported in prior studies. Beside the adaptation of these control results, the paper extends a previous work by the authors in two directions. First, the 3 D case is addressed whereas only motions in a single vertical plane was considered. Secondly, the family of models of aerodynamic forces for which the aforementioned transformation holds is enlarged...|$|R
40|$|Two methods, i. e. {{computer}} simulation and field measurement, {{are used in}} this paper to investigate dynamic pavement loading (DPL) generated by vehicle–pavement interaction. A profilometer is used for measuring road surface roughness. Based on the power spectral density of the measured surface roughness, a {{computer simulation}} program is developed using quarter vehicle model. In field measurement methods, an experiment is designed to gain the time history of DPL. An IVECO vehicle is taken as a test vehicle and eight vibration cells were used to pick up vertical accelerations of vehicle body and axle. The test data are collected and recorded while the test vehicle is moving along 11 different pavement sections of highway and bridge at six different speeds. Statistical characteristics of vertical accelerations and DPL of the test vehicle are obtained and analyzed by means of random process theory.

40|$|Inflatable {{communication}} antennas are {{the subject}} of current space research because of their potential for enabling high-bit-rates. However, a significant problem associated with inflatable technology is the “all-ornothing” scenario, where success of the mission depends on successful deployment of the antenna. For this reason, few satellite programs are willing to take the risk of using an inflatable unless it is mission enabling. The Hybrid Inflatable Antenna, a concept developed by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and ILC Dover, addresses the risk by providing a backup capability within the inflatable dish. This system combines a fixed parabolic dish with an inflatable reflector annulus that greatly increases antenna area. For example a 1 -meter diameter dish can be increased to 4 -meter resulting in a 16 X improvement in reflector surface. A dual feed ensures operation of the smaller fixed dish throughout the mission providing a “risk buffer ” to the inflated dish. The inflatable annulus is stowed compactly under the fixed dish prior to launch to fit a variety of spacecraft and launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>envelopes.</b> Moderate gas pressure deploys the annulus and support tubes.

Important progress towards practical usage of such networks is being made by standardization in Europe and the USA. Thereby, one of the core concerns is privacy of vehicles and their drivers, especially in Europe. Prior work has regarded only a small sub-set of the information exposed by current standards to an attacker for vehicle tracking. Thus, we take a close look on the data contained on different protocol layers of an ETSI ITS system. We find that much data is very distinctive and can be used to identify <b>static</b> <b>vehicle</b> properties such as manufacturer or even model. We call these data sets volatile constant data. Its presence is shown to greatly reduce usability of formerly proposed cooperative pseudonym switching strategies. Thereby, a privacy metric called vehicular uniqueness is introduced. The provided analysis shows that more constraints have to be applied for selecting appropriate cooperation partners for pseudonym switching, which significantly reduces their availability. Therefore, current techniques cannot provide the level of privacy defined in VANET standards. Suggestions for improving the data sets used by security entity and facility layer of ETSI ITS are given to limit the impact of the found issues. Effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms is shown in the provided evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of scale-model trains in crosswinds, undertaken to assess steady and unsteady aerodynamic effects of the vehicle movement simulation. A 1 : 25 scale-model train was tested in the University of Birmingham's TRAIN rig facility. A crosswind generator was designed and constructed to enable static and moving model experiments in the presence of crosswinds in this facility. An on­ board pressure measuring system comprising a series of miniaturised pressure transducers and a bespoke stand­ alone data logger were developed. Static and moving model experiments were carried out investigating a scale­ model of the Class 390 Pendolino train, on a nominal flat ground infrastructure scenario whilst subjected to a crosswind at 30 ° yaw angle. The test facility, measuring equipment and experimental methodology that were developed led to a more realistic underbody flow simulation and to a reduced margin of experimental uncertainty with respect to previous moving model tests. Furthermore, they enabled detailed surface pressure data to be measured, which are suitable for CFD benchmarking. The results support the reliability of wind tunnel tests on <b>static</b> <b>vehicles</b> for investigating steady aerodynamic coefficients but suggest that their use in the analysis of train unsteady aerodynamics is not entirely satisfactory. ...|$|R

A {{finite element model}} (FEM) for a rail-fastener system was produced to determine the nonlinear compressive deformations of TPE rail pads and their nonlinear static stiffness under the <b>static</b> <b>vehicle</b> weight and the preload of rail fastener. Next, the vertical vehicle-track coupled model was employed to investigate {{the influence of the}} amplitude- and frequency-dependent stiffness of TPE rail pads on the vehicle-track random vibration. It is found that the static stiffness of TPE rail pads ranges from 19. 1 to 37. 9 [*]kN/mm, apparently different from the classical secant stiffness of 26. 7 [*]kN/mm. Additionally, compared with the nonlinear amplitude- and frequency-dependent stiffness of rail pads, the classical secant stiffness would not only severely underestimate the random vibration acceleration levels of wheel-track coupled system at frequencies of 65 – 150 [*]Hz but also alter the dominant frequency-distribution of vehicle wheel and steel rail. Considering that these frequencies of 65 – 150 [*]Hz are the dominant frequencies of ground vibration accelerations caused by low-speed railway, the nonlinear amplitude- and frequency-dependent stiffness of rail pads should be taken into account in prediction of environment vibrations due to low-speed railway...|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis the {{gyroscopic}} stabilization of a two-wheeled amphibious concept vehicle is investigated. The key {{idea is to}} neutralize external torques applied on the vehicle by the counter torque produced from the two gyroscopes attached on the vehicle. Here the gyroscopes are used as actuators, not as sensors. When a torque is applied in order to rotate a gyroscope whose flywheel is spinning, then the gyroscope precesses and it generates a moment, orthogonal to both the torque and the spinning axis. This phenomenon is known as gyroscopic precession. As the vehicle leans from its upright position we expect to generate sufficient gyroscopic reaction moment to bring the vehicle back and get it stabilized.   We first derive the equations of motion based on Lagrangian mechanics. It is worth mentioning that we only consider the control dynamics of a <b>static</b> <b>vehicle.</b> This is the so called regulator problem where we try to counteract the effects of disturbances. The trajectory tracking (servo problem) and the water-travelling {{can be considered as}} an extension of the current project.

Infrared video cameras have capabilities to operate at day and night and to acquire the scene sampled with video frame rate, but at the cost of geometric resolution. In this paper, an approach for the estimation of vehicle motion and the assessment of traffic activity from airborne IR video data is presented. This strategy is based on the separate handling of detection and tracking vehicle in the video, which differs from the common method developed to extract the object motion. The reason for it is that <b>static</b> <b>vehicles</b> are also intended to be detected. A single vehicle detector is firstly applied to find the vehicles in the image frames of video successively. Sensor movement is compensated by coregistering the image sequence under the selected geometric constraint. Afterwards, a progressive grouping concept considering temporal coherence and geometric relation is designed to recover the vehicle trajectories and classify them into static, moving and uncertain type. Image matching and the topology of trajectory are integrated into grouping process to aid the verification. Testing the algorithm on an IR video of urban area show us a promising result that 83 % of moving vehicles are successfully extracted which is able to serve as basis for traffic density analysis. 1...|$|R
