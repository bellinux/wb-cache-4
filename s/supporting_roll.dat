The company is today strongly decent­ralized and there is a minimum of collaboration between the 20 business units. This is why the questions were raised; how could the business units coordinate outbound logistic activities and what effects would that provide. The obj­ect­ive of this final thesis is to provide basic data for a future decision-making which desc­r­ibe these effects. The report has mapped out the factors that are important to ABB in an evaluation of their logistic activities and how the outbound logistics work today. The four factors are cost efficiency, delivery service, environmental impact and logistics capability. It was noticed that the degree of collaboration was very low and the business units send their goods in three main directions: Gothenburg, Arlanda and Europe (except for deliveries within the Nordic countries). Today it is only the goods towards Arlanda which are joint­ly transported. In the other directions {{there are only a few}} business units who collaborate. Beside the primal task to negotiate general transport­ation agreements, the central logistic function (GFSM) at ABB has only a <b>supporting</b> <b>roll</b> in the work concerning logistics. The reason is not just that the business units have the real mandate over the logistics but also that the logistic focus in general is low. Furthermore is it hard for the freight managers (FM) at each business unit to change and improve the logistics, because they have other tasks to manage but also since their logistics skills in many cases are poor. The demands on the freight man­agers are also not expressed clearly enough and therefore they don’t know what is expected of them in their rolls as freight managers. Three development directions were identified and expressed as scenarios, see table 1. Scenario 1 represents an increased focus on the logistics and more distinct rolls for the GFSM and the FMs. Scenario 2 addresses an increased coordination of the physical flow of goods (exemplified as a consolidation of all truck transportations toward Gothenburg) where the freight managers are in charge of this coordination. Scen­ario 3 is a combi­nation of the first and second scenario and represents a centralization of the outbound logistics (exemplified as train with containers to Gothenburg). The conclusion was that: -   Scenario 1 entails an increased transparency, communication and central management with positive effects on costs, delivery service and on the environment in the long run. The scenario becomes a prerequisite for the execution of the two others. Therefore is it the first step for ABB if they wish to increase their coordination of physical goods or centralize their logistics operations. -   Scenario 2 envolves cost savings by a good 50 % because the collecting of the goods takes place at each business unit (unchanged amount of handling). These changes are something to attain since it, in addition to the cost savings, can imply an improved delivery service and doesn’t increase the emissions of CO 2 compared with today! -   Scenario 3 results in a cost impairment since the cost reductions are too small for the distance Västerås-Gothenburg and are eliminated by the increased costs for handling of goods, warehousing and internal transportation. Nevertheless is train transportation within Sw­eden preferable out of an environmental perspective. All aspects considered, this scen­ario must consolidate more flows of goods and secure already existing knowledge before it becomes interesting to realize...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} a postural support nappy and/or a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> on neuromotor function in very preterm infants when nursed prone to term equivalent age. Methods: A randomized observer blind controlled trial of 123 very preterm infants was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of the sole tertiary referral centre in Western Australia. Infants were stratified by gestational age (< 29 weeks or 29 - 30 weeks), then randomized into one of three intervention groups: postural support nappy, postural support nappy and postural <b>support</b> <b>roll,</b> or disposable nappy and postural <b>support</b> <b>roll.</b> Interventions started when infants were stable and ceased when routine side-lying commenced. Measurements of shoulder and hip posture were performed pre-intervention, 5 weeks post-intervention and term postmenstrual age. Results: Infants nursed with a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> and a postural support nappy demonstrated improved hip posture to term equivalent age compared with infants nursed with either a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> only, or a postural support nappy only. Infants nursed with a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> either with or without a postural support nappy demonstrated improved shoulder posture to term equivalent age. Conclusions: Combined use of a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> and a postural support nappy while very preterm infants are nursed prone improves hip posture up to term postmenstrual age.

40|$|The {{formation}} of longitudinal off-corner depressions or “gutters ” in continuous-cast steel slabs {{has been investigated}} using coupled finite-element models. Thermal-mechanical behavior of the solidifying shell has been simulated as it moves down through the mold and upper <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> in the spray chamber. The calculation includes solidification, intermittent gap formation, plastic creep, bulging due to ferrostatic pressure, interaction with the mold and rolls, and phase transformations. The effects of turbulent flow in the liquid pool, flow and melting of the powder layers, superheat dissipation, taper, and thermal distortion of the mold walls are accounted for using separate models. Together, these models illustrate a multi-stage mechanism for gutter formation. The problem starts with a hot, thin region down the off-corner wide face. This {{may be caused by}} locally-inadequate liquid powder feeding, or by insufficient taper of the upper portion of the narrow face mold walls, allowing corner rotation within the mold. Depressions may then be created by excessive taper, buckling the thin shell near mold exit. Alternatively, they may evolve during bulging between <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> below the mold, due to bending of the thin off-corner region. The results suggest that the problem can be avoided by optimizing the mold flow pattern and powder properties to obtai...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on using the variation of ferrostatic pressure exerted by the molten steel in the strand to the <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> during continuous casting {{to detect the}} location of the final solidification. The final solidification point is of high importance for applying soft reduction during continuous casting {{in order to ensure}} inner quality and achieve high productivity. The measurement was conducted at one of the casters at SSAB Oxelösund, of which all the support rolls are separately mounted. The project finds that this method shows promising results and can help to narrow down the range of the location due to certain interferences and noises. The ferrostatic pressure decrease during tail-out and the variation of whether a pressure drop exists is the dividing line of full and partial solidification. With the promising results achieved, more effort should be put to further improve the method...|$|R

40|$|Computational {{modeling}} of thermal–mechanical behavior has {{great potential for}} understanding the formation of defects during solidification, especially when combined with appropriate failure criteria. This chapter summarizes the constitutive equations {{that can be used}} to model the complex phenomena that govern thermal–mechanical behavior of solidification macroprocesses. Important issues in model development are discussed, including the numerical treatment of thermal–mechanical coupling, boundary conditions, solid, mushy, and liquid phases, contact, and methods to solve the highly nonlinear and coupled equations. The steps in model development are extended to the prediction of hot-tear crack formation and validation with numerical benchmarks and experiments. Finally, three different practical applications of thermal mechanical models are presented. They range fromdistortion of complex-shaped foundry castings, taper optimization, and longitudinal crack formation during continuous casting of steel in the mold region, and the cyclic bulging and stresses that develop between <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> during continuous casting of slabs. ...|$|R
