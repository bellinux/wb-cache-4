40|$|The paper {{identifies}} thirteen common {{configurations of}} Type B <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> These configurations are modeled using the INTEGRATION software {{for a wide}} range of <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> lengths and travel demands. Subsequently, the simulation results are utilized to develop analytical procedures for estimating the capacity of Type B <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> and compared to the HCM 2000 procedures. The results demonstrate that the HCM 2000 procedures suffer from four significant drawbacks. First, the procedures can only consider relatively long <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> (longer than or equal to 150 m). Second, the HCM procedures fail to capture the impact of the distribution of weaving flows between freeway and on-ramp demand on the capacity of <b>weaving</b> <b>sections,</b> which is demonstrated to be an important factor in the analysis <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> capacities. Third, the procedures do not ensure that the capacity of a <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> reverts to the basic freeway capacity when the volume ratio is zero (no weaving flows) regardless of the <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> length.

The use of analytical models in assessing <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> capacity (such as those suggested by the Highway Capacity Manual-HCM) has proved to produce some inaccurate results.

In this study, a new weaving micro-simulation model has been developed to focus on the behaviour of drivers along a <b>weaving</b> <b>section.</b> This model consists mainly of four essential algorithms to represent car-following, lane changing, gap acceptance and weaving rules. The model was developed with data on drivers' characteristics at <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> which was used in its calibration and validation processes. A large amount of data from loop detectors obtained from the Highways Agency (i. e. the Motorway Incident Detection and Automated Signalling-MIDAS) was collected. However, such data alone was found to be inadequate for studying <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> characteristics. Therefore, over 50 hours of video recordings were collected from several <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> within the Greater Manchester Area. Such comprehensive resource of field data helped in investigating other characterises such as effective length, the percentage of segregation vehicles and merging/diverging points. The results suggest that the effective length could be considered as about 200 m for ramp <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> where the actual weaving length is greater or equal to 300 m. whereas this effective length represents the whole weaving length when the actual weaving length is less than 300 m.

Similarly, high proportions of diverging drivers entered the auxiliary lane very close to the entrance point.

This paper presents two empirical data collection and data extraction processes based on traffic surveillance camera and loop detector measurements. It examines {{the quality of the}} extracted data, and highlights the possible sources of measurement errors considering that the speed and acceleration are varied significantly. This paper proposes locally weighted regression method for data cleaning and presents example results to demonstrate the method by combining the two data sources. The study succeeds in identifying some key driving characteristics of vehicles in the <b>weaving</b> <b>section.</b> We found that 25. 25 % of the weaving movements took place in the first 50 - 100 meters from the point of merge. Around 30 % of the total traffic involved in one lane-changing movement. Meanwhile, the transit time for the driver with more than one lane-changing is 4. 09 sec in average. The appearance of auxiliary lane in the <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> provides further opportunity to delay the lane-changing, which affects the traffic performance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Weaving</b> <b>sections,</b> {{a common}} design of motorways, require {{extensive}} lane-change manoeuvres. Numerous {{studies have found}} that drivers tend to make their lane changes as soon as they enter the <b>weaving</b> <b>section,</b> as the traffic volume increases. Congestion builds up {{as a result of this}} high lane-changing concentration. Importantly, such congestion also limits the use of existing infrastructure, the <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> downstream. This behaviour thus affects both safety and operational aspects. The potential tool for managing motorways effectively and efficiently is cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS). This research investigates a lane-change distribution advisory application based on C-ITS for weaving vehicles in <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> The objective of this research is to alleviate the lane-changing concentration problem by coordinating weaving vehicles to ensure that such lane-changing activities are evenly distributed over the existing weaving length. This is achieved by sending individual messages to drivers based on their location to advise them when to start their lane change. The research applied a microscopic simulation in AIMSUN to evaluate the proposed strategy’s effectiveness in a one-sided ramp weave. The proposed strategy was evaluated using different weaving advisory proportions, traffic demands and penetration rates. The evaluation revealed that the proposed lane-changing advisory has the potential to significantly improve delay...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of freeway <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> {{has been a}} continuing challenge for the developers of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodologies. With {{the release of the}} 2010 HCM, a completely updated methodology is now available to practitioners. This new methodology represents a substantial departure from previous methodologies. In particular, the tabulation of weaving maneuvers is a critical driver, and the maximum length of a <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> is now a dynamic value. With the release of the new methodology, transportation agencies and practitioners will be interested in specific assessments of its accuracy and logic. To address that need, this research will present a cross-cutting assessment of the methodology. The assessment was focused on two key attributes:• Sensitivity of parameters for determining <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> length, and the differentiation between weaving and basic freeway segments. • A comparison of results from the 2000 and 2010 HCMs. The end result is guidance to agencies and practitioners implementing the 2010 HCM weaving procedures...|$|R

40|$|One {{source of}} vehicle {{conflict}} is the freeway <b>weaving</b> <b>section,</b> where a merge and diverge {{in close proximity}} require vehicles either entering or exiting the freeway to execute one or more lane changes. Using accident data {{for a portion of}} Southern California, we examined accidents that occurred on three types of <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> defined in traffic engineering: Type A, where every merging or diverging vehicle must execute one lane change, Type B, where either merging or diverging can be done without changing lanes, and Type C, where one maneuver requires at least two lane changes. We found no difference among these three types in terms of overall accident rates for 55 <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> over one year (1998). However, there were significant differences in terms of the types of accidents that occur within these types in terms of severity, and location of the primary collision, the factors causing the accident, and the time period in which the accident is most likely to occur. These differences in aspects of safety lead to implications for traffic engineering improvements. ...|$|R
