40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to present the results and {{findings}} of the final Human Factors Engineering (HFE) technical analysis and evaluation of the Cold Vacuum Drying Facility (CVDF). Ergonomics issues are also addressed in this report, as appropriate. This report follows up and completes the preliminary work accomplished and reported by the Preliminary HFE Analysis report (SNF- 2825, Spent Nuclear Fuel Project Cold Vacuum Drying Facility Human Factors Engineering Analysis: Results and Findings). This analysis avoids redundancy of effort except for ensuring that previously recommended HFE design changes have not affected {{other parts of the}} system. Changes {{in one part of the}} system may affect other parts of the system where those changes were not applied. The final HFE analysis and evaluation of the CVDF human-machine interactions (HMI) was expanded to include: the physical work environment, human-computer interface (HCI) including workstation and software, operator tasks, tools, maintainability, communications, staffing, training, and the overall ability of humans to accomplish their responsibilities, as appropriate. Key focal areas for this report are the process bay operations, process water conditioning (PWC) <b>skid,</b> <b>tank</b> room, and Central Control Room operations. These key areas contain the system safety-class components and are the foundation for the human factors design basis of the CVDF...|$|E

50|$|A danger with off-roading is {{damage to}} the vehicle from hitting rocks or other hard {{surfaces}} on very uneven terrain. A typical solution would be to install skid plates (sometimes also called bash plates), which are thick metal plates protecting vulnerable parts (such as the transfer/gear box or engine oil sump). Some manufacturers install skid plates as standard equipment on some of their vehicles. For many others this additional protection is available as an after-market accessory. Skid plates may be simple flat plates, but {{they may also be}} formed (by stamping or by welding multiple pieces) to protect shaped items like differentials. Fuel <b>tank</b> <b>skid</b> plates are a common factory option. In addition to skid plates, many off-roaders install differential covers that will not bend or break if they are smashed on rocks or other large objects. Since the axles on an off-road vehicle typically are the lowest hanging part of the vehicle making them susceptible to damage.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data are}} {{presented}} for the parasite drag of various helicopter fuselage components, such as <b>skids,</b> external fuel <b>tanks,</b> and tailplane. The experiments were {{conducted at the}} Kazan National Research Technical University (Kazan Aviation Institute) T- 1 K wind tunnel, investigating four versions of a fuselage similar to the Ansat helicopter. It was found that, for the range of pitch angles − 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg− 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg, the skids added 80 % to the drag of the bare fuselage, whereas the tailplane increased the drag by 20 %. At the same conditions, external fuel tanks were found to add 48 % to the clean fuselage drag. A simple rotor hub with a tail support added 74 % to the bare fuselage {{in the range of}} pitch angles − 8 ≤α≤ 6 [*][*]deg− 8 ≤α≤ 6 [*][*]deg. Streamlining the rear fuselage was found to reduce the drag by 16 % over the range of pitch angles − 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg− 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg. Apart from the parasite drag, ideas for drag reduction are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|A crowd gathers where a jet {{landed in}} fence near a road. Crash Crew and law {{enforcement}} are on site. Photograph taken for a newspaper owned by the Oklahoma Publishing Company. Caption: "Jet Lands In Fence; Pilot Safe A Tulsa air national guard flier crashed his F- 80 Shooting Star through the 6 -foot fence bordering Tinker Air Force base Wednesday morning, but he suffered only minor injuries. Capt. J. H. Rodolf, member of the 125 th fighter-interceptor squadron based at Tulsa municipal airport, was pulled from the cockpit and rushed to the Tinker hospital. He suffered only lacerations and bruises {{on his chest and}} neck, was kept at the hospital for further observation. The air guardsman was unconscious when the rescue squad arrived at the scene, but recovered {{by the time he was}} transferred to the ambulance. He said he could see his plane was "undershooting" the runway as he approached the base from the west. He pushed the throttle forward, he said, but the plane failed to respond. The fighter craft first hit the ground about 200 feet west of the base, lost a wing tank and bounced up. It came down again, lost the other wing <b>tank,</b> <b>skidded</b> across Air Depot road and plowed through a 6 -foot steel fence. Dragging 12 posts of the fence from its nose, the plane kept sliding along the ground until it came to rest near a patrol road at the edge of the runway the flier was trying to make. Although fuel spilled on the ground, there was no fire. The accident occurred about 8 a. m. ...|$|R
