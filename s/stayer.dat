25|$|Since the {{construction}} of its oldest buildings, the university's physical plant has grown substantially. Over the years 31 residence halls have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of libraries, {{the most prominent of}} which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for men, Dunne Hall, began accepting residents for the Fall 2016 semester. Flaherty Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in Fall 2016 as well. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well. Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The <b>Stayer</b> Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey. Also, there are many outdoor fields, as the Frank Eck Stadium for baseball. , an interdisciplinary research facility, opened its doors for the Fall 2016 semester, and ground has broken on a 60,000-square-foot architecture building on the South end of campus near the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center.

500|$|Tristan {{remained}} in training in 1884 {{by which time}} his achievements had made his name a [...] "household word". At Newmarket in spring he ran a public trial against St. Simon a three-year-old colt who was prevented from running in the classics because {{the death of his}} owner had invalidated his entries. Tristan attempted to give the younger horse twenty-three pounds and was easily beaten. The two horses met again at Royal Ascot on 10 June when Tristan attempted to defend his status as the country's best <b>stayer</b> in the Ascot Gold Cup. His temperament came to the fore as he proved difficult to get to the start and when the race began he again proved no match for St. Simon who won by twenty lengths. In his other races at the meeting, Tristan took on St. Gatien and Harvester the colts who had dead-heated in the Epsom Derby. In the two mile Gold Vase he finished third to St Gatien and Corrie Roy, but in the Hardwicke Stakes {{on the last day of}} the meeting he won easily from Waterford, with the favourite Harvester a distant third.|$|E

30|$|To analyze wage {{dynamics}} in more detail, we exploit the longitudinal {{nature of the}} JC data and look at annual nominal earnings changes for individuals for each pair of years between 2005 and 2013. By focusing on job <b>stayers</b> between successive years, we ensure that {{the composition of the}} sample is the same in each year pair. Therefore, the earnings growth rate between any two years is free of compositional changes. Although the restriction to job <b>stayers</b> between successive years overcomes the problem of composition bias in the year pair comparisons, this may not be sufficient to control for compositional biases over the longer run if the composition of <b>stayers</b> themselves is changing. We address this by conducting a supplementary analysis of a balanced panel of job <b>stayers,</b> the results of which we discuss later.|$|R

30|$|Compared to our {{analysis}} {{with the larger}} definition of controls we can establish qualitatively similar results when we use only <b>stayers</b> as controls. However some point estimates differ somewhat. For example, the wage penalty for urban displaced is now smaller. This is not a surprise since from Table  2 we know that quitters in the urban sample have a higher average wage than <b>stayers.</b> So, by not including quitters one actually understates the wage penalty. In contrast, the larger likelihood of being informally employed has an upward bias in the migrant sample, because migrant <b>stayers</b> have a lower incidence of informal employment than migrant quitters (see Table  2). So, on this evidence it strikes us as better to choose both <b>stayers</b> and quitters as controls when one wants to estimate the true level of losses associated with displacement.|$|R

2500|$|Isonomy (May 1875 [...] April 1891) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In {{a career}} that lasted from 1877 to 1880 he ran {{fourteen}} times and won ten races. As a three-year-old he deliberately bypassed the Classics in order that his owner could land a massive betting coup in the Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket. In the following two seasons he was the dominant <b>stayer</b> in Britain, producing a series of performances which led many contemporary observers to regard {{him as one of}} the greatest racehorses of the 19th century.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} found that there is in general a {{negative}} effect of job displacement on a large set of various labor market outcomes. However, many of these studies only compare the workers who remain in a firm upon closure (the <b>stayers),</b> and do not consider the workers displacing in the process leading up to this final displacement event (the early leavers). Neglecting these early leavers may lead to biased estimates of the costs of displacement. Using Norwegian administrative register data, I identify the early leavers and the <b>stayers</b> by determining when the selective labor turnover directly related to the downsizing process starts by comparing the post-separation outcomes of workers separating from closing and non-closing firms using a difference-in-difference approach. Having established that selective labor turnover starts two years prior to firm closure, I estimate the costs of displacement using a double difference-in-difference approach. I find that the cost of displacement in terms of annual pensionable income is greater for the <b>stayers</b> compared to the early leavers. Specifically, the annual income loss for the <b>stayers</b> is from 2. 2 to 4. 5 percent higher in the five years after the displacement year. Using a three-way fixed effects log-wage model estimated {{prior to the start of}} the downsizing process, I construct empirical human capital distributions for the early leavers and the <b>stayers.</b> The resulting distributions lend support to the hypothesis that the <b>stayers</b> are negatively selected in terms of general human capital and positively selected in terms of firm-specific human capital. From a search-theoretical point of view, this may explain why the negative effect of displacement on income is greater for the <b>stayers</b> than for the early leavers...|$|R
30|$|Larger {{networks}} seem to {{be associated}} with higher income for <b>stayers</b> but lower income for movers and with much larger quality of life for all refugees. The fact that quality of life is so strongly affected by the size of networks explains why refugees tend to move to municipalities with larger networks even if this could affect their income negatively. A one standard deviation larger network is associated with a 29  % higher income for <b>stayers,</b> a 2.1  % lower income for movers and a higher quality of life of all refugees (<b>stayers</b> and movers) by an equivalent of 1.2 times their income.|$|R

The sea front will be bricked or paved for a mile or so, {{and there will be}} rows of boats and bathing-machines, and other contrivances to screen off the view of the sea. And, as we have indicated, watering-places and staying by the seaside are incompatible things. The true <b>stayer</b> by the seaside goes into the watering-place because he must; because there is little food, and that uncooked, and no tobacco, between the cliffs and the sea.
