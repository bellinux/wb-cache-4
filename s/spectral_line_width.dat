50|$|In astronomy, the Tully-Fisher {{relation}} is {{an empirical}} {{relationship between the}} mass or intrinsic luminosity of a spiral galaxy and its angular velocity or emission line width. It {{was first published in}} 1977 by astronomers R. Brent Tully and J. Richard Fisher. The luminosity is calculated by multiplying the galaxy's apparent brightness by 4πd2, where d is its distance from us, and the <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>width</b> is measured using long-slit spectroscopy.|$|E

However, the <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>width</b> sometimes shows a sudden decrease at a height 0. 1 - 0. 2 R, where the ratio of sound to Alfven speeds may approach unity. Qualitative analysis shows that the resonant energy conversion from Alfven to acoustic waves near {{the region of the}} corona where the plasma β approaches unity may explain the observed <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>width</b> reduction.

40|$|The {{photoluminescence}} (PL) in a-C:H:N {{was measured}} using a 2. 4 leV Ar ion laser line for varying N content. The PL results show a lowering of the PL peak energy and a <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>width</b> broadening as the N content in the film increases. Decomposition of the PL spectra {{into a series of}} Gaussian sub-peak levels shows two distinct peaks at 2. 2 and 2. 1 eV and a broad peak at 1. 7 eV. It is found that the apparent lowering in the PL peak energy and the <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>width</b> broadening with increasing N content can be understood in terms of an increase in intensity of the sub-peak at 2. 1 eV with respect to that at the higher energy (2. 2 eV).

40|$|<b>Line</b> <b>widths</b> and multiplicities {{observed}} in solute electronic spectra of dilute organic solid solutions depend {{to a great}} extent on lattice disorder and solute site inhomogeneities. A definition of the structure of different types of organic solids is followed by a discussion on defects in these solids and of some of their photophysical consequences. The formation of organic solid solutions and the effect of various thermal treatments are considered {{in the light of the}} previous discussion. The influence of lattice phonon structure on <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>widths</b> is discussed for near-perfect and increasingly disordered solid solutions, in terms of the optical analogue of the Mössbauer effect. At low temperature effect is less important than static and dynamic solute site inhomogeneities in determining observed <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>widths.</b> The latter should be narrowest for substitutional solutions. The formation of such solutions depends on a number of parameters amongst which are the solute and solvent molecular geometries and volumes. The effect of these two parameters on solute <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>widths</b> has been studied. Multiplet structure in the electronic spectra of crystalline organic solutions is discussed. The origin of solute site plurality is considered in terms of the mechanism of crystal growth. I...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>width</b> {{broadening}} in Rydberg gases, {{a phenomenon}} previously {{attributed to the}} many-body effect, was observed experimentally almost a decade ago. The observed line width was typically 80 - 100 {{times larger than the}} average interaction strength predicted from a binary interaction. The interpretation of such a phenomenon is usually based on the so-called diffusion model, where the line width broadening mostly originates from the diffusion of excitations. In this paper, we present a model calculation to show that diffusion is not the main mechanism to the line width broadening. We find that the rare pair fluctuation at small separation is the dominant factor contributing to this broadening. Our results give a width of about 20 - 30 times larger than the average interaction strength. More importantly, by turning off the diffusion process, we do not observe order of magnitude change in the <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>width...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{calculations}} of the electron-phonon interaction and some characteristics of excited electrons {{near the bottom}} of the conduction band of titanium dioxide in the structure of anatase and rutile have been performed. The Eliashberg function, the imaginary and real parts of the self-energy potential, as well as the band and polaron masses and width of the photoemission line, have been calculated. It has been shown that the electron-phonon interaction is primarily determined by the interaction with optical photons. Moderate values of the polaron mass (< 2 me) correspond to large polarons. The calculated values of the <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> <b>width</b> are significantly less than those observed in the experiment.
