There was in the broken, violent speech of that man, {{unveiling}} before me his thoughts with the very hand of Death upon his throat, an undisguised ruthlessness of purpose, a strange vengeful attitude towards his own past, and a blind belief in the righteousness of his will against all mankind, something of that feeling which could induce the leader of a horde of wandering cut-throats to call himself proudly the Scourge of God. No doubt the natural senseless ferocity which is the basis of such a character was exasperated by failure, ill-luck, and the recent privations, {{as well as by the}} desperate position in which he found himself; but what was most remarkable of all was this, that while he planned treacherous alliances, had already settled in his own mind the fate of the white man, and intrigued in an overbearing, offhand manner with Kassim, one could perceive that what he had really desired, almost in spite of himself, was to play havoc with that jungle town which had defied him, to see it strewn over with corpses and enveloped in flames. Listening to his pitiless, panting voice, I could imagine how he must have looked at it from the hillock, peopling it with images of murder and rapine. The part nearest to the creek wore an abandoned aspect, though as a matter of fact every house concealed a few armed men on the alert. Suddenly beyond the stretch of waste ground, interspersed with small patches of low dense bush, excavations, heaps of rubbish, with trodden paths between, a man, solitary and looking very small, strolled out into the deserted opening of the street between the shut-up, dark, lifeless buildings at the end. Perhaps one of the inhabitants, who had fled to the other bank of the river, coming back for some object of domestic use. Evidently he supposed himself quite safe at that distance from the hill on the other side of the creek. A light stockade, set up hastily, was just round the turn of the street, full of his friends. He moved leisurely. Brown saw him, and instantly called to his side the Yankee deserter, who acted as a sort of second in command. This lanky, loose-jointed fellow came forward, wooden-faced, trailing his rifle lazily. When he understood what was wanted from him a homicidal and conceited smile uncovered his teeth, making two deep folds down his sallow, leathery cheeks. He prided himself on being a dead shot. He dropped on one knee, and taking aim from a <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> through the unlopped branches of a felled tree, fired, and at once stood up to look. The man, far away, turned his head to the report, made another step forward, seemed to hesitate, and abruptly got down on his hands and knees. In the silence that fell upon the sharp crack of the rifle, the dead shot, keeping his eyes fixed upon the quarry, guessed that [...] "this there coon's health would never be a source of anxiety to his friends any more." [...] The man's limbs were seen to move rapidly under his body in an endeavour to run on all-fours. In that empty space arose a multitudinous shout of dismay and surprise. The man sank flat, face down, and moved no more. [...] "That showed them what we could do," [...] said Brown to me. [...] "Struck the fear of sudden death into them. That was what we wanted. They were two hundred to one, and this gave them something to think over for the night. Not one of them had an idea of such a long shot before.

40|$|Motivated by {{machining}} of thin-walled parts this dissertation {{investigates the}} modeling {{and control of}} dynamic systems, which feature finite-dimensional and distributed-parameter structures interacting with one another over time-varying contacts and time-delayed feedback. The research studies and creates methods for modeling and control of such systems and applies them to a proposed innovative use of industrial robot manipulators and end effectors {{to act as an}} active <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> in the machining of thin-walled parts. On modeling the combined discrete-continuous structural and machine dynamics with time varying contacts, finite element method (FEM) is employed to discretize and extract dynamic modes of the continuous structure. The time delayed feedback in the machining process is approximated by the semi-discretization method, where only the delay part of the otherwise continuous-time system is approximated by discrete-time delays and proper sampling and holding functions. To enable digital control design, sampling and zero-order hold circuit modeling is applied to the actuators in conjunction with the semi-discretization for the delayed feedback. Followed by lifting technique on the periodic-varying system and order reduction, discrete-time control oriented models for the entire machining system with the actively controlled robots and end effectors are constructed. Linear optimal control and robust control are investigated and applied to the proposed robot assisted machining system models. In the linear quadratic state estimator feedback control, a new approach is proposed for the formulation of the cost function weighting matrices. The approach essentially places weighting on outputs and their derivatives since output has clear physical meaning in connection to the process performance. The optimal linear state estimators, aka Kalman filters, are designed taking an approach that exploits the dual properties between the linear optimal regulators and state estimators. In the robust control, parameters in the machining process, particularly the cutting stiffness that depends on the tool conditions and part material, are isolated as uncertainties in formulating the control oriented models for mu-synthesis based robust control design. The above control design methods are applied to the turning of a thin-walled circular wheel with the actively controlled robotic <b>steady</b> <b>rest.</b> The simulation results show that the feedback controlled robotic active <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> not only can stabilize an otherwise unstable machining system, caused by the well-known machining chatter due to the delayed feedback, but also can improve the machined forms and precision.

This technology {{could be a}} potential candidate for applications in novel all-optical devices for information processing and computing. Photonic neuromorphic processing exploits the biophysics of neuronal computation algorithms [1] to provide {{a wide range of}} computing and signal processing applications by harnessing the high speed, high bandwidth, and low crosstalk available to photonic interconnects. This could potentially grant the capacity for complex, ultrafast categorization and decision-making [2]. Neuromorphic signal processing incorporates a sparse coding scheme called spiking. This hybrid analog and digital processing technique takes advantage of both the bandwidth efficiency of analog computation and the noise robustness of digital computation [3], making it attractive to information processing. We recently discovered [4][5] a close analogy between the dynamics of lasers and those of biological neurons, both of which can exhibit excitability [6]—systems that can be excited from their in a stable <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> state to emit a spike by a super-threshold followed by a refractory period.

(Henceforth called MFD&# 8482;/PMM-method). The MFD&# 8482;/PMM-method used for documenting and controlling a product development project has since it was introduced been used in several industries and projects. The method has been proved to be a good way of working with the early stages of product development, however, there are almost only projects carried out on large industries which means that there are very few references to how the MFD&# 8482;/PMM-method works in a small corporation. Therefore, was the case study in the thesis &# 8220;Conceptual Product Development in Small Corporations&# 8221; carried out in a small corporation to find out whether the MFD&# 8482;/PMM-method also can be applied and used in such a corporation. The PMM was proposed in a paper presented at Delft University of Technology in Holland 1998 by the author and Gunnar Erixon. (See appended paper C: The chart of modular function deployment.) The title &# 8220;The chart of modular function deployment&# 8221; was later renamed as PMM, Product Management Map. (Sweden PreCAD AB, 2000). The PMM consists of a QFD-matrix linked to MIM (Module Indication Matrix) via a coupling matrix which makes it possible to make an unbroken chain from the customer domain to the designed product/modules. The PMM makes it easy to correct omissions made in creating new products and modules. In the thesis &# 8220;Conceptual Product Development in Small Corporations&# 8221; the universal MFD&# 8482;/PMM-method has been adapted by the author to three models of product development; original-, evolutionary- and incremental development. The evolutionary adapted MFD&# 8482;/PMM-method was tested as a case study at Atlings AB in the community Ockelbo. Atlings AB is a small corporation with a total number of 50 employees and an annual turnover of 9 million &# 8364;. The product studied at the corporation was a <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> for supporting long shafts in turning. The project team consisted of management director, a sales promoter, a production engineer, a design engineer and a workshop technician, the author as team leader and a colleague from Dalarna University as discussion partner.

There were no real problems occurring in the project work, on the contrary the team members worked very well in the group, having ideas how to improve the product. Instead, the challenge for a small company is how to work with the MFD&# 8482;/PMM-method in the long run! If the MFD&# 8482;/PMM-method is to be a useful tool for the company it needs to be used continuously and that requires financial and personnel resources.

Brief exposure of Purkinje fibers {{at the low}} level of resting potential to K+-free fluid causes further depolarization, and return to K+-containing solution elicits a transient hyperpolarization which reaches a peak within a few seconds and then declines within a few minutes. Repeating these changes in K+ concentration after clamping the membrane potential at its <b>steady</b> <b>resting</b> level in K+-containing fluid allows the changes in net membrane current presumably underlying the depolarization and transient hyperpolarization to be measured. Net inward current is recorded when the fiber is exposed to K+-free solution, and a transient net outward current arises when it is returned to K+-containing solution. The transient net outward current reflects a temporary increase in the rate of electrogenic Na+ extrusion caused by the rise in intracellular Na+ concentration that occurs while the sodium pump is slowed in K+-free fluid. Sodium extrusion remains enhanced, presumably until the internal Na+ concentration has been brought back to its resting level. The transient outward current is completely abolished by the cardiac steroid acetylstrophanthidin, and its amplitude is increased as the prior exposure to K+-free fluid is prolonged.

40|$|Introduction: Accurate {{water demand}} {{modeling}} {{for the city}} {{is very important for}} forecasting and policies adoption related to water resources management. Thus, for future requirements of water estimation, forecasting and modeling, it is important to utilize models with little errors. Water has a special place among the basic human needs, because it not hampers human life. The importance of the issue of water management in the extraction and consumption, it is necessary as a basic need. Municipal water applications is include a variety of water demand for domestic, public, industrial and commercial. Predicting the impact of urban water demand in better planning of water resources in arid and semiarid regions are faced with water restrictions. Materials and Methods: One of the most important factors affecting the changing technological advances in production and demand functions, we must pay special attention to the layout pattern. Technology development is concerned not only technically, but also other aspects such as personal, non-economic factors (population, geographical and social factors) can be analyzed. Model examined in this study, a regression model is composed of a series of structural components over time allows changed invisible accidentally. Explanatory variables technology (both crystalline and amorphous) in a model according to which the material is said to be better, but {{because of the lack of}} measured variables over time can not be entered in the template. Model examined in this study, a regression model is composed of a series of structural component invisible accidentally changed over time allows. In this study, structural time series (STSM) and ARMA time series models have been used to model and estimate the water demand in Isfahan. Moreover, in order to find the efficient procedure, both models have been compared to each other. The desired data in this research include water consumption in Isfahan, water price and the monthly pay costs of water subscribers between 1388 and 1390. In structural time series model, the model was generated by entering the invisibility part of the process and development of a state-space model, as well as using maximum likelihood method and the Kalman-Filter algorithm. Results and Discussion: Given the value of the test statistic ADF, with the exception of changing water use variables with a time difference of the <b>steady</b> <b>rest.</b> Superpopulation different modes of behavior were assessed based on the demand for water. Due to the likelihood ratio statistic is most suitable for the parameters, was diagnosed the steady-state level of randomness and the slope. Price and income elasticities of demand for water, respectively - 0. 81 and 0. 85 shows that water demand is inelastic with respect to price and income and a lot of water is essential. Identify the nature of the request of one of the most important results in estimated water demand in the urban part of the state space time series structure and patterning methods, as an Alternative for variable is Technology preferences use. The model is estimated for the city's water demand time series model, respectively ARMA (3, 1). Model performance metrics to compare the structural time series and time series ARMA, the result represents a structural time series model based on the fact that all the performance criteria in this study outperformed the ARMA model to forecast water city demand in the Isfahan. Conclusion: Of a time series model structure to model ARMA in this research is to estimate the model and predict the number the less time is required, and also can be used for modeling of other variables (such as income and price) to this is helping to improve the models. Also, in ARMA time series the best model for data was selected according to the Schwarz Bayesian and Akaike criterion. Results indicate that the estimation of water demand using structural time series method is more efficient than when ARMA time series model is applied. Therefore, structural time series model can be used as an efficient tool for managers and planners in the Management Departmentsin order to forecast water demand. Used was for compare the performance of these two models of standard root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ...|$|E

The smooth solutions of these equations are energy conservative, whereas weak solutions are energy stable. The equations possess interesting steady states of lake at rest as well as moving equilibrium states. We design energy conservative finite volume schemes which preserve (i) the lake at <b>rest</b> <b>steady</b> state in both one and two space dimensions, and (ii) one-dimensional moving equilibrium states. Suitable energy stable numerical diffusion operators, based on energy and equilibrium variables, are designed to preserve {{these two types of}} steady states. Several numerical experiments illustrating the robustness of the energy preserving and energy stable well-balanced schemes are presented...|$|R

To reach a total exercise time of at least 6 (children) and 8 (adolescents) minutes the protocol will be adapted based on the expected level of fitness. This {{might be due to}} the subjects high competition level for example or extreme athletic physique but also when a very low fitness is expected. In case of the cycling test, an unloaded phase of 1  min will precede the exercise phase. Each test will be until volitional exhaustion. Usual emergency procedures are in place to ensure health and safety in the very unlikely event of an emergency.|$|R
40|$|The {{initiation}} of chemical reactiondiusion waves by visible light of wavelength k = 632. 8 nm from a 20 mW HeNe laser in the ferroin-catalysed BZ reaction on a polysulfone membrane is reported. With low loading of the catalyst on the membrane, oxidation waves can be initiated from the <b>resting</b> <b>steady</b> state {{and in the}} recovering tail of a wave. With high loading, waves can only be initiated in the vulnerable Ï region behind an exist-ing wavefront. The mechanism of this initiation is {{discussed in terms of}} the photoreduction of the metalligand catalyst and expressed in terms of a modiÐed Oregonator model. These new observations are in contrast to the inhibitory eect of visible light in the light-sensitive Ru-catalysed BZ system...|$|R

The proposed strategy {{is based on a}} regularized model where the advection velocity is modified by the gradient of the potential of the conservative forces in both mass and momentum equations. The stability of the scheme is ensured by the dissipation of mechanic energy, which stands for a mathematical entropy, under an advective CFL condition. The main physical properties, such as positivity, conservation of the total momentum, and conservation of the <b>steady</b> state at <b>rest,</b> are satisfied. In addition, asymptotic preserving properties in the regimes (“incompressible” and “acoustic”) are analyzed. Finally, several simulations are presented to illustrate our results in a simplified context of oceanic flows in one dimension...|$|R
