50|$|The water <b>surface</b> <b>profile</b> {{displays}} how {{the flow}} depth changes over a distance between critical depth and normal depth. For a steep reach, the water <b>surface</b> <b>profile</b> downstream {{of the lake}} is called an S2 curve. When a lake discharges to a mild reach there is no profile. The flow in the reach is immediately at normal depth. When the lake discharges to a steep reach, there is an S2 profile from the lake outlet to normal depth. As the slope decreases, the S2 curve increases in length. Figure 5 shows the S2 curve for the channel profile given above when Fr=1.18. The Standard Step Method was used for calculating the water surface profiles.|$|E
