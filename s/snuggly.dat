50|$|Costumes {{during this}} time were far from {{liberating}} to the dancer. Although a more expressive use of the body was encouraged, dancers' movements were still restricted due to heavy materials, panniers, and tonnelets. Costume fabrics were heavy and covered a dancer's physique. It wasn't until choreographer Jean Georges Noverre called for dance reforms in 1760 with his Letters on Dancing and Ballets that costumes became more conducive to the art form. Noverre urged that costumes be crafted using lightweight fabrics that move fluidly with the body, complimenting a dancer's figure. At {{the end of the}} century, dancers wore soft slippers fitting <b>snuggly</b> along the foot. This shoe design instilled confidence within the ballerina, daring her to dance on her toes. This opened the door to pointework, for this acceptance of more naturalistic costuming allowed the development of the heel-less shoe, which led to the dancer being able to make more use of the rise onto demi-pointe.|$|E

5000|$|In the media, he has {{received}} both ample praise and heavy criticism. He {{has been called the}} Michael Milken of the art world, and [...] "a Sith Lord from the Brotherhood of Darkness," [...] by Jerry Saltz. Art Review's entry on Simchowitz states that [...] "if the artworld needed its Howard Stern, its Ari Gold, its Donald Trump, it got 'Simcho': a brash, publicity-hungry yet highly intelligent collector-adviser-dealer...". Andrew M. Goldstein of Artspace argued that [...] "his approach to collecting and nurturing artists systematically abrogates—annihilates—a whole series of beliefs that lie at the foundation of the art world's critical, institutional, and commercial structures." [...] Simchowitz's trademark transparent and honest attitude leads some to believe that he is simply lifting the veil off of previously hidden activities already prevalent in the artworld. Marc Spiegler, director of Art Basel, attributes Simchowitz's success {{to the fact that he}} does exactly what the galleries do, except at a significantly faster clip, and the [...] "he has taken a market that was built on opacity and been much more transparent. He goes to an artist's studio; he puts the stuff on Instagram." [...] Spiegler characterizes Simchowitz's practice as similar in function to galleries of past, in that he holds exclusive access to his collector base. As such, the approach has been characterized as paradigm-shifting in the context of the contemporary artworld, while <b>snuggly</b> fitting into an extended historical lineage of the artworld's many businessmen.|$|E

Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{deemed it}} [...] "perhaps the most radio-friendly song of Rey's entire career", and praised the [...] "gloriously whiny bounce" [...] of its chorus and [...] "sparkling Lana wisdom" [...] in its lyrics. Similarly, Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani said, [...] "Though it's an understated single by today's pop standards, ..., it's handily Del Rey's catchiest single since 'Summertime Sadness', {{or at least}} 'National Anthem'". Cinquemani also complimented Del Rey's [...] "crisp" [...] vocal and the track's [...] "hypnotic" [...] synth line, and quipped, [...] "lazy, revenge- and smoke-filled summer days never sounded so sweet". Jessica Goodman of Entertainment Weekly deemed it Del Rey's catchiest single yet, praising its [...] "surprising" [...] hip hop elements. Writing in Time, Nolan Feeney said that [...] "High by the Beach" [...] was Del Rey's [...] "poppiest song in a while" [...] and highlighted its [...] "skittering beat and dizzying hook". Feeney's view was echoed by Constant Gardner of Pigeons & Planes who felt [...] "High by the Beach" [...] was [...] "a pop song surely destined for radio play". Stereogum's Peter Helman found [...] "High by the Beach" [...] to be [...] "positively fun" [...] and [...] "probably the straight-up catchiest thing she's done in a while", complimenting its [...] "sultry keys" [...] and the [...] "refreshing independence" [...] of its lyrics.

Writing in The Stage, Harry Venning praised the first ten minutes before adding that the goodwill they generated [...] "was squandered in the truly dreadful 50 minutes that followed". Tom Sutcliffe, in The Independent {{described it as a}} mis-scheduled childrens programme, writing, [...] "its hard to see Sugartown as anything else, so guileless is its plotting and so jauntily empty of threat are its characterisations." [...] Sutcliffe conceded {{that it was not a}} bad show of its type but doubted it would appeal to many, summarizing it as [...] "cocoa for the mind".

In conclusion he stated that Sugartown [...] "won’t (and needn’t) do a whole lot more than satisfy the sweet tooth of a Sunday-night audience." [...] In The Scotsman, Paul Whitelaw, was scathing about the general type of cosy northern comedy dramas and Sugatown in particular.

5000|$|The {{action of}} Bear Behaving Badly is {{centered}} on an apartment block owned by Barney's wealthy uncle Rupert Silverspoon. There are three flats on the ground floor. Barney and Nev live in Flat 1, Beatrice lives in Flat 2, and the caretaker, Mr Prank, lives in Flat 3. There are at least 5 more flats upstairs, one of which Aunt Barbara lives in. A door under the stairs leads down to the boiler room. Barney is a children's television presenter. He doesn't own a car and instead travels everywhere by tricycle or takes the bus. Barney and Beatrice share a mutual affection, though sometimes Barney is a bit shy when talking to her. Mr Prank has an obsequious attitude towards Barney whom he frequently addresses as [...] "Mr Barney, Sir." [...] This feigned respect is {{on account of the}} fact that Barney's uncle is his employer. In addition Prank runs his own ice cream business from his ice cream van which is often seen parked outside the apartment block. Aunt Barbara does not know about Mr Prank's ice cream and constantly refers to it as a 'rusty old thing' and demands the owner (Mr Prank) should be locked up. He is allergic to Nev's blue fur but pretends to like him when Barney is nearby. As soon as Barney is out of sight, Prank is nasty to Nev and makes his life a misery. Sometimes Nev retaliates by snarling, blowing a raspberry at him, or even kissing him on the nose, causing him to sneeze. Nev has a favorite cuddly toy which he calls his <b>Snuggly</b> Ducky Duck Duck. He also likes to have plastic ducks floating in the water when he has a bath. Despite starring in a programme called Bear Behaving Badly, Nev usually tries to do the right thing, and only misbehaves as a response to difficult circumstances or situations. He likes ice cream, jam, rubber ducks and socks.|$|E
