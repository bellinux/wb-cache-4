40|$|BACKGROUND: Fiber fuse is {{a process}} of optical fiber {{destruction}} under the action of laser radiation, found 20 years ago. Once initiated, opical discharge runs along the fiber core region to the light source and leaves periodic voids whose shape looks like a bullet pointing the direction of laser beam. The relation between damage pattern and propagation mode of optical discharge is still unclear even after the first in situ observation three years ago. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fiber fuse propagation over hetero-core <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> (Corning SMF- 28 e and HI 1060) was observed in situ. Sequential photographs obtained at intervals of 2. 78 micros recorded a periodic emission at the tail of an optical discharge pumped by 1070 nm and 9 W light. The signal stopped when the discharge ran over the <b>splice</b> <b>point.</b> The corresponding damage pattern left in the fiber core region included a segment free of periodicity. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial modulation pattern of the light emission agreed with the void train formed over the hetero-core <b>splice</b> <b>point.</b> Some segments included a bullet-shaped void pointing in the opposite direction to the laser beam propagation although the sequential photographs did not reveal any directional change in the optical discharge propagation...|$|E

Different solution techniques for {{the integration of the}} governing equations are compared with respect to perfor-mance and accuracy. Supplementary, the predictive accuracy of the employed rope models is outlined. Moreover, the merits of two different concepts for the towing gear set-up, i. e. utilizing a floating polypropylene part together with a submerged steel hawser or a single floating line, are discussed. Investigated ap-plication examples focus on towing medium sized icebergs with changes in ship speed. Based on a given towing speed profile, the acting forces and accelerations on the iceberg and the rope tension are simulated. Furthermore, the influence of modelling parameters, e. g. added hydrodynamic masses, is reported.

40|$|Four {{mitochondrial}} mutations {{are known}} to block excision of intron I 1 of the cob gene in S. cerevisiae. The nucleotide sequence alteration of one of them, M 4873, has been determined. It is a deletion of 1 bp in a run of five G's {{at a distance of}} 30 to 34 bp upstream to the 3 ' <b>splice</b> <b>point.</b> Reversion is found to occur by restoration of the run of five G's either by insertion of 1 G (wild type reversion) or by transition A leads to G next to this run of G's (pseudo-wild type reversion). The effect of mutation and reversion on RNA splicing indicates that the run of five G's is of critical importance for intron I 1 excision, possibly in participating in the formation of a splice signal with a helical structure. This presumption is confirmed by the observation that this sequence {{is part of a larger}} sequence of some 80 bp next to the 3 ' <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> which is conserved to some extend in the four mitochondrial introns (bI 1, aI 1, aI 2, aI 5) that survive after excision as circular RNAs.

Such conserved internal elements are the 3 ' splice signals recognized in intron splicing. In the lariat splicing mechanism, the G at the 5 ' end of an intron joins covalently to the last A of a 3 ' splice signal to form a branch point in a splicing intermediate.

40|$|The dual {{host range}} virus HIX has been {{previously}} characterized as an envelope gene recombinant between Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) and an unidentified xenotropic murine leukemia virus. Using long reverse transcripts of Mo-MuLV, a region of nonhomology has been mapped by electron microscopic analysis of heteroduplexes formed with HIX 35 S virion RNA. In this nonhomology region, the Mo-MuLV cDNA strand measured approximately 900 nucleotides, mapping between 1. 6 and 2. 5 kilobases from the 3 ′ end. In a previous study, hybridization of Mo-MuLV 21 S RNA with Mo-MuLV cDNA resulted {{in the formation of}} different heteroduplex structures diagnostic of a noncontiguously coded leader sequence at the 5 ′ end of the 21 S RNA.

The site was removed in mutant dl 1061 and altered by fusion to upstream sequences in mutant dl 1062. Analysis of viral RNA showed that dl 1061 and dl 1062 formed only large T-antigen mRNA, whereas bc 1051 did not produce this RNA-species. However, the biological properties of dl 1062 suggested that it also produced mRNA directing the synthesis of a small T-antigen-related polypeptide, at least in low amounts. Only mutant bc 1051 could induce transformation of rat cells. In mouse 3 T 3 cells dl 1062 multiplied to a limited extent, while bc 1051 and dl 1061 failed to produce virus.

40|$|AbstractA T-DNA {{insertion}} mutant of FUSCA 3 (fus 3 -T) in Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits {{several of}} the expected deleterious effects on seed development, but not the formation of brown seeds, a colouration which results from the accumulation of large amounts of anthocyanin. A detailed phenotypic comparison between fus 3 -T and a known <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> mutant (fus 3 - 3) revealed that the seeds from both mutants do not enter dormancy and can be rescued at an immature stage. Without rescue, mature fus 3 - 3 seeds are non-viable, whereas those of fus 3 -T suffer only a slight loss in their germinability. A series of comparisons between the two mutants uncovered differences with respect to conditional lethality, in histological and sub-cellular features, and in the relative amounts of various storage compounds and metabolites present, leading to a further dissection of developmental processes in seeds and a partial reinterpretation of the complex seed phenotype. FUS 3 function is now known to be restricted to the acquisition of embryo-dependent seed dormancy, the determination of cotyledonary cell identity, and the synthesis and accumulation of storage compounds. Based on DNA binding studies, a model is presented which can explain {{the differences between the}} mutant alleles. The fus 3 -T lesion is responsible for loss of function only, while the fus 3 - 3 mutation induces various pleiotropic effects conditioned by a truncation gene product causing severe mis-differentiation...|$|E
40|$|The human {{haploid genome}} {{contains}} {{a family of}} at least five different transglutaminases that are differentially expressed in time- and tissue-specific ways. Of these, transglutaminase 3 (TGase 3) is unusual {{in that it is}} a pro-enzyme requiring activation by proteolysis. To date it is known to be expressed only in terminally differentiating epidermal and hair follicle keratinocytes. In this paper we show that it is encoded by a gene (TGM 3) of 42. 8 kbp containing 13 exons. In the course of isolation of genomic clones for the TGM 3 gene, we also found clones encoding the widely expressed tissue or TGase 2 enzyme, perhaps due to high degrees of sequence homology. The structure of the TGM 2 gene has not yet been reported. Our incomplete data suggest its exon/intron organization is very similar to that of TGM 3. Although the common intron splice points of all members of the transglutaminase gene family have been conserved, the TGM 3 and TGM 2 genes, and the gene for the subplasma membrane transglutaminaselike protein band 4. 2, lack two introns found in the TGM 1 and factor XIIIa genes, and the exact intron <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> of another intron is shifted with respect to that of the TGM 1 and factor XIIIa genes.

40|$|Biochemical {{methods are}} {{presented}} {{for determining the}} structure of spliced RNAs present in cells at low concentrations. Two cytoplasmic spliced viral RNAs were detected in CV- 1 cells during the early phase of simian virus 40 (SV 40) infection. One is 2200 nucleotides in length and is composed of two parts, 330 and 1900 nucleotides, mapping from ∼ 0. 67 to ∼ 0. 60 and from ∼ 0. 54 to ∼ 0. 14, respectively, on the standard viral map. The other is 2500 nucleotides long and also is composed of two parts, 630 and 1900 nucleotides mapping from ∼ 0. 67 to ∼ 0. 54 and from ∼ 0. 54 to ∼ 0. 14, respectively. Correlation {{of the structure of}} these mRNAs with the structure of the early SV 40 proteins, small T antigen (17, 000 daltons) and large T antigen (90, 000 daltons), determined by others suggests that: (i) translation of the 2500 -nucleotide mRNA yields small T antigen; (ii) translation of the 2200 -nucleotide mRNA proceeds through the <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> in the RNA to produce large T antigen (and thus large T antigen is encoded in two separate regions of the viral genome); and (iii) the DNA sequences between ∼ 0. 67 and ∼ 0. 60 present in both mRNAs are translated in the same reading frame in both mRNAs to yield two separate gene products that have the same NH 2 -terminal sequence. Therefore, expression of the early SV 40 genes is partially controlled at the level of splicing of RNAs...|$|E

Whereas srk 2 and srk 3 are c 1 early unrelated at the nucleic acid level, srkl and srk 4 share identical sequences in the 5 ' parts of their cDNAs. The cloning of several primer extension clones and genomic polymerase chain re action experiments confirmed the hypo thesis of an alternative splicing of tandemly arranged carboxyterminal parts of srkl and srk 4. The genomic sequence encoding both proteins was found to be interrupted at the <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> by an intron which is located in the same position as one of the introns in the chicken src gene, which is the only gene conserved in invertebrates and vertebrates. All four srk genes are expressed in adult sponges as mRNA transcripts of about 2. 2 kb.

Genotyping is very valuable since close correlation observed between genotype and phenotype. Objective To identify phenotype and genotype characteristics of CAH due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency (CAH- 21 OH) and correlation between them. Methods From June to November 2006 we analyzed 37 confirmed CAH- 21 OH patients treated at the Department of Child Health, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital during the period of 1990 - 2006. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis or amplification-created restriction site (ACRS) were performed. We first identified deletion/ LGC and I 172 N mutation that had been mostly reported in salt wasting (SW) and simple virilizing (SV) form patients respectively.

The resulting cDNA/RNA hybrids have been inserted at the Pst I site of the plasmid vector pBR 322 after A:T tailing. One recombinant plasmid, pJAW 43, has been characterized in detail and shown to contain sequences from the main body of fiber mRNA, the three leaders common to most late adenoviral mRNAs and a fourth leader found in some species of fiber mRNA. The complete DNA sequence of the leader region has been determined and does not contain the initiation codon AUG, although this codon does occur immediately downstream from the junction between the fourth leader and the main body of the fiber mRNA. The first leader (map coordinate 16. 6) is 41 nucleotides long, the second (from 19. 6) is 71 nucleotides, the third (from 26. 6) is 88 nucleotides and the fourth (from 78. 5) is 181 nucleotides. The location of junctions between viral leaders and intervening sequences has been determined by reference, where possible, to sequences of the adenovirus 2 genome. Although the presence of short repeated sequences at the boundaries of intervening sequences and leaders makes it impossible to locate the <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> unambiguously, all of the leader-intervening sequence junctions can be arranged to stress a common feature [...] the presence of the dinucleotides GT and AG at the 5 ' and 3 ' ends, respectively, of the intervening sequences.

Inhibition of translation by the antibiotics chloramphenicol and spectinomycin also resulted in splicing deficiency. Ribosomal protein S 12, a protein with RNA chaperone activity, and CYT- 18, a protein that stabilizes the three-dimensional structure of group I introns, efficiently rescued the stop codon mutants.

The dislocation optical fiber has two <b>splice</b> <b>points,</b> and we obtained the optimal parameters based on the theory and our experiment, such as the dislocation amount and length of the dislocation optical fiber. According {{to the relationship between}} the temperature and the peak wavelength shift, the temperature of the environment can be obtained. Then, we made this fiber a micro bending as S-shape between the two dislocation points, and the S-shaped micro bending part could release stress with the change in temperature and reduce the effect of stress on the temperature measurement. This structure could solve the problem of sensor distortion caused by the cross response of temperature and stress. We measured the S-shaped dislocation fiber sensor and the dislocation fiber without S-shape under the same environment and conditions, and the S-shaped dislocation fiber had the advantages of the stable reliability and good linearity.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} research program on special concentrically braced frame (SCBF) and buckling-restrained braced frame (BRBF) systems. The study builds upon previous work performed {{as part of}} a research program supported by the George E. Brown Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) entitled "International Hybrid Simulation of Tomorrow's Braced Frame. " This program was initiated due to practical and experimental evidence that SCBFs were not performing as intended by current seismic design provisions. The current study includes a comprehensive experimental and analytical program which included two first-of-its-kind, two-story, one-bay by one-bay SCBF and BRBFs experiments. The experiments were performed at the University of Minnesota NEES laboratory to take advantage of its ability to apply large-displacement bi-directional loading. The two specimens were configured with braces in two orthogonal bays framing into a "shared" column with a floor system designed and constructed to simulate realistic conditions. The first specimen, the SCBF, employed HSS 3 x 3 x 1 / 4 braces in a single-story X-configuration with one continuous brace and a pair of spliced braces in the opposing direction. The second test specimen, the BRBF, employed pin-ended, collared BRBs in a single-diagonal configuration. The analytical study consisted of a large suite of finite element simulations aimed at identifying the main parameters that influence the damage at the beam-column-gusset connection region in BRBFs and to make recommendations for the design and detailing of this connection region. This research has resulted in a number of findings including the observation that out-of-plane loading and deformation had little impact on the drift and ductility capacity of the system when compared to planar frame test results. In fact, the drift capacity of the SCBF test frame was only 6 % less than that of comparable planar frames while the ductility and cumulative ductility capacities of the BRBF exceeded that of many of the planar BRBF system tests.

30|$|Since {{large-scale}} OWFs {{have been}} developed in the last decade, more research works have recently conducted on the optimization of various aspect of OWF. Some studies only found the optimal electrical interconnection configuration to minimize the total trenching length by utilizing analytical methods. Reference [4] addressed different typical power collecting systems and proposed a new single return loop design to improve the reliability and minimize the cables cost. Dutta and Overbye [5] proposed a clustering-based cable design, different from the typical configurations. In a later study [6], the authors proposed various clustering methods to decrease the problem size and find the optimal configuration of each cluster by the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. This study additionally proposed an algorithm to introduce intermediate <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> to minimize the total trenching length of on-shore wind farms. Similar clustering methodology based on the MST algorithm [7, 8] were proposed for OWFs by ignoring intermediate <b>splice</b> <b>point</b> due to very high splicing costs of on subsea cables. Banzo and Ramos [9] proposed a stochastic programming model to find the optimal layout of the electric power system of a real OWF in the UK. A mixed integer programing (MIP) algorithm was used and a minor cost reduction was obtained. Lumbreras and Ramos [10] proposed a similar tool with reasonable computational time to find the optimal electrical layout of OWFs by the MIP algorithm and decomposition strategies. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach was utilized in [11] to minimize the total trenching length of OWFs to find optimal location of offshore substation (OS) and optimal interconnection configuration individually. Nevertheless, none of above papers could include cable dimensions in the objective function to represent a realistic optimization, due to utilizing MST or analytical optimization methods that at least require constant weights for all edges. Reference [12] proposed an improved genetic algorithm (GA) to find optimal location of WTs to minimize the wake effect and then the total trenching length without cable sizing to find optimal electrical interconnection configuration of an OWF in two individual steps. In addition, crossing subsea cables was not avoided, which may increase burying costs or difficulty in practice. On the contrary, recent large-scale OWFs utilizing WTs with higher power rating (≥  5 MW) have created a new challenge to optimize the electrical interconnection layout (interconnection configuration and cable sizing) of the OWFs. Recently, variable cable dimension has also been considered to find the optimal electrical interconnection configuration of OWFs, where metaheuristic algorithms were utilized. Reference [13] proposed a modified approach to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for designing a radial configuration. This study used an improved GA to find the optimal electrical network design of a large-scale OWF, while cable dimensions were considered as a radial configuration without any tapering for cables away from the OS. A binary GA was used in [14] to find the optimal electrical network of an OWF where full cable sizing was considered. However, the optimal layout was found just for the pre-clustered nodes in order to decrease the problem size and power loss as an operational cost is not considered. Hou et al. in [15] proposed an adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO), which adjusts every individual solution to new integer solutions to solve discrete problems. In order to minimize {{the total cost of}} cables, an APSO-MST algorithm was utilized to find the optimal interconnection layout and OS location of an OWF simultaneously. However, the total power losses as well as shipping and burying costs (Csb) of subsea cables were not considered. In [16], the authors also found the optimal interconnection and transmission system of an OWF, where APSO-MST algorithm and C-means clustering method were utilized. In their recent studies [17], the optimal location of OS and optimal topology of WTs location were simultaneously found together with the optimal interconnection layout of real OWFs. The same APSO-MST algorithm was adopted to minimize wake effect and cable cost of the OWF, due to high performance of PSO to solve such continuous problems (finding the optimal locations). However, the project area of the OWFs in case study was considered increasable during the optimization process, which would not yield to fair results. On the contrary, in these studies, finding the optimal electrical interconnection configuration and cable sizing of an OWF are inherently discrete problems. Thereby, the APSO, by adjusting real values to integers, {{may not be the best}} choice, as its performance was decreased to solve such a complex problem. Furthermore, similar [14], crossing subsea cables was avoided so that no crossed edges were considered in MST, which may miss some feasible solutions.|$|E
40|$|A {{refractive}} index sensor based modal interference in hollow core photonic crystal fiber (HCPCF) is proposed and demonstrated. The sensor is realized by splicing {{both ends of}} a HCPCF section to single mode fiber (SMF). At both <b>splicing</b> <b>points,</b> the HCPCF air holes are fully collapsed by the arc discharge. The collapsed regions excite and recombine core and cladding modes which formed modal interference for sensing purpose. The HCPCF sensor is tested in sugar solution and the response is measured from the wavelength shift in the interference spectra. The achieved sensitivity and resolution are 36. 184 nm/RIU and 5. 53 - 10 - 4 RIU, respectively, in {{refractive index}} range between 1. 3330 and 1. 3775. Result also shows that the sensor has a small temperature sensitivity of 19 pm/°C {{in the range of}} 35. 5 °C to 60. 5 °C. The propos sensor potentially can be applied in biomedical, biological and chemical applications...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{enhancements}} to {{the classical}} Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add (WSOLA) algorithm are proposed. As a time-domain approach, it works best for small speed changes and quasi-periodic, monophonic signals. Some of our enhancements are especially effective for small, others for large speed changes. As a consequence, significant improvements for all scaling factors are achieved extending the usability of the new scheme to larger speed changes and more complex signal characteristics. The reduction in computational complexity is analyzed by comparing the number of <b>splice</b> <b>points</b> needed to time-scale the input signal. As will be shown, these are the only points where real signal processing is performed. Therefore, a reduction in their number results in an equivalent decrease in computational demand. Additionally, {{they are also the}} only points where artifacts may arise so that, in many cases, a reduction in their number can serve as an indicator for improvements in the signal quality, too...|$|R
40|$|A DNA {{fragment}} encoding y-glutamylcysteine synthetase [EC 6. 3. 2. 2] of Schizosacchar-omyces pombe was cloned by complementation of the cadmium hypersensitivity of a S. pombe mutant {{deficient in}} the enzyme. Sequence {{analysis of the}} cloned DNA revealed that the enzyme was consisted of 669 amino acid residues and was homologous to the enzymes of human liver, rat kidney, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The deduced amino acid sequence coincides with the amino acid sequences of the proteolytic pep tides obtained from the purified enzyme. A cysteine residue was deduced to be important for catalytic activity by comparing the amino acid sequences of the enzymes of the four species. The gene contains one intron and the <b>splicing</b> <b>point</b> was confirmed by sequencing a cDNA amplified by PCR. Northern blot analysis showed an RNA of 2, 200 bases hybridized with the cloned gene. Key words: active site, y-glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione, sequence homology, Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of seven exons {{of the human}} c-fgr gene, a cellular homolog of the oncogene of Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma virus, was determined. Twenty-six independent genomic clones were obtained from a human gene library with a DNA clone of Y 73 avian sarcoma virus oncogene, v-yes, as a probe under relaxed hybridization conditions. Restriction mapping and partial sequence analyses revealed that two of these clones were derived from the c-fgr gene, distinct from the c-yes gene. Interestingly, the <b>splicing</b> <b>points</b> of the c-fgr gene were identical {{with those of the}} c-src gene throughout the seven exons, suggesting that the two proto-oncogenes were generated by gene duplication of an ancestral gene containing intervening sequences. On RNA blot hybridization the major transcript was found to be 2. 6 kilobase long. Two additional transcripts of 3. 5 and 4. 7 kilobases were also detected. Furthermore, karyotype analysis of several human-mouse hybrid cells and Southern blot analyses of DNAs of the hybrids with a human c-fgr locus-specific probe showed that this gene is located on chromosome 1...|$|R
