5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} maple sugar were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane sugar and {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate the timing and pace of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of those that did exist forced the communists to <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E
5|$|Net-casting spiders weave {{only small}} webs, but then {{manipulate}} them to trap prey. Those {{of the genus}} Hyptiotes and the family Theridiosomatidae <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> webs and then release them when prey strike them, but do not actively move their webs. Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs, hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs, and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their own body length to trap prey, and this move may increase the webs' area {{by a factor of}} up to ten. Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey: backwards strikes to catch flying insects, whose vibrations it detects; and forward strikes to catch ground-walking prey that it sees. These two techniques have also been observed in other deinopids. Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids, but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the backwards strike.|$|E

5|$|The Duke's train had {{run more}} slowly through {{populated}} areas {{owing to the}} cheering crowds, {{and by the time}} it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, Phoenix and North Star, had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling for almost an hour, and the water stop at Parkside was the only scheduled stop on the journey. Although it was beginning to drizzle, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, Charles Arbuthnot, Prince Esterházy, the Earl of Wilton, L founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles {{on either side of the}} railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} combat {{aircraft}} {{had been a}} problem for ONUC. The UN had been delaying the commencement of the operation until sufficient air strength had been amassed to conduct a single attack that could destroy the Katangese Air Force. They feared that a limited attack would fail to eliminate all Katangese aircraft and <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> own forces thin, thereby allowing Katanga to disperse its air forces among hidden airfields and launch retaliatory attacks on Kamina Air Base. India had withdrawn its Canberra bombers in October to guard against China, and Ethiopia repatriated its force of Sabres after one was lost in an accident. However, new air surveillance radar equipment was deployed in Kamina and Élisabethville. The ONUC Air Division was bolstered in November by the delivery of two Saab 29 Tunnan (J-29) reconnaissance-variant jets from Sweden, greatly enhancing the force's intelligence capabilities. This was followed shortly thereafter by the arrival of several J-29 combat aircraft and a 380-strong anti-aircraft unit from Norway. In all, the UN would field 10 combat J-29s in the operation.|$|E
5|$|Hunter's force {{advanced}} {{towards the}} town in a semi-circle formation, composed by the four battalions arranged {{from left to right}} in the following order: the 10th Sudanese, 9th Sudanese, the reduced 3rd Egyptian, and the 11th Sudanese. The artillery battery was with the 3rd Egyptian. The force reached the ridge of the plateau overlooking the town, about three hundred yards away, at a quarter past six. Major-General Hunter, finding the Mahdist garrison prepared for the assault and entrenched in their defenses, ordered the artillery to bombard their positions, which commenced at six-thirty. However, the artillery proved ineffective, as the guns were unable to strike within the narrow trenches or blast aside the cover behind which the Mahdist infantry waited. Hunter ceased the barrage, and ordered Lieutenant MacDonald to lead his brigade in a general advance. The command to fix bayonets was given, and the troops began an orderly advance across the three hundred yards that separated them from their objective. However, facing a line of Mahdist riflemen well-protected in their trenches, the soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders. The uncoordinated volleys of the advancing brigade were moderately effective against the Mahdist riflemen, who had not yet returned fire. When the battalions were about halfway across the three hundred yard <b>stretch,</b> <b>their</b> lines of fire began to converge due to their semi-circle formation, and the 10th Sudanese, on the left, was forced to halt to avoid coming under the fire of the rightmost 11th Sudanese.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a popular}} myth that lemmings commit mass suicide by {{swarming}} off cliffs when they migrate.

In such cases, many may drown if the body of water is so wide as to <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> physical capability to the limit. This fact combined with some unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings gave rise to the myth.|$|E
25|$|Durham played three Championship {{matches in}} June, and {{although}} they missed Paul Collingwood for {{two of them and}} Steve Harmison and Mike Hussey for all three, due to international duties, they won one and drew two to <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> unbeaten run to eight - keeping them 21 points ahead of second-placed Worcestershire when the teams broke off to play Twenty20 cricket. There were also two National League matches - Durham beat Derbyshire to get revenge for the C Trophy loss a month earlier, which gave them a six-point lead, but in the last match before the summer break Sussex Sharks beat them by seven wickets, to close the gap to two points.

Two one-day wins followed, over Kent and the touring Bangladeshis, but on 13 June they posted 82 all out against Durham to lose by five wickets. Derbyshire came ever closer to the elusive Championship win, however, as Lancashire eked through by one wicket in the last match {{before the end of the}} spring season. The final match before Twenty20 set in was a National League game with the Scottish amateurs, and the teams tied that game.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory of}} Nagysalló, brought with itself serious results. It {{opened the way}} towards Komárom, {{bringing}} its relieving to {{just a couple of}} days distance. In the same time it brought the imperials in the situation of being incapable to <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> troops on a very large front which this Hungarian victory created, so instead of uniting their troops around Pest and Buda, as they planned, Feldzeugmeister Welden had to order the retreat from Pest being in danger to fall in the pincers of the Hungarian troops. When he learned about the defeat in the morning of 20 April, he wrote to Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich, the commander of the besieging forces of Komárom, and to Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, the Minister-President of the Austrian Empire, that in order to secure Vienna and Pozsony, from a Hungarian attack, he is forced to retreat the imperial troops from Pest, and even from Komárom. He also wrote that the spirit of the imperial troops is very low, and because of this they cannot fight another battle for a while, without suffering another defeat. So the next day he ordered the evacuation of Pest, leaving an important garrison in the fortress of Buda, to defend it against the Hungarian attacks. He ordered to Jelačić to remain for a while in Pest, and than to retreat towards Eszék in Bácska where the Serbian insurgents, allied with the Austrians were in a grave situation after the victories of the Hungarian armies led by Mór Perczel and Józef Bem.|$|E
25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, linear motion table, stepper motor and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E

Their place in Vác {{was taken by the}} VII. corps under András Gáspár, than after they too departed on the same way, their place in Vác was taken by the division of György Kmety. At 15–17 April the Hungarian army consisting of the I. corps led by General György Klapka, III. corps led by General János Damjanich, and two divisions of the VII. corps led by General András Gáspár arrived to the Garam river, under the overall leadership of General Artúr Görgei. Here, on 19 April, at Nagysalló, they met with the troops of Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth with the new imperial troops gathered in the following Habsburg Hereditary Lands: Styria, Bohemia, Moravia and the capital Vienna, and strengthened with the Jablonowski division (which participated 10 days before in the Battle of Vác). The imperials suffered defeat and retreated towards Érsekújvár. The Hungarian victory of Nagysalló, brought with itself serious results.

Rolling Stones Jean-Charles Costa wrote: [...] "Meddle not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's {{emergence as a}} real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again", and the NME called it [...] "an exceptionally good album". Steve Peterson of Hit Parader cited [...] "Fearless" [...] as its best song and said of the album, [...] "This {{has got to be}} their best ever." [...] Ed Kelleher of Circus called it [...] "another masterpiece by a masterful group", noting [...] "Fearless" [...] as [...] "fascinating" [...] and praising [...] "Echoes" [...] as [...] "a tone poem that allows all four group members much time to <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> muscles".

She concluded that [...] "I feel for the writers, who I honestly believe were forced to <b>stretch</b> <b>their</b> content this season", {{as well as for}} the episode. Nick Campbell of TV.com was unhappy that the episode did not show or comment on Pam and Jim's fight in the previous episode. He felt that the beginning of the dinner scene was nice, due to the two's banter. However, he felt that the end pretended as if they had not discussed the move in any previous episodes. Campbell felt that Odenkirk was used in a good way, but that was [...] "a waste of amazing talent at the real estate office". He also felt that Dwight and Angela's kiss was a good progression for their story.|$|E
