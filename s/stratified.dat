In the quadrangle of Freeland, the surficial geology near Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly features Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact <b>Stratified</b> Drift, and alluvium. The surficial geology near the creek in the Wilkes-Barre West quadrangle mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, with some scattered areas of bedrock and alluvium.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the vicinity}} of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of <b>stratified</b> silt, sand, and gravel, with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains <b>stratified</b> sand and gravel), and urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps and surface mining land (both of which are rich in rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around surficial geology consisting of surface mining land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>STRATIFY</b> {{score is}} a {{clinical}} prediction rule (CPR) derived to assist clinicians to identify patients {{at risk of}} falling. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis {{is to determine the}} overall diagnostic accuracy of the <b>STRATIFY</b> rule across a variety of clinical settings. Methods A literature search was performed to identify all studies that validated the <b>STRATIFY</b> rule. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. A <b>STRATIFY</b> score of ≥ 2 points was used to identify individuals at higher risk of falling. All included studies were combined using a bivariate random effects model to generate pooled sensitivity and specificity of <b>STRATIFY</b> at ≥ 2 points. Heterogeneity was assessed using the variance of logit transformed sensitivity and specificity. Results Seventeen studies were included in our meta-analysis, incorporating 11, 378 patients. At a score ≥ 2 points, the <b>STRATIFY</b> rule is more useful at ruling out falls in those classified as low risk, with a greater pooled sensitivity estimate (0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 52 – 0. 80) than specificity (0. 57, 95 % CI 0. 45 – 0. 69). The sensitivity analysis which examined the performance of the rule in different settings and subgroups also showed broadly comparable results, indicating that the <b>STRATIFY</b> rule performs in a similar manner across a variety of different ‘at risk’ patient groups in different clinical settings. Conclusion This systematic review shows that the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>STRATIFY</b> rule is limited and should not be used in isolation for identifying individuals at high risk of falls in clinical practice. </p...|$|R

The conclusion is that changing the design to <b>stratify</b> on turnover, -sampling and GREG-estimation will provide a smaller standard deviation {{in most of the}} energy domains...|$|R
5|$|In {{its lower}} reaches, the {{surficial}} geology {{in the vicinity}} of Shickshinny Creek consists of urban land highly disrupted by cut and fill, alluvium, alluvial terrace, fill, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact <b>Stratified</b> Drift containing <b>stratified</b> sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta containing sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till (a glaicial or resedimented till containing boulders, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The bedrock mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the surficial geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Outwash and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, and some lakes. However, there is a patch of alluvial fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: to {{investigate}} the predictive validity and reliability of the <b>STRATIFY</b> falls risk assessment tool as applied to patients recovering from acute stroke. Design: prospective cohort study. Setting: six stroke rehabilitation units in the North of England. Subjects: all patients with a diagnosis of acute stroke admitted to the participating stroke units during a 6 -month study period. Assessment: on admission, falls risk (<b>STRATIFY),</b> disability (Barthel index), mobility (Rivermead mobility index), cognitive impairment (abbreviated mental test score) and visual neglect (Albert’s test) were assessed. Then, <b>STRATIFY</b> was completed weekly and within 48 h of anticipated discharge. Consenting patients were contacted at 3 months after discharge to deter-mine falls. Outcome measures: occurrence of a fall within 28 days of the baseline <b>STRATIFY</b> (in-patient study), falls in the first 3 months after discharge (post-discharge study) and falls during stroke unit stay (reliability study). Results: from 387 patients admitted to the participating units during the study period, 225 contributed to the 28 day in-patient study, and 234 were followed up at 3 months after discharge. <b>STRATIFY</b> performed poorly in predicting falls in th...|$|R

5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for <b>stratified</b> sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

5|$|Social {{stratification}} is {{the hierarchical}} arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to {{cultural and economic}} classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in <b>stratified</b> societies.|$|E

5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized <b>stratified</b> squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
5|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of Lastarria rocks, {{like those}} of other volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone, involves the prolonged interaction with crustal rocks in magma chambers {{as well as the}} fractionation of certain minerals.

5|$|An English {{cultural}} identity first {{emerged from the}} interaction of the Germanic immigrants of the 5th and 6th centuries and the indigenous Romano-British inhabitants. Although early medieval chroniclers described the immigrants as Angles and Saxons, they came from a much wider area across Northern Europe, and represented a range of different ethnic groups. Over the 6th century, however, these different groups began to coalesce into <b>stratified</b> societies across England, roughly corresponding to the later Angle and Saxon kingdoms recorded by Bede in the 8th century.
