40|$|<b>Sensitivity</b> limits <b>of</b> {{ground-based}} infrared interferometers using aperture synthesis are presented. <b>The</b> motivation <b>of</b> {{this analysis}} is to compare an interferometer composed of multiple large telescopes and a single giant telescope with adaptive optics. In deriving these limits, perfect wavefront correction by adaptive optics and perfect cophasing by fringe tracking are assumed. We consider the case in which n beams are pairwise combined at n(n − 1) / 2 detectors (n C 2 interferometer) and the case {{in which all the}} n beams are combined at a single detector (n Cn interferometer). Our analysis covers broadband observations by considering spectral dispersion of interference fringes. In the read noise limit, the n Cn interferometer with one dimensional baseline configuration is superior to the n C 2 interferometer, while in the background limit, <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one-dimensional n Cn interferometer is small. As a case study, we compare <b>the</b> point-source <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> interferometers composed of nine 10 -m diameter telescopes and a 30 -m diameter single telescope with adaptive optics between 1 and 10 µm for 10 -σ detection in one hour. At J and H, <b>the</b> <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interferometers are limited to 25 to 24 mag by read noise and OH airglow background, while that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single telescope is limited to 28 to 26 mag by OH airglow background.
