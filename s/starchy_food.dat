60|$|For example, can you {{honestly}} pretend {{that you really}} understand the use and importance of that valuable object of everyday demand, fustic? I remember an ill-used telegraph clerk in a tropical colony once complaining to me that English cable operators were so disgracefully ignorant about this important staple as invariably to substitute for its name the word 'justice' in all telegrams which originally referred to it. Have you any clear and definite notions as to the prime origin and final destination of a thing called jute, in whose sole manufacture the whole great and flourishing town of Dundee lives and moves and has its being? What is turmeric? Whence do we obtain vanilla? How many commercial products are yielded by the orchids? How many totally distinct plants in different countries afford the totally distinct starches lumped together in grocers' lists under the absurd name of arrowroot? When you ask for sago do you really see that you get it? and how many entirely different objects described as sago are known to commerce? Define the uses of partridge canes and cohune oil. What objects are generally manufactured from tucum? Would it surprise you to learn that English door-handles are commonly made out of coquilla nuts? that your wife's buttons are turned from the indurated fruit of the Tagua palm? and that the knobs of umbrellas grew originally in the remote depths of Guatemalan forests? Are you aware that a plant called manioc supplies the <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> of about one-half the population of tropical America? These are the sort of inquiries with which a new edition of 'Mangnall's Questions' {{would have to be}} filled; and as to answering them--why, even the pupil-teachers in a London Board School (who represent, I suppose, the highest attainable level of human knowledge) would often find themselves completely nonplussed. The fact is, tropical trade has opened out so rapidly and so wonderfully that nobody knows much about the chief articles of tropical growth; we go on using them in an uninquiring spirit of childlike faith, much as the Jamaica negroes go on using articles of European manufacture about whose origin they are so ridiculously ignorant that one young woman once asked me whether it was really true that cotton handkerchiefs were dug up out of the ground over in England. Some dim confusion between coal or iron and Manchester piece-goods seemed to have taken firm possession of her infantile imagination.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a very}} rich, high {{cholesterol}} and fatty food; the consumers normally eat some <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> {{in the form of}} mealie pap or toasted bread with the skilpadjies, so as not to attract some symptoms of over-indulgence.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use of asparaginases is as a {{processing}} {{aid in the}} manufacture of food. Marketed under the brand names Acrylaway and PreventASe, asparaginases are used as a food processing aid to reduce the formation of acrylamide, a suspected carcinogen, in <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> products such as snacks and biscuits.|$|E

50|$|Baking, {{grilling}} or broiling <b>food,</b> especially <b>starchy</b> <b>foods,</b> until a toasted {{crust is}} formed generates significant concentrations of acrylamide, a known carcinogen from animal studies; {{its potential to}} cause cancer in humans at normal exposures is uncertain. Public health authorities recommend reducing the risk by avoiding overly browning <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> or meats when frying, baking, toasting or roasting them.|$|R
50|$|In <b>starchy</b> <b>foods,</b> {{low-temperature}} frying {{gives the}} starch {{in the food}} a chance to migrate and carmelize, producing a sweeter outcome.|$|R
5000|$|Sago palm is {{a common}} name for several plants which are used to produce a <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> known as sago. Sago palms may be [...] "true palms" [...] in the family Arecaceae, or cycads with a palm like appearance. Sago {{produced}} from cyads must be detoxified before consumption. Plants called sago palm include: ...|$|E
50|$|Fufu, as well {{as other}} <b>starchy</b> <b>food,</b> is eaten in a great number of African countries, {{especially}} by the Akuapem, the Guans the Asante, the Akyem, the Bono and the Fante peoples of the Akan ethnic group of Ghana the ewes of Togo and the Ivory Coast. It features in Togolese cuisine Guinean cuisine, Cameroonian cuisine, {{as well as}} Nigerian cuisine.|$|E
5000|$|Dental abscess-- A {{dental abscess}} is a {{collection}} of pus that accumulates in teeth or gums as a result of bacterial infection giving rise to a severe throbbing pain {{at the site of the}} abscess. It is caused by consuming sugary or <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> and poor dental hygiene and is treated by a dentist draining the pus and possibly removing an infected tooth.|$|E
50|$|As a food {{processing}} aid, asparaginases can effectively reduce {{the level of}} acrylamide up to 90% {{in a range of}} <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> without changing the taste and appearance of the end product.|$|R
2500|$|In 2016 the UK Food Standards Agency {{launched}} a campaign called [...] "Go for Gold" [...] warning of the possible cancer risk associated with cooking potatoes and other <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> at high temperatures.|$|R
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of acrylamide in some cooked <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> in 2002 prompted {{concerns about the}} carcinogenicity of those foods. [...] {{it is still not}} clear whether acrylamide consumption affects people's risk of developing cancer.|$|R
5000|$|Grains, {{beans and}} legumes, {{sometimes}} categorized as cereals, {{is often the}} largest category in nutrition guides. Examples include wheat, rice, oats, barley, bread and pasta. An example of beans would be baked beans and soy beans, while an example of legumes would be lentils and chickpeas. Grains are {{a good source of}} starch and are often categorized with other <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> such as potatoes.|$|E
50|$|Encephalartos is a genus of cycad {{native to}} Africa. Several species of Encephalartos are {{commonly}} referred to as bread trees, bread palms or kaffir bread, since a bread-like <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> can be prepared from the centre of the stem. The genus name is derived from the Greek words en (within), kephali (head), and artos (bread), referring {{to the use of the}} pith to make food. They are, in evolutionary terms, some of the most primitive living gymnosperms.|$|E
50|$|Moderation is advised {{with regard}} to {{consuming}} alcohol and using some drugs. Alcohol inhibits glycogenesis in the liver and some drugs inhibit hunger symptoms. This, with impaired judgment, memory and concentration caused by some drugs can lead to hypoglycemia. People with diabetes who take insulin or tablets such as sulphonylureas should not, therefore, consume alcohol {{on an empty stomach}} but take some <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> (such as bread or potato crisps) {{at the same time as}} consumption of alcohol.|$|E
50|$|The {{consolidation}} {{phase is}} designed to help in preventing any future massive weight gain. During this phase, fruit, bread, cheese and <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> are reintroduced into a normal diet, leaving two celebratory meals a week as directed by the plan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{consumer}} advice {{statements of the}} NHS regarding low-carbohydrate diets state that: [...] "eating a high-fat diet could increase {{your risk of heart}} disease" [...] and advises: [...] "try to ensure <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> make up about a third of your diet".|$|R
50|$|Acrylamide {{is often}} {{formed in the}} cooking of <b>starchy</b> <b>foods.</b> During heating the amino acid asparagine, {{naturally}} present in <b>starchy</b> <b>foods,</b> undergoes a process called the Maillard reaction, {{which is responsible for}} giving baked or fried foods their brown color, crust, and toasted flavor. Suspected carcinogens such as acrylamide and some heterocyclic amines are also generated in the Maillard reaction. By adding asparaginase before baking or frying the food, asparagine is converted into another common amino acid, aspartic acid, and ammonium. As a result, asparagine cannot take part in the Maillard reaction, and therefore the formation of acrylamide is significantly reduced. Complete acrylamide removal is probably not possible due to other, minor asparagine-independent formation pathways.|$|R
50|$|A haystack (of food) is a dish {{composed}} of a <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> (Fritos, tortilla chips, rice, or saltine crackers), topped by a protein (beans, grated cheddar cheese, taco-seasoned meat, and/or a vegetarian meat alternative), in combination with fresh vegetables (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, olives, peppers), and garnished with various condiments (guacamole, sour cream, Ranch or Italian dressing, ketchup and/or salsa). Haystacks are conceptually like a deconstructed tostada. The haystacks ingredients are served individually and assembled on the plate by the person who will be eating it.|$|E
50|$|The {{nutritional}} {{component of}} rice {{is one of}} the most important indicators of quality; rice is predominantly a <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> though it also contributes useful quantities of proteins and vitamins, mineral, pentosans and fiber. The chemical composition (nutrients) of rice grain varies considerably depends on factors like plant variety (breeds), environmental condition (i.e. location and season in which grown), fertilizer treatment, degree of milling, and condition of storage. The degree of milling and cooking methods loss significant quantities of nutrients, hence most of the vitamins and minerals are in the surface layers.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{method is to}} boil <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> crops like cassava, yams or plantains and cocoyams and then pound them into a dough-like consistency. Fufu is eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce. Foods made in this manner are known by different names in different places. Among the Baule and other Akan groups in Cote d'Ivoire, it is known as sakora; among the Dagombas of Northern Ghana as sakoro; and as couscous (couscous de Cameroun) in the French-speaking regions of Cameroon (not {{to be confused with}} the North African dish couscous).|$|E
40|$|Nutritional {{classification}} of dietary saccharides considers as indigestible saccharides {{those that are}} incompletely or not absorbed in small intestine. Resistant starch (RS) {{as a part of}} dietary fibre (DF) is a type of indigestible saccharide. The addition of natural RS from some fruits, legumes or cereals to commonly eaten <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> is a good alternative to increase the DF intake representing, at the same time, new uses for uncommon sources of DF. This review deals with RS contents of commonly consumed <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> and shows their potential health-beneficial properties in situations where glucose tolerance is impaired, such as diabetes mellitus or obesity. For example, the current daily intake (193 g per day, fresh basis) of maize-tortilla in Mexico represents 1. 8 g RS. However, tortilla prepared by blending maize with flaxseed (20 %) exhibits a notably higher RS content (8. 5 g per day). These staple foods added with natural RS sources show low or moderate in vitro starch hydrolysis rates and predicted glycaemic indices. Current nutritional and technological trends include the development of new formulas for traditionally consumed products. The combination of <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> with high RS content and/or the addition of natural RS sources to common food products could help to reach this objective...|$|R
50|$|The basic {{ingredients}} are plantains and cassava. Fufu-like <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> (usually made from fermented cassava roots) are served with grilled meat and sauces. A variety of local {{ingredients are}} used while preparing other dishes like spinach stew cooked with tomato, peppers, chillis, onions, and peanut butter.|$|R
50|$|Gentle frying or {{low-temperature}} frying is an oil- or fat-based {{cooking method}} used for relatively fragile or <b>starchy</b> <b>foods.</b> While gentle frying is most notably used to cook fried eggs, {{it is also}} used for delicate fish, tender cuts of meat, sausages, and {{as a first step}} in fried potatoes.|$|R
50|$|The {{screw pine}} {{has been shown}} to have many uses. In coastal areas, it has been used for erosion control due to its {{numerous}} aerial roots. These roots help bind the sand dunes along the coast from eroding water and wind. The leaves of P. utilis are used in different cultures for thatching and the production of numerous materials. In areas like Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius, the leaves are used to make ropes, baskets, mats, hats, place mats, nets, thatched roofs for homes and even paper. The waxy covering over the leaves makes them especially attractive for baskets and roofs with their natural water-resistant surface. The fruits form a <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> and can be eaten after being cooked.|$|E
50|$|When Pinckney reached London, {{winter was}} approaching. Without a work permit, the only jobs {{she could get}} were hard manual labour. She would shovel coal and snow for eight hours for little more than $3 a day. And with no central heating in her {{apartment}} she would eat digestive biscuits with jam and copious amounts of <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> to insulate her body in fat. To keep herself warm and awake whilst working she would get through 40 cups of heavily sugared tea each day. When Pinckney left the US she weighed 105 lb. Within {{a few months of}} reaching London her weight had pushed up to 129 lb. With her petite frame and at a height of only 5’1” her body was really starting to suffer.|$|E
50|$|A 2012 study across Asian American subgroups in Southern California (Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese Americans) {{found that}} Filipino Americans {{self-reported}} the highest body mass indexes (BMIs). This is because after {{the migration of}} Filipinos to the U.S. their diets changed and showed to have increase in energy-dense food, processed food, decrease in fruits, vegetables, etc. This seems to have has a negative affect on the body leading to increase body weight and other health-related problems. Specifically in Filipino American diets, {{there was an increase}} in milk, meat consumption, less <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> and snacks. This increase in eating by Filipinos has led to an increase in the calorie intake. This increase was almost doubled and along with it was a double in protein consumption and triple consumption of fat.|$|E

50|$|There are two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, {{that are}} {{important}} in appetite control. Leptin, released by adipose tissue, is a hormone that inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure. Ghrelin, released from the stomach, is a hormone that increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. Sleep deprivation can cause a 19% decrease in the level of leptin. Subjects were deprived of sleep for 2 nights (4 hours per night) and got compensation of sleep for the next 2 nights (10 hours per night). Leptin levels decreased by 18% and ghrelin levels increased by 28%. There was an increase in hunger level by 23 which is probably due to the reduction leptin level. Subjects also preferred high carbohydrate foods (sweets, salty food and <b>starchy</b> <b>food).</b> Craving for salty food increased by 45%. Sleep deprivation can cause people to intake food for emotional/psychological need rather than caloric need of the body.|$|E
50|$|Dr Lisa Matisoo-Smith and Dr Michael Knapp from New Zealand's Otago University have {{released}} {{the results of}} a recent bone and teeth DNA study carried out on early Polynesian migrants to New Zealand who lived at Wairau Bar about 1285-1300 AD. The results of DNA analysis reinforce the idea that some these people were original settlers from East Polynesia, as they had a very different diet based on soft <b>starchy</b> <b>food.</b> The two other burial groups showed a very different, more varied diet consistent with being raised in New Zealand. Scientists found that there was a wide range of DNA mutations indicating that settlers were part of a reasonably large group. This indicate a planned migration rather than isolated random groups. One of the mutations was associated with insulin rejection as found in type 2 diabetes This reinforces the mathematical modelling done in the past that shows the same pattern. Work will now begin on tracing East Polynesian populations that have the same DNA mutations in order to discover the specific homelands of the Wairau Bar settlers. The DNA pattern is very similar to that found in the Marquesas Islands in East Polynesia at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, human {{epidemiological}} analysis by Richard Doll and Richard Peto indicated that smoking caused 30% of cancers in the US. [...] Diet is also thought {{to cause a}} significant number of cancer, and {{it has been estimated that}} around 32% of cancer deaths may be avoidable by modification to the diet. [...] Mutagens identified in food include mycotoxins from food contaminated with fungal growths, such as aflatoxins which may be present in contaminated peanuts and corn; heterocyclic amines generated in meat when cooked at high temperature; PAHs in charred meat and smoked fish, as well as in oils, fats, bread, and cereal; and nitrosamines generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon (ascobate, which is added to cured meat, however, reduces nitrosamine formation). [...] Overly-browned <b>starchy</b> <b>food</b> such as bread, biscuits and potatoes can generate acrylamide, a chemical shown to cause cancer in animal studies. Excessive alcohol consumption has also been linked to cancer; the possible mechanisms for its carcinogenicity include formation of the possible mutagen acetaldehyde, and the induction of the cytochrome P450 system which is known to produce mutagenic compounds from promutagens.|$|E
25|$|Patients with CFS {{benefit from}} a {{well-balanced}} diet and eating regularly (eating little and often), including slow-release <b>starchy</b> <b>foods</b> in meals and snacks. Although elimination diets are not generally recommended, many people experience relief of CFS symptoms with these diets, including gastrointestinal complaints. To avoid the risk of malnutrition, they should be supervised by a dietitian.|$|R

40|$|Starch is {{the major}} {{component}} of cereal grains and <b>starchy</b> <b>foods,</b> and changes in its biophysical and biochemical properties (e. g., amylose, amylopectin, pasting, gelatinization, viscosity) will have a direct effect on its end use properties (e. g., bread, malt, polymers). The use of rapid and non-destructive methods to study and monitor starch properties, such as gelatinization, retrogradation, water absorption in cereals and <b>starchy</b> <b>foods,</b> is of great interest {{in order to improve}} and assess their quality. In recent years, near infrared reflectance (NIR) and mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy have been explored to predict several quality parameters, such as those generated by instrumental methods commonly used in routine analysis like the rapid visco analyser (RVA) or viscometers. In this review, applications of both NIR and MIR spectroscopy to measure and monitor starch biochemical (amylose, amylopectin, starch) and biophysical properties (e. g., pasting properties) will be presented and discussed...|$|R
