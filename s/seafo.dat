50|$|<b>SEAFO</b> {{recognizes the}} need to {{cooperate}} with coastal States and all other States and Organisations having a real interest in the fishery resources of the South East Atlantic Ocean. At regional level, <b>SEAFO</b> and Angola, Namibia, South Africa and UK’s overseas territories {{in the region are}} working closely to ensure compatibility of conservation and management measures adopted for straddling fish stocks on the high seas and in areas of national jurisdiction. <b>SEAFO</b> has strong link with the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme (BCLME) and the Benguela Current Commission (BCC) and shares information on the fisheries and the environment.|$|E
50|$|The Commission is {{the highest}} {{decision-making}} body of the Organisation and it meets annually to among others, formulate fisheries conservation and management measures, review compliance issues and adopt the budget. Decision on matters of substance, within <b>SEAFO</b> is taken by consensus among the Parties. There is also a provision for non acceptance of a decision by a Contracting Party. Budgetary contributions {{are made up of}} an equal basic fee and a fee determined from the total catch of species covered by the Convention. <b>SEAFO</b> allows States and regional economic integration organizations to become parties to the Convention and encourages cooperation with non-Parties. Compliance with monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) is one of the criteria for consideration in determining {{the nature and extent of}} participatory rights in <b>SEAFO</b> fishing opportunities. <b>SEAFO</b> Convention foresees the creation of a robust system of observation, inspection, compliance and enforcement that includes control measures linked to flag State duties and port State duties as well as at-sea and in port inspection, boarding and inspection of vessels on a reciprocal basis, observer programs and procedures to follow up on infringements. For transparency and openness, <b>SEAFO</b> accords accessibility of observers to its meetings and to its documents. <b>SEAFO</b> Scientific Committee provides scientific advice to the Commission on the conservation and management issues such as the status of the resources and the harvesting levels. Subsidiary bodies may be established by the Commission, as needs arise, from time-to-time. The day-to-day work of the Organisation is coordinated, administered and overseen by the Secretariat, based in Swakopmund, Namibia.|$|E
30|$|Giving <b>SEAFO’s</b> {{environmental}} awareness {{in term of}} long-term conservation of aquatic resources {{for the well-being of}} future generations, the question that arises is how sustainable the changes in meat consumption patterns across these countries are. Unlike previous studies that have looked at impacts of MPAs on human nutrition and health (see Gjertsen 2005; Aswani and Furusawa 2007), household income and economic vulnerability (see McClanahan 2010; Weigel et al. 2015), on household food security variables on meat consumption. This is an attempt to examine the social and economic effects of environmental conservation projects as they are manifested in MPAs.|$|R

50|$|Complex {{negotiations}} between the coastal States and the DWFN started in 1997 and were completed in 2000 with the adoption of <b>SEAFO</b> Convention. <b>SEAFO</b> Convention is largely based on 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement (UNFSA) and is internationally hailed as the most contemporary, responsive instrument for conservation and sustainable utilisation of living marine resources in high seas. The Convention was signed on 20 April 2001 in Windhoek by Angola, the European Community, Iceland, Namibia, Norway, Republic of Korea, South Africa, United Kingdom (on behalf of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Islands) and the United States of America. It entered into force on 13 April 2003 after the deposit of instruments of ratification by Namibia and Norway and approval by the European Community. Angola deposited its instrument of ratification on 7 March 2006, making it a 4th Contracting Party of <b>SEAFO.</b> The {{role played by the}} developing coastal States in the drafting of <b>SEAFO</b> Convention was extensive.|$|E

50|$|The South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (<b>SEAFO)</b> is an {{organization}} that maintains controls over fishing and fishing related acts in the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|At {{international}} level, <b>SEAFO</b> has {{working relationships}} with various regional fisheries management organisations, notably North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), Commission for the Conservation of the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NAFO) and the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Cooperation with these organisations is centred on {{the exchange of}} experiences on all matters of mutual interests, including on sharing of data on by-catch species and information on compliance matters such as on IUU fishing activities. <b>SEAFO</b> is {{working closely with the}} United Nations in particular with FAO and with the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea (DOALOS) aiming at strengthening high seas fisheries governance.|$|E

50|$|<b>SEAFO</b> is an {{intergovernmental}} regional {{fisheries management}} organisation responsible for ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable {{use of the}} fishery resources (excluding migratory fish stocks) in the high seas of southeast Atlantic Ocean, within the Convention Area. The <b>SEAFO</b> Convention Area is situated in the southeast Atlantic region, outside the exclusive economic zones of the coastal states of Angola, Namibia, South Africa and United Kingdom’s overseas territory of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Island. It covers an area of about 16 million square kilometres. The idea to establish <b>SEAFO</b> came from Namibia in 1995 because of the concern that certain commercially valuable straddling fish stocks required better protection to avoid compromising their potential in Namibian waters {{as a result of}} unsustainable fishing practices on the adjacent high seas. The idea was welcomed and greatly supported by the coastal neighbours of Angola, South Africa and United Kingdom (on behalf of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Islands) and by DWFN's of EU, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and United States - all of which have history of fishing or demonstrated real interest in the fisheries in the area.|$|E
50|$|To {{assist in}} {{maintaining}} or increasing its population, {{it has been}} placed on CMS Appendix II, and ACAP Annex1. Gough Island has been designated as a World Heritage Site. Antipodes Island has had preliminary work done to start long term monitoring, and in 2007 the monitoring started. In 2001, brown rats were eradicated from Campbell Island, and in 2006, <b>SEAFO</b> tightened longline fishing regulations.|$|E
50|$|Living marine {{resources}} covered by <b>SEAFO</b> including fish (such as orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus, alfonsino Beryx splendens, Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, hake Merluccius paradoxus, horse mackerel Trachurus capensis, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, cardinalfishes Epigonus species, oreo dories and armourhead Pseudopentaceros species, some shark species and rays), molluscs (such as octopus and squid) and crustaceans (such as {{deep sea red crab}} Chaceon maritae). Some {{of the most}} notable commercially important species are orange roughy, alfonsino - harvested by bottom trawling, and deep sea red crab - capture by pots or traps and Patagonian toothfish caught by longlining. Highly migratory fish stocks such as tuna, swordfish, marlin and sharks in the region are covered by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Most of <b>SEAFO</b> fish resources are found in deep waters (greater than 500 m depth) and tend to be slow grower, long-lived, late-matured and therefore could be vulnerable to over-exploitation. Their biological and ecological dynamics are not well known and there are no good historic time series.|$|E
50|$|<b>SEAFO</b> Convention {{provides}} {{fundamental principles}} that govern {{conservation and management}} of living marine resources under SEAFO's jurisdiction. Fisheries management {{is based on the}} best available scientific evidence, and where scientific information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate, the precautionary approach principle prevails, until such time when more information is known about the resources dynamics, ecosystem structures and functions. The general principles encompass the concept of ecosystem approach to fisheries management. In particular conservation and protection of species that belong to the same ecosystem as, or are associated with or dependent upon the harvested fishery resources (e.g., seabirds, cetaceans, seals and marine turtle)s are given emphasis. In addition the general principles call for the minimization of harmful impacts on all living marine resources and protection of marine environment and its biodiversity.|$|E
5000|$|Predating the Independence of Namibia in 1990, the International Commission for South East Atlantic Fisheries (ICSEAF) was {{responsible}} for the management of the fisheries in the region both in the exclusive economic zones of Angola, Namibia and South Africa and in the adjacent water of the high seas. ICSEAF Convention came into force in 1971, with the [...] located in Madrid, Spain and was established mainly in response to increased levels of exploitation of newly discovered rich fishing grounds off the Namibian coast by the fleet of Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs). ICSEAF failed its mandate largely because Contracting Parties did not comply with the conservation and management measures they adopted and that the Commission lacked effective compliance and enforcement mechanisms. Fishing efforts increased rapidly during the 1960s and throughout the 1970s and 1980s on targeted species such as hake, horse mackerel and pilchards off Namibia and horse mackerels (Trachurus capensis and T. trecae) and sardinellas (Sardinella aurita and S. maderensis) in southern Angolan waters. For example, in 1965 about 193,000 tonnes of hake were caught mainly off Namibia and by 1972, a peak of 820,000 tonnes was recorded, followed by a declining trend to about 338,000 tonnes landed by 1988. At Independence in 1990, the new government of Namibia proclaimed through the Act of Parliament a 200 nmi km EEZ and the jurisdiction over the fisheries within the zone. The organisation became inoperative following Namibia's refusal to join it. Meanwhile, the high seas fisheries of the southeast Atlantic were left without a managing body. With new mandate and direction, <b>SEAFO</b> replaced ICSEAF.|$|E
40|$|The <b>SEAFO</b> coral and sponge taxa {{guide was}} {{developed}} by the Spanish Oceanography Institute (lEO) and the Marine Science Faculty at the University of Vigo (Galicia, Spain). This is a simple pictorial guide to corals and sponges for use by sea-going observers in the <b>SEAFO</b> Convention Area (CA). The aim is to enable observers to identify general types of corals and sponges as it is rarely possible at sea to identify specimens to the species level (this often requires microscopic analysis ashore). The guide is a first edition and will be improved on the basis of feedback from observers and also as more information on corals and sponges becomes available in the <b>SEAFO</b> Convention Area...|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} the {{previous}} studies, meat consumption tends to increase with trade and urbanisation and to decrease with health information. More interestingly, the coefficient of the MPA is positive and significant, confirming an increase in substitution of meat eating to seafood by <b>SEAFO</b> member countries as MPA increases to help preserve aquatic resources. Every unit increase in the protected area is found to increase the per capita meat consumption by 1 % across these countries. Consequently, with the greenhouse gas emission associated with rising meat production and consumption, the safeguard of the marine asset only might not be sustainable for <b>SEAFO</b> in achieving its goal {{to protect the environment}} and marine ecosystems. Beyond the protection of marine area, <b>SEAFO</b> management might consider restricting meat eating by promoting consumption of unthreatened seafood species by its member countries.|$|E
30|$|Meat {{demand is}} complex, multi-faceted, and {{constantly}} evolving as new and important demand drivers develop {{over time in}} response to new information (Tonsor, Mintert and Schroeder 2010). Besides considerable changes observed in food habits, health information and environmental concerns have been recently advocated as important drivers of food demand. And this may alter the structure of empirical demand estimates. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the dynamics of <b>SEAFO</b> countries’ meat consumption in relation to their economic performance under the fishing restriction. This is an attempt to shed light on the adaptive capacity of <b>SEAFO</b> countries to cope with protein demand.|$|E
40|$|Acrobat document, 2 {{tables and}} 7 Figures. 13 pagesAt the South-East Atlantic, {{fisheries}} resources have been commercially explored {{by a large}} international fleet fishing mostly in the Namibian waters. The Spanish and the former Soviet Union have been the predominant distant fleet working at the continental shelf and their activities were managed until 1990 by the International Commission for the South-East Atlantic Fisheries (ICSEAF). Historically, the following countries {{are known to have}} been fishing in the current <b>SEAFO</b> Convention Area. Spain, Portugal, Russia, Cyprus, Mauritius, Japan, Korea, Poland, Norway, South Africa and Namibia, but {{the quality and quantity of}} data available remain poor (<b>SEAFO,</b> 2008). Thus, the main activities of some of these fleets occur on the continental shelf (EEZ) and sporadically they explored adjacent seamounts, sometime on the route between fishing grounds or as a target activity. This paper intends to stress the importance of bottom fishing footprint as a method to understand the extent of the areas fished up to date in the <b>SEAFO</b> region. For this exercise some available data from the Spanish and Portuguese fleets were used...|$|E
30|$|While seafood is {{considered}} as a more environmentally-friendly alternative to red meat consumption, the major objective of the <b>SEAFO</b> is the conservation and management of straddling and high seas stocks in the South East Atlantic. Thus, increasing meat production and consumption could be {{considered as a}} solution to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources in SEAFO’s area of competence. However, with the negative impact of meat consumption on the environment and health which are not conducive to economic growth, a better understanding of what the trade-offs are in terms of balancing seafood as opposed to meat production and consumption is required to assess the environmental sustainability of the <b>SEAFO</b> member countries.|$|E
40|$|The cruise is a {{contribution}} to <b>SEAFO</b> resulting from a co-operation between <b>SEAFO,</b> the EAF-Nansen project, and the FAO Deep-sea programme. The aim is to facilitate activities {{in support of the}} efforts by RFMOs to meet objectives in relation to the United Nations General Asssembly (UNGA) resolution 61 / 105 and the associated FAO Guidelines on Bottom Fisheries in the high seas. Furthermore, the southeastern Atlantic ABNJ was selected by the recently initiated GEF-sponsored FAO ABNJ programme (“Common Oceans”) as an area of particular attention, involving the relevant RFMO with competent to regulate bottom fishing in that region is the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries Organization (<b>SEAFO).</b> Despite a shortage of data on the occurrence of ‘vulnerable marine ecosystems’ (VMEs, as defined in the FAO Guidelines), <b>SEAFO</b> has introduced comprehensive measures to protect such ecosystems from significant adverse impacts within the convention area. The convention area consist of agreed limited ‘existing fishing areas’, i. e. areas were fisheries were conducted within a recent reference period, and more extensive ‘new fishing areas’ where this was not the case. Commercial harvesting is essentially restricted to the ‘existing fishing areas’, but further regulated by other measures such as species-specific TACs, gear restrictions and other measures aimed to conserve e. g. sharks. To conduct exploratory fisheries in ‘new fishing areas’ parties need to submit a notification and detailed plan and report to the Organization for approval. <b>SEAFO</b> has furthermore closed 10 subareas of the convention area to all fishing activity, a regulation most recently revised in 2011. Best available bathymetry data were compiled to locate subareas recognised in the FAO guidelines as VME features, essentially primarily seamounts. As fishing is restricted to the upper 2000 m of any feature, a map of areas shallower than 2000 m was the basis of further selection. In <b>SEAFO</b> such areas are seamounts or seamount complexes of various sizes and shapes. The spatial distribution of VME indicators such as corals and sponges (i. e. as given in FAO guidelines) is not well known in <b>SEAFO,</b> but the benthic and pelagic biogeographical patterns have been described. It was therefore decided to close 10 potential fishing areas that represented the range of features and the major biogeographical zones of the region. Some of these were actual fishing areas; others were either not fished or lightly fished. The end result was the set of ten closures with various shapes and sizes, ranging from single seamounts to rather wider areas comprising several seamounts or mid-Atlantic Ridge segments. While <b>SEAFO</b> took significant steps to ensure conservation of VMEs, the shortage of information on the distribution patterns of VME indicators remains unsatisfactory. Some new data were acquired by recent fishing experiments in existing and new fishing areas, and by Spanish-Namibian research activity on the Valdivia Bank. However, even within the relatively restricted actual fishing areas, the documentation remains scattered and limited. Similarly, the Scientific Committee of <b>SEAFO</b> struggles with data shortage on the fish resources actually harvested in the convention area, primarily Patagonian toothfish, pelagic armourhead, alfonsino, deep-sea red crab, and associated bycatch species. Stock assessments are generally highly uncertain and fully dependant on fisheries-generated data, hence conservation measures implemented by <b>SEAFO</b> remain largely precautionary rather than tuned to good estimates of abundances and productivity. Catches currently remain rather limited, i. e. collectively less than 1000 t, but some species are valuable and tend to attract interest from fishing parties that would value not only enhanced opportunities but also management based on more reliable stock assessments. This project thus aims to supplement and extend knowledge and databases on VME indicators as well as fisheries resources and will accordingly conduct targeted investigations in the currently used fishing areas of the convention area, primarily on the Walvis Ridge. In addition, some of the fishing closures will be visited to document presence-absence of VME indicators and describe distribution patterns. New data from these targeted studies will enhance the quality of fish stock assessments and help analyse the appropriateness of VME closures currently implemented solely based on feature characteristics and biogeographical affinity. Main conclusions: VMEs indicators were located in all seamounts prospected but differences in structure and development state were observed. In some seamounts coral rubble, sediment-clogged, mostly dead coral framework and living coral framework were observed from the base to the summit all along the slope. Current system associated to each seamount, depth and probably other depth-dependent environmental factors driven the presence and development of deep-water reefs. Continuous research efforts are needed to increase knowledge about biodiversity and structure. Understanding their dynamics will improve effective management and conservation of this vulnerable ecosystems. FAO, EAF-Nansen project / Deep-sea Norway projec...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, <b>SEAFO</b> {{management}} {{might want}} to adjust its long-term conservation strategy to achieve environmental sustainability. On one hand, further development of the livestock sector in ways that maximises on its positive effects while controlling the negative impacts could contribute to increasing levels of nutrition, improving agricultural productivity, improving {{the lives of the}} rural poor FAO (2010), and to fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2016 – 2030.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a need for {{countries}} to diversify the source of proteins; seafood being the primary alternative to meat consumption. In Western diets, fish consumption is lower than red meat consumption and this fact can influence on total diet quality (Alegria-Lertxundi et al., 2014). According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the period 1960 to 2003 saw a 420 % and 200 % rise in meat and seafood, respectively against a decline of only 15 % in red meat consumption. Despite the significant increase in fish consumption, it is still not at the desired levels. For instance, an average fish production per capita in Asian countries is 50  kg and only 25  kg per annum for the European Union countries (Sayin et al., 2010; Koç et al., 2009; Akbay, 2005). The development of MPA as is the case in <b>SEAFO</b> countries may hinder attainment of desired seafood levels. It might therefore be efficient for <b>SEAFO</b> management to restrict the consumption of red meat by promoting consumption of unthreatened seafood species by its member countries.|$|E
30|$|Livestock {{production}} and consumption of meat are significant contributors to today’s most serious environmental problems and global warming. This paper investigates the role of marine reserves in shaping meat consumption pattern across member countries of the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (<b>SEAFO)</b> for the period 1990 to 2009. Using a panel data including economic factors, life expectancy and environmental awareness, we find that meat consumption is positively associated {{with the presence of}} marine protected areas (MPAs). This suggests a possible increase in substitution of meat eating to seafood by <b>SEAFO</b> member countries due to aquatic resources conservation. Marine resource conservation policy is not a complementary strategy for sustainable livestock policy. This points out to some necessary policy improvements and actions to ameliorate the relationship between MPA and the negative environmental impacts of livestock. Furthermore, economic factors appear to have {{played a significant role in}} explaining meat consumption growth. Apart from price inflation, the most relevant factors that positively influence meat consumption appear to be GDP, exports and imports of agricultural products, and urbanisation. Beyond economic factors, negative health information associated with meat consumption appear to lead to a reduction in the consumed quantities of meat. There is evidence that meat-eating behaviour is not only related to macroeconomic development but also to environmental awareness.|$|E
40|$|The {{criteria}} {{adopted by}} the <b>SEAFO</b> Commission {{for the establishment of}} a fishing footprint, “if an area has been fished in two consecutive years during the period 1987 - 2007 ”, is considered not a good starting point for any rigorous analysis of the historical spatial effort in the region because of losing valuable data and the difficulties on its application. Spanish data consisting in 1191 records of haul by haul (August 1996 - November 2006) were analyzed using a protocol developed by New Zealand at SPRFMO to study trawl footprints in this region. The use of 20 ’x 20 ’ blocks method clearly overestimate the footprint. Thus, 10 ’ gridding fits better fishing footprint area. However, at any case more than one point (e. g., midpoint) has to be used to define a set/haul position. Longlining is the fishing activity more widely spread out with 144 blocks (8. 79 %) of which 67 % “lightly fished”; and 33 % “moderately fished”. However, bottom trawl tend to concentrate its activity in small areas as Valdivia Bank and the North-East of the Walvis Ridge, with 5 “heavily fished” blocks (0. 31 %). A general vision of current and recent past situation of fisheries in the <b>SEAFO</b> region was also mad...|$|E
30|$|For the {{empirical}} assessment, variables {{have been transformed}} in their logarithm forms. This eases the interpretation; allowing coefficients estimates to be interpreted in terms of elasticities. Pairwise correlation coefficients obtained from the transformed variables across <b>SEAFO</b> countries are presented in Table 1, panel B. Meat consumption appears to be strongly correlated with real GDP, urbanisation, MPA and life expectancy (with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.6). Similar pattern emerges from Fig. 1 where {{there seems to be}} a converging trend between per capita real GDP and meat consumption.|$|E
40|$|A {{proposal}} to compile {{the best available}} information {{of the most important}} <b>SEAFO</b> species about: i) the biology, ecology, productivity, vulnerability and population dynamics of the main species; ii) fisheries data; iii) factors or events affecting both the species and their environment; and iv) the evolution of their fisheries in the regional management area, to be used in assessment models, management advice and ecosystem modelling. This proposal includes a species profile template (Annex I) which contains explanatory text to help to complete it, and two incomplete species profiles (Annex II) as an example...|$|E
30|$|The price {{elasticity}} {{on the other}} hand is positive in the first model suggesting that meat is a Giffen good across <b>SEAFO</b> countries. Accounting for the level of development, we find that {{price elasticity}} in developed countries is negative and significant as expected from theoretical predictions. In developing countries, however, the price elasticity remains positive and significant. This is unsurprising as meat in developing countries is generally affordable either to households in relatively high-income categories with switching tendency to more meat eating because of improving diet or to subsistence farmers who have easy access to live stock products.|$|E
30|$|This is {{particularly}} critical for member {{countries of the}} South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (<b>SEAFO)</b> given their primary aim of safe-guarding the long-term conservation and sustainability of all marine resources in the South East Atlantic Ocean and protecting the environment and marine ecosystems. Maldonado and del Pilar Moreno-Sánchez (2014) argue that the expansion of marine protected areas (MPA) is a key prevailing management strategy to stop the degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems. However, the effectiveness of MPAs is affected not only by ecological factors but also by social ones. According to Leverington et al. (2010) only 24 % of all protected areas globally are managed ‘soundly’. These figures raise fundamental questions {{about the number of}} MPAs that are achieving their ecological targets or potential. Furthermore, many of the potential ecological benefits of MPAs are threatened by broader environmental conditions and extreme events (Keller et al. 2009).|$|E
