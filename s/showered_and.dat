25|$|Police checked {{incoming}} train {{records and}} believed {{the man had}} arrived at the Adelaide railway station by overnight train from either Melbourne, Sydney or Port Augusta. They speculated he had <b>showered</b> <b>and</b> shaved at the adjacent City Baths (there was no Baths ticket on his body) before returning to the train station to purchase a ticket for the 10:50a.m. train to Henley Beach, which, for whatever reason, he missed or did not catch. He immediately checked his suitcase at the station cloak room before leaving the station and catching a city bus to Glenelg. Although named the City Baths, the centre was not a public bathing facility but a public swimming pool. The railway station bathing facilities were adjacent to the station cloak room, which itself was adjacent to the station's southern exit onto North Terrace. The City Baths on King William St. were accessed from the station's northern exit via a lane way. There is no record of the station's bathroom facilities being unavailable on the day he arrived.|$|E

Both were avid athletes; Lazarus played on the school's junior varsity women's basketball team. She would steal his clothes when he <b>showered</b> <b>and</b> take naked photographs of him while he slept. While the two frequently had sexual relations, Ruetten never considered the relationship as anything more than [...] "necking and fooling around".

Housing was in short supply, so between 1949 and 1953 an estimated 5,500 men lived, studied, ate, <b>showered,</b> <b>and</b> attended classes at the Annex on the former Bryan Air Force Base, which was deactivated in May 1961.

6000|$|There {{was much}} need in Homeric warfare for {{protection}} against heavy showers of arrows. Mr. Monro is hardly correct {{when he says}} that, in Homer, [...] "we do not hear of BODIES of archers, of arrows darkening the air, as in descriptions of oriental warfare." [...] [Footnote: Ibid., vol. ii. 305.] These precise phrases are not used by Homer; but, nevertheless, arrows are flying thick in his battle pieces. The effects are not often noticed, because, in Homer, helmet, shield, corslet, zoster, and greaves, as a rule prevent the shafts from harming the well-born, well-armed chiefs; the nameless host, however, fall frequently. When Hector came forward for a parley (Iliad, III. 79), the Achaens [...] "kept shooting at him with arrows," [...] which he took unconcernedly. Teucer shoots nine men in Iliad, VIII. 297-304. In XI. 85 the shafts ([Greek: belea]) <b>showered</b> <b>and</b> the common soldiers fell--[misprint] being arrows as well as thrown spears. [Footnote: Iliad, IV. 465; XVI. 668, 678.] Agamemnon and Achilles are as likely, they say, {{to be hit by}} arrow as by spear (XI. 191; XXI. 13). Machaon is wounded by an arrow. Patroclus meets Eurypylus limping, with an arrow in his thigh--archer unknown. [Footnote: Iliad, XI. 809, 810.] Meriones, though an Achaean paladin, sends a bronze-headed arrow through the body of Harpalion (XIII. 650). The light-armed Locrians are all bowmen and slingers (XIII. 716). Acamas taunts the Argives as [...] "bowmen" [...] (XIV. 479). [...] "The war-cry rose on both sides, and the arrows leaped from the bowstrings" [...] (XV. 313). Manifestly the arrows are always on the wing, hence the need for the huge Homeric and Mycenaean shields. Therefore, as the Achaeans in Homer wore but flimsy corslets (this we are going to prove), the great body- covering shield of the Mycenaean prime did not go out of vogue in Homer's time, when bronze had superseded stone arrow-heads, but was strengthened by bronze plating over the leather. In a later age the bow was more and more neglected in Greek warfare, and consequently large shields went out, after the close of the Mycenaean age, and round parrying bucklers came into use.|$|E

50|$|<b>Showers</b> <b>and</b> {{thunderstorms}} along thunderstorm trains usually {{develop in}} one area of stationary instability, and are advanced along a single path by prevailing winds.

The same process repeats in the new storms, until overall conditions in the surrounding atmosphere become too stable for support of thunderstorm activity. <b>Showers</b> <b>and</b> storms can also develop along stationary fronts, and winds move them down the front.

6000|$|So the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an Irishman, and his wife, {{and several}} children, from the broad-faced boy who {{assisted}} {{his father at}} his work, and now came running by his side from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like, cone-headed infant that sat upon its father's knee as in the palaces of nobles, and looked out from its home {{in the midst of}} wet and hunger inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not knowing but it was the last of a noble line, and the hope and cynosure of the world, instead of John Field's poor starveling brat. There we sat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while it <b>showered</b> <b>and</b> thundered without. I had sat there many times of old before the ship was built that floated his family to America. An honest, hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife, she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and bare breast, still thinking to improve her condition one day; with the never absent mop in one hand, and yet no effects of it visible anywhere. The chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked about the room like members of the family, too humanized, methought, to roast well. They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked [...] "bogging" [...] for a neighboring farmer, turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre {{and the use of the}} land with manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at his father's side the while, not knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience, telling him that he was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was getting my living like himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardly cost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two build himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor milk, nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them; again, as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me but a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter, and milk, and beef, he had to work hard to pay for them, and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his system--and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was long, for he was discontented and wasted his life into the bargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to America, that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only true America is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where the state does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the use of such things. For I purposely talked to him as if he were a philosopher, or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild state, if that were the consequence of men's beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study history to find out what is best for his own culture. But alas! the culture of an Irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort of moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he required thick boots and stout clothing, which yet were soon soiled and worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost not half so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman (which, however, was not the case), and in an hour or two, without labor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as I should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week. If he and his family would live simply, they might all go a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved a sigh at this, and his wife stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead reckoning to them, and they saw not clearly how to make their port so; therefore I suppose they still take life bravely, after their fashion, face to face, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive columns with any fine entering wedge, and rout it in detail;--thinking to deal with it roughly, as one should handle a thistle. But they fight at an overwhelming disadvantage--living, John Field, alas! without arithmetic, and failing so.|$|E
