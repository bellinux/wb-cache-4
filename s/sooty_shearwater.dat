5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwater</b> as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwater</b> chicks.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids {{undertake}} long annual migrations in the non-breeding season. Southern {{species of}} shearwater {{such as the}} <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwater</b> and short-tailed shearwater, breeding on islands off Australia, New Zealand and Chile, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to the waters off Alaska and back each year during the austral winter. Manx shearwaters from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to the waters off Brazil in the South Atlantic. The mechanisms of navigation are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown {{that they are able}} to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. A Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200mi).|$|E

5|$|While Hesperornis is {{not thought}} to have left descendants, the {{earliest}} modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called Tytthostonyx glauconiticus, which seems allied to the Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes. In the Paleogene the seas were dominated by early Procellariidae, giant penguins and two extinct families, the Pelagornithidae and the Plotopteridae (a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins). Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene, although the genus Puffinus (which includes today's Manx shearwater and <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwater)</b> might {{date back to the}} Oligocene. The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. At the end of the latter, the oceanic food web had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.|$|E
500|$|Like many birds, seabirds often migrate {{after the}} {{breeding}} season. Of these, the trip {{taken by the}} Arctic tern is the farthest of any bird, crossing the equator in order to spend the Austral summer in Antarctica. Other species also undertake trans-equatorial trips, both from the north to the south, and from south to north. The population of elegant terns, which nest off Baja California, splits after the breeding season with some birds travelling north to the Central Coast of California and some travelling {{as far south as}} Peru and Chile to feed in the Humboldt Current.

500|$|Many of the shearwaters in {{the genus}} Puffinus are {{proficient}} divers. While {{it has long}} been known that they regularly dive from the surface to pursue prey, using both their wings and feet for propulsion, the depth that they are able to dive to was not appreciated (or anticipated) until scientists began to deploy maximum-depth recorders on foraging birds. Studies of both long-distance migrants such as the <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwater</b> and more sedentary species such as the black-vented shearwater have shown maximum diving depths of [...] and [...] Tropical shearwaters, such as the wedge-tailed shearwater and the Audubon's shearwater, also dive in order to hunt, making the shearwaters the only tropical seabirds capable of exploiting that ecological niche (all other tropical seabirds feed close to the surface). Many other species of procellariid, from white-chinned petrels to slender-billed prions, dive to a couple of metres below the surface, though not as proficiently or as frequently as the shearwaters.|$|E
50|$|Among the fauna {{that may}} be {{observed}} are yellow-eyed penguins, little penguins, spotted shags, <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> fur seals, and Hector's dolphins. Flora observed include nikau palm, kahikatea, and tree ferns.|$|R
5000|$|Many are long-distance migrants, {{perhaps most}} spectacularly <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> which cover {{distances}} {{in excess of}} 14000 km from their breeding colony on the Falkland Islands (52°S 60°W) to as far as 70° north latitude in the North Atlantic Ocean off northern Norway.

2500|$|There {{are many}} species of birds on Stewart Island/Rakiura that {{have been able to}} {{continue}} to thrive because of the relative absence of the cats, rats, stoats, ferrets, weasels and other predators that humans brought to the main islands.

The birds of Stewart Island include weka, kākā, albatross, the flightless Stewart Island kiwi, silvereyes, fantails, and kererū. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin has a significant number of breeding sites here [...] while the large colonies of sooty shearwaters on the offshore Muttonbird Islands, are subject to muttonbirding, a sustainable harvesting program managed by Rakiura Māori. Meanwhile, a small population of the kakapo, a flightless parrot which is very close to extinction, was found on Stewart Island in 1977 and the birds subsequently moved to smaller islands (Codfish Island) for protection from feral cats.

40|$|International audienceBreeding <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwaters</b> Puffinus griseus cycle between long (11 to 14 d) {{and short}} (1 to 2 d) {{foraging}} bouts at sea, but no information exists on bird behavior during these trips. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} shearwaters use these long trips to travel to distant Antarctic waters compared to remaining in local waters. Patterns of habitat use of 28 breeding <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwaters</b> were studied using 6 g archival data loggers that recorded location, environmental temperature, and diving behavior. Dive activity was compared to remotely-sensed environmental data to characterize the habitats visited by shearwaters on long and short trips. <b>Sooty</b> <b>shearwaters</b> traveled predominantly (70 % of all long trips) to cold oceanic waters along the Polar Front (mean ± SD, 1970 ± 930 km from colony) on long trips or remained within warmer neritic waters of the New Zealand shelf (515 ± 248 km from colony) on short trips. Diving depths (mean depth 15. 9 ± 10. 8 m, max depth 69. 9 m, n = 2007 dives) {{were not significantly different}} between excursion types. Activity patterns suggest that shearwaters commuted between distant foraging grounds (e. g. Polar Front) and the breeding colony and that more than 95 % of diving activity occurred during daylight hours. Although shearwaters traveled primarily to Antarctic waters on long trips, occasional trips around New Zealand waters were observed; all but 2 birds were from the northern-most study colony. Oceanic habitats in Antarctic waters were substantially different from neritic habitats around New Zealand, indicating that shearwaters experience dramatically different environmental conditions associated with each excursion type. The ability of <b>sooty</b> <b>shearwaters</b> to use 2 vastly different habitats provides greater flexibility for maximizing resource acquisition during breeding and reduces competition near the colony...|$|R
