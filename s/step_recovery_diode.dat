50|$|Microwave {{generators}} may use a <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> {{impulse generator}} {{followed by a}} tunable YIG filter. The YIG filter has a yttrium iron garnet sphere that is tuned with a magnetic field. The <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> impulse generator is driven at a subharmonic of the desired output frequency. An electromagnet then tunes the YIG filter to select the desired harmonic.|$|E
5000|$|Pulse {{generators}} {{capable of}} generating pulses with widths under approximately 100 picoseconds are often termed as [...] "microwave pulsers" [...] and typically generate these ultra-short pulses using <b>Step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> (SRD) or Nonlinear Transmission Line (NLTL) methods (for example http://amsacta.cib.unibo.it/archive/00001623/01/GAAS_98_081.pdf). <b>Step</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Diode</b> pulse generators are inexpensive but typically require several volts of input drive level {{and have a}} moderately high level of random jitter (usually undesirable variation in the time at which successive pulses occur).|$|E

25|$|The {{reverse current}} ceases {{abruptly}} when the stored charge is depleted; this abrupt stop is exploited in <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diodes</b> for generation of extremely short pulses.|$|R
50|$|When diodes {{switch from}} forward {{conduction}} to reverse cut-off, a reverse current flows briefly as stored charge is removed. It is the abruptness with which this reverse current ceases which characterises the <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{example in}} other areas of {{electronics}} is the generation of pulses where the rise time need to be short; one {{way to do this is}} to start with a slower-rising pulse, and decrease the rise time, for example with a <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> circuit.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, a <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> (SRD) is a {{semiconductor}} {{junction diode}} having {{the ability to}} generate extremely short pulses.

50|$|YIG {{multipliers}} often want {{to select}} an arbitrary harmonic, so {{they use a}} stateful distortion circuit that converts the input sine wave into an approximate impulse train. The ideal (but impractical) impulse train generates {{an infinite number of}} (weak) harmonics. In practice, an impulse train generated by a monostable circuit will have many usable harmonics. YIG multipliers using <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diodes</b> may, for example, take an input frequency of 1 to 2 GHz and produce outputs up to 18 GHz. Sometimes the frequency multiplier circuit will adjust the width of the impulses to improve conversion efficiency for a specific harmonic.|$|R
40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{pulse generator}} with two complementary outputs has been realized in a SiGe bipolar technology. Both ultra-short output pulses (with different polarity) are well approximated by a Gaussian function and show a width t p of about 50 ps and an amplitude of 3. 4 V, {{resulting in an}} amplitude at the differential output of 6. 8 V. Such short pulses are essential in sub-sampling TDR systems as t p limits the bandwidth and thus {{the resolution of the}} measurement applications. The monolithically integrated pulse generator presented here shows substantial performance improvement compared to already existing solutions, mostly based on <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diodes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Drift <b>Step</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Diode</b> (DSRD) was {{discovered}} by Russian scientists in 1981 (Grekhov et al., 1981). The principle of the DSRD operation {{is similar to the}} SRD, with one essential difference - the forward pumping current should be pulsed, not continuous, because drift diodes function with slow carriers.|$|E
5000|$|One classic {{design for}} a {{harmonic}} mixer uses a <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> (SRD). The mixer's subharmonic input is first amplified to a power level that might be around 1 watt. That signal then drives a <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> impulse generator circuit that turns the sine wave into something approximating an impulse train. The resulting impulse train has the harmonics of the input sine wave present to a high frequency (such as 18 GHz). The impulse train can then be used with a diode mixer (also called a sampler).The SRD usually has a very high frequency multiplication ratio, {{and can be used}} as the basis of a comb receiver, monitoring several harmonically related frequencies at once. This forms the basis of many simple 'bug detectors' where the intention is to detect transmission on any frequency, even if not known in advance. (This {{is not the same as}} a 'rake' receiver which is a correlation device.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{figure on}} the right shows a typical pulse {{generated}} by gain-switching with a sinusoidal injection current at 250 MHz producing a pulse of approximately 50 ps. The carrier density is depleted during the pulse, and subsequently rises due to continued current injection, producing a smaller secondary pulse. If the injection current is rapidly switched off at the proper time, for example using a <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> circuit, a single 50 ps light pulse can be generated.|$|E

The modulator provides nano-second length pulses into a 50 Ω load, i. e. a strip line kicker. The rise and fall time of the kicker is primarily determined by the switching characteristic of the DSRD and has been measured as approximately 1. 5 ns with a 5 kV output voltage.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1998 / Town & Country Resort Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaA Phase Modulator {{combining}} digital techniques with non-traditional analog circuitry can {{minimize the}} shortcomings of a traditional (purely analog) Phase Modulator. These shortcomings are: nonlinear response from input modulating signal to output modulated signal; parameters (frequency and modulation index) {{that are difficult to}} set; and the need for complex filters. The design approach discussed in this paper uses a combination of Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) and analog devices operating in their linear range to generate a Phase Modulated RF (140 MHz) signal. A Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO) digitally generates the first IF yielding a very accurate, repeatable and linear signal with easily adjustable parameters such as frequency and modulation index. Linear multipliers (instead of saturated <b>diode</b> mixers or <b>step</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>diodes)</b> are used for up-conversion to RF.

40|$|In this thesis, a new {{digitally}} tunable UWB {{pulse generator}} for an impulse type of pulse generator is developed. The pulse generator is {{realized with a}} low cost simple circuitry by using <b>Step</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Diode</b> (SRD), PIN diodes and microstrip transmission lines which are employed in the many basic UWB pulse generation circuits. During the pulse generation process, the generator initially generates sharp edges by using a <b>Step</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Diode</b> (SRD) from an applied low frequency input sinusoidal signal, and then the sharp edges are converted into short pulses with desired durations by utilizing parallel short-circuited stub with variable lengths. These variable length stubs are acquired by PIN Diodes and microstrip transmission line sub-sections. By adjusting the lengths of the microstrip transmission line, variable duration UWB pulses can be obtained. Also by controlling stub with the N sub-sections digitally, 2 N variable duration UWB pulses can be obtained that is a significant improvement in UWB pulse generation. The digitally tunable UWB pulse generator has been designed, implemented during the studies by using microstrip line technology and yielded reasonable performance. Typical pulse durations varying from 550 to 1750 psec and from 900 to 2500 psec have been obtained experimentally for 2 -bit and 4 -bit pulse generator, respectively.
