5|$|Enrico Fermi {{and a team}} of {{scientists}} at the University of Rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934. Fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938. The <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> actually a mixture of barium, krypton, and other elements, but this was not known at the time. Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.|$|E
5|$|F. On November 18, 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that Rashid Ramzi of Bahrain {{had been stripped}} of {{the gold medal in}} the men's 1500 m race. Ramzi had been the first athlete from Bahrain to win an Olympic gold medal. His frozen blood <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> re-tested and found to contain traces of Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), a stamina-building blood-booster. Kenyan Asbel Kipruto Kiprop was upgraded to gold, Nicholas Willis of New Zealand was given the silver and Mehdi Baala of France received the bronze.|$|E
5|$|For example, when {{comparing}} the imaginary {{part of the}} refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15km and 18km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300nm. Here, the 18km (k {{was found to be}} around 0.009) <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> much more absorbent than the 15km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).|$|E
30|$|As {{part of the}} study, {{groundwater}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} different areas. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> randomly taken from whole area of newly installed pumps to investigate the different water quality parameters in the groundwater. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken in 500  ml bottles. The 60 water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected in total from the groundwater. After {{the collection of the}} <b>samples,</b> the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> preserved and analyzed in the laboratory.|$|R
30|$|Millions of {{clinical}} <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> collected {{every day for}} use in diagnostic tests that support clinical decision making. The majority {{of clinical}} routine <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> discarded but {{it is estimated that}} over one billion clinical <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> stored in biobanks worldwide [3]. The preservation of these <b>samples</b> <b>is</b> an important undertaking since each <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> unique and has the potential to facilitate future research and diagnostics.|$|R
30|$|Twenty <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from different sandstone sources (Missouri sandstone, Roubidoux sandstone, and Berea sandstone). The length (L) of all <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> 1.5 in. (3.7  cm) and the diameter (d) of all <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> 1.5 in. (3.7  cm). To {{make sure that}} the dimensions of all <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> exact, a caliper was used to measure the core length and diameter. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed in an oven at 120  °C for 24  h. After that, the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> evacuated and then saturated to 100  % with brines of chosen concentrations.|$|R
5|$|Just {{over one}} gram of {{berkelium}} has been {{produced in the}} United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> used to synthesize the new element tennessine {{for the first time}} in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Lacks {{was treated}} with radium tube inserts as an {{inpatient}} and discharged {{a few days later}} with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks's cervix without her permission or knowledge; one <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous. These samples were given to George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, a commonly used cell line in contemporary biomedical research.|$|E
5|$|Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity {{in a sample of}} potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element russium after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa, and he did not pursue the element further.|$|E
30|$|Twenty-six {{brown algae}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} during October and November, 2014. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from the}} fringing reefs area with transect at c. 50  m and depth {{in the range of}} 50 – 150  cm. Four species including Turbinaria sp., Sargassum sp., Cystoseira sp. and Padina sp. <b>were</b> identified. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> stored in polyethylene bottles until transferring to laboratory. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> then flushed by seawater that was collected from the relevant locations. The soft parts in algae <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> separated and oven-dried at 105  °C. Dried <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> crushed to fine powder for treatment.|$|R
30|$|In Oman, <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from 4 governorates: Musandam, Batinah North, Dakhilya, and Dhahira (Fig.  6). At least 15 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} 5 farms in each governorate. Lime leaf <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> also collected from 6 farms in Al-Ain (UAE) in March 2013. In addition, <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from Hormozgan and Kerman (Iran) (Fig.  6). At least 20 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from each country. All <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> labeled {{and transferred to}} Plant Pathology Research Laboratory, Sultan Qaboos University, where they were stored at − 80  °C until used.|$|R
30|$|Plasma and serum <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{obtained}} from arterial blood samples {{taken from the}} indwelling arterial catheter. Blood <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes at 10 °C and then <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> frozen at - 80 °C until analysis. Urine <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected and frozen at - 80 °C until analysis.|$|R
5|$|The red-hued {{heartwood}} is coarse-grained and soft. It {{is sometimes}} used for turning, but requires careful drying before use to avoid warping. A <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> prepared in Victoria in 1885 {{as part of}} a collection of local timber species under the direction of Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. The collection was displayed in various exhibitions, including the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, and is housed at the Melbourne Museum.|$|E
5|$|The stones {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (one foot) in width, and 0.1 metres (4 inches) thick. The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, a <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E
30|$|At 4 tile {{drainage}} (TD) and 5 river sites (Ri), <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken weekly or biweekly from March to July 2013. A total of 40 {{tile drainage}} and 63 river <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed. At each site and on every sampling date, {{the volume of}} diatom <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> determined and <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> filtered through a 20 -µm plankton net. The retained organisms were transferred into 50 -mL glass bottles and fixed in 5 ‰ non-acetic Lugol’s iodine solution [42]. After 48  h, the supernatant liquid of undisturbed <b>samples</b> <b>is</b> carefully removed and <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> thus concentrated to 30  mL for further processing.|$|R
30|$|<b>Sampling</b> <b>was</b> {{done during}} two periods in April/May 2014 (on-set of rainy season) and November/December 2014 (on-set of dry season) {{from the various}} {{locations}} indicated above. Depth integrated water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected over bridges and preserved at about pH 2 with conc. HNO 3, whilst sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected through coring with a PVC tube. Two water and sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken from each location. The fish <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected using dragnet and stored in an ice chest at 4  °C and transported to the laboratory. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> later identified in the laboratory and prepared for analysis.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{contaminated}} pistachio <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{prepared in}} closed package. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed before treatment. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed between the electrodes and then {{exposed to the}} plasma at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18  min. After plasma exposure, the treated <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> transferred for fungal analysis, each treatment was repeated thrice.|$|R
5|$|While free on bail, Vick tested {{positive}} for marijuana in a random drug test. This {{was a violation of}} the conditions of his release while awaiting sentencing in federal court. Vick's positive urine <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> submitted on September 13, 2007, according to a document filed by a federal probation officer on September 26. As a result, Hudson ordered Vick confined to his Hampton, Virginia home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. with electronic monitoring until his court hearing date in December. He was ordered to submit to random drug testing.|$|E
5|$|After an oil {{drilling}} operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took {{them back to the}} University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, an Italian {{research}} company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, {{began an}} organized {{effort to find}} anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius, which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound {{at about the same}} time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} six and half years, 862 {{different}} clinical samples [sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, thorax puncture, cerebrospinal fluid and skin samples] were tested by Gen-probe amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD) or ligase chain reaction (LCR) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 239 parallel clinical <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> cultivated, and some <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> stained with Ziehl-Neelsen staining. 1 - 4 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> tested per patient. 29 (12. 13 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive and 177 (74. 05 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> negative with both cultivation and molecular genetic methods. 2 (0. 83 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive only on cultivation, and 31 (12. 97 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive only with the molecular diagnostic methods. The differences are undoubtedly explained by {{the sensitivity of the}} molecular diagnostic methods...|$|R

50|$|The main {{difference}} between cluster sampling and stratified <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> that in cluster <b>sampling</b> the cluster <b>is</b> treated as the sampling unit so <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> {{done on a}} population of clusters (at least in the first stage). In stratified <b>sampling,</b> the <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> done on elements within each strata. In stratified sampling, a random <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> drawn {{from each of the}} strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters <b>are</b> <b>sampled.</b> A common motivation of cluster <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. This contrasts with stratified sampling where the motivation is to increase precision.|$|R
