50|$|Plenum {{supply air}} {{temperature}} rise is the increase of the conditioned air due to convective heat gain as it travels through the underfloor supply plenum from the plenum inlet to the floor diffusers. This phenomenon is also named thermal decay. Plenum air temperature rise is caused by cool supply air coming into contact with warmer than air concrete slab and raised floor. According to a modeling study, air temperature rise can be quite significant (as much as 5 °C or 9 °F) and subsequently, compared to an idealized simulated UFAD case with no air temperature rise, elevated diffuser air temperatures can lead to higher <b>supply</b> <b>airflow</b> rate and increased fan and chiller energy consumption. The same study found that air temperature rise in summer is higher than in winter and it also depends on the climate. The ground floor with a slab on grade has less temperature rise compared to middle and top floors, and an increase of the {{supply air temperature}} causes {{a decrease in the}} temperature rise. The temperature rise is not significantly affected by the perimeter zone orientation, the internal heat gain and the window-to-wall ratio. Supply plenum air temperature rise, thus, has implications on the energy saving potential of UFAD systems and their ability to meet cooling requirements with supply temperatures above those of conventional overhead systems. Current research suggests that both energy and thermal performance can be improved in UFAD systems by ducting air to perimeter zones where loads tend to be the greatest. Critics suggest however that such underfloor ducting reduces the benefit of having a low-pressure plenum space, as well as adding design and installation complications when fitting ducts between floor tile pedestals.|$|E

In addition, the fixed-bleed inlet offers more operating-control margin at supersonic Mach numbers when the inlet is started. Further, its off-design performance is higher because separation of the flow in the subsonic diffuser can be avoided - something that apparently cannot be done with a traveling-bleed inlet without reducing the transonic <b>airflow</b> <b>supply.</b> Finally, it appears that the management and efficiency of bleed airflow for the fixed-bleed inlet can be improved using analytical methods verified by the tests...|$|R

A productivity cost related to the outdoor <b>supply</b> <b>airflow</b> rate and the indoor temperature according to the recent studies was assumed.

The new ventilation technique studied through this project is used by the so-called FtX ventilation systems, whose main difference comparing to FTX ones is that the <b>supply</b> <b>airflow</b> rate is reduced. This reduction of the <b>supply</b> <b>airflow</b> rate is simulated by means of commercial software called IDA Indoor Climate and Energy, which provides the energy consumption in the dwelling so as the temperature in the building and the different airflows. Firstly, the model of the house is built in IDA taking into account the regulations established by the Swedish Building Code and the materials and size of a typical construction in Scandinavian region. The building is located in Bromma, near Stockholm. The reason to situate the building in this place is that IDA ́s database contains the meteorological data registered in this location during a whole year, so yearly simulations can be carried out using real meteorological data. After simulating every model, results are gathered and compared. On the one hand, an energy study is carried out for a whole year {{in order to determine the}} optimal quotient between the <b>supply</b> <b>airflow</b> rate and the exhaust airflow rate which minimizes the energy consumption. This study indicates that when the <b>supply</b> <b>airflow</b> rate is 0. 95 times the exhaust airflow rate, the energy consumed by the building is minimal. On the other hand, an economical study is done. To calculate the economical cost of the energy purchased by the building, the tariffs of a company which sells district heating and electricity in Stockholm are used. Considering these data and the energy consumption for the whole year, it is calculated the economical cost in each case. The optimal ventilation rate, in monetary terms, is (Qs/Qe) ≅ 0. 9.

Corridor <b>supply</b> <b>airflows</b> usually {{did not meet}} design flows. 2. Makeup air paths for suite exhaust were not properly designed. 3. Suite access door leakage was highly variable and usually did not meet smoke control requirements. 4. Airflow from the corridor through the suite access door leakage {{appeared to be the}} primary ventilation air supply for suites. 5. Suites were usually well-ventilated, but some were marginally- or under-ventilated. 6. Poor pressure control often allowed transfer air from one suite to another. Inter-suite transfer air fractions ranged from 0 to 45 %, with an average of 19 %. In summary, this work showed suite ventilation can be highly influenced by corridor supply flows, by the treatment of corridor access doors, and by transfer airflows. As a result, suite ventilation at any given time in current mid- and high-rise residential buildings is very difficult to predict.

The model was tested against experimental droplet dispersion data obtained in an experimental hospital ward using Interferometric Mie Imaging and a light-scattering aerosol spectrometer. The change in airflow supply rate had insignificant effect on the {{transport and}} deposition of very large droplets (initial sizes >= 87. 5 m) due to the dominance of gravitational settling on these behaviors. Smaller droplets (initial sizes <= 45 mu m) exhibited certain airborne behaviors. The effect of thermal plumes from heat sources was observed only when the <b>supply</b> <b>airflow</b> was low and when the droplet size was small, as observed in the vertical mixing patterns of the droplets of various sizes. Larger droplets tended to settle lower and lateral dispersion of the droplets became weak at the low <b>supply</b> <b>airflow</b> rate. The deposition characteristics for different surfaces in the room are described. The heat plumes seemed to obstruct small droplets from being deposited onto heated surfaces. More deposition was predicted in the lateral injection case compared with the vertical injection case. Adopting near-wall correction for turbulence in the model reduced the predicted deposition removal fraction by 25 % for 1. 5 mu m droplets. This reduction became less significant for larger droplets due to the smaller dependence on turbulent diffusion in their deposition. Copyright © American Association for Aerosol Research...|$|E

Indoor air, the air that we breathe more than 80 % of the time, is increasingly pre-treated or arriving through filters and ducts. Any technological solution for ventilation should pro-actively protect IAQ, by improving or not deteriorating the quality of outdoor air coming in, and alarming when IAQ levels are declining. In this study we examined how human IAQ needs are met, in design or in practice, by domestic ventilation systems, including natural ventilation, balanced ventilation, and adaptive systems. Methods Three population groups with different sensitivity towards air quality were recognized: healthy adults (between 20 and 49 years of age), healthy younger and older persons, and chronic lung sufferers. Risk aspects of ventilation systems were identified from literature: pollution accumulation, draught, and maintenance. Current indoor air quality in Dutch dwellings was evaluated from continuously measuring 4 indoor air quality indicators (CO 2, humidity class, ventilation rate, and fine particles) in 37 dwellings for a whole week in winter each. Ventilation was by windows and grids, or grids and exhaust fans. Actual IAQ levels in dwellings were linked to complaint percentages in different air qualities derived from literature. Results The size of the groups with moderate (young, old) and high (lung sufferers) sensitivity is large and increasing, both in relative and absolute figures. An acceptable IAQ for the most susceptible group was not present in any of the dwellings, whilst only one dwelling met the standards for the group of young and older persons. Most common cause was inadequate ventilation. Newer systems with balanced ventilation have intrinsic risks with regard to maintenance (filters) and cleaning (ducts). Intelligent adaptive systems with mechanical exhaust only are in theory the best choice to protect IAQ.

The results also show that the indoor vertical temperature distribution is influenced by the distance between the measuring location and the supply vent position. When the measuring location is close to the supply vent, the vertical temperature profile is influenced by the <b>supply</b> conditioned <b>airflow.</b> When the distance from the supply vent is larger than 150 cm, the vertical temperature distribution becomes quite consistent. The vertical temperature profile is not influenced significantly by the return vent location. The supply air flow rate can change the vertical temperature distribution...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct {{numerical}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimental analysis of the performance of a wind catcher with Horizontally-arranged Heat Transfer Devices (HHTD) for hot climate conditions. A detailed experimental prototype was created using 3 D printing and tested in a closed-loop low speed wind tunnel. An accurate geometrical representation of the wind tunnel test setup was recreated in the numerical modeling. The <b>airflow</b> <b>supply</b> velocity was measured and compared with the numerical data and good correlation was observed. Flow visualisation testing was conducted to analyse the airflow within the device and also inside the ventilated space. The results of the numerical analysis showed that the wind catcher with HHTD was capable of reducing the air temperature by up to 12 K within the micro-climate depending on the outdoor conditions. The technology presented here is subject to a UK patent application (1321709. 6) ...|$|R
