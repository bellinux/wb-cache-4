5|$|In the Pacific, {{migration}} {{patterns are}} poorly characterized. Although some fin whales are apparently present year-round in the Gulf of California, {{there is a}} significant increase in their numbers in the winter and spring. Southern fin whales migrate seasonally from relatively high-latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low-latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding areas is <b>still</b> <b>unknown,</b> since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Matter is {{commonly}} {{defined as the}} substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the observable universe. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 {{percent of the total}} mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy. The exact arrangement of these components is <b>still</b> <b>unknown</b> and is under intensive investigation by physicists.|$|E

Halpern and Tomasello calculated the observable universe using data from European Space Agency's Planck satellite, estimating it to be 90.68 billion light-years across, 0.7% smaller then previously thought.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of CCD are <b>still</b> <b>unknown,</b> but many causes {{are currently being}} considered, such as pesticides, mites, fungi, beekeeping practices (such {{as the use of}} antibiotics or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other pathogens, and immunodeficiencies. The current scientific consensus is that no single factor is causing CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.|$|E
5|$|These {{observations}} {{argue against}} traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators, {{and open up}} the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously {{thought to have been}} discrete.

5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were {{once thought to be}} a way by which {{individuals}} identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks can be used to identify individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is <b>still</b> <b>unknown</b> whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is <b>still</b> <b>unknown.</b> Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is <b>still</b> <b>unknown</b> as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{arrived in}} Honduras in 1525, {{bringing}} livestock with him. Cortés claimed jurisdiction over Honduras, although its extent was <b>still</b> <b>unknown.</b> He rapidly imposed his {{authority over the}} rival Spanish factions there, {{as well as some}} native groups. He founded the settlement of Natividad de Nuestra Señora near Puerto de Caballos, settled fifty colonists there, and placed Diego de Godoy in charge. Cortés then sailed on to Trujillo. Conditions in Natividad were unhealthy, and half of the Spanish settlers rapidly succumbed to disease. With the permission of Cortés, the rest moved inland to the fertile Naco Valley, where Sandoval had securely established a Spanish presence.|$|E

5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is <b>still</b> <b>unknown.</b> One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that microbes at this level could be soaking up ultraviolet light from the Sun {{as a source of}} energy, which could be a possible explanation for dark patches seen on UV images of the planet. Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected in the cloud decks. In 2012, the abundance and vertical distribution of these unknown ultraviolet absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere have been investigated from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images, but their composition is <b>still</b> <b>unknown.</b> In 2016, disulfur dioxide has been identified as a possible candidate for causing the so far unknown UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E

Despite discoveries such as Sedna, the region between the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, an area {{tens of thousands of}} AU in radius, is still virtually unmapped. There are also ongoing studies of the region between Mercury and the Sun. Objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted regions.|$|E
