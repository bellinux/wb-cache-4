We can infer the flow proper-ties and external factors by analyzing the <b>scatter</b> <b>graph</b> obtained from the measured data flow rate monitoring data since an field external factor affecting the sewage flow is reflected in the flow rate monitoring data. In this study, Selecting the three points hav-ing various external factors, and we Inferred the sewer flow characteristics from depth-velocity <b>scatter</b> <b>graph</b> and determined the analysis equation for the dry-weather flow rate data. At the‘point 1 ’expected non-pressure flow, we were able to see the draw-down effect caused by the free fall in the manhole section. At the‘point 2 ’, existed weir and sediments, there was backwater effect caused by them, and each of size calculated from the <b>scatter</b> <b>graph</b> analysis were 400 mm and 130 mm. At the‘Point 3 ’, there is specific flow pattern that is coming from flood wave propagation generated by the pump station at upstream. In common, adequate equations to explain the dry weather flow data are flume equation and modified manning equation(SS method), and the equations had compatibility for explaining the data because all of R 2 values are over 0. 95.

Principal component analysis accounted for a total variation of 91. 95 % by the first three principal components.

Signals were captured at seven positions on the strap muscles as a subject was uttering nine monosyllabic words which each of the words includes five tones. Eight features, i. e.

Moreover, RMS, VAR and WL can classify the high tone better than other features. All of the Spectral Moments yield similarly the results of classification, especially they can classify well the rising tone. For the remainder of the tones, while the scatter graphs are considered without the rising tone and the high tone, the low tone can be separated from their group when WL or WAMP is used for classification only...|$|E

The average of mean statistics from 40 -simulation prediction sets of an independent 78 -plot validation dataset differed from the observed validation means by 0. 5 cm for DBH, and by 12 trees/h for density. The 40 -simulation average of standard deviation, quartile range, maximum value and minimum value differed from the validation dataset, respectively, by 0. 3, 1. 3, 0. 6 and 1. 5 cm for DBH, and 10, 42, 29, and 54 trees/h for density. In addition, test statistics were also computed individually {{for each of the}} 40 single simulations of the 78 -plot validation dataset. In all cases, the test statistics supported the null hypothesis of no difference between simulated and observed DBH lists. When power of these hypothesis test statistics was set to 80 %, the calculated minimum detectable differences were still reasonably small at 2. 7 cm for mean DBH and 90 trees/h for stocking.

40|$|Nowadays, {{analysis}} of electromyography (EMG) signal using wavelet transform {{is one of}} the most powerful signal processing tools. It is widely used in the EMG recognition system. In this study, we have investigated usefulness of extraction of the EMG features from multiple-level wavelet decomposition of the EMG signal. Different levels of various mother wavelets were used to obtain the useful resolution components from the EMG signal. Optimal EMG resolution component (sub-signal) was selected and then the reconstruction of the useful information signal was done. Noise and unwanted EMG parts were eliminated throughout this process. The estimated EMG signal that is an effective EMG part was extracted with the popular features, i. e. mean absolute value and root mean square, in order to improve quality of class separability. Two criteria used in the evaluation are the ratio of a Euclidean distance to a standard deviation and the <b>scatter</b> <b>graph.</b> The results show that only the EMG features extracted from reconstructed EMG signals of the first-level and the second-level detail coefficients yield the improvement of class separability in feature space.

40|$|Scatter graphs (e. g. SPIRE Galaxies, Bead, VR-VIBE) are {{a popular}} medium for visualising spatial-semantic {{structures}} derived from abstract information spaces. For small spaces (i. e. {{less than one}} hundred nodes), such graphs {{can be an effective}} means of reducing high-dimensional information into two or three spatial dimensions. As dimensionality increases, representing the thematic diversity of documents using spatial proximity alone becomes less and less effective. This paper reports an experiment designed to determine whether, for larger spaces, benefits are to be gained from adding visual links between document nodes as an additional means of representing the most important semantic relationships. Two well known algorithms, minimum spanning trees (MST) and pathfinder associative networks (PFNET), were tested against both a <b>scatter</b> <b>graph</b> visualisation, derived from factor analysis, and a traditional list-based hypertext interface. It was hypothesised that visual links would facilitate users' comprehension of the information space with corresponding gains in information seeking performance.

Results indicate both significant performance gains and more positive user feedback for MST and PFNET visualisations over scatter graphs.

In the process of changing, when the overtaking rate is 4 % 14 % ，, overtaking stimulates the traffic flow; when the overtaking rate is 0 4 % ，, overtaking has a decreasing facilitation effect on traffic flow until it becomes zero.

Quantitative backscattered electron imaging is a technique that allows the degree of mineralization of trabeculae to be assessed and in this study is applied to inter-trochanteric bone biopsies of the proximal femur. Biopsy cores from 22 controls, nine individuals with acute and chronic medical conditions and 22 fragility fracture individuals undergoing total hip replacement were processed into methyl methacrylate, polished and analysed in a Philips XL 20 scanning electron microscope. A mean and distribution of weight percent calcium were determined for each individual, and for the control, medically ill and fragility fracture groups. All individuals and groups of individuals showed normal distributions of percent calcium with both the ill and fragility fracture groups being under mineralized relative to the control group. The shape and position of the mineralization distributions suggest that the fragility group resulted from increased bone turnover with a slow progression to under mineralization. In contrast, the ill group appears to have had a more rapid change in the mineralization dynamic. Clear distinctions between the control, fragility fracture and medically ill groups could be seen when the mineralization data were plotted as a <b>scatter</b> <b>graph</b> against age. Graphing the data in this way showed an age-related increase in the degree of mineralization in control individuals with the under-mineralized, fragility fracture group scattered below this normal trend.

For patients who could not receive one of the current standard bags, details of bag volume and macronutrients were plotted on a <b>scatter</b> <b>graph</b> to compare the differences with the current standard bag compositions. Results There were 505 (78 %) individualised and 148 (22 %) standard bags ordered between Jan and Jun 2013. The high per-centage of individualised bags leads to a higher cost to the Trust as the cost of an individualised bag is around £ 20 more expensive than the average standard bag as well as there being an increased work pressure on pharmacy resources and an increased risk of contamination. There were 54 out-of-date standard bags that were wasted over the data collection period leading to a cost of roughly £ 1, 300. This is due to the poor uptake and the minimum order number for each of the current standard bags.

In all these patients, Serum analysis for cardiac markers such as troponin-T and creatine phosphokinase-MB (CPK-MB) and serum analysis for quantitative estimation of HS-CRP were done along with few other parameters.
