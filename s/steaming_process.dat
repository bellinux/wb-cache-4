It is served either filled or covered with sweetened mung bean paste, red bean paste, mashed red beans, raisins, a sweetened filling made with sesame seeds, sweet pumpkin, beans, jujubes, pine nuts or honey). Tteok is usually served as dessert or as a snack. Among varieties, songpyeon is a chewy stuffed tteok served at Chuseok. Honey or another soft sweet material such as sweetened sesame or black beans are used as fillings.

50|$|Continuous {{operation}} of the injection and production wells at approximately reservoir pressure eliminates the instability problems that plague all high-pressure and cyclic <b>steam</b> <b>processes</b> and SAGD produces a smooth, even production that can {{be as high as}} 70% to 80% of oil in place in suitable reservoirs. The process is relatively insensitive to shale streaks and other vertical barriers to steam and fluid flow because, as the rock is heated, differential thermal expansion allows steam and fluids to gravity flow through to the production well. This allows recovery rates of 60% to 70% of oil in place, even in formations with many thin shale barriers. Thermally, SAGD is generally twice as efficient as the older cyclic <b>steam</b> stimulation (CSS) <b>process,</b> and it results in far fewer wells being damaged by the high pressures associated with CSS. Combined with the higher oil recovery rates achieved, this means that SAGD is much more economic than cyclic <b>steam</b> <b>processes</b> where the reservoir is reasonably thick.|$|R
5000|$|The foam {{content is}} {{controlled}} by the barista during the <b>steaming</b> <b>process,</b> and involves two phases: first, introducing air ("frothing, stretching") by having the steam tip {{near the top of the}} milk. A slight but audible hissing sound occurs when the air enters the milk. The second stage involves mixing the incorporated air throughout the milk ("mixing, texturing"), which is achieved by having the steam tip immersed more deeply, creating flow or a [...] "whirlpool" [...] in the milk. Tools known as milk frothers may be used for this purpose. During the <b>steaming</b> <b>process,</b> the foam phase is both primarily created at the top, and naturally separates from the liquid phase, and rises to the surface. As a result, after the steaming ends, the mixing often continues by swirling the pitcher in a smooth, circular motion until the mixture of foam and warmed milk becomes homogeneous, before being added to a drink.|$|E

Due to the {{constantly}} growing {{environmental concerns}} about global warming, there is immense {{pressure on the}} coal-to-liquids (CTL) industry to lower carbon dioxide emissions. This study evaluates the cogeneration of electricity and <b>process</b> <b>steam,</b> using coal and nuclear heat obtained from a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (HTGR) such as a Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), for the use in a CTL plant. Three different cogeneration processes were investigated to resolve what influence nuclear cogenerated electricity and <b>process</b> <b>steam</b> {{would have on the}} carbon dioxide emissions and the unit production cost of electricity and <b>process</b> <b>steam.</b> The first <b>process</b> investigated utilises coal as combustion medium and an extraction/condensing steam turbine, together with the thermodynamic Rankine cycle, for the cogeneration of electricity and <b>process</b> <b>steam.</b> This <b>process</b> was used as a basis of comparison for the nuclearbased cogeneration processes. The second process investigated utilises nuclear heat generated by a HTGR and the same power conversion system as the coal-based cogeneration system. Utilising a HTGR as a heat source can decrease the carbon dioxide emissions to approximately zero, with a 91. 6 % increase in electricity production cost. The last process investigated is the nuclear-based closed cycle gas turbine system where a gas turbine and Brayton cycle is coupled with a HTGR for the cogeneration of electricity and <b>process</b> <b>steam.</b> It was found on technical grounds that this process would not be viable for the cogeneration of electricity and <b>process</b> <b>steam.</b> The unit production cost of electricity and <b>process</b> <b>steam</b> generated by each process were determined through an economic analysis performed on each process. Overall {{it was found that the}} CTL industry could benefit a great deal from utilising nuclear heat as a heat source. Master...|$|R

Water as the only transfer medium participated in <b>steam</b> explosion <b>process</b> is closely correlated with refining efficacy and energy consumption, while researches on steam explosion are neglected from transfer mechanism. In this work, from water transfer perspective, <b>steam</b> explosion <b>process</b> was innovatively divided into four specific stages and the multi-stage mass transfer model of <b>steam</b> explosion <b>process</b> was firstly established. From this model, quantitative relation of water composition in each stage and final water content formula were evaluated, which is efficient to guide the process energy efficiency with several proposed regulation strategies. By combining transfer process simulation with pretreatment efficacy evaluation, much water in feedstock presented a buffering effect on reaction and transfer issues during <b>steam</b> explosion <b>process,</b> thereby weakening the actual severity of treatment. 40 % water content of cellulosic biomass was optimized from the compromise between treatment efficacy and energy efficiency. The yield of overall glucose through pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis was increased by over 20 % with a potential cost savings of steam consumption by simply coordinating water content of cellulosic biomass prior to steam explosion treatment. Thus, results in the work emphasize the water transfer and regulation during <b>steam</b> explosion <b>process</b> on understanding water reaction mechanism, enhancing pretreatment efficacy and saving energy, leading to more efficient use of biomass.
