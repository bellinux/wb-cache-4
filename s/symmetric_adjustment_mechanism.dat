40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{systematically}} analyze the equity risk module of Solvency II, the new regulatory framework in the European Union. The particularly interesting aspect of this module is that it contains a <b>symmetric</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> commonly known as equity dampener which shall reduce procyclicality and thus systemic risk in the insurance industry. We critically review the equity risk module in three steps: we first analyze the sensitivities of the equity risk module with respect to the underlying technical basis, then work out potential basis risk (i. e., deviations of the insurers actual equity risk from the Solvency II equity risk), and—based on these results—measure the impact of the <b>symmetric</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the goals of Solvency II. The equity risk module is backward looking in nature and a substantial basis risk exists if realistic equity portfolios are considered. Also, the adjusted capital stress substantially deviates from the proposed 99. 5 % confidence level. Our results are helpful for academics interested in regulation and risk management as well as for practitioners and regulators working on the implementation of such models...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} testing purchasing power parity. The special {{feature of the}} paper is that we switch from conventional unit-root test and cointegration test to a category of asymmetric testing methodology, namely, TAR (Threshold AutoRegressive) model test and M-TAR (Momentum Threshold AutoRegressive) model test. Enders 2 ̆ 6 Granger (1998) and Enders 2 ̆ 6 Sikols (1998) recently made these approaches available;Conventional testing methodology rarely supports PPP strongly even though PPP has very sound theoretical foundation. The deviation could come from two perspectives: first, by claiming the national price index usually is downward stickey, we question the correctness of the <b>symmetric</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> which is implied by the alternative hypothesis in the conventional test method. Second, the data set people usually employed are not very appropriate for testing PPP in that CPI or WPI usually are not constructed by using the same mixture of goods, and same weights on each good across countries;Based on these two observations, we apply TAR model and M-TAR model to a very special data set which was kindly provided to us by John Pippenger. Because the data was published to adjust the salaries of German diplomats and foreign service people outside Germany, the price levels are constructed using weights that represent the typical spending pattern of a four-person family in Germany. Therefore, this data set does not have weight problem;As we expect, these two improvements together made we accept PPP in general;A fractional cointegration test {{is applied to the}} same data set for a comparison purpose. We found that the more powerful mean-reversion detecting method did not work better than Engle-Granger test significantly. Therefore we conclude that the incorporation of the asymmetric test methodology is very essential;We also tested PPP by using a very general Fourier convergence test...|$|E
40|$|The Enders and Granger (1998) unit-root {{test against}} {{stationary}} alternatives with asymmetric adjustment {{is applied to}} the extended Nelson and Plosser dataset. The test rejects roughly as frequently as does the ADF test on these data. In only one of these cases, for the S&P 500 index, does further testing suggest that the <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> is asymmetric. 1. Introduction Over the past fifteen years a substantial body of evidence documenting asymmetric adjustment in the dynamic behavior of key macroeconomic and financial time series has developed; see, e. g., Potter (1995) and Ramsey and Rothman (1996) and the references therein. In light of this evidence, Enders and Granger (1998) (EG) emphasize that standard unit-root tests are run against stationary alternatives with <b>symmetric</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This leaves open the possibility that the wellknown failure of Dickey-Fuller-type unit-root tests to reject the null hypothesis of integration for many economic time series may be due t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of transaction costs in trading implies a non-linear adjustment process of real exchange rates towards Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). This {{may make the}} traditional tests for PPP using a linear framework [...] - ones that generally tend to refute the PPP hypothesis [...] - unreliable. Instead, this study models {{the dynamics of the}} adjustment towards PPP using a modified exponential smooth transition autoregressive process which accounts for both a <b>symmetric</b> and asymmetric <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> and tests for the validity of PPP using a new test. Using quarterly data from 10 APEC countries, our results suggest that the bilateral US real exchange rates are mean reverting.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{reform of the}} {{financial}} system {{has focused on the}} dollar's loss of international purchasing power (the Triffin dilemma) and its substitution by an international reserve currency that is not a national currency. The problem, however, is not the particular asset that serves as the international currency but rather the operation of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> for dealing with global imbalances. In a preliminary report issued in May, the Commission of Experts of the President of the United Nations General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System made clear that the international system suffers from an inherent tendency toward deficient aggregate demand, a reflection of the asymmetry in the international <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Even the simple creation of a notional currency to be used in a clearing union (proposed by Keynes) cannot do this without some commitment to coordinated <b>symmetric</b> <b>adjustment</b> by both surplus and deficit countries. Thus, the first steps in the reform process must be (1) to offset the balance sheet losses caused by the collapse of asset values and (2) to provide an alternative source of demand to replace the U. S. consumer and an alternative source of finance to offset the deleveraging of financial institutions. This can be done through the coordinated introduction of traditional, countercyclical deficit expenditure policies, on a global scale. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{relation}} between the stability of a competitive equilibrium (CE) and the price <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> used to attain that equilibrium point. Using two specific examples, a three-commodity exchange economy with a unique competitive equilibrium (Scarf’s global instability example) and a two-commodity, two-trader type exchange economy with multiple competitive equilibria, we show that the stability of a CE depends critically upon the dynamics of the price <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A particular CE may be unstable under one price <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> but stable under another. The joint dynamics of the chosen price <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the given economy determines the overall stability of its competitive equilibrium.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{structure}} of adjustment costs for labor. In particular, the question whether hiring and firing costs are asymmetric is addressed. We maintain the standard assumption of quadratic adjustment costs, but allow the multiplicative coefficient to differ for the firing and hiring regime. The Euler equations for this problem can be combined into a general model that nests the one with <b>symmetric</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. The model can be conveniently estimated and the parameter restrictions implied by symmetry easily tested. We also extend the model to allow for variable adjustment coefficients. In the empirical application we use a panel data collected by Ceris on 52 large Italian firms for the period 1958 - 1988. The general conclusion from the econometric testing is that the hypothesis of <b>symmetric</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs is rejected by the data. Copyright 1993 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} change in the <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> of Japan's labor market before and after the {{collapse}} of bubble economy around early 1990 s. Comparison of Phillips curves among industrialized countries shows that Japan's Phillips curve has become much flatter in the 1990 s. The steeper Phillips curve before the 1990 s would be attributable to nominal wage flexibility reflecting flexible bonus payments or annual spring wage negotiations, slow employment adjustment, and the large discouraged worker effects. On the other hand, the flatter Phillips curve after 1990 s and onward would be attributable to the existence of downward nominal wage rigidity under the low and negative inflation rate as well as a decline in discouraged worker effects. Therefore, it is concluded that while slow employment <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> did not change so much, fast wage <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> deteriorated to some extent due to downward nominal wage rigidity in the 1990 s, and also flexible labor supply adjustment such as discouraged worker effects got smaller in the 1990 s. We also explore the reasons for a persistent rise in Japan's unemployment rate after collapse of bubble economy, emphasizing a lack of nominal shock absorption due to downward rigidity in nominal wages that created unemployment, slow employment <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> that prevented the employment from recovering, and weak discouraged worker effects that kept unemployment rate high. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{rain-fed farming}} systems, a poor harvest can have broad and {{overwhelming}} effects on affected households. Smallholder farmers have {{to ensure that}} they have adequate food from one harvest to the other and enough inputs for the next farming season. Households consume more just after the harvest and the consumption levels decline as they move away from the harvest season. The study identified the ex-ante and ex-post <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to seasonal food and input requirements. Special consideration was given to determine whether the probability of using a given <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> to seasonality is the same in good, normal, poor and very poor years and whether household wealth has an influence on the use of <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Attention was also given to determining whether agricultural production and household wealth are reflected in observed seasonality in consumption. The study used cross-sectional data from 225 randomly selected households. The study relied on non-parametric methods of data analysis because the required dependent variables could not meet the parametric assumptions. The analysis showed that the probabilities of using some ex-ante and ex-post <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for both food and input requirements by the non-poor households are not the same in good, normal, poor and very poor years. However, the poor households’ probability of using any of the identified ex-post <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to seasonal input requirements is the same in all the years. The study established that household wealth affects the use of ex-ante and ex-post <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to seasonal input requirements and ex-post <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to seasonal food requirements after good, normal, poor and very poor harvests. The study further revealed that agricultural production is reflected in household seasonal consumption. However, the study failed to find a relationship between consumption and agricultural production in the post-harvest season after good and normal harvests. The study also showed that household wealth is reflected in food consumption in all the seasons of normal, poor and very poor years. However, no relationship was found between food consumption and household wealth in the post-harvest and rainy seasons after good harvests. The study further revealed that there is always a seasonal fall in consumption levels among households of all wealth strata despite the use of <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The situation worsens as we move from the good years towards the very poor years. The study suggests that the use of one size fits all type of interventions to minimise the seasonality problem cannot adequately achieve the required results for all households. It is important to know the way households from each wealth stratum respond to the seasonality problem and why they respond in such a way. Programmes that encourage strategic planning, agricultural production and wealth creation are necessary to reduce the seasonality problem. Furthermore, mechanisms which ensure that the benefits from government interventions reach the poor households are necessary.

40|$|Investment {{activity}} produces {{effects on}} two different economic variables. On the one hand, it adds to the existing productive capacity, on the other, it represents a component of demand. What is required for demand may not be required for accumulation, and viceversa. As a consequence different <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been put forward in the economic literature to make the two aspects of investment compatible to each other. In all cases, a distinction has been made between the fundamentally macroeconomic nature of the demand aspect, and the fundamentally microeconomic nature of the capacity-augmenting aspect. This paper tries to discuss the foundations of a non-perverse <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on the internalisation of the demand aspect of investment. The <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> discussed earlier is based on investment reacting to positive or negative excess aggregate demand. Once it is shown that a collectively efficient equilibrium can be reached even on an entirely arbitrary basis, one may set out {{to show that a}} behaviour which gets selected in a small population can be easily extended to a large one. ...|$|R
