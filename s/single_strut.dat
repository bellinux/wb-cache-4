25|$|Designation of the {{prototype}} when {{purchased by the}} United States Army Air Corps, Modified XB-907A with enclosed cockpits and turret and <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> landing gear.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of wooden}} construction, using a D-tube wing with a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> and doped aircraft fabric covering. The wing employs a Göppingen 535 airfoil at the wing root and a NACA M-6 at the wing tip. The fuselage is plywood covered.|$|E
25|$|The Tundra {{is built}} from a welded steel cockpit cage with a {{fibreglass}} fairing. The tailboom, tail group and wings are of aluminium construction, with {{the wings and}} tail surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric. The wing incorporates a D-cell, Junkers-style ailerons and a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> layout.|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufactured}} {{lattice structures}} show a high potential for lightweight design. Currently, these structures have a periodical build-up, {{which leads to}} disadvantageous stress states. On the one hand, unfavorable bending loads on the <b>single</b> <b>struts</b> appear. This can be avoided by an adaption of {{the course of the}} structure to the main stress directions inside the part. On the other hand, different stress values are appearing inside the <b>single</b> <b>struts.</b> Therefore, a procedure for the optimization of the struts diameters is presented. Thus, it becomes possible to achieve equal stresses in the whole structure and gain a better lightweight performance...|$|R
50|$|The CAJO 59 was {{powered by}} two 65 hp (49 kW) Walter Mikron III {{inverted}} inline engines. Two fixed floats, mounted well outboard on <b>single</b> <b>struts,</b> stabilised flights off water. It had a manually retractable tricycle wheeled undercarriage, with main legs {{mounted on the}} fuselage and retracting into it above the waterline.|$|R
5000|$|Improved model, with double-tapered {{wings and}} <b>single</b> wing <b>struts.</b> About four built.|$|R
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{fuselage}} the empennage was steel framed and fabric covered. The tailplanes were mounted just below the top of the fuselage, each braced from below with a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> and carrying a balanced elevator. A curved, deep, balanced rudder, mounted on a small fin and slightly pointed on top, worked in elevator cut-outs. The airliner had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The two mainwheels were mounted independently on V-struts from the lower fuselage with near-vertical oleo struts to the wing roots. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel was steerable.|$|E
25|$|The Coccinelle is {{a simple}} wood framed, fabric covered monoplane, with {{shoulder}} mounted wings braced by a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> each side from the lower fuselage longerons. The wings are essentially rectangular in plan, though with blunted forward tips, and have significant forward sweep. The balanced rudder is almost without a fin, {{though there is a}} shallow, triangular fillet in front of the rudder, which is large, straight edged and extends to the keel. The rectangular tailplane, mounted {{at the top of the}} fuselage, carries full span, rectangular plan elevators with a central cut-out to allow rudder movement.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{commenced}} in October 1914, and {{was completed}} by spring 1915. Early test flights, probably limited to short hops, revealed multiple shortcomings in the design. As originally completed, the wings were braced between {{the second and third}} cell by only a <b>single</b> <b>strut.</b> Reinforcements to the wings added a second strut aft of this position, together with a set of diagonal struts to support the overhang of the upper wings Other modifications at this time included rigging the wings with a slight dihedral to improve lateral stability, adding a second tailfin and rudder to improve control, and grafting an open gun position onto the front of the fuselage to improve the aircraft's centre of gravity.|$|E
50|$|The Chengdu X-7 is a two-seat basic {{training}} glider of glass-fibre construction, which first flew in October 1966. It is a high-winged monoplane with the wing braced to the pod-and-boom fuselage by <b>single</b> <b>struts.</b> The crew of two sit in tandem open cockpits, while the undercarriage is a non-retractable monowheel, with nose- and tailskids. 130 {{had been built}} by 1980.|$|R
50|$|The D.IX was {{a single}} bay biplane, its wings {{constructed}} in Fokker's established fashion with two box spars and fabric covering. The interplane struts were N-form while the cabane structure included two fully triangulated forward struts connecting to the forward spar, {{and a pair of}} <b>single</b> <b>struts</b> connecting to the rear spar. Ailerons were only fitted on the upper planes.|$|R

25|$|Reflecting new Kei car rules, in July 1976 {{the length}} of the Hatch was {{extended}} to 3190mm (wheelbase to 2100mm), all ahead of the firewall. The new front and new large bumpers made what was an already odd-looking car even stranger. Now the Suzuki Fronte Hatch 55 (or 550), it received the three-cylinder 539cc LJ50 engine, which was a de-smogged L50 engine with an extra cylinder tacked on: it was also known as the T5A/T5B in other applications. The new model code was SH10. The inside remained nearly unchanged and the only differences at the rear was a new, larger bumper, and the change to a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> for the rear gate for increased access. Power remained 25PS as per late 360 Hatches, but torque was up considerably. The lineup was again restricted to B, D, and T models, with the T receiving chromed rather than painted bumpers.|$|E
25|$|Fuselage {{structure}} was typical for the period, being welded chrome-moly tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in {{and covered with}} fabric. Wings were built around two solid spruce spars with the airfoil formed from trussed ribs made from plywood and spruce. The leading edge was covered in aluminum sheeting and the whole assembly covered in fabric. Ailerons were interconnected with a strut mounted to the trailing edge and on some versions were sheeted with ribbed aluminum. Most models were not fitted with flaps – the VKS-7F, built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) being the exception. It was fitted with split flaps only on the undersides of the upper wings and at mid chord, inboard and {{just ahead of the}} ailerons. Wing bracing was with a canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, there being no bracing wires. Elevators and rudder were built up from welded steel tubing braced with wire cables, and both could be trimmed, the elevators in flight and the rudder with a ground adjustable tab. Normally the main undercarriage was made up of a pair of vees, sprung with oleo/spring struts and provided with brakes as standard equipment, and a free-castoring tailwheel sprung with triangulated shock cords. was fitted to most aircraft, although a small number for Brazil were fitted with a tail skid. Floats were also offered as an option, starting with the UIC which had Edo P-3300 floats. Later types (including the UKC, YKC and CJC) were offered with Edo 38-3430 floats.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is fabricated from welded 4130 {{steel tubing}} covered in doped aircraft fabric. The aluminum structure wing, covered in flush riveted aluminum sheet, employs a new Harry Riblett-designed airfoil {{and does not}} have flaps. The wing {{is supported by a}} <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> per side. The engine power range is [...] and the recommended engines include the [...] Continental A-65, [...] Continental A-75 and the [...] Continental O-200 four-stroke powerplants.|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point for this research was {{the viability of the}} Selective Laser Melted (SLM) titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V micro-lattice structure for applications in Foreign Object Impact (FOI) situations in aerospace sandwich constructions. To this end, the mechanical behaviour of <b>single</b> <b>struts</b> and the compression behaviour of micro-lattice blocks were studied. Detailed characterizations of dimensional accuracy, circularity and microstructure, as well as clarifications of deformation behaviour and failure of <b>single</b> manufactured <b>struts</b> under tensile loading were done. The variability in stress-strain curve of struts which was derived using compliance correction method was found to arise from the variations in strut diameters, due to outer surface roughness of the material. Post-manufacture heat-treatment processes improved the surface roughness and variations of strut diameters as well as the microstructure of the α/β titanium alloy, hence reduced the scatter in the stress-strain curve of <b>single</b> <b>struts.</b> The deformation of the SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V micro-lattice blocks with Body Centred Cubic (BCC) structure was elucidated using combined experimental studies and computational analysis. Detailed analysis of geometry and diameter variations in struts of the micro-lattice blocks were done and compared to that of <b>single</b> manufactured <b>struts.</b> Node formation and manufactured quality of the micro-lattice structure were revealed from a 45 ° angle diagonal plane of sectioned block. The compressive deformation behaviour of the BCC micro-lattice block structures was then studied. Effects of different manufacturing routes and parameters as well as post-manufacture treatments in the compressed micro-lattice structures were discussed. Finite element analysis was performed using a validated model of BCC micro-lattice unit cell. The progressive collapse of the micro-lattice block structure was shown to be comparable with the prediction from the finite element model of a unit cell. The numerical simulation was then used to quantify the effect of parent material properties on block collapse. In this way, the relations between SLM manufacturing route, material properties and structural performance are highlighted...|$|R
50|$|The last generation, {{produced}} from 1957, was the Yak-12A. It was an aerodynamically refined variant, with a slimmer fuselage {{and a new}} wing. The cowling was smaller diameter. The rectangular wings were fitted with trapezoidal ends and automatic slats, also <b>single</b> <b>struts</b> replaced twin struts. Navigation equipment and controls were improved, and performance also increased. In the USSR, 3,801 of Yak-12s were built in all models (including 3,013 Yak-12R, M and A). An experimental Yak-12B biplane was also developed, but did not enter production.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{additive}} manufacturing technologies to produce lightweight or functional structures is widespread. Especially Ti 6 Al 4 V {{plays an important}} role in this development field and parts are manufactured and analyzed with the aim to characterize the mechanical properties of open-porous structures and to generate scaffolds with properties specific to their intended application. An SLM and an EBM process were used respectively to fabricate the Ti 6 Al 4 V <b>single</b> <b>struts.</b> For mechanical characterization, uniaxial compression tests and hardness measurements were conducted. Furthermore, the struts were manufactured in different orientations for the determination of the mechanical properties. Roughness measurements and a microscopic characterization of the struts were also carried out. Some parts were characterized following heat treatment (hot isostatic pressing). A functional correlation was found between the compressive strength and the slenderness ratio (λ) as well as the equivalent diameter (d) and the height (L) of EBM and SLM parts. Hardness investigations revealed considerable differences related to the microstructure. An influence of heat treatment as well as of orientation could be determined. In this work, we demonstrate the influence of the fabrication quality of <b>single</b> <b>struts,</b> the roughness and the microstructure on mechanical properties as a function of orientation...|$|R
2500|$|The hull, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was {{all-metal}} and rectangular, with flat sides and top. Its planing bottom was also flat, with two steps. Stability on the water was provided by long, stepless floats on each side, strut-mounted from the wings a little outside the engines and braced to the fuselage with a parallel pair of horizontal struts. [...] The hull tapered in plan to the tail, where the empennage was again rectangular, with a broad fin reaching out beyond the end of the hull and carrying a balanced rudder. [...] The tailplane was mounted on the fin about one third of the way up, braced from below with a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> on each side, and carried narrow-chord elevators.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} further refined in the G.E.3, of which two were {{built for the}} Turkish government. This had a {{fuselage}} faired to a circular cross-section with the crew in two tandem cockpits, with fuel and oil tanks sufficient for three hours flight between them, [...] and was powered by a [...] Gnome Lambda single-row rotary engine threequarters enclosed in a circular cowling. The continuous inmost interplane struts were replaced by short struts between the lower longerons and the lower wing and a cabane consisting of two sets of inverted V struts supplemented by a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> between {{the centre of the}} upper wing and the nose of the aircraft. [...] Trials of the aircraft revealed that the wing spars were too flexible, and although an attempt was made to address this problem by adding short kingpost-bracing to the rear spar, by this time the Italian blockade of Turkey made delivery difficult, and no further development was carried out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Hippie are high set with {{noticeable}} positive dihedral. They are unswept, with constant chord and have small end-plate fairings at the tips. [...] They are built from glass and carbon reinforced plastics, with plastic skins and braced to the lower fuselage with a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> on each side. [...] Glass and carbon reinforced plastics are used throughout the Hippie: the forward fuselage is a glass-fibre ring, mounted under the wing, which incorporates a windscreen, the pilot's seat and a small keel underneath which acts as the main undercarriage. Aft, there is an open, tapering Warren girder which carries the fabric-covered tail unit. [...] The {{leading edge of the}} fin is formed from an extended diagonal fuselage member, with a vertical piece behind to support the rudder. The Hippie has a T-tail with a wire braced tailplane on top of the fin. [...] There is a small loop tailskid {{at the bottom of the}} rudder post.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the effects on longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of utilizing struts to brace the wing to allow the wing thickness reduction on the LFAX- 8 fighter configuration. Structural and load analysis indicated that the maximum airfoil thickness could be reduced from 4. 5 to 3. 1 percent with the strut brace concept. Wave drag theory indicated that reducing the wing maximum thickness from 4. 5 percent to 3. 1 percent would yield a significant reduction in zero-lift wave drag of about 28 percent at the design Mach number of 1. 60. Strut arrangements designed and tested included, a <b>single</b> straight <b>strut,</b> a <b>single</b> swept <b>strut,</b> and a set of tandem straight struts. In addition, a wire of approximately the same cross sectional area replaced the <b>single</b> straight <b>strut</b> on one series of runs. The original LFAX- 8 with the 4. 5 -percent-thick wing was retested to serve as a base line for this investigation...|$|R
5000|$|The core of {{the house}} has a king-post roof with <b>single</b> angle <b>struts,</b> while the west wing has its own king-post roof and the east wing a six-bay notched-collar truss roof.|$|R
2500|$|The {{upper wing}} was {{well above the}} {{fuselage}}, braced to it by two pairs of V-form struts on either side; two <b>single</b> <b>struts</b> from the same points on the upper fuselage braced each lower wing. [...] The pilot sat below the wing leading edge and the observer, equipped with a Lewis gun, sat well aft. [...] The split-axle undercarriage allowed torpedo dropping from under the aircraft and was fitted with wheel brakes as its shipborne role required, together with an arrestor hook and tailwheel. [...] The Buzzard's underslung radiator was positioned between the forward undercarriage legs.|$|R
2500|$|Pander {{followed}} their first aircraft, the small, single-seat monoplane Pander D with a two-seat, low-powered biplane for club and training use. The Pander E {{was a true}} sesquiplane, with a lower wingspan exactly half that of the upper span; in plan, though not in detailed construction the lower wing was almost a half scale copy of the upper wing, the two maximum chords being in the ratio of 0.52 and the area ratio 0.23. [...] The wings were entirely of wooden construction, apart from part of their covering. [...] The upper plane was built around two box spars with spruce flanges and plywood webs. [...] From the leading edge to behind the forward spar the covering was three-ply, with fabric aft. [...] There were ailerons only on this upper wing. [...] The narrower lower wings were of similar construction but used only a single box spar, though this was extended into a larger D-box by ply skinning forward around the leading edge. [...] The wings were arranged so that the rear spar of the upper one was vertically above the single lower wing spar and the aft member of the V-form interplane struts was correspondingly vertical, with the forward member reaching forward to the forward upper spar. These Vs leaned outwards, their base on the lower wing strengthened with a further <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> to the upper fuselage longeron. The upper wing, built in two pieces, was held high above the fuselage by four cabane struts to the front spar and two more to the aft; the wings were pin-jointed to them.|$|E
2500|$|The deep but narrow {{rectangular}} section fuselage, {{constructed from}} duralumin tubes, tapered to {{a knife edge}} at the rear and had rounded decking. The nose differed according to engine; the early V-12 had two distinct bulges over the cylinders and a separate rectangular radiator, attached to the fuselage underside, which could be partially retracted by the pilot, whereas the three cylinder banks of the W-12 required an additional central bulge and the radiator was integrated into the nose {{in front of the}} engine. There were two open cockpits. [...] The pilot sat in front under the trailing edge of the wing, which had a V-shaped cut-out to improve his field of view. He controlled two fixed, forward firing machine guns and behind him the observer's position was equipped with two more on a gun mount. This post was far enough aft to provide a good all-round view. The tail was conventional, with the tailplane, which had swept leading edges, placed {{near the top of the}} fuselage and braced by a <b>single</b> <b>strut</b> on each side from below. [...] The angle of incidence of the tailplane was in-flight adjustable for trim and its elevators were balanced. [...] The vertical tail was rounded and reached down to the keel, operating in a small elevator cut-out. [...] The Descamp's landing gear had mainwheels mounted under the wings at the meeting point of the inner and outer interplane struts, providing a wide track. There was no cross-axle; instead the wheels were mounted on rubber shock absorbers within trouser fairings. [...] This arrangement allowed bombs to be released from under the fuselage; up to 3× bombs could be carried. [...] The tailskid was free to pivot to assist ground steering.|$|E

50|$|The PZL-105 was {{designed}} as a successor to the successful utility aircraft PZL-104 Wilga, being more modern and economical and offering increased transport capacity. The design was initially called Wilga 88. It retained the high-wing layout of the PZL-104 and the upward-opening side doors, but it was a completely new aircraft. Compared with the Wilga, it has a six-seat cabin instead of four seats and the wings are supported by <b>single</b> <b>struts</b> instead of a cantilever design. The plane was intended for a variety of purposes, like glider towing, parachute training, transport, air ambulance, patrolling and crop dusting (with 500 kg of chemicals). Also, a seaplane variant was intended.|$|R
50|$|The RemSchetMash Robust is {{the only}} {{aircraft}} built to date by this general manufacturing company. It has a high wing of constant chord, without flaps. The wings are braced by <b>single</b> <b>struts</b> to the lower fuselage. This is a carbon fibre monocoque with a starboard side door {{for access to the}} single-seat cockpit. A conventional tricycle undercarriage is mounted on the fuselage with spring steel cantilever legs bearing the mainwheels. The rear underside of the fuselage tapers upwards to the tail, where a constant chord tailplane carries a single piece elevator between two endplate fins. The fins and rudders are parallel edged but with rounded tips, the rudders noticeably less deep than the fins.|$|R
50|$|The Taupin had {{tailskid}} {{landing gear}} with its low pressure mainwheels mounted on V-struts hinged {{from the lower}} longerons and with a <b>single</b> telescopic <b>strut</b> on each side to the mid-upper longerons, though the drawing in L'Aéronatique shows a different, split axle undercarriage.|$|R
