5|$|It is an {{important}} source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive <b>solar</b> or active <b>solar</b> depending on how they capture and distribute <b>solar</b> energy or convert it into <b>solar</b> power. Active <b>solar</b> techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated <b>solar</b> power and <b>solar</b> water heating to harness the energy. Passive <b>solar</b> techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.|$|E
5|$|<b>Solar</b> {{thermal power}} {{stations}} include the 354megawatt (MW) <b>Solar</b> Energy Generating Systems {{power plant in}} the USA, Solnova <b>Solar</b> Power Station (Spain, 150MW), Andasol <b>solar</b> power station (Spain, 100MW), Nevada <b>Solar</b> One (USA, 64MW), PS20 <b>solar</b> power tower (Spain, 20MW), and the PS10 <b>solar</b> power tower (Spain, 11MW). The 370 MW Ivanpah <b>Solar</b> Power Facility, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world's largest solar-thermal power plant project currently under construction. Many other plants are under construction or planned, mainly in Spain and the USA. In developing countries, three World Bank projects for integrated <b>solar</b> thermal/combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in Egypt, Mexico, and Morocco have been approved.|$|E
5|$|Some {{examples}} of such <b>solar</b> clusters are the Charanka <b>Solar</b> Park, where there are 17 different generation projects; Neuhardenberg, with eleven plants, and the Golmud <b>solar</b> parks with total reported capacity over 500MW. An extreme example is calling all of the <b>solar</b> farms in the Gujarat state of India a single <b>solar</b> park, the Gujarat <b>Solar</b> Park.|$|E

5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a <b>solar</b> park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised <b>solar</b> power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as <b>solar</b> farms or <b>solar</b> ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale <b>solar</b> is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|A <b>solar</b> power tower uses {{an array}} of {{tracking}} reflectors (heliostats) to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers are more cost effective, offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among CSP technologies. The PS10 <b>Solar</b> Power Plant and PS20 <b>solar</b> power plant are examples of this technology.|$|E

It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with wheals (swollen areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed <b>solar</b> urticaria is induced by {{a broad spectrum of}} radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700nm.|$|E
5|$|Active <b>solar</b> {{techniques}} use photovoltaics, concentrated <b>solar</b> power, <b>solar</b> thermal collectors, pumps, {{and fans}} to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive <b>solar</b> techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing {{the position of}} a building to the Sun. Active <b>solar</b> technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive <b>solar</b> technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cost}} of <b>solar</b> {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of grid-connected <b>solar</b> PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale <b>solar</b> power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. <b>Solar</b> PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam <b>Solar</b> Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E

5|$|Between two {{and five}} <b>solar</b> eclipses occur every year, {{with at least}} one per eclipse season. Since the Gregorian {{calendar}} was instituted in 1582, years that have had five <b>solar</b> eclipses were 1693, 1758, 1805, 1823, 1870, and 1935. The next occurrence will be 2206. On average, there are about 240 <b>solar</b> eclipses each century.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} <b>solar</b> {{power plants}} were first {{developed in the}} 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah <b>Solar</b> Power Facility, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest <b>solar</b> power plant in the world. Other large concentrated <b>solar</b> power plants include the 150 MW Solnova <b>Solar</b> Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol <b>solar</b> power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente <b>Solar</b> Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka <b>Solar</b> Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. <b>Solar</b> projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rooms on}} the ground floor of the private space, were often known as parlours while the upper floor {{provided}} rooms called <b>solars.</b> The upper rooms would be reached in the simplest buildings by means of a ladder or steep companionway[...] The <b>solars</b> often stretched beyond the outer wall of the ground floor rooms, jettying out at one end or else at both ends of the building. As the hall itself had no upper floor within it, its outer walls always stood straight, without jettying.|$|R
50|$|On February 24, 2009, First <b>Solar's</b> {{cost per}} watt broke the $1 barrier, {{reaching}} $0.98. Production cost {{has continued to}} fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.|$|R
5|$|Commercial <b>solar</b> {{water heaters}} began {{appearing}} in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, <b>solar</b> water heating attracted renewed attention {{as a result of}} the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the <b>solar</b> water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999. Although generally underestimated, <b>solar</b> water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed <b>solar</b> technology with an estimated capacity of 154GW as of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction <b>solar</b> cells. <b>Solar</b> concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a <b>solar</b> tracker {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent <b>solar</b> concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E
5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for <b>solar</b> energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful <b>solar</b> power plants have {{been built in the}} Mojave Desert.
